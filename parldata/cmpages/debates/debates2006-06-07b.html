State&#146;s ongoing discussions with other Cabinet colleagues. What
precautions are the Government going to take to ensure that Welsh and
other British farmers are not penalised in the next round of common
agricultural policy reform? It is generally recognised that we have the
most productive farmers, and they should be applauded for that. Europe
should learn from that and our farmers should not be
penalised&#151;in Wales or in any other part of the United
Kingdom.</p><p><a name="06060754000029"><b><a name="06060754001433">Nick
Ainger:</b> I totally agree with the hon. Lady. It is
important that we take forward the CAP reform agenda, and Britain is
now acknowledged as leading in Europe in on CAP reform. I can assure
her that, although we want to introduce such reforms, the intention is
not to penalise our own agricultural industry in doing so. It is clear
that the reforms already in place have not penalised our farmers, and
we want to continue in that
vein.</p><p><a name="06060754000030"><b><a name="06060754001434">Mrs.

encephalopathy disaster, which happened under the last Government, and
the resulting beef ban. In 1995, beef exports from the UK were worth
&#163;600 million, and 270,000 tonnes of British beef were exported.
We have lost all that in 10 years, and we need to regain those markets.

what the Minister has just said, but may I draw his attention to
another important, current subject: the failure of the fallen stock
scheme? This Government would not allow Wales, and north Wales in
particular, to be exempted from the scheme, which, for obvious reasons
that we warned about at the time, proved impractical. We now have
rotting carcasses throughout farms in north and mid-Wales, which is bad
for biosecurity and human health and, I am afraid, the economy. Will
the Minister please speak to his bungling colleagues in the National
Assembly?</p><p><a name="06060754000033"><b><a name="06060754001437">Nick

provided that service in north Wales, and I am assured that other
companies are coming in to tackle the backlog. I agree that it is
essential that we deal with the biosecurity issue, which is why the
Assembly is tackling it by getting other fallen stock companies to
clear up the backlog.</p><p><a name="06060754000034"><b><a name="06060754001438">Mrs.

nothing to animal disease, so dealing with tuberculosis in cattle and
cattle movements between England and Wales requiresclose
co-operation between the Department for Environment, Food and Rural
Affairs, the Assembly Government and the British Cattle Movement
Service, as the Minister will doubtless acknowledge. What checks has he
made on the co-ordination of data relating to pre-movement TB tests,
and what percentage and number of TB reactors have so far been picked
up in pre-movement testing in Wales?</p><p><a name="06060754000035"><b><a name="06060754001439">Nick

give her the detailed figures that she has requested, but I will write

concern for hundreds if not thousands of people who have been in
contact with asbestos during their working lives. The Government fully
understand the concerns expressed about the House of Lords judgment in
the Barker <i> v. </i>Corus case and we are sympathetic to the
claimants. The judgment raises serious and complex issues and it is
important to ensure that we get the right answer. We are therefore
exploring all options with the relevant stakeholders to achieve a

injuries and have not yet received their compensation? Irefer
to one of my constituents, Donald Watkins of Pontneathvaughn, who has
been waiting six and a half years. These miners are becoming older and
iller by the day and the same sometimes applies to their widows. Will
the Minister cut through the crap and ensure that they get the

industrial injury civil action case that the world has ever seen.
Throughout the UK, we have already paid out &#163;3 billion to
miners; and in Wales the payment is &#163;565 million. As I said, if

restore the position. The Minister will be aware of the enormous

opportunity to eat the finest Welsh beef made from Welsh black cattle.
We heard about that earlier, but I should not have to take you that
far, Mr. Speaker. I could take you to the White Hart in London, but
other places do not serve Welsh black cattle beef. What can the
Minister do to ensure that England and Scotland enjoy the benefits of
the finest British beef&#151;Welsh black

Friend the Secretary of State is giving me and suggest that the hon.
Member for Lichfield (Michael Fabricant) become an ambassador for Welsh
produce. He is quite right that Wales produces some of the finest
livestock in the world. Welsh black beef, in particular, is an
excellent product. The Welsh Assembly Government have processing and
marketing grants that assist in the marketing of Welsh produce, not
just in England but throughout Europe. I am sure that the hon.
Gentleman will want to join me in congratulating the Welsh chef, Bryn
Williams, on winning a chance to cook for the Queen&#146;s 80th
birthday celebrations, and I am particularly pleased that he will be
sourcing all his ingredients from Wales. That is another way of
marketing Wales&#146; excellent food

but say &#147;Made in England&#148; all over them. For that matter,
some of the best cricket players in this country who play for the
English cricket team are actually made in Wales. Is it not time that we
were a bit more honest and reminded 
<br><notus-date day="7" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>7 Jun 2006 : Column 237</b><br>the cricket authorities that they are the England and Wales Cricket

Ainger:</b> We may have strayed a bit from the original
question, but the National Assembly is concerned to promote the Welsh
brand and to brand Welsh products&#151;including cricketers, I
expect. Several initiatives are under way on food products, and I
welcome the opening last month of Lloyd&#146;s dairy in Islington, a
recreation of one of the old Welsh dairy shops that used to proliferate

that fundamental to the promotion of Welsh produce in England is the
ability to transport that produce to England in the first place? Does
he therefore share my concern at the continuing closure of the A5 trunk
road between Maerdy and Dinmael, which was closed with little warning
on 26 May and remains closed with no indication of when it
willbe reopened? Does he share my despair at the incompetence
of the Assembly in dealing with the

Ainger:</b> I accept the importance of reopening the A5 as
quickly as possible. As the hon. Gentleman will know, the closure was
because of a serious risk of injury from an unstable cliff face. He
will also be aware that while most landowners on the old A5, which
could provide an alternative route, are co-operating with the Welsh
Assembly Government, one has unfortunately decided not to do so at this
stage. The matter needs to be addressed quickly and I understand that
Andrew Davies, the Minister with responsibility for transport in Wales,
is dealing with it as a priority. Its importance is recognised, but if
the hon. Gentleman wants to make his views known I will pass them on to
Andrew Davies. Perhaps he should also make a direct
approach.</p><h3 align="center"><a name="06060754000021">Post

in my constituency and, I expect, in his, there are senior citizens who
depend on the local post office, and we want to see them kept open if
at all possible. That is why we are providing the investment. But the
issue is not as simple as just keeping the Post Office card account,

plummeting waiting times, extra nurses, extra doctors, improved health
performance, and 10 new hospitals being built or already built in Wales

is in part not just because of the minimum wage, which he opposed, but
because of the working families tax credit, which makes work pay for
people. As a result of the children&#146;s tax credit, we have been
able to give help to millions of families in this country. Those
families were let down by the Tory years of boom-and-bust economics,
high unemployment and poverty, which was why we made the change, and we

credit system, yet he has not made a single statement, or answered a
single oral question in the House of Commons, on tax credits in the
past year. Yesterday, the Prime Minister said that Ministers should not
just blame officials when things go wrong. I agree with that. But is
not the Chancellor&#146;s behaviour typical of this Government?
Ministers create a massive bureaucracy that becomes a painful paper

we remember when families used to come to our constituency surgeries at
the time of 10 or 15 per cent. interest rates, with kids who could not
get jobs for years. There were families with kids living in poverty,
and nothing was done about it. Yes, it is true&#151;tax credits have
helped millions of families in this country. The problems that are
there will be dealt with. We are glad that under this Government

Friend that this is not about an expansion of nuclear power. The fact
is that over the next 15 or 20 years we will lose that 20 per cent. of
our electricity presently generated by nuclear power. It is in the
interests of people in Northern Ireland and in the whole of the United
Kingdom that we have secure supplies of energy for the future.
Therefore, we need a balanced energy policy. A major component of that

the number of people waiting more than six months for treatment was

toughen the minimum standard for sentences for individuals who are in
illegal possession of a knife. As my right hon. Friend explained when
this was debated, there are issues about whether it is possible to do
this in a sensible way, but I totally agree that knife crime is
extremely serious. That is why we have extended the types of knives
banned under the legislation, and why we have made sure&#151;for

knife is listed as an offensive weapon, the maximum penalty for
carrying it is four years. Since 1997 we have added stealth knives,
disguised knives and batons to the offensive weapons list. We are
raising the minimum age at which someone can buy a knife from 16 to 18.
There is a new offence of using someone to mind a weapon, and there are
extra powers, along with extra resources, for head teachers to search
pupils for weapons. In addition, there was a national knife amnesty a
short time ago. I will look at whether we need to increase minimum
sentences. As I said, the issues were explained in detail when the
matter was last debated, but in principle, we want to make sure that
anybody who is found in illegal possession of a knife is subject to the
toughest penalties possible. May I point out to the House that in
respect of firearms, we introduced a mandatory minimum five-year
sentence, which is now in operation?</p><p><a name="06060754000119"><b><a name="06060754001518">Graham

Every year hundreds and possibly thousands

along with the intelligence services, to try to track down those who
are engaged in people trafficking. The hon. Gentleman is right to
describe it as a problem, but the only way of resolving it is by means
of the measures that we have introduced, which will allow us to seize
the assets of people engaged in this trade. I hope that when we

Secretary of State for Health (Ms Patricia Hewitt):</b> With
permission, Mr. Speaker, I wish to make a statement about the NHS chief
executive&#146;s report and NHS finances for
2005-06.</p><p><a name="06060754000152">Sir Ian Carruthers, acting
chief executive of the NHS, today publishes his first report on the
performance of the NHS, including the provisional financial out-turn
for the last financial year. A copy has been placed in the Library,
together with a more detailed report on the finances from the
Department&#146;s director of finance, Richard Douglas. This
information also forms part of the Government&#146;s evidence to the
Select Committee on Health, which is conducting an inquiry into these
matters.</p><p><a name="06060754000153">I should like
to begin by reminding the House of the context. Following decades of
growth averaging around 3.1 per cent. a year, since 1997 the NHS has
received annual average growth in funding of 6.4 per cent. The NHS
budget, which has already doubled compared with 1997, will have trebled
by 2008. That unprecedented investment has enabled the NHS to employ an
additional 307,000 staff, including 85,000 more nurses. I am sure the
whole House will want to express our thanks to all NHS staff for their
outstanding dedication and hard work. With that investment has come
reform, giving patients more choice for elective operations, using the
independent sector to add to the capacity and innovation of the NHS,
and establishing NHS foundation trusts with more freedom to respond to
local people&#146;s
needs.</p><p><a name="06060754000154">Sir
Ian&#146;s report shows that NHS staff are continuing to improve
patient care. Waiting times are continuing to fall. Virtually no-one
now waits more than six months for an operation, compared with 270,000
patients who were waiting more than six months for an operation in
2000. The majority are treated much more quickly&#151;the average
wait for an operation is around just seven and a half weeks. There is
now a maximum 13-week wait for an out-patient appointment. Again, the
average wait is much shorter, with four out of five people getting
their first out-patient appointment within eight
weeks.</p><p><a name="06060754000155">Nearly 99 per
cent. of people with cancer are treated within a maximum of 31 days of
diagnosis, and more than 91 per cent. are treated within 62 days of an
urgent referral from their GP, compared with only75 per cent.
one year ago. Early deaths from coronary heart disease, cancer and
suicide continue to
fall.</p><p><a name="06060754000156">Patient care is
improving everywhere but some parts of the country face significant
financial problems.</p><p><a name="06060754000157">The provisional unaudited
figures for 2005-06 show a net overspend across the NHS, excluding
foundation trusts, of &#163;512 million. That is made up of a gross
deficit of &#163;1.27 billion, offset by surpluses of &#163;765
million. Although we clearly cannot allow that position to continue, we
also need to put it into perspective. The net deficit in the NHS is
less than 1 per cent. of the NHS revenue budget and is concentrated in
a minority of organisations.</p><p><a name="06060754000158">Seven out of 10 hospitals and
other NHS organisations are not only improving patient care, 
<br><notus-date day="7" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>7 Jun 2006 : Column 254</b><br>employing more staff and paying them better than ever, but doing so
within their budget. Two out of 10 have relatively small levels of
overspending and only one in 10 NHS hospitals and other organisations
account for more than two thirds of the
overspending.</p><p><a name="06060754000159">My
decision to publish those unaudited financial figures, together with
the director of finance&#146;s report to me, reflects our commitment
to greater transparency in the NHS. In future, we will publish
quarterly reports on NHS
finances.</p><p><a name="06060754000160">In the past,
because the focus was largely on the overall financial position of the
NHS, overspending organisations had little incentive to improve their
performance but relied on other parts of the service to bail them out.
The system was unfair because most of the overspending occurred in
better-off areas with a generally healthier population and most of the
underspending was in places with far greater health needs and health
inequalities. We are not prepared to allow that unfairness to
continue.</p><p><a name="06060754000161">By the end
of the financial year, we will return the NHS as a whole to financial
balance. The turnaround teams that I announced to the House in January
are helping organisations with the biggest financial problems to
implement recovery plans that will allow them to maintain and improve
patient care within their budgets. As most of the NHS demonstrates, and
Sir Ian confirms in his report, there should be no trade-off between
improving patient care and sound financial management. They go
together.</p><p><a name="06060754000162">We are aiming
for all organisations with deficits to reach monthly balance of income
and expenditure by the beginning of April next year. However, there
will be some exceptional cases when an organisation needs longer to
make the necessary changes while maintaining patient care. However,
because overspending in one organisation has to be balanced by
underspending elsewhere, we will continue to challenge and expect that
minority of organisations to return to monthly balance as quickly as
possible.</p><p><a name="06060754000163">We have also
asked the new strategic health authorities to establish a regional
reserve that will support organisations while they return to balance.
That means asking primary care trusts that have stayed within their
budget or delivered a surplus to contribute some of their growth money,
which averages 9.2 per cent., in the current year and to postpone some
of the improvements that they were planning to make for their patients.
However, that money will not be lost to those communities. It will be
repaid, normally in the three-year allocations period. I have stressed
to the health authorities that the areas with the greatest health needs
should be repaid
first.</p><p><a name="06060754000164">There will be
difficult decisions to make, especially in the minority of trusts with
substantial deficits. In some cases, that will mean work force
reductions and we all understand the anxiety and uncertainty that that
causes for staff who have dedicated their lives to the NHS.</p><p><a name="06060754000165">However, there will not be the
wholesale redundancies across the NHS that some commentators have
forecast. In most cases, as Sir Ian stresses, work force reductions
will be achieved by natural turnover, reduced spending on expensive
agency staff, redeploying staff and freezing some posts. Compulsory 
<br><notus-date day="7" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>7 Jun 2006 : Column 255</b><br>redundancies will be kept to an absolute minimum and those affected
will, of course, be given as much support as possible to find a new
post.</p><p><a name="06060754000166">The NHS is
treating more patients and saving more people&#146;s lives than ever
before. Of course there is still more to do to meet the public&#146;s
rising expectations, as people are living longer and a revolution is
taking place in medical care and scientific knowledge. But Sir
lan&#146;s report today shows that the NHS is on the right track, and
I commend it to the
House.</p><p><a name="06060754000167"><b><a name="06060754001549">Mr.

to the Secretary of State for giving me the opportunity to see her
statement and the financial performance report 40 minutes ago. After
her excursion into a parallel universe, it is about time we came back
down to earth. She has come to the House today to admit that, for the
fourth year in a row under this Government, the financial situation in
the national health service is deteriorating, and that the deficit is a
great deal larger than in the previous year. She says that there was a
net deficit of &#163;512 million in the last financial year. On a
like-for-like basis, it was &#163;216 million in the previous
financial year, so it is now more than two and a half times
greater.</p><p><a name="06060754000168">The
Secretary of State&#146;s policy has failed, but of course it is the
civil servants and the managers in the NHS who will get the blame.
Trusts will be singled out and told that they are responsible for the
deficit. Sir Nigel Crisp resigned in March. If everything was going so
well in March, I wonder why the chief executive of the NHS had to leave
in those circumstances. Since then, there has been an exodus from the
Department of Health, with people either jumping or being ejected from
the sinking ship. Many of them have rightly said that the NHS is
suffering from the void of leadership in the rudderless Department of
Health. The growing gap between the hard-working staff in the NHS and
the leadership that ought to be coming from the Department of Health is
causing a crisis of confidence.
</p><p><a name="06060754000169">The Secretary of
State&#146;s statement purported to give us financial information
about the past year. Shegave us the unaudited figures, and
mentioned a sum of &#163;512 million. Did she go on to tell us that
the unaudited figures last year were out by 80 per cent. compared with
the audited figures? The audited figures were &#163;112 million
higher than the unaudited figures. We do not yet know what this
year&#146;s audited figures are going to be.</p><p><a name="06060754000170">The Secretary of State told us
that the gross deficit was &#163;1.27 billion. That is about 1.5 per
cent. of the total NHS allocations. She then said that that was being
offset by surpluses. Well, yes indeed&#151;there are &#163;760
million of surpluses. But she did not tell the House that more than
&#163;500 million of those surpluses have been generated by the
strategic health authorities. That means that they have cut their
budgets, and they are planning to do so again this year. Most of those
cuts will involve training budgets, which will mean fewer posts for
doctors and nurses coming into the profession seeking to pursue their
vocation. If there is a 10 per cent. cut in training budgets this

Lansley:</b> That lecturer told me that 120 student nurses who
are finishing her course at Keele university will not find
jobs.</p><p><a name="06060754000173">Did the
Secretary of State mention that deficit switching has led to cuts in
mental health services that have been deplored by her own national
clinical director? Actually, she did not say anything at all about
mental health services. She talked about the reductions in waiting
times, but did she mention the waiting times for diagnosis? Her own
figures, to which she did not admit, now show that waiting
times&#151;including waits for diagnosis&#151;can be up to four
years for trauma and orthopaedics.</p><p><a name="06060754000174">Did the Secretary of State
admit that, but for the strategic health authorities cutting their
budgets, the deficits would be more than &#163;1
billon&#151;precisely the amount that we predicted last November? In
December, the Secretary of State told the Health Committee that the
deficit would be managed down to &#163;200 million across the NHS by
the end of the financial year. Actually, she said &#163;250 million,
but she had to be corrected by her officials because she did not have
the figure in her head. However, the deficit has not been managed down
to &#163;200 million. It is now two and a half times greater than the
figure to which the Secretary of State committed herself in front of
the Select
Committee.</p><p><a name="06060754000175">Did the
Secretary of State come here with any apology? No, she did not. Did she
come here with any clarification of what will happen this year? No.
There may be a chief executive listening to this out there. Are chief
executives required to achieve balance over the whole of the current
financial year? We do not know. Are they required instead to achieve
what the Department is now calling&#151;we shall hear this term
again&#151;&#147;run-rate&#148; balance, which means balancing
monthly income and expenditure in the last month of the financial year?
That is a very different discipline. Perhaps they are expected to
achieve such a balance; perhaps they are not. Are they required in all
cases to recover earlier deficits? We simply do not know.</p><p><a name="06060754000176">The Secretary of State is
promising that by the end of this financial year the NHS will have
returned to financial balance. Will she tell the House that if by the
end of this financial year the NHS is recording a further net
system-wide deficit, she will resign?</p><p><a name="06060754000177">Yesterday the Prime Minister
told the public service to speed up reform, but it is the mismanagement
of reform that is holding the NHS back. Public servants want to deliver
better services continuously, year by year&#151;of course they
do&#151;but they cannot do that under a Government who have let them
down. It is policy that is failing. It is not only consultants in the
British Medical Association who are saying that. We have a Government
who fail to allocate resources in line with the real burden of disease
and demand across 
<br><notus-date day="7" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>7 Jun 2006 : Column 257</b><br>the country, with the result that some health economies are going into
serious deficit.</p><p><a name="06060754000178">The
Government grossly miscalculated the cost of new contracts, and failed
to link those contracts to productivity or reform. They are spending
billions on the NHS IT programme, but it is over two years late and is
not delivering the system that the NHS wants. Last year the Government
imposed central targets&#151;the Secretary of State did not mention
them&#151;which cost hundreds of millions, distorted clinical
priorities, and caused some of the deficits. The Secretary of State
talked of 300,000 extra staff for the NHS, but she did not tell us that
106,000 of them were administrators. She has doubled the number of
managers, and financial management in the NHS is clearly woefully
lacking.</p><p><a name="06060754000179">This is a
Government who have let the NHS down. Policy failures and mismanagement
have left the NHS in serious and growing deficit. Hard-working
front-line NHS staff deliver good, indeed excellent, care to patients,
but they complain bitterly&#151;and with justification&#151;that
that is not because of the Government, but in spite of them. They want
to be free of damaging interference by Labour
Ministers.</p><p><a name="06060754000180"><b><a name="06060754001552">Ms
Hewitt:</b> I find it extraordinary that the hon. Gentleman
made no mention at all of the dramatic improvements in care that have
been delivered in the NHS over the past eight years and, indeed, the
past 12 months. I am very surprised that he did not choose to mention
that whereas in 1997 the number of patients in South Cambridgeshire who
were waiting more than six months, in pain, for operations that they
needed was 1,790, the figure in March 2006 was zero. It is
extraordinary that the hon. Gentleman failed to mention improvements in
his constituency and elsewhere, but I have to
say&#151;<i> [Interruption.]</i></p><p><a name="06060754000181"><b><a name="06060754001553">Mr.

Hewitt:</b> Thank you, Mr.
Speaker.</p><p><a name="06060754000183">Not only did
the hon. Gentleman fail to mention the improvements in care for
patients; he was clearly very disappointed that the deficit was not
higher&#151;that it had not reached the levels that he had predicted.
In fact, it is lower than the forecast figure that we published at the
half-year point.</p><p><a name="06060754000184">The
hon. Gentleman asked specifically about surpluses in the strategic
health authorities. Many of those surpluses come directly from primary
care trusts and other NHS trusts; but instead of being transferred
directly to the accounts of overspending organisations, where in the
past they have served to conceal the real problem of overspending, they
have been held in strategic health authorities.</p><p><a name="06060754000185">The hon. Gentleman said that
newly qualified nurses and other staff were finding it difficult to
obtain jobs. Of course, with more staff in the NHS than ever
before&#151;85,000 more nurses alone&#151;it is more difficult for
newly qualified nurses to find jobs than it was in the days when it was
scarcely possible to find nurses to fill the vacancies that so
desperately needed to be filled. 
<br><notus-date day="7" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>7 Jun 2006 : Column 258</b><br>What we are doing in response is ensuring that much more effort is made
throughout the country to match our newly qualified staff to the
vacancies that exist for every kind of staff in some parts of the
NHS.</p><p><a name="06060754000186">Let me make it
clear once again that I am determined that the NHS as a whole will be
back in financial balance by the end of March next year. Of course, as
Health Secretary I will be accountable to the House and the public for
achieving that goal. We have said that we expect individual
organisations to sort out their problems and achieve monthly financial
balance as quickly as possible. A small number of them&#151;largely
those that have been overspending for several years and have large
accumulated deficits&#151;will not even be able to get to monthly
financial balance by the end of next year. However, as I said, we will
go on helping them to make the difficult but essential changes so that
they get back into balance and deliver the best possible care within
their budgets without expecting other parts of the NHS and other
patients to bail them out.</p><p><a name="06060754000187">My final point is that the hon.
Gentleman needs to decide whether he wants the NHS to deliver the best
value possible for the money&#151;the increased money that he and
Opposition Members voted against&#151;that the public have put in.
Does he really think that poorer areas, which typically are those that
have been underspending, should go on bailing out better-off areas that
have been overspending? Does he agree with the right hon. Member for
Witney (Mr. Cameron), who wrote to the Prime Minister on 18 May asking
for the deficit in Oxfordshire&#151;one of the overspenders&#151;to
be wiped out? Does the hon. Gentleman recognise that in that area
funding has risen by more than &#163;38 million in the past three
years? Does he recognise that it will increase again by more than
&#163;36 million in the next two years? Does he believe that
south-west Oxfordshire, to take one example, which has 64 GPs per
100,000 population, should be given money from, for instance,
Sedgefield, with 52 GPs per 100,000 population? Does he really believe
that money should be taken from the poor to bail out the overspenders,
or does he, like us, believe in fair funding across the NHS, and the
best care and value for money
everywhere?</p><p><a name="06060754000188"><b><a name="06060754001555">Steve
Webb (Northavon) (LD):</b> I thank the Secretary of State for
her statement. Will she confirm that she just told the House that the
NHS deficit has doubled in the past year? Will she confirm that one in
three trusts are in deficit and that one in 10 are in serious deficit,
which is more than last year? Will she confirm thatthe scale
of the deficits is so much that the deficit trusts between them have
run up a deficit in excess of&#163;1 billion, which they
will have to sort out, including paying back any assistance that they
get from other trusts? The Secretary of State gave figures excluding
foundation trusts. What are the figures including foundation
trusts?</p><p><a name="06060754000189">Who is
responsible for the financial crisis? If the Government set the pay
rate for GPs, doctors and consultants, set &#147;Agenda for
Change&#148; and NHS staff rates, set the tariff for how much trusts
get and set all the targets, is it someone else&#146;s fault or is it
the Government&#146;s fault if the sums do not add up? Will the
Secretary of State take responsibility for the deficit in the NHS? How
much of it is due to Department of 
<br><notus-date day="7" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>7 Jun 2006 : Column 259</b><br>Health mistakes, creating bodies that get abolished a few years later
and negotiating contracts that result in overspending&#151;the GP
contract and the consultant contract? Is that her fault or someone
else&#146;s fault? Can we believe her when she says that the NHS will
be in balance at the end of the year when Sir Nigel Crisp said in
December that the deficit this year would only be &#163;200 million
and then, just a few months later, she told us that it would be two and
a half times as big? Why should we believe her when she says that she
will get the deficit under control this time around?</p><p><a name="06060754000190">The surpluses in the NHS are in
different places to the deficits, so the gross deficit of &#163;1.2
billion is huge. Is not it the case that it takes incredible
mismanagement to spend record sums of money on the NHS and to come to
the House admitting the worst deficits in years? How has the Secretary
of State achieved that? How did she manage to do
that?</p><p><a name="06060754000191">Is not it the
case that what is going on is breakneck NHS reform, because the Prime
Minister said that he will not go until the NHS is sorted out? How
quickly will it be sorted out? Is not it the case that what we are
getting is not measured organisational change, with long-term planning
and rational reorganisation, but emergency cuts packages to deal with a
short-term financial crisis? Does the Secretary of State accept that
that is no way to run the
NHS?</p><p><a name="06060754000192"><b><a name="06060754001556">Ms
Hewitt:</b> I have already given the specific answers to the
questions that the hon. Gentleman asked initially. I have made it
clear, and I shall make it clear again: seven out of 10 NHS
organisations are in balance or delivering a surplus. Two out of 10
have a relatively small deficit, which is quite manageable. One out of
10 organisations, many of which have been overspending for several
years, have serious financial problems. The financial figures for the
foundation trusts were published earlier this week by Monitor. Their
overall deficit is &#163;24 million, making an overall deficit of
&#163;536 million, which is still significantly less than 1 per cent.
of the overall NHS budget.</p><p><a name="06060754000193">If the cause of the deficits
was pay rises for staff or targets for better care for patients, there
would be deficits everywhere, and there are not. The majority of trusts
in the NHS are employing more staff and paying them better, treating
more patients faster than ever before, and saving more people&#146;s
lives&#151;and they are doing it within their budgets. It is entirely
reasonable&#151;I am surprised that the hon. Gentleman does not
support this&#151;to say that the NHS should be doing that
everywhere.</p><p><a name="06060754000194">I am proud
of the fact that we are paying our staff better than ever before. I am
sure that they will note with interest that the Liberal Democrats are
not so keen on that. It is perfectly true that the GP contract cost
more than we and the British Medical Association initially anticipated.
There is a very good reason for that: it is a performance-related
contract and the GPs have delivered more and better care than we and
the BMA expected. The additional costs in the GP
contracts&#151;somewhat below &#163;300 million&#151;have
delivered better care for patients. Indeed, thousands of people are
alive today as a direct result of that GP contract.</p><br><notus-date day="7" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>7 Jun 2006 : Column 260</b><br><p><a name="06060754000195">I stress&#151;I tried to make
this point earlier&#151;that in the past the financial reporting
systems within the NHS had the effect of concealing persistent
overspending in a minority of organisations. In some cases, the
underlying financial problems were wholly unclear even to the
organisations themselves. We have stopped that. As a result of the
changes and reforms that we are making, we have much greater
transparency right across the NHS as we give patients more choice, as
money follows the patients, and as hospitals, particularly foundation
trusts, have greater freedom to respond to what patients need while
taking responsibility for their performance and for delivering the best
possible patient care within those increased budgets. In other words,
our reforms are helping to reveal the problems and to deal with them,
rather than causing them.</p>

He talked about funding, but I should point out that in his
constituency there are 65 general practitioners per 100,000 population,
which is significantly more than the average and significantly more
than in a constituency such as Sedgefield. I am sure that the entire
House and the public will be interested to hear that what the hon.

which have far greater health needs, and more money for his area.
However, his area has already received enormous increases in its NHS

George (St. Ives) (LD):</b> Is the Secretary of State aware
that it has been announced today that Royal Cornwall Hospitals
Trust&#151;it covers not a better-off area, but the poorest region in
the UK&#151;has an estimated deficit of &#163;15.7 million, which
is double what was announced only three months ago? Will the Secretary
of State inform the House who is responsible for that? Is it the trust,
which is appointed by her; is it the perpetual and expensive Government
gimmicks endorsed by her Department; is it the funding formula that
leaves Cornwall at the bottom of the earnings league table; or is it,
in fact, the Secretary of State
herself?</p><p><a name="06060754000220"><b><a name="06060754001578">Ms

deficits that have arisen in a minority of organisations&#151;there
is no single cause. If it were the targets or the pay rises, the
deficits would arise everywhere, which is not the case. The Royal
Cornwall hospital and the health community there must look into the
same issues as other parts of the NHS are having to look into. For
instance, are they doing enough day case surgery? Are they doing enough
in the community to reduce the number of emergency admissions? Are they
carrying out all the proven measures that are being used in other parts
of the NHS to deliver better care to patients, with better value for
money? The hon. Gentleman mentioned the funding formula, which we have
made fairer. It now takes account of issues such as the demands of a
rural economy, the proportion of elderly people living within the
community and, above all, social and economic deprivation. That is why,
over this year and the next, the poorest areas with the biggest health
needs that are furthest from their target funding will get the biggest
increases. I think that that is fair, and I regret the fact that the
Opposition parties do not agree.</p><p><a name="06060754000221"><b><a name="06060754001579">Andrew

I am sure that the hon. Gentleman would, like me, welcome the fact that
the latest survey of patients showed that 90 per cent. believed that
their NHS care was good, very good or excellent&#151;the highest-ever

some more reassurance that, while the much-needed improvements that
they have planned may be delayed somewhat, they need to come on stream,
so that their health needs and the needs of those communities, which

trust, like others, will have local members and a local governance
arrangement, and it is up to the members and the governing council to
decide what those salaries should be. He refers to ward closures. There
are many reasons why a hospital might want to reorganise wards. It
might need and want to reduce the number of beds. For instance, if it
is doing more day case surgery or if it is bringing people in for an
operation on the morning that it takes place rather than the day
before, that is better for patients, but it has the effect that fewer
beds are required and therefore resources can be released for use on
other improvements in care for other patients. I thought that he would
welcome that, as well as the strong leadership that is provided by
those on the good board of any well-performing organisation, rather

death and disease caused by smoking. As a result of recent debates, if
nothing else, we are also now well informed about the damage that
breathing in other people&#146;s smoke can do to one&#146;s health.
However, there is a third element of the misery caused by smoking that

injuries from fires started by cigarettes. I commend the Fire Brigades
Union and Action on Smoking and Health for the work they have done to
highlight the continuing risks associated with smouldering
cigarettes.</p>

<p><a name="06060754000252">Despite
some success with &#147;stub it out&#148; campaigns, the number of
tragic and avoidable deaths in such domestic fires has proved hard to
drive down. The Government report &#147;Fire Statistics for the
United Kingdom&#148; shows that in 2004, 3,500 fires in dwellings
were caused by smoking materials, not including cigarette lighters and
matches, and a further 1,600 in other buildings. Over the previous 10
years, the number of such fires totalled more than 60,000. Fires in
dwellings caused in that way resulted in 114 deaths in 2004 and 1,260
non-fatal casualties. Smokers&#146; materials are the most frequent
source of ignition causing accidental dwelling fire deaths, accounting
for around a third of such deaths every year. The vast majority of
those fires were caused by manufactured
cigarettes.</p><p><a name="06060754000253">The
victims of those fires are more likely to be from low-income households
and of course they include non-smokers as well as smokers, children as
well as adults, and firefighters as well as members of the public, so
this is no trivial matter. If the dry statistics are not enough, the
human stories behind them are all too evident. For example, the
<i> Edinburgh Evening News</i> of 16 May this year reported on a fire
that left a child aged less than 18 months with burns over almost half
his body, requiring the amputation of two of his toes. It also left his
family without a home. By great good fortune, and thanks to the
presence of a smoke alarm, no lives were lost. Investigators believe
that that fire, like so many others, was most likely to have been
caused by smokers&#146;
materials.</p><p><a name="06060754000254">Tobacco
manufacturers have long dismissed the link between cigarettes and fire
deaths as &#147;merely a public perception&#148;, but for more than
20 years, as internal industry documents clearly show, the tobacco
industry has known full well that many of those fires could be easily
prevented. It argues that the introduction of cigarettes with a reduced
propensity to ignite would lead to more negligent behaviour, but that
is not a valid 
<br><notus-date day="7" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>7 Jun 2006 : Column 274</b><br>argument as the changes needed to the cigarette are slight and unlikely
to be noticed by smokers. There are also many examples of safety
standards being imposed on consumer products to protect public health
without triggering dangerous or irrational behaviour, such as seatbelts
and airbags in cars. If that argument were accepted, nothing would be
accomplished by any attempt by the authorities to impose safety
standards on consumer products. To avoid misleading descriptions, I
suggest the use of the term &#147;reduced ignition
propensity&#148;&#151;as used in Canada&#151;rather than
&#147;fire safe&#148; or
&#147;self-extinguishing&#148;.</p><p><a name="06060754000255">In January 2000, the tobacco
firm Philip Morris introduced a reduced ignition propensity cigarette
into the market, using small speed bands on special paper, which
ensured that the cigarette rapidly went out if not actively smoked. In
August 2000, New York state passed fire safety regulations requiring
that all cigarettes sold there had to meet reduced ignition standards
by June 2003. Early figures suggest that that may have reduced the
number of fire deaths from smoking materials across the state by at
least a third. Similar standards now apply in Canada, and the
regulatory impact assessment there forecasts a reduction in the number
of fires caused by manufactured cigarettes of up to two thirds. In the
US, Illinois and Vermont have already followed the example of New
York.</p><p><a name="06060754000256">In this country,
a fire research report done for the former Office of the Deputy Prime
Minister estimated that, had cigarettes in the UK conformed to the
highest standards in New York, the number of fires caused by cigarettes
would have fallen by nearly two thirds. The ODPM figures suggest that
that would have meant 78 fewer deaths in 2003 alone.</p><p><a name="06060754000257">Such standards could be
introduced across the European Union, under the general product safety
directive. Indeed, the European Commission is believed to favour such a
move. Therefore, I hope very much that we can now discount early
rumours that officials at the Department of Trade and Industry might
not support further progress on this issue, when the relevant Committee
meets in Brussels on 13 and14 June next week. I understand and
accept that the DTI rightly seeks to protect business from unnecessary
regulation, but I do not accept that the bulging bank accounts of the
tobacco industry really need such diligent defence by Government
officials. Surely the experience of that child in Edinburgh and the
thousands of other victims of fires caused by cigarettes merit a little
consideration.</p><p><a name="06060754000258">If DTI
officials are really so worried, let me reassure them that reduced
ignition standards could be introduced at minimal cost to business and
without threatening sales. Many of us may say in relation to cigarettes
that that is not something to be given undue priority in any event. I
hope that, now this matter has been drawn to the attention of
Ministers, they will instruct their officials to take a more
constructive approach. However, this House does not need to wait for
the cumbersome processes of the European Union and the internal
workings of Whitehall Departments to bear fruit. My Bill would require
this simple and overdue measure to be introduced in the United
Kingdom.</p><br><notus-date day="7" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>7 Jun 2006 : Column 275</b><br><p><a name="06060754000259">Smoking is a lawful activity in
a free society, but it brings with it terrible problems and it is
surely our job as legislators to ensure that they are minimised as far
as possible. In this case, we could introduce reduced ignition
standards without affecting anyone&#146;s freedom to any significant
extent. The number of fires would be reduced. The number of deaths and
serious injuries in fires would fall too, and insurance costs would
fall with them. The Department of Health would be assisted in its
hugely important aim of reducing health inequalities. The Department of
Communities and Local Government would be helped to meet its equally
crucial public service agreement target of cutting the number of deaths
from fires in the home by a fifth by 2010. And fewer young children
like the Edinburgh toddler would be exposed to horrific accidents and
injuries.</p><a name="06060754001316"><p>In my
own county of Leicestershire, a 55-year-old Anstey man would still be
alive today if this Bill had been on the statute book, as would a
70-year-old woman from Fleckney. Residents in Thringstone and
Ravenstone, wards that I have represented at various stages in my local
government career, would not have had some serious fires occur in their
homes&#151;so it is not surprising that the Bill is supported by
firefighters who, all too often, have to risk their own safety to deal
with fires caused by cigarettes. That is especially true for those in
the Leicestershire fire service, whom I thank for their research into
one element of the
Bill.</p><p><a name="06060754000260">In short,
everyone one would gain from my Bill&#151;and even the tobacco

reached yesterday by the Economic Affairs Committee in the other place,

of the Exchequer, the author of the tax credit policy, to explain to
this House what measures are being undertaken to address these
problems.</p></ul><p><a name="06060754000269">The
incompetent administration of tax credits touches the constituents of
every Member of this House. This debate could not be more timely: last
week, the Inland Revenue revealed that almost half of the 6 million
people in receipt of tax credits were paid the wrong amount. That is a
staggering level of error, and an increase on the previous
year.</p><p><a name="06060754000270">I welcome to the
debate the Chairman of the main Treasury Select Committee, and his
counterpart on the Treasury Sub-Committee. The Treasury
Committee,of course, is made up of. Members from all parties.
Yesterday, it published a report identifying Government error as a key
cause of the overpayments. In its briefing for this debate, the
National Association of Citizens Advice Bureaux reminds us that, four
years after the introduction of tax credits, it continues to see
</p><a name="06060754001329"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;thousands of families
who face hardship and genuine confusion as they have been told that
they have been overpaid but given no explanation and no warning before
payments are suddenly
cut&#148;.</p></ul><p><a name="06060754000271">Yet the
Chancellor of the Exchequer still lacks the courage to defend a policy
that he designed and implemented. We are told that he is at
ECOFIN&#151;the first such meeting that he has attended since
December. Two days ago, he was planning to send the Paymaster General.
We know that because we have the list of the week&#146;s events
produced by No. 10 Downing street. It clearly
states:</p><a name="06060754001330"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;EU

this debate was called and, for some reason, the Chancellor of the
Exchequer changed his mind. Is it not strange how the right hon.
Gentleman is always around to take the credit if things go well, but
always happy to let others take the blame when things go wrong? Not
once in the past year has he made a statement, taken part in a debate
or even answered a question on tax credits. It is the policy that dares
not speak its name, from a Chancellor who dares not open his mouth.
Prime Ministers need many qualities, but political cowardice is not one
of them.</p><p><a name="06060754000273">In the
Chancellor&#146;s absence, we have the poor new Chief Secretary to
the Treasury. He, at least, must know something about the chaos in the
tax credits system as he happens to represent the constituency 
<br><notus-date day="7" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>7 Jun 2006 : Column 278</b><br>with the largest number of people who are overpaid and the largest

Gentleman&#146;s constituents in East Ham who claim tax credits
receive the wrong amount from the Department that he helps to
run.</p><p><a name="06060754000274">The Chief
Secretary will undoubtedly tell us that the amount being overpaid
across the country has fallen a little, to a mere &#163;1.7 billion.
When he does so, perhaps he will confirm that the number of people
being overpaid has risen, with almost 3 million people getting the
wrong award. When he tells us that help is going to the poorest
families, will he also confirm that more than 100,000 of the poorest
families&#151;those on incomes of less than &#163;5,000&#151;did
not receive the level of support to which they were entitled? When he
tells us about what he has called in the past couple of days the
&#147;improved performance&#148; of the tax credits system, will he
explain why the number of people in his constituency being overpaid has
doubled in a year? Why did NACAB tell me yesterday that there was no

focus not just on the mistakes of the past, but the prospects for the
future. I have four questions for the Chief Secretary to answer when he
responds. They lie at the heart of whether the Chancellor&#146;s tax
credit system, designed by the Economic Secretary, can ever be made to
work in future. First, can the Chief Secretary confirm that the huge
annual overpayments&#151;almost &#163;4 billion in two
years&#151;are not the result of what the Paymaster General once
dismissed as &#147;teething problems&#148;, but are now a permanent
feature of the tax credit system? He admitted as much last week when he
set out the latest emergency reforms to the way in which the credits
operate. He said&#151;this is a striking statement&#151;that once
the changes are</p><a name="06060754001331"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;fully
implemented, we expect them to reduce overpayments in future years by
around one third&#148;.</p></ul><p><a name="06060754000288">So,
even if the reforms work as well as he hopes&#151;let us face it,
nothing else that the Government have promised on tax credits has
worked&#151;two thirds of the overpayments will remain. Almost 2
million people a year will go on receiving the wrong tax credit payment
and will face having the money clawed back off them, with all the

<br><notus-date day="7" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>7 Jun 2006 : Column 280</b><br>accept that the reduction of one third would follow from the change in
the income disregard, but that the other overpayments should also be
reduced by the changes to the reporting requirements? That was another
really important recommendation made in the pre-Budget
report.</p><p><a name="06060754000292"><b><a name="06060754001624">Mr.
Osborne:</b> As I understand it&#151;there is an opportunity
for the Chief Secretary to clarify this&#151;the reduction of a third
was if all the changes, both the reporting requirements and the
increase in the disregard, were to take place. The increase in the
earnings disregard simply reclassifies overpayments as disregarded
income. That is one of the ways in which the Government are dealing
with the problem.</p><p><a name="06060754000293">As
I said, the Chief&#146;s Secretary&#146;s admission was
extraordinary. As the Child Poverty Action Group reminded us last
week:</p><a name="06060754001332"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;behind these

despair&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06060754000295">because of the
clawback of tax credits that were rightfully hers. The chairman of the
Inland Revenue wrote to me about the case earlier this year. He
said:</p><a name="06060754001334"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;I am
sorry to say that when we processed your constituent&#146;s claim we
missed including her new income

possibly miss including the income details when one processes a tax
credit claim? That reveals a deep flaw in the system.</p><p><a name="06060754000297">The new changes announced by
the Government include new obligations on claimants to fill in more
forms and to file them more quickly&#151;any bureaucracy&#146;s
answer to any problem. Why do not the changes also include new
obligations on the Treasury? The parliamentary ombudsman recommended a
year ago that the Government introduce a statutory test for the
recovery of overpayments that gives people a right to appeal to an
independent tribunal when they think that the Revenue has got things
wrong. That is the same test that exists for other benefits. The
parliamentary ombudsman said that the test would</p><a name="06060754001335"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;strike the right balance between
the obligations on the part of the administrators and those on the part
of the recipients&#148;.</p></ul><p><a name="06060754000298">NACAB
says today that the test
would</p><a name="06060754001336"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;build confidence
in...the decisions being
made&#148;.</p></ul><p><a name="06060754000299">Why have the

instead imposing new obligations on the recipients that are not matched

Mike Weir (Angus) (SNP):</b> I was interested in what the hon.
Gentleman said about the new forms. What good is there in changing
forms if part of the problem is that the information does not seem to
get on to the computer system in the first place? The people who return
forms still end up with overpayments or the wrong payments because the
information goes missing, does not get put on to the computer or the
computer seems unable to recognise it.</p><p><a name="06060754000303"><b><a name="06060754001628">Mr.
Osborne:</b> That is one of the rare issues on which I agree
with the hon. Gentleman.</p><p><a name="06060754000304">The other question for the
Government on overpayments is, why have they not implemented their own
promise last year to pause before proceeding to recover an overpayment
so that they can work out whether it is the Revenue that has made the
mistake? Again, the parliamentary ombudsman recommended that approach.
So, too, did NACAB. The Select Committee said in its report yesterday
that that was</p><a name="06060754001337"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;crucial,
in the interests of natural
justice.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06060754000305">However, the
Committee also said that it feared that the Government promise had been
&#147;sidelined&#148;. Why have the Government reneged on that
promise? Perhaps the Chief Secretary can explain.</p><p><a name="06060754000306">If multi-billion pound
overpayments affecting millions of people are to be an annual feature
of the tax credit system, the Government need to implement the changes
needed to protect the rights of our most vulnerable families. That
brings me to the second question&#151;when will the ongoing fiasco of
the computer system be resolved? Again, I recently dealt with a case in
my constituency of a single parent who repeatedly tried to tell the
Inland Revenue that she was being overpaid. She was ignored for months,
only for her tax credits suddenly to be suspended altogether two weeks
before Christmas. She wrote to me to say that she could not buy her two
young children presents because she was struggling to provide them with
even the basics. A month later, after Christmas, the Revenue wrote to
me admitting that it had got the case wrong because
of</p><a name="06060754001338"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;a technical fault we
are experiencing with our
computer.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06060754000307">That was this
year. That was the same computer that the Paymaster General told the
House a year ago was &#147;stable and performing...well&#148;.
Does the Chief Secretary still think that the computer is stable and
performing well? Will he repeat that phrase when he gets up to
speak?</p><p><a name="06060754000308">The Government
amendment says that the IT problems affected only</p><a name="06060754001339"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;the early stages of
implementation&#148;.</p></ul><p><a name="06060754000309">If
Ministers really think that that is the case, I am afraid that they are
living in a fantasy world. Certainly the Select Committee does not
agree. It says in its report that IT error remains a
&#147;significant&#148; cause of the tax credit mistakes. Do
Ministers not realise what is 
<br><notus-date day="7" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>7 Jun 2006 : Column 282</b><br>going on in their own Department? The report goes on to talk about the

states:</p><a name="06060754001340"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;The

continues:</p><a name="06060754001341"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;It

shows, the deal done by Ministers means that&#151;this is truly
incredible&#151;full compensation is paid only if EDS wins other
Government contracts. In short, the company that Ministers believe is
guilty of messing up the tax credit computer will pay full compensation
to taxpayers only if it is given a chance to mess up another Government
computer system. Only this Government could negotiate such an
incompetent deal, and now they refuse to discuss the details of the
deal on the ground of commercial confidentiality. The Select Committee

they make and subject to parliamentary scrutiny on the arrangements
into which they enter on our behalf, instead of hiding behind
commercial
contracts.</p><p><a name="06060754000314">Of course,
it is not only the computer that has cost the taxpayer millions of
pounds, but fraud, which brings me to my third question&#151;what is
the true cost of tax credit fraud and what are the Government doing to
tackle it? The Government refuse to tell us the true extent of tax
credit fraud. According to the Paymaster General, there have
been</p><a name="06060754001342"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;persistent attempts
by organised criminals to obtain tax credits by using stolen or
fictitious
identities&#148;.</p></ul><p><a name="06060754000315">We know that
the Government had to abandon their online application system six
months ago after systematic abuse. We know, too, that although
Ministers say that they are acting tough, there were just 211
prosecutions for tax credit fraud, with only two for organised tax
credit fraud, out of 6.5 million applications. However, we do not know
when Ministers knew for the first time that systematic fraud was taking
place or how much money has been lost. Does the figure run into
hundreds of millions of pounds, or even billions?</p><p><a name="06060754000316">Ministers were warned about the
possibility of fraud before the tax credit system was introduced. Why
did the Chancellor ignore the series of security checks that

counter-fraud measures not carried
out?</p><p><a name="06060754000318">What about
stopping fraud in the future? Surely the Select Committee is right when
it warns that increasing the earnings disregard to &#163;25,000
creates an incentive for further fraud as people deliberately fluctuate
their incomes from year to year, but the Government have done nothing
to prevent that from happening. Will the Chief Secretary address that
problem today,
too?</p><p><a name="06060754000319">The Paymaster

tax credits. That all-party Committee asks the Chancellor to consider
fixing awards over shorter periods than a year, and I ask him again to
do so. The time has come to give serious consideration to moving to a
tax credit system that is based on shorter, more fixed payments, that
brings greater certainty to family incomes and that avoids the hardship

million people benefit from tax credits. Ninety three per cent. of
families on incomes below &#163;10,000 claim their entitlement to
child tax credit compared to the initial family credit take-up of just
57 per cent. under the Tories. In 1997-98, fewer than 2.5 million
families with children paid no net tax. Under today&#146;s tax credit
system, there are now 3 million families in that position.</p><p><a name="06060754000354">Three enormous gains have been

Charles Walker (Broxbourne) (Con):</b> Undoubtedly the tax
credit system has helped many people, but there are many families that
suffer huge distress when they receive claims for large sums that they
have no means of paying. How is the Minister proposing to reduce this
distress on hard-working families who do not deserve to be treated in
that way?</p><p><a name="06060754000356"><b><a name="06060754001647">Mr.
Timms:</b> I shall set out the progress that we are making on
that, because I think that it will be acknowledged that it has led to
considerable improvements. Before I do so, I am grateful for
acknowledgement of the benefits of the system, which I shall set out.
First, tax credits have significantly improved incentives to work. In
the past, far too many people found that they were better off on
benefits than in a job. Tax credits have put that right. That is one of
the reasons why so many more people are now in work and why the
historic high rate of employment that we have achieved has been
maintained for so long. Secondly, the tax credit system has reduced the
tax 
<br><notus-date day="7" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>7 Jun 2006 : Column 287</b><br>burden on low to middle-income families. An OECD study, published in
March, showed that, thanks to tax credits, net tax paid by a couple
with one child living on the average manufacturing wage has fallen from
more than 17 per cent. in 1997 to less than 10 per cent. now. That is a
dramatic reduction in the tax burdenfor people who are
benefiting greatly from the improvements that have been
introduced.</p><p><a name="06060754000357"><b><a name="06060754001648">Mr.
Philip Hollobone (Kettering) (Con):</b> I shall read briefly
the comments recently of one of my constituents in response to a letter
from the Tax Credit Office. My constituent
writes:</p><a name="06060754001352"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;I
should like to point out that although initially the tax credit
payments proved very useful, the situation created by your overpayment
has caused me substantial hardship and increased stress. In fact, I
wish that I had never applied in the first instance. I feel very let
down by the
system.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06060754000358"><b><a name="06060754001649">Mr.
Timms:</b> I shall describe to the House the improvements that
we have made. It is particularly interesting to note that take-up of
tax credits has continued to rise.</p><p><a name="06060754000359">The most recent figures and
data have confirmed that the third big gain has been that tax credits
have helped to achieve a big reduction in child poverty&#151;since
1997, the number of children growing up in poverty has fallen by
700,000. That is consistent with our aim of halving child poverty by
2010 and abolishing it by 2020. Tax credits have made a big
contribution to that success.</p><p><a name="06060754000360">Of course, there have been
problems with administration and with IT. It is right that the House
should press for those problems to be fixed, and I want to report
progress on that. I hope that the debate will reflect a new agreement
across the House that tax credits are right in principle and that the
focus now needs to be on how we can make the system more effective
still. Conservative Members now say that they agree with that, and that
is progress, but that is not reflected in the detail of their
contributions to the debate. Tax credits are playing a key role in
moving people into work, helping people move up the employment ladder
while in work and ensuring that it pays to be in a
job.</p><p><a name="06060754000361"><b><a name="06060754001650">Mr.
Jim Cunningham (Coventry, South) (Lab):</b> I am sure that my

they opposed tax credits. They opposed the proposal all the way down
the line. Does my hon. Friend recall also who it was who introduced the
Horizon project that cost billions and cost nearly &#163;50 million
to put right? The shadow Chancellor of the Exchequer did not talk about
that. I wonder whether he had a hand in that when he was an adviser in
John Major&#146;s
Government.</p><p><a name="06060754000362"><b><a name="06060754001651">Mr.
Timms:</b> The Conservative party was responsible for that. My
hon. Friend is absolutely right that the Conservative party
consistently opposed tax credits and consistently opposed the dramatic
improvements that we have seen in work incentives, reductions in tax
burdens and reductions in child poverty.</p><br><notus-date day="7" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>7 Jun 2006 : Column 288</b><br><p><a name="06060754000363">I will say a little more about
those three key improvements. Tax credits have improved incentives to
work. Together with our wider economic stability, they have helped to
increase the number of people in work by more than 2 million since the
spring of 1997. Since then, long-term unemployment has reduced by
450,000. For example, from this October, a couple with two children
moving into full-time work on the national minimum wage will be
&#163;41 a week better off for having done so. A lone parent with two
children moving into full-time work on the national minimum wage will
be &#163;76 a week better off compared with the &#163;54 that that
person would have received under the system as it was in 1997. A single
person without children moving into full-time work on the national
minimum wage will be &#163;58 a week better off compared with the
&#163;39 that they would have received under the system as it was in
1997. There have been substantial improvements in the incentives to
move into work, and they are one of the main reasons why we have seen
such a big increase in the employment
rate.</p><p><a name="06060754000364"><b><a name="06060754001652">Mr.
Vara:</b> The Minister is keen to emphasise the positive
aspects of the system. Will he concede, bearing in mind some of the
recipients of tax credit are the poorest in the land and some of the
most vulnerable, that he and the system are doing such people no
favours by increasing bureaucracy and the responsibility on them to
make claims without there being a similar impact on the
administrators?</p><p><a name="06060754000365"><b><a name="06060754001653">Mr.
Timms:</b> There is a big impact on precisely the people to
whom the hon. Gentleman refers, and that is for the good. For example,
the tax credit system has reduced substantially the tax burden on low
to middle-income families, precisely those to which he refers. That tax
take of 9.8 per cent. on a single earner couple on &#163;21,000, with
two children&#151;the manufacturing average wage&#151;is now,
according to OECD studies, the lowest rate of any country in the G7.
There has been a huge gain for middle and low-income families. The
single earner family with two children can now earn just under two
thirds of the average wage before they start to pay any net tax. Thanks
to tax credits, the number of families with children paying no net tax
will have risen by more than 500,000 to more than 3 million this year.
Those improvements should attract wide support from across the
House.</p><p><a name="06060754000366"><b><a name="06060754001654">Mr.
McFall:</b> I thank my hon. Friend for his remarks on the
constructive but critical report of the Treasury Committee. It says
clearly that tax credits are right in principle. The core issue is
whether we want a flexible system or a fixed system. I would wish to
take up that issue if I were to catch the eye of the occupant of the
Chair. I have not had a response from the shadow Chief Secretary about
the core issue. Where are the Opposition going? Are they fixed or
flexible? Will my hon. Friend address that core
issue.</p><p><a name="06060754000367"><b><a name="06060754001655">Mr.

point indeed.</p><p><a name="06060754000368">The
third big gain from the system is the fact that tax credits have helped
to achieve a significant reduction in child poverty&#151;700,000
children have been lifted out of relative poverty since 1997, compared
with a doubling of child poverty in the previous 20 years under the
Tory Government. There is recognition across the House that child
poverty must be tackled. Previously, the Opposition did not acknowledge
that, but they do so today, which is another reason for the broad
agreement that, as the Treasury Committee said, the tax credit system
is right in principle. Tax credits provide support for 20 million
people&#151;a third of the population&#151;and assist 6 million
families and just over 10 million children. Take-up is substantially
higher than in any previous system of income-related financial support
for families in work, and it has risen much faster than it did under
previous benefit systems such as family credit. The people most likely
to take up their entitlement are the low-income families who stand to
benefit the most.</p><p><a name="06060754000369"><b><a name="06060754001656">Anne

someone received an overpayment of &#163;9,000 that they were asked
to repay in monthly instalments of &#163;600, which is far beyond
their means. Until the Chief Secretary and the Government accept that

continue to cite facts. Individuals are better off in work, instead of
being on benefits, as they were in the past. Individuals have a lower
tax burden, thanks to the tax credit system, and 700,000 individual
children are not growing up in poverty, although they would have done
so under the system administered by the
Opposition.</p><p><a name="06060754000372"><b><a name="06060754001659">Mr.
Bailey:</b> We should talk about individuals. Individuals whom
I have met on the doorstep say that tax credit has transformed their
personal financial circumstances. If Opposition Members were completely
honest, they would have to include that in the equation. However, does
my hon. Friend agree that an obvious overpayment factor was built into
the system? In itself, that should not mean that a family suffers
hardship when their income increases and they have to repay it but, in
a small minority of cases, the calculations are wrong, resulting in
difficult circumstances. Furthermore, does my hon. Friend not agree
that the alternative is a fixed, inflexible system that penalises
people far more?</p><p><a name="06060754000373"><b><a name="06060754001660">Mr.
Timms:</b> My hon. Friend is right on both points. Yesterday,
the Treasury Committee made the point that 
<br><notus-date day="7" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>7 Jun 2006 : Column 290</b><br>its witnesses have not called for a return to a less flexible system,
although some hon. Members have done so.</p><p><a name="06060754000374">The statistics published at the
end of last month showed continued growth in the number of tax credit
recipients. The total number of families who benefit from tax credit
rose to 5.9 million in 2004-05, and 305,000 families have benefited
from the child care element alone&#151;a 14 per cent. increase on the
previous year. A total of 79,000 families benefit from the disabled
worker element, which represents an increase of 23 per cent. on
2003-04. Tax credits, as my hon. Friend rightly said, make a vital
contribution to the well-being of hard-working families in Britain
today. As the Treasury Committee said yesterday, they are right in
principle. The challenge is to make sure that the administrative
problems that have been raised in our debate are put
right.</p><p><a name="06060754000375"><b><a name="06060754001661">Mr.
David Laws (Yeovil) (LD):</b> So that we can move on to the
substance of the debate, can the Chief Secretary tell us how many
recommendations made a year ago by the ombudsman have been
implemented?</p><p><a name="06060754000376"><b><a name="06060754001662">Mr.
Timms:</b> We responded positively to the ombudsman&#146;s
report, and we have not rejected any of its recommendations. The hon.
Gentleman will have seen our response, as it has been
published.</p><p><a name="06060754000377">A good
deal of the debate concerns end-of-year adjustments, which were raised
by my hon. Friend the Member for West Bromwich, West (Mr. Bailey). Let
me make the position clear: as family circumstances change, we must
reflect those changes in the tax credits that are paid, which is why
end-of-year adjustments are integral to a flexible system that responds
to people&#146;s changing needs. For example, if a couple have a
second child or if they suffer a sudden drop in income, the tax credit
system should be able respond with extra help straight away. That is
the great strength of the flexible system that has been set up, and
such a response is only possible if payments can be adjusted during the
year and, where necessary, at the end of the year, once any changes in
income are known.</p><p><a name="06060754000378"><b><a name="06060754001663">Mr.

be removed if we did so, but he and the House must acknowledge the
price that would be paid is a loss of flexibility. Interestingly, the
report published yesterday included a suggestion, based on work by the
Economic and Social Research Council centre for analysis of social
exclusion, that, if anything, the system should be more flexible in
future.</p><br><notus-date day="7" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>7 Jun 2006 : Column 291</b><br><p><a name="06060754000381"><b><a name="06060754001665">Mr.

it is often not entered into the system or is not entered correctly so
it cannot be found if there is a problem. This week, I received a
letter from Revenue and Customs saying that it could not retrieve
information from the system to tell me whether my constituent had been
overpaid, underpaid or paid the correct amount. My constituent is
beside herself with worry&#151;there is a problem in the system, as
it cannot deal with flexibility.</p><p><a name="06060754000385"><b><a name="06060754001668">Mr.
Timms:</b> I was pleased to discuss the improvements that we
have made in a recent Adjournment debate, when the hon. Gentleman
raised his concerns. Procedures are in place to minimise hardship,
including reduced recovery rates from continuing tax credit payments
for people on low incomes. For people who no longer receive an award,
there are 12-month instalment plans, with longer repayments where
necessary. Her Majesty&#146;s Revenue and Customs considers the case
for making additional payments to people who claim hardship as a result
of recovery. My right hon. Friend the Paymaster General listened to
representations last year about the balance between certainty and
flexibility, and responded with changes that reflected those
representations.</p><p><a name="06060754000386">We

that, asmy right hon. Friend the Member for
Birkenhead(Mr. Field) said, there will be many, many more

Select Committee, I appreciate the open mind that my hon. Friend is
bringing to the problems that were thrown up. They are not easy
problems to resolve, but the fact that they are accepted and that work
is going on is welcomed. However, seeing the problems should not
distract us from the effect that tax credits have had on our estates. I
have seen so many young people waste away on benefits, particularly
single parents, who should be in a job but whose lack of skills means
that their first job will be a low-paid one, which does not make it
worth their while coming off benefits. Tax credits&#151;my hon.
Friend mentioned the figure of &#163;50 to &#163;76 a
week&#151;have provided the incentive for so many people on my estate
to take up work, enter society and be a stakeholder for the first
time.</p><p><a name="06060754000391"><b><a name="06060754001672">Mr.
Timms:</b> My hon. Friend is absolutely right. The dramatic
improvement to the incentives to get into a job have been a big gain
from the system. I am grateful to him for drawing the attention of the
House to the gains in his constituency, and I pay tribute to his work
on behalf of his constituents in that respect. That is why the Select
Committee said yesterday that we could not go further on certainty
without putting flexibility at risk. That was an interesting
conclusion, which the House will want to reflect
on.</p><p><a name="06060754000392">My right hon.
Friend announced some important policy changes last November, in
particular to address the impact of the annual income rises that have
led to the need for adjustment and an increase in the tax credits
disregard from &#163;2,500 to &#163;25,000. That crucial change has
taken effect from April this year. Together with other changes, those
policies will minimise the need for adjustments, yet maintain the
flexibility to respond to changes in
circumstances.</p><p><a name="06060754000393"><b><a name="06060754001673">Greg

neutral in cost terms. When one considers the elements of it that cost
money and those that gain revenue, the overall impact is broadly
neutral.</p><p><a name="06060754000395">In our modern
labour market, where in any year3 million people change jobs,
flexibility to respond is tremendously important. That is the big
benefit of the system as it has been constructed. I welcome the

that.</p><p><a name="06060754000396">Our strategy is
to make work pay and to providereal financial support to
families through tax credits. There have been problems in the early

giving way again. I sense that he is winding up. Will he deal with two
specific points, which I know the Select Committee considered and
Citizens Advice is concerned about? One is the statutory test and the
right to appeal to an independent tribunal, which exists for other
benefits. The second is the pause that the Government promised before
the claw back of overpayments, to give people the right to question the

is consistent between the tax credit system and the benefits system as
regards the handling of official error. As the hon. Gentleman knows, I
have just come from the Department for Work and Pensions, and there is
consistency now between those two. On the pause, we have said that we
want to accept the ombudsman&#146;s recommendation. I can reaffirm
that today. Some IT changes will be needed to achieve that, and they
may take a little time. We want to take the time, to make sure we get

timely moment to consider tax credits and the future of the system. Not
only do we have the figures that were published last week on the
2004-05 performance of the tax credit system, but we have the excellent
report from the Treasury Committee, which throws a great deal of light
on the salient issues that we shall discuss today, many of which were
glossed over in the Chief Secretary&#146;s response. I hope that the
Paymaster General will be able to say more when she sums
up.</p><p><a name="06060754000401">I welcome the
Chief Secretary to his new responsibilities and am glad to see that he
is taking a leading role in tax credits policy. Indeed, he seems to
have been taking the lead role over the past week as the Government
dealt with the implications of last week&#146;s
figures.</p><p><a name="06060754000402">I had not
spotted the statistics that the shadow Chancellor drew to our
attention, which indicate that in the Chief Secretary&#146;s
constituency there are greater problems with the tax credit system than
anywhere else in the country. I hope that that will ensure that there
is a stronger spokesman in the Treasury than there has been in the past
for the interests of those who have been failed by the system and who
are looking for reforms, rather than complacency, from the
Government.</p><p><a name="06060754000403">There are
two aspects of tax credits that we must debate today. The first group
of issues are those on which the Select Committee commented in its
excellent report, concerning the practicalities of the tax credit
system, with its existing broad design. The parliamentary ombudsman
commented on many of 
<br><notus-date day="7" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>7 Jun 2006 : Column 294</b><br>those in her report a year ago. The Chief Secretary said that the
Government accepted all the ombudsman&#146;s recommendations, but he
failed to say which had been implemented to date, and he is surely
wrong to say that the Government accept all the recommendations. I
thought it had already been made clear by the Paymaster General that
the Government did not accept the ombudsman&#146;s most important
recommendation, No. 10, which was to write off the overpayments that
have occurred in the past owing to official error. Perhaps the
Paymaster General can put on the record later whether the
Government&#146;s position on that has
changed.</p><p><a name="06060754000404"><b><a name="06060754001678">Philip
Davies (Shipley) (Con):</b> The hon. Gentleman hits upon
something that affects one of my constituents, Susan Webster, who is in
a distressing situation. She made Revenue and Customs aware each time
her circumstances changed, as HMRC has confirmed to me on its hotline,
yet she still had an overpayment of &#163;1,000, which she is
expected to pay back. Revenue and Customs refuses to write off that
sum. Surely it is wrong, when someone makes HMRC aware of changes in
their circumstances at the right time, that they are still expected to
pay back a considerable amount of
money.</p>

draws to our attention the fact that the Government have been in denial
about the problems of tax credits ever since the system was
established, and they have maintained from the beginning&#151;it is
picked up in the Treasury Committee&#146;s report&#151;that all the
problems that people have faced with tax credits have been due to their
own incompetence in dealing with the system. In fact, most of the
people I have seen in my advice centres in my constituency&#151;I
must have seen 250 to 300 over the past two years&#151;have faced
problems that were caused in some way by official error. That is what
the Government have neither acknowledged nor dealt with in the design

some of the successes of the tax credit system, and 17 of the 18 lines
of the Government&#146;s amendment trumpet its successes. Every hon.
Member today has acknowledged that for many people, tax credits have
made an enormous difference. It would have been almost unbelievable
that a Government could spend &#163;15.8 billion in a single year on
means-tested benefits without benefiting anybody. The issue is that the
design of the tax credits system has been fundamentally flawed, that
overpayments are fundamental to the system and that they have driven
into poverty many of the people whom the Government have sought to help
most, as has been shown by not only the Select Committee&#146;s
report, but the ombudsman&#146;s report, which has been sitting on
the shelf for the best part of a year.</p><p><a name="06060754000411">The Chief Secretary and the
Paymaster General would do well to read the leader article in the
<i> Financial Times </i>last week on the day on which the Government
published the latest statistics, in which the leader writer
said:</p><a name="06060754001357"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Compassionate
governments insulate low-income hard-working families from the ravages
of a global market. Enlightened governments seek such protection by
rewarding work through their tax and social security systems. Arrogant
governments close their ears when these policies are
failing.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06060754000412">One of the
greatest disappointments in terms of the Government&#146;s response
over the past year, and to some extent even the Chief
Secretary&#146;s response today, is that there has been an arrogance
and an unwillingness to accept the problems that have been created for
many people on the lowest incomes throughout the country.</p><p><a name="06060754000413">The problems of the tax credits
system, in terms of the loss of public money and the enormous
overpayments that have had to be recovered from people on low incomes,
are already well known. Many hon. Members today have already spoken,
and I am sure others will later, of their own experiences of dealing
with the individuals who have had these problems, many of whom have
never been significantly in debt before, are baffled by the complexity
of the system, and have got into these enormous debts and overpayments
through no fault of their own. It is on those practical issues that I
seek some reassurance from the Government
today.</p><p><a name="06060754000414"><b><a name="06060754001684">Mr.
Timms:</b> The hon. Gentleman&#146;s main proposal is the
reintroduction of a much less flexible system, like the old family
credit system based on fixed awards. He will have seen what the
Treasury Committee said about that yesterday. I
quote:</p><a name="06060754001358"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;there seemed to
be little support amongst our witnesses for returning to a regime of
fixed awards.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06060754000415">Indeed the
hon. Gentleman&#146;s predecessor in his current post explicitly
supported the ability of the system to be flexible in the way that it
is. Does that give the hon. Gentleman any pause to reflect on the
merits of the proposal that he has been running with for
sometime
now.</p><p><a name="06060754000416"><b><a name="06060754001685">Mr.
Laws:</b> I find the Government&#146;s position on this
issue rather difficult to fathom. The Chief Secretary has said a number
of times that the fixed system would have terrible disadvantages and
that it would be some 
<br><notus-date day="7" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>7 Jun 2006 : Column 296</b><br>kind of disaster, and that was the line that the Paymaster General used
to take. But at the same time they have acknowledged to the shadow
Chancellor that they are considering precisely such an option and that
they are keeping it under review. I remember being in this House a year
ago and hearing the Paymaster General tell us how the alternatives to
the then system were ridiculous; that a fixed award system would be
ludicrous and that increasing the disregard to the outrageous figure of
&#163;10,000 would be enormously expensive. Yet a few months later
the disregard went up from &#163;2,500 to &#163;25,000. The Chief
Secretary would do well to acknowledge that in paragraph 52 of their
report, members of the Select Committee say that they had not sought in
this inquiry</p><a name="06060754001359"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;to ask
whether the model of tax credits regime which the Government has
adopted is the right
model.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06060754000417">That is not what
the Select Committee has pretended to do. The Committee also took
evidence from a series of people, as the Chief Secretary will know,
including one-parent families, who want to see a return to fixed
awards; the Institute of Fiscal Studies, which believes that that
option needs to be looked at seriously; and the Child Poverty Action
Group, which has said that it believes that if the existing system
cannot be made to work, there should be a major redesign. If the Chief
Secretary really believes that the system of fixed awards is so flawed,
why do not the Government carry out a public assessment? Why do they
not commission some sort of research about other systems in the world?
We have this extraordinary debate where it is hintedthat a
fixed system would be unacceptable, yet the Government simultaneously
say that the system is being kept under review.</p><p><a name="06060754000418">I noticed today that one of the
things that the Chief Secretary is trying to do by continually coming
back to the issue of a fixed award system, which was not even an aspect
of the Select Committee&#146;s report, or one of the recommendations
of the ombudsman, is to try to distract attention from the lack of
progress on some of the major issues in the ombudsman&#146;s report,
which came out a year ago. I find it extraordinary that the Chief
Secretary is unable to say how many of the ombudsman&#146;s
recommendations made a full year ago have been implemented. I find it
extraordinary that he does not know that the principal recommendation
that the ombudsman made has been rejected by the Government. It is
extraordinary that the Government do not seem to have taken on board
the implications of the existing system for low-income families. It is
also extraordinary that, one year after the ombudsman&#146;s report,
which was the most powerful critique of the impact that the tax credits
system was having on some low income families and will probably never
be bettered in terms of its insights into the tax credits system and
its recommendations for putting it right in its existing form, a
cross-party Select Committee with many thoughtful but also
instinctively loyal Members of the Government, a majority Labour
Committee, should be reporting that</p><a name="06060754001360"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;we are not convinced that the
Paymaster General and the Department fully realise the extent to which
HMRC needs to re-focus its administrative structures for tax credits
around the needs of
claimants.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06060754000419">It
is astonishing that the Select Committee has gone on to
conclude:</p><br><notus-date day="7" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>7 Jun 2006 : Column 297</b><br><a name="06060754001361"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;We consider it would be
much more helpful if the Department were to focus on the quality of the
service it provides to claimants, rather than seeking to attribute the

on the part of
claimants.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06060754000420">The Select
Committee refers to the Paymaster General&#146;s statement about a
year ago when she attributed virtually every aspect of the overpayments
to errors that other people were making, and no aspect of the
overpayments to the errors that are being made by the system itself and
by the Inland
Revenue.</p><p><a name="06060754000421"><b><a name="06060754001686">Mr.
Mark Francois (Rayleigh) (Con):</b> Does the hon. Gentleman
agree that if, as the Government claim, the pre-Budget report package
is supposed to be essentially revenue neutral, and because the tenfold
increase in the disregard is expensive&#151;although the Government
will not tell the House how much it costs, even though we know that
they know&#151;in logic, the only way to keep the package neutral is
that HMRC will have to rule more harshly on those other decisions about
who is responsible for overpayments, and that will have a deleterious
effect on the low-income families who were supposed to be helped in the
first
place?</p><p><a name="06060754000422"><b><a name="06060754001687">Mr.
Laws:</b> The hon. Gentleman makes a serious point about the
Government&#146;s package that was presented in the PBR last year,
and the Treasury Committee&#146;s report was fairly scathing in
setting out the lack of evidence about costings for those changes. I
suspect that that is either because the disregard of &#163;25,000
will be much more expensive than the Government expect, or perhaps the
Government were never expecting ever to be able to reclaim a lot of
those overpayments in any case, and therefore have treated them as
written off.</p><p><a name="06060754000423">Let us
come to the main recommendations of the ombudsman in her report last
year, and the main recommendations about overpayments in the Select
Committee&#146;s report and what I would like the Government to focus
on as their first priority. I will touch upon some of the interesting
issues that have been raised with regard to fixed awards and some of
the comments about means-testing. There are challenges there for all
the parties. But the first matter to get right is the system as it is
working now.</p><p><a name="06060754000424">There
are a number of problems in the ombudsman&#146;s report that, in
fairness to the Government, they have started to try to deal with.
Unfortunately, the problems that they seem to have prioritised have
been some of the smallest and therefore the easiest to change. The
biggest recommendation of all, which would have involved a lot of
money, writing off overpayments due to official error, has been
disregarded by the Government. But the really critical recommendations
that the ombudsman has made concern the way in which overpayments are
treated. That was clear from today&#146;s briefing by the National
Association of Citizens Advice Bureaux, from recommendations 10 to 17
of the Select Committee&#146;s report, and from the shadow
Chancellor&#146;s questions, but it was not clear in the answer from
the Chief Secretary. We must move away from the type of system that
one-parent families described in the Committee&#146;s evidence as a
system designed by HMRC that would work with IT rather than with
claimants. That is the type of system that the 
<br><notus-date day="7" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>7 Jun 2006 : Column 298</b><br>Paymaster General described to me in a letter last June, when she said
that it was right that there should be</p><a name="06060754001362"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;a presumption of recovery by
means of reducing or stopping further
payments&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06060754000425">because most
overpayments would be due to errors by claimants. In other words, the
system as it has always worked from the beginning has been driven by IT
and computers, not by any sense of justice.</p><p><a name="06060754000426">In light of the responses by
the Paymaster General and the Chief Secretary, I am very disappointed
that one year on from the recommendations made by the parliamentary
ombudsman, the Government seem to have made absolutely no progress on
putting in place a pause so that people are able to challenge the
overpayments that have been alleged against them. That pause must not
only mean that people are not guilty until proven innocent but allow
them to understand why the overpayment has occurred. At the moment, the
information about that is completely inadequate in most
cases.</p><p><a name="06060754000427"><b><a name="06060754001688">Ms
Keeble: </b>This is a very important point that comes back to
how one manages the collection of debts, which is what they are in some
instances, from people on low incomes. We must ensure that, in the name
of having a pause, we do not build another big delay into the system
that makes it worse for people who are having difficulties. That is not
a flippant point but a serious one about managing income, repayments
and
debt.</p><p><a name="06060754000428"><b><a name="06060754001689">Mr.
Laws:</b> The hon. Lady makes a legitimate point about the
balance between not allowing people to get further into debt and
overpayment and giving them a reasonable breathing space to challenge
overpayments. I am sure that she accepts that the existing system that
presumes that people are guilty until they prove themselves innocent is
inadequate and, as the ombudsman puts it, systemic maladministration.
It is fundamentally unjust.</p><p><a name="06060754000429">What has struck me from my own
constituency cases is the complexity of making decisions about many of
the cases where overpayments occur. Looking at the system from the top,
one might think that one would be dealing either with an overpayment
caused by an outright error by the Inland Revenue, where it was obvious
to the person that &#163;1 million had turned up in their bank
account, or the opposite, where there had been a case of fraud. A huge
number of cases are much more complicated, and the tax credits system
needs to deal with that. They usually arise when individuals have
accurately reported information over a helpline or on paper to the
Inland Revenue. Those individuals usually then assume that the Inland
Revenue will use that information correctly, but often it does not. It
makes errors that it expects people to pick up from extremely complex
forms which most people do not understand, and which, in fact, many
Members of Parliament probably would not understand.</p><p><a name="06060754000430">I can think of an enormous
number of cases in my advice centres just over the past few weeks.
People have reported that in a particular year they had no income and
then have gone into a job, and the tax credits award notice that came
back showed them simultaneously working 40 hours and also having no 
<br><notus-date day="7" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>7 Jun 2006 : Column 299</b><br>income. People have been on the basic state pension but the award notice
has said that they are on pension credit and they have not understood
that. People have put in one application for a disabled child with
particular mobility components and something else has turned up on the
form. Many of these cases are not black and white. The existing system,
which applies the double lock whereby someone has somehow to prove not
only official error but that they could not have found it by looking
through all the forms, is completely inadequate for most of our
constituents.</p><p><a name="06060754000431">I
cannot understand why the Chief Secretary does not accept that the
systems of the Department for Work and Pensions and the Inland Revenue
are fundamentally different in relation to the assumptions that are
made about error and reasonableness. We need a fairer
test.</p><p><a name="06060754000432"><b><a name="06060754001690">Jim
Cousins (Newcastle upon Tyne, Central) (Lab):</b> May I draw
the hon. Gentleman&#146;s attention to the fact that his predecessor
as Front-Bench spokesman, the hon. Member for Northavon (Steve Webb),
was apparently able as a Member of Parliament to claim tax credits,
perfectly properly, by discounting his pension contributions from his
income? Does he find, as I do, that most of our constituents do not do
that, and that that accounts for a great deal of the
overpayment?</p><p><a name="06060754000433"><b><a name="06060754001691">Mr.
Laws:</b> With all due respect to the hon. Gentleman, who is
my former colleague on the Treasury Committee, I am sure that he is
making a serious point&#151;that one needs to be a professor of
social policy and a former fellow of the Institute for Fiscal Studies
to understand this system. I was once a Treasury spokesman for my
party, and I am now supposed to be the Work and Pensions spokesman, yet
I cannot understand some aspects of the forms that the Government send
out. They are still not simple enough, and it is still unsatisfactory
that there is no statutory test. It is bizarre that the Government have
been maintaining several different standards for writing off
overpayments over the past couple of years. It is disappointing that
none of those issues was addressed by the Chief Secretary. The Treasury
Committee&#146;s report goes over incredibly important ground that we
knew about a year ago following the report by the parliamentary
ombudsman.</p><p><a name="06060754000434"><b><a name="06060754001692">Mr.
Weir:</b> I am interested in the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
remarks about the complexity of the system. I used to be a solicitor,
and I find it very difficult to follow. The situation is even worse
than he suggests. A constituent of mine recognised that she had been
overpaid and continually told the Revenue so, but it would not accept
it. Eventually she got a letter from it claiming an overpayment and
saying that although she had repeatedly said that she was being
overpaid, it was not reasonable for her to accept the payments. What
sort of reasonableness are the Revenue working to when they send out
such
letters?</p><p><a name="06060754000435"><b><a name="06060754001693">Mr.
Laws:</b> The hon. Gentleman is right. Many hon. Members who
have had people with tax credit 
<br><notus-date day="7" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>7 Jun 2006 : Column 300</b><br>problems coming to see them will recognise such cases, and yet will be
entirely uncertain about how the Inland Revenue would deal with them in
practice. I have referred cases to the tax credits office where a
correct judgment has been made to overturn the overpayments. I have had
other cases where there is still fundamental injustice&#151;sometimes
involving people with serious disabilities or people with learning
difficulties who could not possibly be expected to understand aspects
of the form having given the correct information to the
Treasury.</p><p><a name="06060754000436"><b><a name="06060754001694">Mr.
Mudie: </b>I listened with interest to the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s answer to my hon. Friend the Member for Newcastle
upon Tyne, Central (Jim Cousins). I went on television to defend the
Liberal spokesperson for claiming tax credit despite a wage of about
&#163;60,000. This is a good opportunity to put that on the agenda.
My personal view is that if a system directed at the poorest and most
vulnerable extends to people such as MPs, that clearly pushes a lot of
work on to the Revenue that it should not have because we should not be
able to claim. The system should be tighter and directed at the most
needy.</p><p><a name="06060754000437"><b><a name="06060754001695">Mr.
Laws:</b> The hon. Gentleman makes a sensible point. As he
says, people are entitled to claim from a system that the Government
have established and on which they have a legitimate claim. He will
know that there will be huge sympathy for his viewpoint. It seems
bizarre that people who otherwise pay the upper rate of tax can get
such benefits. The Government&#146;s difficulty with a means-tested
system is that if one wants to deny the benefits to such individuals,
one has to taper it away more sharply, which raises the disincentive
issues mentioned by the shadow
Chancellor.</p><p><a name="06060754000438">When the
Paymaster General winds up, I would like to hear what progress has been
made on the crucial recommendations made by the parliamentary ombudsman
a year ago, which the Treasury Committee has felt it necessary to come
back to in its report. That should not have been necessary. The
Government should have been able to progress these issues by now, even
if they had decided to make changes that could not have been
implemented for some
time.</p><p><a name="06060754000439">I would also
like to follow up the shadow Chancellor&#146;s point about fraud.
Those matters deserve a much bigger debate than we have today. However,
it is clear that the Comptroller and Auditor General was expecting the
updated fraud figures this spring. Have provisional figures already
been made available to him? When will they be given to the
House?</p><p><a name="06060754000440">We need to
have a wider debate on fixed awards and the balance between flexibility
and stability. The Select Committee acknowledged that it did not fully
investigate that in the report. It would be enormously beneficial to
the House if it could examine some of those issues in future. Even the
Government have had to learn to some extent from their experience when
the original design of the tax credits system went wrong. The Chief
Secretary&#146;s claims that a fixed award system would be wrong or
damaging sits ill with the Government&#146;s statements that they are
keeping the matter under review. If they are keeping it under review,
it would be interesting to know what they are doing to review
it.</p><br><notus-date day="7" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>7 Jun 2006 : Column 301</b><br><p><a name="06060754000441"><b><a name="06060754001696">Rob

Committee report and the parliamentary ombudsman&#146;s report and
ask the Government why they have not implemented the recommendations,
which we support, that should have been implemented as a priority a
year ago. I ask the hon. Gentleman to ask the Chief Secretary to
consider seriously the case for a fixed award system such as that in
Canada. I thought that he would brief us on Canada&#146;s excellent
experience of a fixed and stable system. The Government should examine
that option because stability is as important if not more important
than flexibility for families on low incomes.</p><p><a name="06060754000445">We all understand that the
Government have made, at considerable cost to the public finances, an
enormous commitment to trying to reduce child poverty and improve work
incentives. They have changed the terms of the political debate, even
though there are some major problems with the design of tax credits and
the extent to which we can rely on increasing use of means-tested
benefits. The Chief Secretary will know about that from his time in the
Department for Work and Pensions, dealing with the pension
credit.</p><p><a name="06060754000446">My major
criticism of the Government is not that they have rejected all our
proposals for a fixed award system, but that we are sitting here, one
year after the parliamentary ombudsman reported and two years after we
knew about the problems, and the most important recommendations have
not been implemented. I do not like to personalise such matters but it
is regrettable that the Chancellor of the Exchequer has not bothered to
be here today and that he can find time to change his diary and deal
with international issues but cannot find time to tackle an important
issue such as this. It is also regrettable that much that the Paymaster
General has said in the past couple of years has been complacent and
reflected a state of denial. That must lie behind the fact that a year
has passed and yet we have made no progress on the

families, we now have20 million people getting support, as the
Paymaster General said, involving 6 million families and10
million children. That is an increase on the results of every past
policy, and the take-up rate among low earners has been 93 per cent.
That is a big improvement compared with the take-up rates of 57 per
cent. in the early years of family income supplement, of 62 per cent.
for family credit and of 65 per cent. for working families tax credit.
That is why the Select Committee has endorsed this policy.</p><p><a name="06060754000472">The Select Committee also
endorses the child poverty objectives that have resulted in 700,000
children being lifted out of relative poverty, and the measures on
creating adequate financial incentives to work. The Chief Secretary to
the Treasury mentioned the tax burden. Like him, I look to the survey
carried out by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development, which showed that, as a result of the tax credit, there
had been a large fall in the tax burden for families. The tax burden on
a single-earnercouple with no children earning &#163;21,000
has fallen from 17.3 per cent. of gross earnings in 1997 to 9.8 per
cent. in 2004. That is the lowest rate for any G7 country, and it is
indeed an incentive for people to get into work. The effect of the
policy on children is also important, and the Select Committee report
notes that the tax credit has helped to ensure that the number of
families with children paying no net tax has risen from under 2.5
million to more than 3 million in 2006-07. That is a considerable
improvement.</p>

<p><a name="06060754000473">However,
I must ask whether everything is going right with the regime, and the
answer is most definitely no. That is why the Treasury Committee has
sought to address a number of points. Is the regime fit for purpose?
Yes, in terms of the majority of people getting tax credits. However,
it is not fit for purpose for the minority of people having problems
with the tax credit system. That is why the Select Committee visited
the tax credit office in Preston, where we looked at the way in which
the regime was working in practice. Overpayments were a big issue
there.</p><p><a name="06060754000474">We examined
the problem of overpayments, and the staff gave us three reasons for
it. The first is that people&#146;s incomes rise from one year to the
next. The second is that families overestimate the extent to which
their income has fallen. The third is that the provision of payments at
the start of a tax year might be based on out-of-date information.
Those three reasons combined account for 70 per cent. of the
overpayments. I would like to think that the Select Committee has
performed a service in identifying those three issues so that they can
be tackled. The Select Committee also noted that 30 per cent. of the
overpayments were due to delays in reporting changes in a
family&#146;s circumstances.</p><p><a name="06060754000475">The Conservative and Liberal
Democrat spokesmen both mentioned the arguments for either fixed or 
<br><notus-date day="7" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>7 Jun 2006 : Column 305</b><br>flexible systems, and I would like to say to the hon. Member for Yeovil
(Mr. Laws) that that subject was very much a feature of the
Committee&#146;s discussions. My right hon. Friend the Member for
Birkenhead(Mr. Field) gave oral evidence to the Committee in
which he said that he was getting fewer complaints at his surgeries
about tax credits now. I have also taken anecdotal evidence on this,
and that is certainly a feature of what hon. Members tell me more
widely.</p><p><a name="06060754000476">If we were to
go back to a fixed system, hon. Members would have an increasing number
of people coming to see us about the problems involved. I would also
like to point out to the Chief Secretary to the Treasury that if we
returned to a fixed system, we would not be responding to the demands
of a modern labour market. That is important because 3 million people
change jobs every year in a modern labour market, and each year more
than 200,000 move into new or better jobs, resulting in an increase in
their family income by &#163;10,000 a year or more.</p><p><a name="06060754000477">Those are the reasons for the
overpayments. I cannot stress strongly enough that, if we are to have a
flexible system, overpayments will be a feature of it. So how can we
manage this in a client-sensitive manner? I might be departing from
what the Select Committee has said on this, but my experience is that
the benefits of a flexible system are there for everyone in the family.
</p><p><a name="06060754000478"><b><a name="06060754001713">Jim
Cousins:</b> Will my right hon. Friend comment on paragraph 30
of the report&#146;s conclusions and recommendations? The Select
Committee makes it clear that, if we are to have a system with the
flexibility that he described, it will not be reasonable to expect to
achieve staff reductions. In fact, the number of people being employed
to achieve a more flexible system is growing, and that pattern is
likely to continue. We will not be able to achieve staff reductions if
we want to achieve flexibility.</p><p><a name="06060754000479"><b><a name="06060754001714">Mr.
McFall:</b> That is a very good point. That issue was raised
with us at the tax credit office in Preston. As a result of the demands
on the office, extra members of staff were being drafted into that
area. When the Minister and others look at the Gershon reviews, and at
the demands that have been made on the Department already, they should
keep this issue up front. We realise that this cannot be fixed
overnight; it will take time. I will mention some of the problems
involved as I go through my speech. However, it is an issue that we can
all tackle
constructively.</p><p><a name="06060754000480">I know
that the Chancellor has an open mind about this system. The media and
others focus on the fact that there have been &#163;2 billion of
overpayments this year. That equates in the public&#146;s mind to
&#163;2 billion of losses, but that is not the case. However, it does
give the impression that the system is running less than smoothly. So
perhaps the Chancellor will anticipate that reaction and say,
&#147;Okay, we&#146;ll go back to a fixed system. It will be a
surer system.&#148; But will it serve the interests of our
constituents? I do not think so.</p><p><a name="06060754000481"><b><a name="06060754001715">Mr.
Laws:</b> Does the right hon. Gentleman accept that this is
not just an issue of presentational embarrassment for the Government or
lost money for the taxpayer? It is also a fact that many of the 
<br><notus-date day="7" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>7 Jun 2006 : Column 306</b><br>overpayments are being recovered from people on extremely low incomes,
sometimes when the problem has arisen through official error rather
than their own. That is an even bigger problem than the fact that the
Government have paid out &#163;2 billion more than they
intended.</p><p><a name="06060754000482"><b><a name="06060754001716">Mr.
McFall:</b> The hon. Gentleman must accept that overpayments
are an inherent part of a flexible system. But how can we marry such a
system with a client-sensitive system? The Select Committee had that
discussion with members of the unions and officials in Preston when we
visited the tax credit office there, and that is the important issue
for them.</p><p><a name="06060754000483">The
overpayments were &#163;2.2 billion in 2004-05 and &#163;1.8
billion in 2005-06, and I hope that the Paymaster General will respond
to this point when she windsup the debate. A breakdown is
needed of those overpayments to determine what the Government&#146;s
figures are. The figure of &#163;4 billion over two years needs to be
broken down.</p><p><a name="06060754000484"><b><a name="06060754001717">Mr.
Philip Dunne (Ludlow) (Con):</b> Does the right hon. Gentleman
agree that this is not just about the overall amount of money involved?
It is also about the number of people involved. He referred to a
minority who had received overpayments, but we heard from the shadow
Chancellor earlier that, in many constituencies, nearly 50 per cent. of
those entitled to payments are either being underpaid or overpaid. I
have just worked out that, in my constituency, 47 per cent. are getting
the wrong payment. Given the administrative nightmare that is taking
place in HMRC, the impact on people&#146;s lives of having to deal
with this problem is getting them very upset, and we have to spend all
our time dealing with that. Solving the problem of administrative
incompetence is absolutely critical to getting this matter
right.</p><p><a name="06060754000485"><b><a name="06060754001718">Mr.
McFall:</b> As I said earlier, overpayments are an integral
part of the system, but it is necessary to distinguish between
individuals who can make an adequate response to the Tax Credit Office
about overpayments and those&#151;perhaps people on low incomes and
in distress&#151;who cannot. However, I agree with the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s second
point.</p><p><a name="06060754000486"><b><a name="06060754001719">Mr.
Weir:</b> I understand what the right hon. Gentleman is
saying, but does he not accept that, as many other Members have pointed
out, some people who recognise that they have been overpaid find it
difficult to persuade Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs that they have
been overpaid? That prevents the problem from being sorted out
earlier.</p><p><a name="06060754000487"><b><a name="06060754001720">Mr.
McFall:</b> I realise that, and if Members give me an
opportunity I shall say more about it
shortly.</p><p><a name="06060754000488"><b><a name="06060754001721">Rob
Marris (Wolverhampton, South-West) (Lab):</b> My right hon.
Friend is doing a great job in drawing out what I perceive as a
consensus, evidenced by the last two interventions. The consensus on
both sides of the House seems to be that tax credits are a good thing
and are doing a great deal to alleviate poverty, and that there are
administrative teething problems. The only 
<br><notus-date day="7" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>7 Jun 2006 : Column 307</b><br>difference now seems to concern the magnitude of the problems, and how
far the Government have gone towards addressing them. The overpayment
figures for two years that my right hon. Friend has given show that
they are moving in the right direction. If the Opposition would be a
little more flexible, we could have consensus on that. There are
problems, which are being fixed. It will take more effort to fix them
further.</p><p><a name="06060754000489"><b><a name="06060754001722">Mr.
McFall:</b> The Paymaster General dealt with a number of those
problems in the pre-Budget report, and I am sure that she will discuss
them
later.</p><p><a name="06060754000490">End-of-year
adjustments feature in any flexible system. The only way in which to
eliminate overpayments is to have a fixed system in which eligibility
is based on the previous year&#146;s income and circumstances, and I
certainly do not want to go down that
road.</p><p><a name="06060754000491">The Treasury
Committee said that there should be a shift in the culture of HMRC if
the tax credits system was to be a success. HMRC conducted a review of
the merger of the two departments, which the Select Committee
recommended to the Government. As has been pointed out, there are two
entirely different cultures, and the client-centred culture has not
been predominant. That must be addressed, and I hope that David Varney,
HMRC&#146;s chief executive, and his colleagues will read the report
with that constructive criticism in
mind.</p><p><a name="06060754000492">I should like
the Paymaster General to think about what the Committee said about
official error. The Committee believes that it has been a cause of
overpayments in a significant number of cases, and that the Government
should publish a complete analysis of incidences. There are also the
errors caused by the IT system, which a number of Members have
mentioned. Constituents have come to me about it. After our visit to
Preston, the reason is obvious to us. When a client telephones a civil
servant who then consults a computer, not all the information on the
client will be on that computer. If decisions are being made on the
basis of incomplete information, we can be sure that the system will be
made worse. The IT problem must be addressed as a matter of
urgency.</p><p><a name="06060754000493">When we
visited Preston, we learned that only about 25 per cent. of claims went
straight through the automated system with no need for manual
intervention. About 80 per cent. of new claims required intervention,
and it was required by about30 to 35 per cent. of claims for
renewal. The Public and Commercial Services Union told us that the
Government initially intended the &#147;rapid data capture&#148;
process&#151;the conversion of written information from application
forms into electronic data&#151;to handle about 90 per cent. of
claims without further need for human intervention. My hon. Friend the
Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, Central (Jim Cousins) mentioned staff
numbers, and those figures make his point. There is an urgent need to
keep staff at the Tax Credit
Office.</p><p><a name="06060754000494">A recurring
theme was the IT system&#146;s lack of flexibility, and the
difficulty of correcting a mistake once it had been entered into the
system. Staff may&#151;as 
<br><notus-date day="7" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>7 Jun 2006 : Column 308</b><br>they told us&#151;accept that the information is wrong, but may still
be unable to correct the error.</p><p><a name="06060754000495">The Committee also referred to
fraud, error and organised crime. When the Paymaster General appeared
before the Committee, I personally interrogated her on issues relating
to staff from the Department of Work and Pensions and from Network
Rail. HMRC has closed the e-portal and it feels that the fraud issue
can be addressed, but there is still a problem over national insurance
numbers. Vigilance is
needed.</p><p><a name="06060754000496"><b><a name="06060754001723">Mr.
Mudie:</b> Perhaps it is wrong to raise this when my right
hon. Friend is talking about fraud, but I think we should record the
problems that the Committee had with Electronic Data Systems. We were
not able to confirm that we could discuss the matter with the Minister,
because we were bound by a settlement. The Public Accounts Committee
has raised the issue, and it has been raised by us. I think it should
be put on record that the settlement with EDS is
insupportable&#151;that it is quite wrong, requires investigation,
and should never be
replicated.</p><p><a name="06060754000497"><b><a name="06060754001724">Mr.
McFall:</b> My hon. Friend makes a good point. I remind the
Paymaster General that David Varney, the HMRC chief executive,
contacted us and offered us a confidential briefing. However, that
would naturally have meant that we could not open our mouths at any
future date. As politicians and public representatives, we were not
prepared to enter into any such negotiation.</p><p><a name="06060754000498">There is a credibility problem.
There is, perhaps, a perception of impropriety. There may have been no
impropriety, but the position is far from satisfactory, and my hon.
Friend the Member for Leeds, East(Mr. Mudie) has done us a
service by referring to
it.</p><p><a name="06060754000499">The Committee
welcomed the increase in disregard from &#163;2,500 to
&#163;25,000, but the Government say that they expect the increase to
reduce the current level of overpayments by a third. That suggests that
the remaining two thirds of overpayments arise as a result of changes
in claimants&#146; circumstances other than increases in income.
Consequently, over the next few years&#151;although the tax credits
regime may see a decrease in the number of overpayments&#151;levels
are likely to continue to be high. At the same time, claimants&#146;
problems may well become increasingly complex as their case histories
within the regime lengthen. I should like the Paymaster General to
examine that issue, as well the important issues of the pause and the
referral to an independent tribunal for appeal. We have mentioned both
those
issues.</p><p><a name="06060754000500"><b><a name="06060754001725">Ms
Keeble:</b> On the independent tribunal appeal, does my right
hon. Friend agree that it is important that we see the report first, as
the Treasury Committee suggests, so that we can determine the
practicality of having an independent appeal system, which is what we
recommended?</p><p><a name="06060754000501"><b><a name="06060754001726">Mr.
McFall:</b> I agree and hope that the Paymaster General
continues to talk to the Committee while she considers the pause. We
said that we were concerned by the apparent lack of urgency on the part
of the 
<br><notus-date day="7" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>7 Jun 2006 : Column 309</b><br>Government and the Paymaster General in seeking to implement the pause
before recovery of overpayment, given that automatic recovery of
overpayments is contrary to natural justice. We recommend that the
Government reassess the priority that they have assigned to
implementing the pause. I hope that she refers to that.</p><p><a name="06060754000502">In deciding whether to write
off an overpayment, HMRC should not apply a stringently objective
reasonableness test, but take account of things such as a
claimant&#146;s circumstances and the clarity of award notices. I
know that the Paymaster General has considered
that.</p><p><a name="06060754000503"><b><a name="06060754001727">Mr.
Michael Wills (North Swindon) (Lab):</b> Does my right hon.
Friend agree that one of the important innovations that the Paymaster
General and her team introduced was the hardship team, which examined
individual circumstances and could vary the amount of repayment? Does
he share my concern that the hardship team was disbanded at the start
of this financial year and no date has been set for it to be
re-established? Does he share my hope that the Paymaster General will
address
that?</p><p><a name="06060754000504"><b><a name="06060754001728">Mr.
McFall:</b> I agree entirely. I do not know the particular
circumstances of the case, but I am willing to take my hon.
Friend&#146;s word on it. However, as I said, we have to distinguish
between those who have been overpaid and can pay the money back
adequately, and those low-income families who are experiencing hardship
and are in distress. As he says, a hardship team is essential in
determining that, and I hope that the Paymaster General considers the
issue.</p><p><a name="06060754000505">I think that I
have exhausted all possible interventions and finish on three things
mentioned earlier. First, on the support for families, more families
are getting the credit. Secondly, we are making progress on child
poverty targets. Thirdly, on incentives to work, my hon. Friend the
Member for Leeds, East mentioned young people who are unemployed. I am
a former school teacher. When I first took up teaching, a lot of the
kids whom I taught in the area where I lived went on not to work, but
to unemployment. I would meet some of them five, 10 years later. They
would be with their wife or kids, pushing a pram, and I would dread
asking, &#147;What are you doing?&#148; I was reluctant to do that.
Now I can walk down my high street and ask people what they are doing
with more confidence and more authority because more people are in
work.</p><p><a name="06060754000506">We need a
flexible system that responds to people&#146;s needs and provides
incentives to work, especiallyfor young people, because we
must rememberthat unemployment is the single most important
determinant of poverty. If we can have such a system, warts and all, it
deserves our support. However, we will keep our critical eye on the
Paymaster General over the next few months. We will not let up and will
work as a team to ensure that we get the system
right.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="06060754001415">3.32

have found her and her civil servants extremely courteous. The fact of
the matter is, however, that a ghost is missing from the
banquet&#151;it is the author of this shambles, the Chancellor of the
Exchequer. It is conspicuous that over the three years of malfunction
of the system that he introduced he has not taken part in one of these
debates. Like the Duke of Plaza-Toro, he has led his troops from
behind. Frankly, that level of political timidity in somebody

months. The advice given to my constituent&#151;the

for more than two years, one has been referred to the adjudicator, and
eight more will have to be referred to the adjudicator. Because of our

failures, but it is not responsive to data input&#151;I think that
that is the
expression.</p><p><a name="06060754000523">In
evidence to the Treasury Committee, the Paymaster General said with
tremendous and accustomed
candour:</p><a name="06060754001379"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;I am
not a computer
person.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06060754000524">The problem is
that not only is the right hon. Lady not a computer person, but so far
I can see, the people responsible for the installation and maintenance
of the Treasury&#146;s computers are not computer people
either&#151;they are not capable of getting it right&#151;and the
result is a Treasury Committee report that is absolutely scathing in
its determination.</p><p><a name="06060754000525">We
are dealing with real people. Teething troubles have been referred
to&#151;if there are such troubles, all I can say is that second
teeth are coming through, because the programme is now three years old.
The Treasury team responsible, including the Paymaster General and the
Chancellor of the Exchequer, have had three years to get it
right.</p><p><a name="06060754000526">Members of
Parliament continue to receive cases of hardship and misery, generated
by a scheme that we were told would solve people&#146;s problems and
help them out of debt, poverty and hardship and back into work. For a
third of the people involved in the scheme, who are supposedly
receiving money as beneficiaries, the reverse is the case&#151;it is
creating problems and causing hardship. It hurts me to have to say
this, but frankly, if the chairman of Revenue and Customs and the
Treasury team responsible for the scheme cannot get it right after
three years, they should move over and make way for someone who
can.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="06060754001416">3.41

Sally Keeble (Northampton, North) (Lab):</b> A bit later in my
remarks, I want to deal with an aspect of the tax credit scheme that
has not been talked about much: the child care element&#151;a
particularly important point that is responsible for some of the very
high levels of overpayment. Before I do so, it is important to return
to the fact that the policy is basically the right one. Although
everyone says, &#147;Oh yes, we agree that it is the right one,
but...&#148;, we are left with the &#147;buts&#148;, which
are undermining. The implication that the system is working so badly
that it cannot be made to work and therefore that it must be changed is
one of the things that I want to refute very strongly.</p><p><a name="06060754000528">We have a choice, and my right
hon. Friend the Member for West Dunbartonshire (Mr. McFall) was right
to press on both Opposition parties that there is a choice between
flat-rate and real-time benefits. Of course, a flat-rate benefit would
be easier to administer. We could just say, &#147;We know the family
size, and here&#146;s a flat-rate payment.&#148; However, the real
issue is what the payment should be. That is where things become
problematic, because we might assume that there is an identikit family
and we might give people a certain 
<br><notus-date day="7" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>7 Jun 2006 : Column 313</b><br>amount of money. Labour Members&#146; suspicion is that if the
Opposition ever got their hands on the system, the level would be too
low.</p><p><a name="06060754000529">People are now
much more familiar with working with computer systems and real-time
benefits can take account of changing circumstances. In a sense, people
expect the system to target their real needs much more carefully.
Again, that comes back to the child care element. That is why it is so
important and why my right hon. Friend was correct constantly to press
the point about the flat-rate system versus the more flexible
version.</p><a name="06060754001317"><p>By
providing flexibility, we make it possible for people to remain in
work. That is fundamental not only to the fight against poverty, but to
people&#146;s dignity, self-respect, standing in society and ability
to support their children and to hold out the prospect of a better life
for them and all the other things that people want to do for their
families. In a previous incarnation, when I was the leader of an
inner-London council during all the Tory recessions, I saw people on
flat-rate benefits who lived on large council estates, and those
benefits only served to keep them in
poverty.</p><p><a name="06060754000530"><b><a name="06060754001735">Mr.
Tobias Ellwood (Bournemouth, East) (Con):</b> I remind the
hon. Lady that her party is in power and this motion has been tabled
because mistakes are being made by the Government. Does she agree that
about half of those who apply for tax credits receive the wrong
assessment? That is what we should be addressing, not some fictitious
idea of what a future Conservative Government might
do.</p><p><a name="06060754000531"><b><a name="06060754001736">Ms

policy choices and what has been learned from the past to inform the
future. It also relates to what happens to lone
parents&#151;unemployed women bringing up children&#151;and their
prospects. I do not think that anyone&#151;and that includes Labour
Members&#151;has referred to that key issue for the tax credit
system.</p><p><a name="06060754000532"><b><a name="06060754001737">Danny
Alexander (Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey)

system, but major problems are caused by the high degree of error and
incompetence, and they would make it worth while investigating
returning to a system of fixed awards. The experience of my
constituents is that it is no longer worth the trouble of engaging with
the tax credits system&#151;which was set up to help
them&#151;because the incompetence has been going on for three years
and they are sickof
it.</p><p><a name="06060754000533"><b><a name="06060754001738">Ms
Keeble:</b> The hon. Gentleman makes the fair point that if a
system is constantly run down, people disengage from it. It is
important therefore to ensure that the public understand that the
system can make a real difference to their life chances. I accept that
it is complicated, and people may need help with working their way
through it. The Committee&#146;s report contains important
recommendations with which, as a member of the Committee, I
wholeheartedly concur. We must recognise that if we are to give people
a hand up, not a hand out&#151;to use one of our old
phrases&#151;we must 
<br><notus-date day="7" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>7 Jun 2006 : Column 314</b><br>ensure that we provide them with the kind of support that will help them
best in their present circumstances, not the circumstances in which
they were last
year.</p><p><a name="06060754000534">The system is
important because of what it has done for women, and that is why we
must get the administration of it right. I take second place to nobody
in criticising the administration and the amount of fraud. The system
was designed to give a real chance to people on low and average
incomes&#151;and in some cases, people with fairly high earnings but
large family commitments&#151;to get children out of poverty and to
provide some dignity for women who had been kept out of work and at
home on benefits for many years, and it is a scandal that it is
hampered by administration problems and fraud. That is why Labour
Members are so concerned about the administration and why the
Committee&#146;s report has received so much attention. It is
certainly an excellent
report.</p><a name="06060754001318"><p>Much of
the ground has already been covered and other hon. Members wish to
speak, so I shall make only a few points. The staff have received much
criticism, and when we visited them in Preston it was clear that they
have thought a lot about the issues and learned a lot from doing so.
Some of the managers had done superb jobs in sorting out their
targeting and working out ways to deal with the administrative
problems. That deserves to be recognised, and the staff should be
congratulated on their work. The system is complex and people who are
not used to it or to dealing with benefits of this type can find it
difficult to come to terms with. Such problems need to be resolved, but
it is important that we do not merely castigate the staff for what has
happened.</p>

<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060607/debtext/60607-0389.htm"/>


<p><a name="06060754000535">The
report identifies various problems, but other challenges&#151;such as
the difficulty of reporting a change in circumstances&#151;remain.
The report spends a lot of time talking about how people&#146;s
income can vary in-year. That is understandable when people working
shifts or in temporary jobs have to adjust their hours for school
holidays and so on. However, evidence gathered for the report made it
clear that people&#146;s lives change. We must accept that families
break up and that people find new partners. New babies get born and
children grow up, moving from nursery school to their main school and
then out to work.</p><p><a name="06060754000536">All
those changes can have an impact on a person&#146;s tax credit claim.
My right hon. Friend the Chancellor announced changes to the system in
his Budget statement, and their implementation must take account of
people&#146;s changing circumstances. I am sure that my right hon.
Friend the Paymaster General is more familiar with the details than I
am, but I think that one of the proposals is that a change in
circumstances will have to be reported in one month rather than in
three months. Staff must be geared up and ready to deal with such
changes, and claimants must also be aware of what they have to do. They
must be able to manage what can be quite a complicated process, as it
is not always clear that a change in circumstances will be
permanent.</p><p><a name="06060754000537">In
addition, the relevant computer systems must be geared up to deal with
the requirement that changesin circumstances are reported more
quickly. It is important, too, that people who advise claimants
understand the changes.</p><br><notus-date day="7" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>7 Jun 2006 : Column 315</b><br><p><a name="06060754000538">The Treasury Committee also
talks about the ombudsman&#146;s recommendation about an independent
appeals system, and makes it clear that it wants to see a report on the
practicalities involved. I hope that HMRC can look into the matter very
carefully and make a report available quickly, because it is really
important to ensure that a paper chase, once begun, does not
proliferate.</p><p><a name="06060754000539">The hon.
Member for North Thanet (Mr. Gale) mentioned the arguments that people
can get into, and the sequence of events is familiar to all hon.
Members. When a person in receipt of a tax credit award undergoes a
change in circumstances, he or she is likely to say that the award was
wrong in the first place. Details of the changes are fed through the
system, making the first award even more wrong and rendering incorrect
any award made subsequently. The problem then is that it is very
difficult to alter the first award, with the result that a paper chase
begins that goes on and on. It can take an inordinately long time to
resolve such a
problem.</p><p><a name="06060754000540">Any appeals
system has to be appropriate. It must arrive at the right decision and
provide proper redress, but it also has to be quite fast. It must not
add to the paper chase&#151;it is very important that the appeals
system makes things better rather than worse. I hope that the HMRC
report on an independent appeals system is made available to hon.
Members, and that it is prepared very quickly.</p><p><a name="06060754000541">My final point has to do with
child care, an element in the debate that has been overlooked so far.
It is important that we remember that the flexible tax credits system
recognises the cost of caring for children. It is not perfect, but for
the first time ever women can claim their child care costs and go out
to work.</p><a name="06060754001319"><p>In the
early days of the system that led to some fraud, but the new process
has helped a bit. Some problems remain, such as how to deal with
holidays and what mature students with children can do about their
child care costs. However, it is really important that, as we move
forward, we retain the recognition that a woman might need only a small
amount of money in tax credits because she can earn reasonably well,
but she can earn well only if all her child care costs are paid. She
might need only a few pounds a week in tax credits, but she will need
&#163;100 a week or more in child care costs. I hope that that is
recognised. </p><p><a name="06060754000542">I
hope that it is also recognised that, because that is the case, I have
constituents who have received huge overpayments because of the child
care element. I am sure that other hon. Members have such constituents,
too. I ask that that be looked at&#151;particularly in any future
proposals that the Treasury makes&#151;to make sure that women can
get their child care costs, and also that, if mistakes are made, women
do not suddenly find themselves plunged into paying large amounts of
money because of miscalculations on child care, especially when child
care costs sometimes do not take account of holidays and some of the
difficulties that women have.</p><p><a name="06060754000543">I know that Conservative
Members do not like being told about things that happened in the past.
Fortunately, it is a long time since the last Tory 
<br><notus-date day="7" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>7 Jun 2006 : Column 316</b><br>Government. However, I remember hundreds of people being laid off work
and being put on benefits in the middle of one of the worst of the Tory
recessionsin Birmingham. That was in the days before
computers&#151;or before large-scale computers. The then Department
of Health and Social Security system&#151;all the offices in
Birmingham&#151;shut down in a strike because people were overloaded.
It was not just that the admin did not work; it shut down completely.
For about nine months, people got nothing. Thatwas an example
of the Conservative Government administering financial support to
people who were out of work because of the recession that the
Conservative Government created, and who were in dire poverty. The
suffering was severe, which is one reason why Labour Members think
twice when they hear Conservative Members talking about benefits for
people on low incomes.</p><p><a name="06060754000544">As I say, I will be second to
none in criticising maladministration and fraud in the benefits system.
Will my right hon. Friend the Paymaster General make sure that we have
a welfare system that does not act as a kind of opium of the masses in
keeping them in unemployment, but enables people to transform their
lives, go out to work and have proper child care for their children,
and create a much better future for their
families?</p><h5 align="left"><a name="06060754001417">3.57
pm</h5><p><a name="06060754000545"><b><a name="06060754001739">Greg
Clark (Tunbridge Wells) (Con):</b> There is no perfect system
of welfare. The system always involves choices. There is no utopia that
we can ever hope to achieve. Because those choices have to be made, it
is important that they should be debated properly and fully in
Parliament. Those choices are fundamental to the designs of systems.
There is the choice to provide incentives for people to stay in
work&#151;that extends in-work benefits up the income scale to the
levels that we have. That is a choice that has to be made. We can have
the simplicity of universalism in benefits, but that comes at a cost.
All those questions need to be discussed fully and properly. What has
been a bit disappointing in the contributions from Labour Members is
how unwilling they have been to have a proper and open debate about the
changes. Instead, they have defended a system that reflects some policy
choices that can and should be questioned. The Select Committee report
has done that.</p><p><a name="06060754000546">It is
important to address three points in particular. First, there is the
question of overpayments. Secondly, there is the complexity of the
system and, thirdly, there is the effect of the tax credit system on
low pay. When it comes to the level of overpayments, let none of us be
under any illusions. The overpayments are a direct consequence of the
policy. The tax credit system is engaged in bringing together two
completely different policies: the tax system, which has traditionally
taken a look at income on an annual basis, and the welfare system,
which takes a much shorter term&#151;often week by week&#151;looks
at what claimants need. Needless to say, putting those two things
together involves exactly the type of problems that we have seen and
that are intrinsic in that system. That is why that requires
debating.</p><p><a name="06060754000547">Quite
reasonably, the Government have recognised the problem and increased
the disregard from &#163;2,500 a 
<br><notus-date day="7" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>7 Jun 2006 : Column 317</b><br>year to &#163;25,000. No doubt that will help to solve the problem. It
is, however, important that we assess whether the change represents
value for money, but the Government have consistently refused to allow
us to make such an
assessment.</p><p><a name="06060754000548">When the
disregard was set at &#163;2,500, the Treasury was able to estimate
that it would cost &#163;800 million. When the disregard was
increased tenfold to &#163;25,000, similar figures, miraculously,
could not be produced and no assessment could be given&#151;or so we
thought. When the Public Accounts Committee questioned senior officials
in Her Majesty&#146;s Revenue and Customs on the matter, it emerged,
after a degree of probing, that such estimates had been produced.
However, presumably because it would have been inconvenient to Treasury
Ministers if the figures were disclosed, the information was not put in
the public domain, although we know that it is
available.</p><p><a name="06060754000549">The
Institute for Fiscal Studies, a well-respected think-tank that does
valuable work to inform all parliamentarians about the technical
aspects of the tax system, was eager to obtain the information so that
it could make what, as every hon. Member wouldagree, would be
an independent assessment of the consequences of the change, but its
request was refused. HMRC sent the IFS an unbelievable letter in which
it disclosed that it had information about the cost of the increased
disregard, but refused, on freedom of information grounds, to give it.
The letter
read:</p><a name="06060754001380"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;In
applying this exemption we had to balance the public interest in
withholding the information against the public interest in disclosing
the information.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06060754000550">I have
no idea what the public interest in withholding the information can be.
If the Paymaster General wishes to explain it to me, I will be happy to
take her intervention, but she is, perhaps conveniently, buried in her
paperwork, as ever.</p><p><a name="06060754000551">We
are able to make an estimate of the figure because we know that the
overpayments in the most recent financial year amounted to some
&#163;1.8 billion. It is argued that the overpayments reflect several
factors, of which changes to income in-year is but one, and that it is
impossible to work out the situation, although calculations have been
done. However, in the qualification of the annual report and accounts
of the Inland Revenue, the Comptroller and Auditor General was able to
make an assessment of the reasons for the overpayments. In the 2004-05
accounts, the CAG said that the</p><a name="06060754001381"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Total overpayments for 2003/4
were mainly because family income had increased by more than the
&#163;2,500
disregard&#148;.</p></ul><p><a name="06060754000552">In other
words, the CAG, who is an unimpeachable figure, says that the main
contribution to the then&#163;2.2 billion figure, which is
now &#163;1.8 billion, was in-year changes in income. If the
Paymaster General wishes to correct Sir John Bourn on the record, I
will happily give her the opportunity to do so, but I see, again, that
she chooses not to intervene. The matter is important. If we interpret
the CAG&#146;s assessment as generously as possibly by regarding
&#147;mainly&#148; as constituting half the expenditure, the
relevant figure is well over &#163;1 billion a year and could be as
high as&#163;1.8 billion.</p><p><a name="06060754000553">I said at the beginning of my
speech that the welfare system involves policy choices. We should be
able to 
<br><notus-date day="7" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>7 Jun 2006 : Column 318</b><br>debate in both Select Committee and the Chamber whether &#163;1
billion of Government expenditure is best applied to simplifying the
system in such a way, or whether, for example, we should use it to
increase child benefit by &#163;140 for each family, which would be
an alternative. Ministers are disgracefully denying us the opportunity
to exercise such scrutiny. Although I understand the political interest
in doing such a thing, I do not see the public
interest.</p><p><a name="06060754000554"><b><a name="06060754001740">Ms
Keeble:</b> Will the hon. Gentleman give
way?</p><p><a name="06060754000555"><b><a name="06060754001741">Greg
Clark:</b> I will be glad to hear an explanation of the public
interest in withholding the
information.</p><p><a name="06060754000556"><b><a name="06060754001742">Ms
Keeble:</b> If the hon. Gentleman reads the report, it works
out that 30 per cent. of the overpayments are due to changes in income,
roughly 30 per cent. due to changes in circumstances, and about 15 per
cent. each to two other factors. That does not mean that
therecan then be a transfer into values. There is an
interrelationship between the different elements, so the conclusion is
wrong.</p><p><a name="06060754000557"><b><a name="06060754001743">Greg
Clark:</b> The hon. Lady is right in saying that there are
different factors. That is why I referred to the Comptroller and
Auditor General, whose qualification of the accounts was based not on
the number of claimants&#151;he has no interest in that&#151;but on
value. He said that the main contribution was from in-year changes in
income. That was his
assessment.</p><p><a name="06060754000558">There are
two more deficiencies in the present system. The first is its
complexity. We should be able to have a reasonable exchange of views on
the complexity of the developing system without having to pretend that
it is the best possible system for the best possible set of
circumstances. The National Audit Office takes a balanced and
reasonable view. In a report on the complexity of the benefits system
that the PAC considered, the NAO
said:</p><a name="06060754001382"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;We
consider that an appropriate degree of complexity exists when there is
an equilibrium between the system being complex enough to meet the
needs of the wide range of different individuals in various
circumstances, yet straightforward enough to run efficiently. Overall,
in the National Audit Office&#146;s view, this equilibrium has not
yet been
reached.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06060754000559">Those
are the objective and independent words of the NAO. Surely Ministers
should reflect on that and concede that the system is too complex and
needs to be reformed so as to be more simple. If the words of Sir John
Bourn do not carry much weight with Treasury Ministers, perhaps those
of the Child Poverty Action Group will. Its helpful handbook on welfare
benefits and tax credits has, I think, been sent to all of us, as
Members of Parliament. It now runs to 1,600 pages. In this
year&#146;s introduction, it says that
recent</p><a name="06060754001383"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;changes...have
left activists exhausted, claimants increasingly anxious about their
entitlements&#148;&#151;</p></ul><p><a name="06060754000560">we
have heard that from many of my hon.
Friends&#151;</p><a name="06060754001384"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;and
arguably, a system more fragile and complex than ever
before.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06060754000561">This cannot be
seen to be a system that works.</p><p><a name="06060754000562">I was concerned when the Chief
Secretary seemed almost to be welcoming the ever-increasing numbers of
people who are claiming tax credits. I will be the first to 
<br><notus-date day="7" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>7 Jun 2006 : Column 319</b><br>welcome improvements in take-up&#151;that is to say people who are
entitled to benefits taking them up&#151;but surely it cannot be a
benchmark of Government policy that more and more people coming onto
state benefits should be a symptom of success. What basis of economic
competitiveness is that?</p><p><a name="06060754000563">Another way of thinking of
record numbers of people claiming tax credits is that 7 million working
people&#151;representing 6 million families&#151;are in jobs that
are not productive enough to generate an income to keep themselves and
their families without a top-up from the state. Of course, if they are
not able to earn to that level, they need to have a top-up. They need
to be helped, but we cannot congratulate ourselves that earnings are so
low that more and more people every year require the intervention of
the state so as to have a decent sum on which to live.</p><p><a name="06060754000564">I endorse the view of the
Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, who, in a notable lecture to
the Fabian Society, recently
said:</p><a name="06060754001385"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;It is a
striking fact that around half of the children living in poverty today
live in a household where an adult is in
work.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06060754000565">There are two
reasons why people require these top-ups to sustain themselves. One
reason is that they may not be productive enough&#151;their skills
may not be adequate enough to support themselves and their families. An
increase in claimants for that reason is a damning indictment of what
we need to do to be competitive. Again, the Secretary of State for Work
and Pensions
said:</p><a name="06060754001386"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Whereas
we today have 3.4 million unskilled jobs, it is estimated that by 2020
we will need only
600,000.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06060754000566">It is extremely
important that we increase skill levels within
society.</p><p><a name="06060754000567"><b><a name="06060754001744">Ms

work.</p><p><a name="06060754000568"><b><a name="06060754001745">Greg

more and more people have jobs that pay so little that their earnings
need to be topped up by the state. However, support should be
available.</p><p><a name="06060754000569">Unusually
for a Conservative Member, I endorse the campaign by the Transport and
General Workers Union on low pay in the cleaning industry, in which it
points out that, for example, 60 per cent. of cleaners employed in the
City of London earn less than &#163;5.50 an hour. It is unacceptable
for employers who make do very well from large profits and who depend
on those services to get away with poverty pay. We should not accept
such behaviour, and Government Members should not accept it either. We
need to look seriously at the tax credit system and its interaction
with the minimum wage if we are to address the argument of the eminent
academic Jonathan Bradshaw of the university of York:</p><br><notus-date day="7" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>7 Jun 2006 : Column 320</b><br><a name="06060754001387"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;At the moment the state

all the way to their
shareholders&#148;.</p></ul><p><a name="06060754000570">In
conclusion, this is such an important issue thatit is
disappointing that the Government have complacently defended the
present position. We need to debate these things more thoroughly and
positively. If the words of my right hon. and hon. Friends and I do not
carry any weight with Treasury Ministers, perhaps the words of the
right hon. Member for Darlington (Mr. Milburn) will do so. In March, he
said that we need
to</p><a name="06060754001388"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;tackle the root
causes, not the symptoms. That must mean moving beyond simply
correcting low wages and family poverty after the event, towards
policies that spread opportunity and help people to realise their own
aspirations for progress.&#148;&#151;[<i> Official Report</i>, 28

too.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="06060754001418">4.12

Gwynne (Denton and Reddish) (Lab):</b> It is a pleasure to
follow the hon. Member for Tunbridge Wells (Greg Clark), given his
apparent conversion to Labour&#146;s national minimum wage.</p><p><a name="06060754000573">I welcome this debate, but the
House will be relieved to learn that I wish to make only a brief
contribution. Tax credits have made a huge difference to a great many
families in my constituency. Earlier, the hon. Member for Guildford
(Anne Milton) bemoaned the citing of facts and statistics, and she
urged us to focus on individuals. I am happy to do so, because she
reminded me that in the last general election campaign, I ran a street
stall on Denton market ground on a Sunday morning. A young mother came
up to me and said, &#147;Are you Labour?&#148; Given her tone, I
hesitated to reply, but I said, &#147;Yes.&#148; She said,
&#147;That&#146;s okay, because your lot have made a real
difference to my life. You have done so much for me and my family. The
tax credits have really made a difference, and have enabled me to go
out and find a
job.&#148;</p><p><a name="06060754000574">That is
the hidden success of the Government&#146;s tax credit system. Quite
simply, tax credits have made work pay, and they have helped to support
families financially. As the Minister said, they have helped us to lift
700,000 children out of relative poverty, which is good news that
should be applauded. Yes, some of my constituents have experienced
problems, and when things go wrong they often go very wrong indeed,
which causes those families great concern. However, as my right hon.
Friend the Member for West Dunbartonshire (Mr. McFall) said, our right
hon. Friend the Member for Birkenhead (Mr. Field) and others have
received anecdotal evidence of fewer tax credit problems than in
earlier years. Having worked in my predecessor&#146;s constituency
office, and having dealt with many of those tax credit problems myself,
I can confirm that there has been a substantial reduction in cases,
although there are still some issues that need to be resolved. I have
every confidence that they will be.</p><p><a name="06060754000575">I welcome the changes being put
in place by Her Majesty&#146;s Revenue and Customs, which will
alleviate 
<br><notus-date day="7" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>7 Jun 2006 : Column 321</b><br>some of the problems in the system, not least with the increase in the
disregard for earnings between one tax year and the next from
&#163;2,500 to &#163;25,000. That will reduce the overpayments
substantially once the measure is fully implemented, as has been
acknowledged by speakers in all parts of the House. People whose
circumstances have changed and who currently get caught up in the
system should not get caught up in future. That is surely to be
welcomed.</p><p><a name="06060754000576">I am working
to resolve the cases that my constituents have brought to me, and I
will continue to do so, as I am sure other hon. Members will do. I
re-emphasise what tax credits mean to many people. Tax credits benefit
6 million families. In my constituency, Denton and Reddish, that
amounts to 7,600 families in receipt of family tax credit and 12,600 in
receipt of child tax credit. Those are often lower paid families who
struggled to survive under the Conservative Government.</p><p><a name="06060754000577">For all the difficulties that
there were and are in the system, that extra money is making a
fantastic difference to a great many families in Denton and Reddish and
throughout the country. It is most certainly not the shambles that the
hon. Member for North Thanet (Mr. Gale) described. Yes, let us iron out
the problems, but let us also be proud of this good policy&#151;a
redistributive policy, a Labour policy and one that is lifting families
out of poverty and giving people opportunities to secure work. I am
proud of that and I want to see those principles continue into the
future.</p><p><a name="06060754000578">Despite the
apparent conversion today of those on the Opposition Front Bench, I do

Tobias Ellwood (Bournemouth, East) (Con):</b> It will take me
just three minutes to get my views across in this interesting debate. I
am sad that the Chancellor is not present to hear some of the comments,
and that it has taken the Conservatives to bring the issues to the
fore. We listened with interest to the Chief Secretary, but one can
always tell when a Minister is on the back foot. Rather than answer the
questions put to him by the shadow Chancellor, the hon. Gentleman went
on to attack what a Conservative Government might or might not do in
the future. He failed to explain why about half of those who apply for
tax credits do not receive the correct amount. He failed to explain why
the overpayment threshold has been changed from &#163;2,500 and
increased tenfold to &#163;25,000, and the consequences of that to
the taxpayer. On a personal note, he also failed to explain why his own
constituency is among those that fare worst in the tables published
last week.</p><p><a name="06060754000581">We have a
benefits system that is getting worse, not better, getting more
complicated, not simpler, and costing more, not less. It has taken the
Conservatives to bring the matter to the Floor of the House. It is 
<br><notus-date day="7" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>7 Jun 2006 : Column 322</b><br>interesting that Mr. Speaker decided to throw out the amendments to the
motion because they were not worthy. We wanted to discuss issues of
overpayment, fraud and incompetence in the administration of the tax
system. We wanted the Chancellor to reply, since he created the system
in the first place, but he is not
here.</p><p><a name="06060754000582">In their
amendment the Government usually cite a great many statistics. I am
glad to hear that some of the &#163;15 billion that is being spent on
the tax system is going to some places, but with just under half the
people not getting the right amount, there are clearly questions to be
answered. They were not answered today. I hope that the shadow
Chancellor will have the wisdom to call another debate when the
Chancellor can fit it into his diary and be present in the Chamber.
However, the Government have been forced in their amendment, which has
been thrown out, to acknowledge that there are IT problems and that
there have been administration cock-ups, and to acknowledge the need
for more changes yet again in a system that the Chancellor
created.</p><p><a name="06060754000583">We have had
enough renaming, rebranding and restructuring. We need a radical
overhaul of the tax system, with a programme that simplifies it to its
core, that is revenue neutral and that reduces the gap between the cost
of paying a tax and the amount of tax collected. Until we go down that
road, more and more of the &#163;15 billion that has been spent every
year will be
wasted.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="06060754001420">4.20
pm</h5><p><a name="06060754000584"><b><a name="06060754001748">Mr.
Mark Francois (Rayleigh) (Con):</b> It is a genuine pleasure
to sum up the debate today for Her Majesty&#146;s Opposition and to
highlight what has become the shambles of the tax credits system as
administeredby the Government. The system now costs
some&#163;16 billion a year, or the equivalent of 5p on the
standard rate of income tax. It incorporates some6 million
families, of which some 2 million were overpaid in 2004-05, while at
the same time just under1 million families were underpaid. In
other words, nearly half of all the payments in the entire system were
incorrect. I therefore welcome the Chief Secretary&#146;s admission
that the system has serious problems, and his acceptance this afternoon
that there is now &#147;a consensus&#148; that tax credits should
be retained. It was important that the Government accepted that there
was a consensus to retain them, and we welcome
that.</p><p><a name="06060754000585">However, the tax
credits system, as it is currently configured, is seriously flawed. It
is prone to fraud and it is also far too complicated, to the extent
that many of the claimants who use it do not fully understand what they
are claiming, many of the staff who administer it do not really
comprehend it properly, and it is all based around a computer system
that itself is highly unreliable, as was brought out clearly in the
typically punchy contribution of my hon. Friend the Member for North
Thanet (Mr. Gale). That serves only to compound the mistakes in the
system itself.</p><p><a name="06060754000586">The
Government&#146;s defence, as outlined in their hurried written
statement that was rushed out on Monday, is essentially that the
package of remedial measures announced in the December pre-Budget
report will put things right. But six months on, they 
<br><notus-date day="7" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>7 Jun 2006 : Column 323</b><br>still refuse to tell the House what the package will really cost, and
even then, they admit that this will reduce the overpayments by only a
third, so well over 1 million families will still be overpaid even when
the package is fully up and running. The PBR package does not address
the problems at the heart of the current system&#151;namely, its
excessive complexity and its dependence on unreliable information
technology. <i> [Interruption.]</i> The Chief Secretary has returned
just in time for me to welcome his acknowledgement of our consensus. In
effect, the PBR package is an attempt to place a sticking plaster over
what has become a gaping
wound.</p><p><a name="06060754000587">Since the new,
and supposedly more flexible, system was introduced in 2003, a series
of independent reports has subsequently criticised the operation of the
Chancellor&#146;s system. In June 2005, after receiving thousands of
individual complaints about the new system, the parliamentary ombudsman
produced a report that
concluded:</p><a name="06060754001390"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;A
review of all the cases referred to the Ombudsman shows that the
greatest difficulties are suffered by the core group that the tax
credit system is aimed at helping, mainly families on low
incomes.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06060754000588">In September
2005, the Public Accounts Committee looked at the system and attacked
its complexity. It
concluded:</p><a name="06060754001391"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;The
Government intended the new tax credits to provide a system that was
simple for people to understand and to administer. In practice, many
people have found the scheme difficult to understand. Many have
complained to the Inland Revenue about the system and the frustration
and misery it has caused to
claimants.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06060754000589">We heard that
reflected on both sides of the House in our debate this
afternoon.</p><p><a name="06060754000590">In January
2006, after reviewing the ombudsman&#146;s findings, the Public
Administration Committee delivered the following damning verdict on the
IT system, which underlines the current tax credits system. It
said:</p><a name="06060754001392"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;We are
concerned that the IT system which is supposed to enable an efficient
delivery of the scheme has in fact been a root cause, first of creating
some of the problems which have led to the criticism and complaints
about the scheme and then of acting as a barrier to resolving them
quickly.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06060754000591">Then, in April
2006, we had a scathing report by the Public Accounts Committee that
looked at the fraud and errors in the system, including overpayments
that totalled &#163;1.8 billion in 2004-05. It
concluded:</p><a name="06060754001393"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;The
Department does not have reliable or up to date information on levels
of claimant error and fraud in tax credits. The absence of this
information and its analysis seriously impairs the Department&#146;s
management of the schemes and its ability to safeguard
taxpayers&#146;
money&#148;.</p></ul><p><a name="06060754000592">Despite that,
Ministers at all levels in the Treasury keep trying to insist in the
media that the system is working well.</p><p><a name="06060754000593">Can the Paymaster General tell
us the true extent of the fraud that is now inherent in the tax credits
system? We were promised those figures in the spring&#151;let us have
them now. Picking up on what my hon. Friend the Member for Tunbridge
Wells (Greg Clark) cleverly pointed out, we still have not had the cost
of the tenfold increase in the disregard, and we are now told that it
is not in the public interest to tell us, as elected 
<br><notus-date day="7" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>7 Jun 2006 : Column 324</b><br>Members of Parliament, what that figure is. Will the Paymaster General
tell us why?</p><p><a name="06060754000594">Only
yesterday we had, as the right hon. Member for West Dunbartonshire (Mr.
McFall) said, a very objective report from the Treasury Committee,
which looked in great detail at the administration of the system and
concluded:</p>

<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060607/debtext/60607-0390.htm"/>


<a name="06060754001394"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;It
is obvious to us that the Paymaster General&#146;s account makes no
reference to causes of overpayments which have arisen as a consequence
of the Department&#146;s own processes&#151;for example official
error and IT systems error. Rather, the Paymaster General has referred
only to those causes of overpayments which can be attributed to
claimant error or omission, or to the design of the tax credits regime,
or a combination of
both.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06060754000595">All these critical
reports, in just two years, represent a litany of failure, and it is a
failure lodged firmly on the doorstep of No. 11 Downing
street.</p><p><a name="06060754000596">There is also
a growing consensus among the voluntary sector that the current system
does not work properly. As we have heard, the National Association of
Citizens Advice Bureaux&#151;citizens advice bureaux now advise tax
credit claimants as a major part of their work load&#151;provided a
frank commentary on the problems in the
system:</p><a name="06060754001395"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Last
year Citizens Advice Bureaux across the UK advised on around 150,000
tax credit problems. CAB experience is that the recovery of
overpayments has caused significant hardship to many families as
payments have stopped without warning or
explanation.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06060754000597">Whereas,
for those who read <i> The Guardian</i>, the Reverend Paul Nicholas,
chairman of the Zacchaeus 2000 Trust, was quoted in the paper this week
as
follows:</p><a name="06060754001396"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Enforcement
is driven by computers that have no means of identifying the
illiterate, blind, disabled, mentally or chronically
ill&#148;&#151;</p></ul><p><a name="06060754000598">and in some
cases, even dead. He concludes
that</p><a name="06060754001397"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;an overpayment of
tax credits can lead to a downward spiral of a family&#146;s fortunes
into a morass of
debt.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06060754000599">Even the
Fabian Society has acknowledged that the system is not working. In its
report, &#147;Narrowing the Gap&#148;, issued earlier this year, it
admitted that the system had faults and that tax credits were
associated with &#147;complexity and administrative problems&#148;.
Now it has a sleeper within the Treasury arguing that agenda, as the
report was launched by none other than the Economic
Secretary&#151;and where is he?</p><p><a name="06060754000600">It needs to be remembered that
this system was established to assist people on low incomes. In many
cases, it is doing precisely the opposite. It needs to be reformed in
order to continue to provide help to people who need it but without
driving them to distraction in the process. As far as the current
configuration of tax credits is concerned, the Treasury is shuffling
the deck chairs on the Titanic, with the Economic Secretary
particularly desperate to get one before they all disappear.</p><p><a name="06060754000601">Perhaps the greatest irony of
all is that the architect of this system is the Chancellor himself, who
famously said in the mid-1990s that he wanted to abolish means-testing.
Yet the current system is the apotheosis of that concept, against which
there is now an overwhelming consensus that it needs to be reformed.
The Prime Minister referred at Prime Minister&#146;s 
<br><notus-date day="7" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>7 Jun 2006 : Column 325</b><br>questions earlier this afternoon to: &#147;Working families tax
credit, which makes work pay for people.&#148;</p><p><a name="06060754000602">Working families tax credit was
abolished three years ago. That is the old system. We are debating the
new one. The Chancellor has created a system that is so complicated
that even the Prime Minister does not understand it, so what hope is
there for a single mother, who perhaps has not had a strong financial
education, living on a run-down council estate struggling to fill in
the forms and deal with the bureaucracy that the Select Committee
identified?</p><p><a name="06060754000603">The
greatest shame is that the system was the Chancellor&#146;s personal
creation. It was his pet project above all others. Yet when the day
came for him to be held to account, what did the iron Chancellor do? He
ran away. Unusually, the Government&#146;s amendment has not been
selected, so hon. Members have a clear choice. They can put up with the
shambles that is the current system, and go along with the fact that
the Chancellor invented it but would not come and defend it, or they
can join us in the Lobby and protest against a system that drives
ordinary working families to distraction. I hope that they will do the
latter.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="06060754001421">4.30

changes that they needed to make.</p><p><a name="06060754000609">The hon. Member for North
Thanet (Mr. Gale) made several things absolutely clear but I shall pick
on one of them. He said that the system was about people. I could not
agree more. He knows that I have made it clear both in private meetings
and in exchanges across the Floor that it is crucial to do what needs
to be done to take forward a basically sound policy and ensure that its
administration is right.</p><p><a name="06060754000610">My hon. Friend the Member for

<br><notus-date day="7" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>7 Jun 2006 : Column 326</b><br>be met of the changing circumstances that people experience in their

response. She made important points about child care, to which I want
to refer.</p><p><a name="06060754000611">My hon.
Friend the Member for Denton and Reddish (Andrew Gwynne) echoed the
point about the important contribution that tax credits have made in
his constituency and in constituencies throughout the
country.</p><p><a name="06060754000612">Let us be
clear: the tax credits deliver three key achievements. They improve
incentives to work, they reduce tax on low to middle income families,
they help dramatically to reduce child poverty and they have played a
major role in helping people into work and to move up the employment
ladder, ensuring that work pays over benefits.</p><p><a name="06060754000613">I am not surprised that a party
that presided over doubling child poverty when in power attaches so
little credit to those achievements. When we seek a consensus in the
Chamber&#151;the consensus to whichmy right hon. Friend the
Member for West Dunbartonshire referred&#151;it is to get all
Opposition parties to commit themselves to the principle of eradicating
child poverty and the practical means of achieving that. Every time the
Conservatives and the Liberal Democrats were challenged by Labour
Members this afternoon, they were unable to say how they would match
the huge contribution that tax credits have made to this important
debate.</p><p><a name="06060754000614">Let us remind
ourselves of that contribution. A couple with two children moving into
full-time work on the national minimum wage will be &#163;41 a week
better off, compared with &#163;34 in 1997. A lone parent&#151;and
I can assure hon. Members that they can read and write&#151;with two
children moving into full-time work on the national minimum wage will
be &#163;76 a week better off, compared with &#163;54 in 1997. A
single person without children moving into full-time work on the
national minimum wage will be &#163;58 a week better off, compared
with &#163;39 a week in 1997.</p><p><a name="06060754000615">Tax credits are central to
reducing the tax on low and middle-income families, as the recent OECD
study shows. The tax paid by a couple with two children earning
&#163;21,000 a year has fallen from 17.3 per cent. of gross earnings
in 1997 to 9.8 per cent. in 2004. That is the lowest rate in any G7
country. In the UK, a single-earner family with two children can now
earn just under two thirds of the average wage before they start to pay
any tax. Those are the benefits of tax credits. That is the
contribution that is being made by a policy that the Treasury Committee
unanimously agreed in principle was the right way to proceed. It has
reduced poverty and raised children out of living on absolute low
incomes.</p><p><a name="06060754000616">Are families
responding to this in a positive way? We have only to look at the
take-up figures to see the answer. In the first year, 93 per cent. of
families on an annual income below &#163;10,000&#151;that is low
pay by any definition&#151;claimed their entitlement, compared with
50 per cent. in the early years of family income supplement, and 57 per
cent. for family credit.</p><p><a name="06060754000617">My right hon. Friend the Member
for West Dunbartonshire asked about appeals and aboutthe
pause. On the latter point, the Departmententirely supports in
principle the ombudsman&#146;s 
<br><notus-date day="7" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>7 Jun 2006 : Column 327</b><br>recommendation to give taxpayers notice before commencing
recovery&#151;the so-called 30 days&#151;and we are considering how
we can integrate such a pause into the information technology system
without jeopardising it. On appeals, we are exploring with the
adjudicator&#146;s office the feasibility of introducing a fast-track
process to provide claimants with the timely, accurate response that my
right hon. Friend described. We have done that in close consultation
with the ombudsman, who circulated a letter to every Member of this
House on 27 March 2006
stating:</p><a name="06060754001398"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Since
I published that report, my staff and I have had regular discussions at
senior level with staff in the Revenue, including the Tax Credit Office
and the Adjudicator&#146;s
Office.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06060754000618">Those matters
are being taken forward.</p><p><a name="06060754000619">The key objective in tackling
poverty is to consider how the needs of families&#151;especially
low-income families&#151;change, and how we can respond to those
changes. We know that their incomes are volatile. More than a quarter
of households analysed by Professor John Hills had erratic and high
levels of income changes. The statistics for tax credits show
that1 million families saw their income fall between 2003 and
2004, and 700,000 of them would have been worse off under a fixed
system. We would have to bear that in mind if we went back to a fixed
award system. They would not have received the extra money that tax
credits provide for them. We need that flexibility, and of course that
means that there sometimes has to be an end of year adjustment. Let us
keep this in perspective, however. Fifty-four per cent. of the
overpayments are less than &#163;500, and 31 per cent. are less than
&#163;200.</p><p><a name="06060754000620">In 1997,
only 800,000 families received family credit; 6 million now receive tax
credits. In 1997, only 50 per cent. take-up was achieved; now take-up
is 93 per cent. among the poorest families. Today the income tax
liability of 3 million families has been effectively wiped out by tax
credits which ensure that they can use their money to spend on their
families.</p><p><a name="06060754000621">The
consensus that we seek today is one that includes the Tories and the
Liberal Democrats. We seek a commitment to the eradication of child
poverty, a commitment to recognising that people have volatile incomes,
and a commitment to willing the means. Today the Conservatives failed
in that regard. That is no surprise in the case of a party that
presided over child poverty in the
1990s.</p><p><a name="06060754000622"><i> Question

Burt (North-East Bedfordshire) (Con):</b> I beg to
move,</p><a name="06060754001399"><ul><p class="tabletext">That this House
takes note of the immense contribution to society made by those
honoured during the recent Volunteers Week and forthcoming Carers Week;
recognises and values the significant economic and social benefits
resulting from the work of volunteers and carers, often performed in
difficult circumstances requiring the most selfless qualities; further
notes the need to ensure that the fewest possible barriers are placed
before those wanting to volunteer and act as carers; believes
that</p></ul><a name="06060754001400"><ul><p class="tabletext">encouragement should be
given to all, especially the young, to consider volunteering as a
contribution to the welfare of a healthy society; and expresses its
thanks to all those who act as role models for volunteering and
caring.</p></ul><p><a name="06060754001142">I am delighted
to have the privilege of leading this afternoon&#146;s debate on a
matter close to the heart of virtually every Member. Its purpose is to
honour those involved in volunteering and caring in society by using
mainstream time on the Floor of the House to demonstrate how important
their contribution is to all hon. Members. We have therefore taken the
opportunity offered by volunteers week and carers week to do precisely
that. We want to recognise the immense, varied and significant
contribution made by individuals throughout the country who participate
in volunteering and caring and to register the extent of their
commitment and the contribution that they make.
</p><p><a name="06060754001143">I trust that we can
explore current issues facing volunteering and caring, consider the
barriers that still need to be overcome to make the most effective use
of people and their time and examine how life can be made easier for
those involved. Finally, I hope that we can look to the future and
raise issues that the recently announced Commission on the Future of
Volunteering will examine over the next 12 months. I have little doubt
that the debate will be well informed by all hon. Members and that we
will hear about the personal experiences of some of the remarkable
people we have met who are involved in these activities. I intend to
concentrate on volunteering, leaving my hon. Friend the Member for East
Worthing and Shoreham (Tim Loughton) to talk in greater detail about
the work of carers when he winds up the
debate.</p><p><a name="06060754001144">There is no
typical volunteer in this country. People who give up their time to
help others come from all sections of the community, are of all ages
and come from all cultural and ethnic backgrounds. Despite the dreadful
story in the newspapers this morning of the poor child left calling for
help in the middle of the road after being struck by a car, the
instinct to help one&#146;s neighbour is one of the deepest human
ones
imaginable.</p><p><a name="06060754001145">Members of
Parliament have many privileges, as journalists are frequently keen to
remind us, but one of the privileges rarely reported is the opportunity
that we have to observe some of the finer instincts of members of our
community. A typical MP&#146;s diary of time spent in the
constituency will reveal visits to those involved in some of the most
selfless activities, which all too rarely command national headlines.
Our local newspapers make an excellent, if too often unsung,
contribution, and often provide the recognition necessary to enable a
community to appreciate that the picture of national 
<br><notus-date day="7" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>7 Jun 2006 : Column 333</b><br>collapse&#151;an inference too often drawn from some appalling
incident&#151;is not the reality of life for
everyone.</p><p><a name="06060754001146">Before we
consider individual stories, let us gain some sense of how important
the voluntary sector is to this country. I am indebted to the National
Council for Voluntary Organisations and Stuart Etherington for their
statistical analysis and work on this matter. The latest information
available shows that the voluntary and community sector, as best it can
be defined, has an income of more than &#163;26 billion. Its work
force is sizeable, at some 600,000, but the number who
volunteer&#151;defined as giving unpaid help through groups, clubs
and organisations to benefit other people or the environment&#151;is
staggering. Some 29 per cent. of our community take part in formal
volunteering at least once a month and 44 per cent. at least once a
year. Half of our population has volunteered, formally or informally,
at least once a month, which is equivalent to more than 20 million
people in England and
Wales.</p><p><a name="06060754001147"><b><a name="06060754002261">Derek
Conway (Old Bexley and Sidcup) (Con):</b> My hon.
Friend&#146;s support for the voluntary sector is renowned in the

that volunteers in the animal welfare sector&#151;especially the
10,000 who do so for the organisation to which I am connected, Cats
Protection&#151;make a commitment not once a week or once a month
but, because they are dealing with live animals, every day? Those who
volunteer to help animals, especially cats and dogs, make a
seven-day-a-week commitment, and it is all the more
remarkablefor
it.</p><p><a name="06060754001148"><b><a name="06060754002262">Alistair

volunteers and carers are involved. It is remarkable that hardly any
facet of our national and community life does not involve selfless
giving by people, and my hon. Friend&#146;s valuable work and
expertise in his area is recognised. It is right for him to say what he

diminish the work done by a wide variety of organisations, and I am
sure that the hon. Gentleman will mention many of them, but will he
recognise that 26 per cent. of all volunteers work in sport?
Some6 million people volunteer in sport regularly, and I speak
with a slight vested interest as chair of the National Strategic
Partnership for Volunteering in Sport, which brings them all together.
The hon. Gentleman could also give us some indication of his own
prowess at sport with his run earlier today in the Westminster

recall that I was a minute ahead of the hon. Gentleman this afternoon,
in an event graced again by an astonishing performance by the Minister
for Employment and Welfare Reform, the hon. Member for East
Renfrewshire (Mr. Murphy), who did the mile for Sport Relief in 5
minutes and 35 seconds&#151;an extremely creditable
performance.</p><br><notus-date day="7" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>7 Jun 2006 : Column 334</b><br><p><a name="06060754001151">Colleagues will know from their
constituency work that remarkable things can be done with sport. It
touches all parts of society, including the most needy people. Time
given up for sport is exceptionally valuable, but that brings us to one
of the problems of modern life. People used to live and work in more or
less the same area, finishing work at a reasonable time and going home
for tea at 5 o&#146;clock. They were therefore able to go out and
support a sports club or train a team in the evening. These days,
however, people work further away and get home much later. They are
more tired and more committed to their work, so it is harder for them
to offer the support for sport that the hon. Member for Loughborough
(Mr. Reed) mentioned. We should pay a special tribute to those who work
with youngsters in sports teams and who thus make an immense
contribution.</p><p><a name="06060754001152"><b><a name="06060754002265">Mr.
Nigel Evans (Ribble Valley) (Con):</b> My hon. Friend has
visited my constituency several times, and knows that it is a rural
area that does not have as many sporting facilities as other places.
However, we are rich in mums and dads and other volunteers prepared to
give up their time in the middle of the week and at weekends, in all
sorts of weather. I am thinking of George Hibbert of the Clitheroe
Wolves, who helps more than 450 young boys and girls to play football
on a regular basis, and of Farouk Hussain, who gives up his time in the
middle of the week to help youngsters play cricket. Without such
people, young people in rural areas would not have the same opportunity
to play sport.</p><p><a name="06060754001153"><b><a name="06060754002266">Alistair
Burt:</b> My hon. Friend is right. He makes the point that
voluntary activity to help disadvantaged people is not confined to
urban areas but is also effective in rural areas. He mentions the time
commitment required of those who work and train with youngsters in the
way described by the hon. Member for Loughborough. I pay tribute to the
people in my hon. Friend&#146;s constituency who devote so much time
to that&#151;and especially to those who are working to build up yet
another wonderful Lancashire cricket team that will win more
trophies.</p><p><a name="06060754001154">What is the
economic worth of voluntary activity, quite apart from the personal and
social benefits that it confers? People who volunteer formally tend to
spend about eight hours a month on voluntary work. That adds up to 1.9
billion hours of work&#151;about the same as that done by 1 million
full-time workers. At the national average wage, that contribution is
worth&#163;22 billion a year.</p><p><a name="06060754001155">There is no possibility that
that amount of effort could be taken over by the state or people in the
paid sector. It could not be afforded, so the voluntary contribution
that people make constitutes an exceptional addition to this
country&#146;s national life. We should all salute and celebrate
it.</p><p><a name="06060754001156"><b><a name="06060754002267">Mr.
Gary Streeter (South-West Devon) (Con):</b> My hon. Friend has
set out the undoubted economic benefit accruing from voluntary work,
but does he agree that the long-term, one-on-one personal care devoted
to some of the most vulnerable people in our society by people in the
voluntary sector&#151;including but not exclusively those in the
faith communities&#151; 
<br><notus-date day="7" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>7 Jun 2006 : Column 335</b><br>could never be replicated by the state? The voluntary sector provides a
great saving, but the quality of the care that is given could never be
delivered by the state, no matter how well it was intended. Is not that
the real benefit of what the voluntary sector
provides?</p><p><a name="06060754001157"><b><a name="06060754002268">Alistair
Burt:</b> There are some remarkable examples of the personal
care provided by people in both the voluntary and state sectors. Those
of our public sector workers who work with the most distressed
individuals make a substantial contribution, but there is something
special about people who do something that is not part of their job.
Volunteering adds an extra dimension to their lives, as we have all
seen.</p><p><a name="06060754001158">For two years in
the 1990s, I had the great honour to be the Minister with
responsibility for people with disabilities. In that role, I came into
contact with some exceptional people. I met people struggling with
disabilities and overcoming circumstances that would be unimaginable to
most of us, and I also met their carers, who were prepared to put in an
extraordinary amount of time. My hon. Friend the Member for South-West
Devon (Mr. Streeter) is absolutely right to recognise the contribution
that such people make.</p><p><a name="06060754001159">I have mentioned the economic
impact of those who work in the voluntary sectors, but I now turn to
carers specifically. About 6 million people in the UK look after
someone who is frail, sick or disabled. The care that they provide is
unpaid. Many do not identify themselves as carers because the care that
they give is to a family member. Three in five of us will become a
carer at some stage in our lifetime and 301,000 people are becoming
carers each year. If each carer worked for 20 hours a week&#151;1.25
million carers currently work for more than 50 hours a week and the
Department of Health estimates that more than 400,000 carers combine a
full-time job with more than 20 hours of caring a week&#151;that
collective output would dwarf the NHS&#146;s 1 million-strong work
force. That is how much we depend on our extraordinary
carers.</p><p><a name="06060754001160"><b><a name="06060754002269">Mr.
Michael Wills (North Swindon) (Lab):</b> Everybody in the
House shares the sentiments that are being expressed on both sides of
the House. I certainly agree with the hon. Member for South-West Devon
(Mr. Streeter) about the special nature of voluntary care, but I hope
that the hon. Member for North-East Bedfordshire (Alistair Burt) agrees
that it is important to remember that people who work in the public
services as a job also give unparalleled care, dedication and
service.</p><p><a name="06060754001161"><b><a name="06060754002270">Alistair
Burt:</b> Absolutely. I hope that I made that clear when I
responded to my hon. Friend the Member for South-West Devon. There
should not be any sense of competition. We know that a number of people
feel a calling to work in the public service. Some of us do that
through politics, and we all know people in our constituencies who do
it, whether in the health service, teaching or care. Some people feel
called to give their lives in an extraordinary way and do so through
their work; some people, because they work in a different sector, give
their lives in a different way. There is no sense of
competition.</p><br><notus-date day="7" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>7 Jun 2006 : Column 336</b><br><p><a name="06060754001162">That builds to an extraordinary
national sense. We are talking about something that makes us the
country that we are. That is why the story in the newspaper this
morning was so shocking. It goes against everything in all our natures,
and in the natures of the vast majority of people we come across, that
someone in distress could be left. That still makes one stop and think
when one travels abroad to a country where the extent of poverty is so
great and the cheapness of human life is rather greater. One sees
children in some degree of agony being left on the side of the road
because no one can afford to care. That should not happen here. We
build into our national life that sense of people being
involved&#151;either through their working lives or their voluntary
lives.</p><p><a name="06060754001163"><b><a name="06060754002271">Ms

the hit-and-run driver could not be bothered to stop? That is
despicable beyond words. We do not want to believe that that type of
behaviour could take place in Great Britain
today.</p><p><a name="06060754001164"><b><a name="06060754002272">Alistair

sign of hope that the national reaction has been so intense and that we
all recognise that behaviour as abhorrent. The worry is that, over the
years, experience has tended to show that a dreadful story one year
might become commonplace the next. We are all striving to avoid
that.</p><p><a name="06060754001165">I know that a
number of Members will seek to catch your eye, Mr. Deputy Speaker, to
talk about people in their constituency or their experiences of
volunteering with others, so that the House can get a flavour of what
is behind the statistics. Volunteers week has been taken up by
colleagues on this side of the House&#151;as I am sure that it has
been on the other side&#151;as a particular opportunity to take part
in or support voluntary activities. My colleagues have been involved in
quite a range of activities. My hon. Friend the Member for North-West
Norfolk (Mr. Bellingham) has been helping West Norfolk Disability
Information Service. My hon. Friend the Member for
Beckenham(Mrs. Lait) is visiting her Sure Start project in
Penge to catch up on progress. My hon. Friend the Member for Sutton
Coldfield (Mr. Mitchell) sent round a helpful note of international
development organisations that were looking for support and he is
contributing some time. My hon. Friend the Member for North
Thanet(Mr. Gale) has volunteered to help FARM-Africa.
Colleagues have done a range of things.</p><p><a name="06060754001166">My hon. Friend the Member for
Meriden(Mrs. Spelman), my boss, has given me information about
supporting a trip to Germany by a football team&#151;this one
supported by newspapers&#151;from the Birmingham and Solihull Mental
Health NHS Trust, which comprises those with mental health
difficulties. They are playing in Germany in a round-robin tournament
that involves other teams comprising fans supporting Germany or
England. My hon. Friend lent a hand when some of that squad showed the
giant banner that they have created in this country, which they intend
to give to their German hosts when they go to Germany. All of us in

will be held here on 27 June to honour those in our constituencies who
do good work as volunteers, many of whom are elderly. Those people
represent the British spirit and culture. However, is my hon. Friend
also aware of the great problem that Members have in choosing one
individual to receive the award as a hero from so many worthy,

far as my experience of support volunteering week is concerned&#151;I
raise this as an example of something in which we are all
involved&#151;I express my thanks to Gary Bishop, who is a church
leader in Openshaw, Manchester, in the constituency of the hon. Member
for Manchester, Central (Tony Lloyd). Gary is involved in the Eden
project, which is a Christian-based initiative that has been operating
in Manchester for several years. The project is especially
extraordinary because it has asked young people to commit up to five
years of their lives to live and work in some of the most deprived
communities in the city. That enables them to become part of the
community so that they can stimulate and support the personal and human
development that is often necessary in places where there has been
little family stability and where hopes and aspirations can be low,
with self-esteem lower
still.</p><p><a name="06060754001172">The name of Bob
Holman is known to many hon. Members because of his work on poverty. He
identified that one of the key features of estates in difficulty is
that when anyone gets a job or tries to improve themselves, they move
out of the estate, thus depriving it of natural community leaders and
people who might provide stability and focus for others. His life of
commitment in Easterhouse in Glasgow has been the 
<br><notus-date day="7" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>7 Jun 2006 : Column 338</b><br>inspiration for many, including my right hon. Friend the Member for
Chingford and Woodford Green(Mr. Duncan Smith), whose work on
social justice is proving to be a significant contribution to
politics.</p><p><a name="06060754001173">Members
of the Eden project are working in Manchester in much the same way. Two
of the estates in the area are classified as the 11th and 12th most
deprived areas out of the 32,482 in the United Kingdom. Through a
series of projects&#151;including supporting mothers and children,
home visiting, parents survival and family intervention, working with
youths in clubs and on the streets, and providing after-school clubs,
Sunday supper clubs and other opportunities&#151;the Eden project and
those who work with it are putting their time and effort into
unglamorous and difficult work. It can be harder to ask volunteers to
give their time to some projects than others. There are six staff, but
30 volunteers. Eachof their stories is inspirational, but they
would acknowledge that they are only representative of many more people
working throughout the
country.</p><p><a name="06060754001174">Pete had the
call to move from Leicester to Manchester to be involved in the
community. He works in a Sure Start project and gives spare time to the
community. Hannah is married to Gary. She came to Manchester, where she
qualified as a nurse. Her daily work is as a district nurse in the area
of need, but she still finds time to volunteer as a family support
worker, when she works mostly with people with drug or alcohol misuse
problems.</p><p><a name="06060754001175">Unlike those
who have moved from other areas to Manchester, Sinead, at 18, has
always lived in the community. She got involved with Eden when it began
to work with her and her friends, and now she is qualified as a nursery
nurse, but spends extra time volunteering with families and children in
the
community.</p><p><a name="06060754001176">Shannon, at
15, is even younger and is still at school, yet she has learned that
she has a gift for working with and leading other youngsters in the
area. I think that the project, and the work being done by Andy
Hawthorn and others in Manchester, is remarkable, given the commitment
that they have shown in becoming embedded in an area.</p><p><a name="06060754001177">What has
brought these volunteers to work in that place is no different from
what has brought others to work in other areas&#151;they recognise
the need to help others. At the same time, they say how much they
themselves have grown and developed through contributing voluntarily:
getting involved with a simple and often repeated statement. They aim
to ensure that their work is sustainable. Being able to lead youngsters
such as Shannon and Sinead into positions of responsibility is a key
objective. It is not merely that an elastoplast is being applied to the
wound. These volunteers are participating in long-term care and
recovery.</p><p><a name="06060754001178">Although
the multiple problems that the estate and those who live on it may face
can be daunting at times, volunteers gain strength from working with
each other and supporting each other through difficult times. I suspect
that that is a common feature among those who work in difficult areas
of society.</p><p><a name="06060754001179"><b><a name="06060754002277">Mr.

we do it and we go away&#151;the commitment shown by the volunteers
whom we are talking about is that they live in the communities in which
they aim to serve. Does the hon. Gentleman agree that we should try to
replicate such a model as far as possible? It is not something that we
can force, but would not it be great if the hope that such Christian
groups have achieved in being part of the communities in which they
serve could be models for the
future?</p><p><a name="06060754001180"><b><a name="06060754002278">Alistair
Burt:</b> The hon. Gentleman makes a good point. The
commitment shown is extraordinary. The number of people who can make
such a commitment is limited, but there is no doubt about what these
people provide by physically being present in an area and staying in
it. Those who live in some of the most difficult places in our society
get used to seeing other people for a short period. A social worker
moves on; someone who is trusted takes a different job. There is
nothing wrong with that, but the more that people can stay and be
consistently identified as points of stability in difficult areas, the
better. If more projects can see that as a model, that will make a
tremendous
contribution.</p><p><a name="06060754001181"><b><a name="06060754002279">Patrick
Hall (Bedford) (Lab):</b> The hon. Gentleman has referred to
some young people involved in volunteering. Is that not an important
point to be made in the debate? So much media coverage of young people
is focused on antisocial behaviour, hoodies and all the associated
problems. I acknowledge that these problems exist, but would it not be
appropriate to have a more balanced view of young people, so many of
whom, especially through school, perhaps, work hard to raise money and
raise the profile of many issues? For example, in Bedfordshire we know
of the tsunami appeal, Work Africa, African Children and teaching and
work on AIDS. Is not that an important aspect of volunteering? Young
people can involve themselves in thinking beyond their immediate needs
and wants and take on board the needs and wants of
others.</p><p><a name="06060754001182"><b><a name="06060754002280">Alistair
Burt:</b> The hon. Gentleman correctly identifies one of the
privileges that we have that all too often others do not. We are lucky
in that we see many youngsters&#151;good youngsters in our
community&#151;who far outweigh the number of those who cause
difficulties. We are lucky enough to see them at work. I pay tribute to
our local newspapers, which tend to highlight good youngsters rather
more than national newspapers. It is always easy to criticise and to
pick up the things that go wrong. Nationally, to value our youngsters
who are working so hard, would do us all a great deal of
good.</p><p><a name="06060754001183"><b><a name="06060754002281">David

neighbours has worked again. The hon. Gentleman anticipates the next
section of my speech, which will deal with some of the barriers and
problems that affect those who volunteer. He is right to raise the
issue and I shall now focus on it. I say a final thank you to those who
I spent time with on Sunday and Monday, to the mums and
toddlers&#146; clubs, to Nicky who reintroduced me to Play-Doh after
many years of absence, as my own children have grown up. I thank all of
those people in that community as an example of those who are doing so
much.</p><p><a name="06060754001185">As the hon.
Gentleman has just said, there are barriers to volunteering. I shall
touch on them briefly, as time is short. Surprisingly, one of those
barriers is disagreement about the value of volunteering, as not
everyone believes in the importance of volunteering. The
&#147;NCVO&#146;s Vision for the Future&#148;, which was
published in September 2005, said that in many cases volunteers have
accepted the role of junior partner when, in fact, they should have
been prepared to make their case more strongly. It
said:</p><a name="06060754001401"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;We have
a tendency to undervalue ourselves, particularly our value to
government. If we genuinely believe that we should have a voice on the
biggest issues facing our society then we need to have the courage of
our convictions. We need to break through the boundaries that others
place around us.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06060754001186">We do
not undervalue the sector, and it is important that we ensure that
volunteering is not considered an amateur pursuit. People who volunteer
should be proud to do so. They deserve our respect, and our debate
should highlight that.</p><p><a name="06060754001187">Regulation and bureaucracy are
more difficult problems. The delicate issue of checks by the Criminal
Records Bureau gives rise to a clash of principles, as no one would
wish volunteers with access to some of the most personal aspects of
people&#146;s lives to misuse that confidence. People who rely on the
services of volunteers should be sure about them, and a cloud of
suspicion should not hang over them. CRB checks provide clearance, but
the bureaucracy involved is sometimes overbearing. Many volunteering
organisations do not know when or why they need to check volunteers, or
when they do not need to do so.</p><p><a name="06060754001188">There are different levels of
CRB checks, and it is not always certain which level is necessary. My
wife is not an untypical example: she has three separate CRB
clearances&#151;two at a high level, and one at a lower level. She
chairs the Bedford branch of Home Start&#151;an excellent scheme that
assists vulnerable families nationwide&#151;as well as working in the
local church and at a school with children. A total of &#163;100 has
been spent on obtaining those clearances. That expenditure is
multiplied for volunteers throughout the country, but it could be used
for other purposes. At least two of the checks on my wife were
unnecessary, and there should be a platform of check on which to build
if someone needs to move from a lower-level clearance to a higher-level
one. The cost and the obscure nature of the checks are a barrier to
volunteers 
<br><notus-date day="7" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>7 Jun 2006 : Column 341</b><br>and voluntary groups. They are a barrier, too, to developing projects
that involve contact with vulnerable
groups.</p><p><a name="06060754001189">That problem,
among others, was picked up by the Better Regulation Task Force in its
report of November 2005, &#147;Better Regulations for Civil
Society&#151; Making Life Easier for Those Who Help Others&#148;.
Its seventh recommendation dealt specifically with the CRB checks, and
I should be grateful if Ministers told us, either in response to my
opening contribution or at the end of the debate, whether we can expect
an explanation for the slow progress in responding to those
recommendations. I have been in touch with the Better Regulation
Commission, which is disappointed by the time it has taken to receive a
response. We all appreciate that the Home Office is under pressure, but
it would be helpful to reform CRB checks and implement the
recommendations of the taskforce, so we would appreciate a progress
report.</p>

<p><a name="06060754001190"><b><a name="06060754002283">Mr.
Graham Stuart (Beverley and Holderness) (Con):</b> My hon.
Friend&#146;s remarks on the CRB checks are timely, as a few days ago
I received a letter from a constituent who recently was subject to
seven separate checks. That is not unusual, as many volunteers
volunteer for many organisations, so any steps that can be taken to
ensure that that needless duplication is ended would be
welcome.</p><p><a name="06060754001191"><b><a name="06060754002284">Alistair
Burt:</b> My hon. Friend is quite right. I cannot foresee any
objections to his proposal&#151;it is simply a matter of streamlining
the system and making sure that each individual has a single reference
number so that checks are carried through from one voluntary role to
another. If they need to move up a level, they should be able to do so.
The problem that my hon. Friend highlighted has been experienced by
other people, so we must deal with it.</p><p><a name="06060754001192">Closely related to issues
opened up by the problem of CRB checks is the general culture of risk
aversion, which now affects many organisations working with the public.
In an excellent speech last year, Justin Davis Smith, the deputy chief
executive of Volunteering England, addressed the problem directly. He
said that</p><a name="06060754001402"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;we must avoid
the temptation to overstate the case, but the warning signs are
there...a volunteer movement without risk is a contradiction in
terms and one not worth having.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06060754001193">Volunteering England surveyed various
organisations about the issue of whether compensation culture was a
myth or reality. Nine in 10 voluntary organisations believed that the
UK had developed a compensation culture.</p><a name="06060754001403"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Not
surprisingly,&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06060754001194">Justin
Davis Smith
continues,</p><a name="06060754001404"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;given this
belief in the shift towards a compensation culture, a majority of
organisations&#151;some two thirds&#151;felt that issues of risk in
relation to volunteering had become more of a problem in recent
years.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06060754001195">One result is the
difficulty in recruiting volunteers. One in five organisations reported
to Volunteering England that volunteers had stopped volunteering for
them because of risk and liability
fears.</p><p><a name="06060754001196">The good news
is that many organisations are coming to terms with this change in
culture and want to fight back and put in place preventive strategies
that 
<br><notus-date day="7" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>7 Jun 2006 : Column 342</b><br>allow them to continue to operate, despite the sense of risk.
Politicians of all parties should work closely with them to do whatever
we can to remove whatever fears are unreasonable. Risk management
policies and strategies may seem tedious, but they can be reassuring
and effective. Organisations share good practice among themselves, and
Volunteering England&#146;s own risk project funded by the Home
Office is looking to develop a set of tools to help volunteer-involving
agencies to develop their risk management policies. We collectively
need to ensure that no more than is reasonable is demanded of
organisations in the voluntary
sector.</p><p><a name="06060754001197">A less high
profile issue but one that is just as real is the increased
responsibility being attached to trustees and governors. Not too long
ago, those were honorary positions often held by retired professionals
who cast a benevolent eye over governance and financial
matters&#151;but no longer. Being held liable for significant
financial sums or being embroiled in quite serious employment
difficulties has made those jobs much more difficult and, for some, not
worth the candle. We must make it easier for people to volunteer for
such positions. It might be right to ask whether it is truly necessary
to demand exactly the same rigorous standards in every organisation as
might be expected from a major plc or an
Enron.</p><p><a name="06060754001198">Other problems
that colleagues may wish to address when they get a chance to speak
include the problem of recruiting people who are older, making sure
there is no age discrimination, watching out for disability
discrimination, and making sure that the pattern of funding is
compatible with the work of voluntary organisations. All too many
complain of the short-term funding problem. I was speaking to a charity
for the homeless this morning and was told that it was involved in 47
local contracts with 16 different authorities, of which only one
contract lasted for longer than a year. It is not possible to work that
way. We are trying to work in a different way in the public sector, and
I hope that that will extend more to voluntary
bodies.</p><p><a name="06060754001199">We need to
make sure that everyone from all sections of society can contribute. It
is true that those from a higher social class&#151;a higher financial
background&#151;tend to be more involved in volunteering than others.
Looking for ways to make sure that we break down the barriers and that
people can afford to give time and effort to voluntary organisations is
extremely important. We must continue to do
that.</p><p><a name="06060754001200">Finally, looking
ahead, on 29 March Baroness Julia Neuberger launched the Commission on
the Future of Volunteering. Following on from the success of volunteers
year last year and the Russell Commission, over the next 12 months the
commission will examine a range of issues, some of which I have touched
on, to try and ensure that volunteering has a secure base for the
future.</p><p><a name="06060754001201">Baroness
Neuberger recognises, as do many others, that volunteering has never
seemed as important as it does today, and is keen that the heightened
interest of political parties should not result in party or Government
takeover of voluntary activity. I can assure her from the Conservative
Benches that there is no intention or aim of that happening. We
recognise, as I am sure does the Minister, that volunteers offer a 
<br><notus-date day="7" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>7 Jun 2006 : Column 343</b><br>valuable non-partisan service which he appreciates in government, and
which we will equally appreciate when we sit on the Government
Benches.</p><p><a name="06060754001202">One of the
key areas that we will be looking at is how we encourage young people
into more voluntary activity. There is already quite a high level of
participation, but as the Eden project shows, we want to encourage
more. Growing people into voluntary organisations in their own areas is
very valuable. I pay particular tribute to the Biggleswade sea cadets,
of which I happen to be president. I have seen them being exceptionally
active in the local community, and so many of those who have been in
the sea cadets go on to give their time back to the local area and to
the sea cadets and other voluntary organisations. The benefit to a
small market town can only be imagined. When that is spread across the
whole country, one sees how valuable the work can
be.</p><p><a name="06060754001203">We all have our
stories about the value of carers and volunteers. We have seen them in
every circumstance. We have seen them working abroad to teach, relieve
pain and suffering or protect the environment. We have seen them at
home, from joyful participation in local events in their communities to
sitting down with hurt and miserable children with the direst of
backgrounds, but who suddenly have hope and aspiration as a result of a
kind word and skilled advice. From all of us in this place, to all of
them, wherever they are, you have our hearty
thanks.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="06060754001423">5.34
pm</h5><p><a name="06060754001204"><b><a name="06060754002285">The
Parliamentary Secretary, Cabinet Office (Edward Miliband):</b>
It is a pleasure to follow the hon. Member for North-East Bedfordshire
(Alistair Burt). He spoke as someone who cares passionately about
carers and volunteering, and he will no doubt make an important
contribution to the Neuberger commission, the results of which we look
forward
to.</p><p><a name="06060754001205">I
have been in my job as Minister with responsibility for the third
sector in the Cabinet Office for a month or so, and I am delighted to
have this opportunity to set out the Government&#146;s approach and
future plans. We have good reason to be optimistic about the ethic of
volunteering in this country. Next year, the new Office of the Third
Sector will be investing &#163;65 million a year directly in the
infrastructure of volunteering programmes. Millennium Volunteers saw a
transformation of youth volunteering in this country, engaging almost a
quarter of a million young people. Today 20.4 million men and women in
our country volunteer regularly, up from18.4 million in 2001,
a rise in both formal and informal
volunteering.</p><p><a name="06060754001206">We need
to go further. We have just launched V, the independent body that will
build on the work of the Millennium Volunteers and is tasked with
recruiting a million more youth volunteers. For carers too, there is
more to do. There are more resources and better legislation, and the
Under-Secretary of State for Health, my hon. Friend the Member for
Bury, South (Mr. Lewis), who has responsibility for social care, will
have more to say about that when he replies to the debate.</p><br><notus-date day="7" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>7 Jun 2006 : Column 344</b><br><p><a name="06060754001207">For my part, I want to focus on
the Government&#146;s approach to volunteering, which is based on
three principles. The first is that volunteering, including mentoring,
is the bedrock of our society. The second is that the Government have
an enabling role to play, investing in organisations with the expertise
to make the best use of resources and breaking down barriers to
volunteering, and I will deal with some of the points that the hon.
Gentleman raised on that. The third&#151;this is important&#151;is
that volunteering should be seen as complementary to state action, not
a substitutefor
it.</p><p><a name="06060754001208">I will deal first
with the role that volunteering and mentoring play in our society.
Almost 50 years ago, William Beveridge published a report&#151;not
his most famous&#151;entitled &#147;Voluntary Action&#148; on the
role of the voluntary sector in society. One phrase in it seems
particularly apt as we meet in this House today. Voluntary action, he
wrote, expressed</p><a name="06060754001405"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;the
driving power of social
conscience&#148;.</p></ul><p><a name="06060754001209">I
spent the first day of volunteers week last Thursday visiting and
volunteering at different organisations, and for me they showed that
driving power in action. They included the Whitechapel mission, serving
breakfast to the homeless; Live magazine in Brixton, which is produced
for and by some of the most disadvantaged young people in south London;
the British Trust for Conservation Volunteers, with its 140,000
volunteers across the UK, which is improving public spaces all round
Britain; and Sixty Plus, in Kensington and Chelsea, which brings
together young people and older
citizens.</p><p><a name="06060754001210">The
Parliamentary Secretary, Cabinet Office, my hon. Friend the Member for
Wolverhampton, South-East (Mr. McFadden), volunteered for the excellent
senior citizens&#146; link line project in Bilston in his
constituency, to which I pay tribute today, and the Minister for the
Cabinet Office, my right hon. Friend the Member for North-West Durham
(Hilary Armstrong), visited a women&#146;s aid project and
volunteered there this
morning.</p><p><a name="06060754001211">What united
the volunteers in those diverse organisations was both the individual
fulfilment that people got out of their volunteering and the difference
that they were making to their communities, as those to whom I spoke
confirmed. As the hon. Gentlemanand others have said, we see
that all around the country, from the millions of volunteer sports
coaches, to the hundreds of thousands of school governors, to the many
thousands of volunteers who campaign for the causes in which they
believe.</p><p><a name="06060754001212">The
Government, of course, do not create volunteers, and it is important to
remember that, but they do have an enabling role, which takes me to the
second principle of our approach. That is partly seen in the enabling
role of the Government investing in our volunteering infrastructure,
and I want to talk about our future plans in that regard.</p><p><a name="06060754001213">Today, 47 per cent. of young
people volunteer at least once a year. In the ways that they
contribute&#151;my hon. Friend the Member for Bedford (Patrick Hall)
made this point&#151;they are a living contradiction to the
stereotype of yobbishness with which too many young people are branded
today. It is the responsibility of the media&#151;which we often like
to criticise&#151;but also of 
<br><notus-date day="7" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>7 Jun 2006 : Column 345</b><br>politicians, to represent a balanced picture of young people. We want
many more young people to have the chance to volunteer&#151;1 million
more young people over five years. We know that volunteering enables
young people to develop new skills outside school and broaden their
horizons. By working with the third sector, public services and the
private sector, our aim is to transform the number of young people who
get involved in volunteering in their
communities.</p><p><a name="06060754001214"><b><a name="06060754002286">Mr.
David Burrowes (Enfield, Southgate) (Con):</b> Will the
Minister visit Enfield, where there is a shining example of young
people engaging in volunteering? Ofsted has lauded youth action
volunteering in Enfield as a unique and valuable scheme, which sends
600 people to 230 placements each year. Those people all do 15 hours a
week working in a variety of areas, not least the Leonard Cheshire
home, which I visited this
morning.</p><p><a name="06060754001215"><b><a name="06060754002287">Edward

which means that I accept all invitations. I am therefore delighted to
accept the hon. Gentleman&#146;s invitation and look forward to
visiting Enfield. That said, I fear that another invitation is
approaching.</p><p><a name="06060754001216"><b><a name="06060754002288">Mr.
Charles Walker (Broxbourne) (Con):</b> I have a two-for-one
offer for the Minister, because my seat is next to that of my hon.
Friend the Member for Enfield, Southgate (Mr. Burrowes). Will the
Minister join me in recognising that every pound given to voluntary and
charitable organisations generates huge value&#151;sometimes 10 or 20
times the value of the donation?</p><p><a name="06060754001217"><b><a name="06060754002289">Edward
Miliband:</b> I agree with the hon. Gentleman and will look
kindly on his invitation. Gift aid has improved the situation on tax
relief, and the sum provided by the taxpayer has increased from
&#163;200 million to &#163;600 million. We all know about the huge
impact of volunteering, and I shall discuss that matter
later.</p><p><a name="06060754001218">V is a new,
independent organisation, and it embodies the Government&#146;s
enabling role. It will be led by young people through the youth
advisory board, V20; it will be shaped by the needs of young people;
and it will fund thousands of full-time youth volunteering
opportunities, as well as many thousands more part-time opportunities.
The Government have committed up to &#163;100 million over three
years to fund increases in youth volunteering through V, and I am
pleased to say that 26 companies have already pledged their commitment
to the project, contributing a total of more than &#163;10
million.</p><p><a name="06060754001219">We want more

voluntary capacity on cardiac risk for the young and who provide

discussing young people, but many ancients work very hard in the

because I was about to discuss older volunteers. Yesterday, I was
fortunate enough to attend the Help the Aged and the Volunteering
Initiative in the Third Age conference, where two older volunteers
talked about their amazing work. We look forward to the VITA report in
the autumn, which will address what more we can do to promote the role
of older volunteers. I agree with my hon. Friend that older volunteers
play an important role.</p><p><a name="06060754001223"><b><a name="06060754002294">Mr.

local council licensing departments are making a perverse
interpretation of this law, and will he encourage local councils to
adopt a helpful attitude instead of discouraging such
events?</p><br><notus-date day="7" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>7 Jun 2006 : Column 347</b><br><p><a name="06060754001229"><b><a name="06060754002300">Edward

me the chance to say that a committee under Sir Les Elton is
considering the whole issue of the implementation of the Licensing Act,
particularly as it affects village halls and other venues.</p><p><a name="06060754001230">There are different rules and
procedures for those that serve alcohol as against those that do not,
and it is very important that they are implemented properly. I take the
hon. Gentleman&#146;s point and would be happy to talk further with
him.</p><p><a name="06060754001231">As I said, we are
working with VITA, but it is also important to give volunteering
opportunities to those who are excluded and under-represented in terms
of those opportunities, including disabled people, black and ethnic
minorities and other socially excluded groups. I can announce today
that we are allocating&#163;3 million for a new partnership
between the Media Trust and organisations representing disabled, black
and ethnic minority and socially excluded groups to try to open up
volunteering opportunities for
them.</p><p><a name="06060754001232">The
Government&#146;s role is not only about improving the volunteering
infrastructure, but about removing barriers to volunteering. The new
Office of the Third Sector, based in the Cabinet Office, offers an
opportunity for greater co-ordination within Government of the effort
to break down those barriers, three of which have been cited in
particular as preventing volunteering. First, there is the deterrent
effect of potential legal action for incidents involving volunteers.
Several hon. Members raised that issue. Tomorrow, the Compensation Bill
receives its Second Reading in the House. It represents an important
response to concerns that have been raised, including in the private
Member&#146;s Bill introduced in 2004 by the hon. Member for
Canterbury (Mr. Brazier). Part 1 of the Compensation Bill makes it
clear that when considering a claim of negligence, courts will be able
to consider the wider social value of the activity. That will help to
ensure that voluntary organisations are not discouraged from taking on
volunteers by the threat of legal action. It has been widely welcomed
by many organisations that use volunteers. For example, the Scout
Association has said that it welcomes the proposals.</p><a name="06060754001321"><p>Secondly,
there is the operation of the Criminal Records Bureau, which was
mentioned by the hon. Member for North-East Bedfordshire and by the
hon. Member for Beverley and Holderness (Mr. Stuart), who is no longer
in his place. Every year, about 500,000 checks on volunteers are
processed by the CRB free of charge as a result of a decision made by
this Government. That is a considerably higher number of applications
than was expected. There have been concerns about delays in processing,
but I am pleased to say that the situation has improved, with 93 per
cent. of standard checks completed within two weeks and 88 per cent. of
enhanced checks completed within four weeks. Of course, we recognise
that there is scope for further improvement in this area, and we will
continue to consult the sector and work with the CRB to bring about
improvements. We are working on several matters, but I believe that the
situation has
improved.</p><p><a name="06060754001233">Thirdly,
concerns have been raised, including in the Russell report, about the
benefit rules being a possible deterrent to volunteering. On
examination, it turned out that many of those anxieties related to the
implementation of the rules rather than the rules themselves. For
example, those on jobseeker&#146;s allowance can volunteer 
<br><notus-date day="7" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>7 Jun 2006 : Column 348</b><br>provided that they continue to look for work and can start a job within
a week. That is why the Government have launched an updated guide to
volunteering while on benefits. The task is now to ensure that it is
implemented locally in jobcentres.</p><p><a name="06060754001234">A final part of the enabling
role of Government is to build an ethos of volunteering&#151;the
sense that we all have a responsibility to put something back into our
society. That must start in schools, and that is why the Government
have already piloted the active citizens in schools programme and are
determined to do more to embed volunteering in the citizenship
curriculum. We are also working with the private sector, through
Business in the Community, and with the public sector to open up more
volunteering opportunities and persuade more people to
volunteer.</p><p><a name="06060754001235">The third
principle of the Government&#146;s approach is that the role of the
third sector in general, and volunteers in particular, must be seen as
a supplement to and not a substitute for Government funding of public
services. The relationship of state and the third sector has always
been difficult for our society&#151;we should be honest about
that&#151;and, indeed, for any major advanced industrial society that
has a welfare state. The third sector can reach out to the
disadvantaged, it is close to the communities that it serves and it has
a deserved reputation for innovation. As we have already heard in the
debate, the role of volunteers reflects the reality that there will
always be ways in which Government provision and services can be
supplemented by the engagement of volunteers. However, volunteering
must not be seen as, and cannot be a cut-price alternative to
Government. That is true of the third sector generally.</p><p><a name="06060754001236">Before the second world war,
the patchwork nature of the welfare state may have encouraged a spirit
of charity and voluntary action, but Labour Members do not romanticise
that era, for it was a time when services were frail and failed many
people. For Labour Members, the significant increases in expenditure on
public services&#151;and the resultant improvements&#151;are
consistent with the increase in volunteering. Both contribute to a more
just society.</p><p><a name="06060754001237">Today&#146;s debate is
important because I hope that it might enable us to declare a happy
consensus on the need for partnership between the state and the
voluntary sector. That would be welcome. It would mark a major change
from the position of the Conservative party in the 1980s, when the
choice between state and volunteer was perceived as a zero sum
game&#151;more state provision meant crowding out the volunteer; less
state provision was desirable because it would increase voluntary
action.</p><p><a name="06060754001238"><b><a name="06060754002301">Adam
Afriyie (Windsor) (Con):</b> Does the Parliamentary Secretary
share my concern that today, many volunteers give much of their time to
hospitals throughout the country serving tea, providing artwork and
performing many other noble tasks? I was stunned by his party political
point because my example shows the substitution of volunteer labour for
public expenditure. Will he do something about
that?</p><p><a name="06060754001239"><b><a name="06060754002302">Edward

for Chingford and Woodford Green (Mr. Duncan Smith) to the debate. He
has taken a great interest in the voluntary sector and social justice.
I feel some anxiety when reading some of the speeches that he has given
on the issue and I hope that he will have the chance to speak in the
debate. Last November, around the time when he was appointed to his new
role, he made a speech in which he said:</p><a name="06060754001406"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;As big charity gets
ever closer to big government, it increasingly mirrors its thinking and
behaviour&#148;.</p></ul><p><a name="06060754001241">I am worried
and I believe that there is concern in the voluntary sector that that
represents a 1980s view of faith in smaller government and belief that
voluntary action should fill the gap.</p><a name="06060754001322"><p><b><a name="06060754002303">Mr.
Iain Duncan Smith (Chingford and Woodford Green) (Con):</b>
The speech to which the Parliamentary Secretary refers dealt with the
relationship between larger charities and the smaller voluntary groups.
He should go back to his office and examine carefully what happens with
some of the bigger charities. Approximately 5 per cent. dominate
charitable giving to such an extent that many smaller groups cannot get
money. At the same time, they dominate the relationship with big
government, often dictatingthe pressure on it. Genuine
voluntary effort in the community groups often gets crowded out by that
combination of big government and big
charity.</p><p><a name="06060754001242"><b><a name="06060754002304">Edward
Miliband:</b> I have the utmost respect for the right hon.
Gentleman, who is a much more senior Member of the House than I am.
However, in the last part of his intervention, he again referred to
crowding out by big government. He and I have a very honest
disagreement&#151;not about ends, because I completely respect the
ends towards which he is working, but about means. I do not think that
the role of the Government necessarily crowds out the work of voluntary
sector groups. However, when we are considering ways in which the
voluntary sector can carry out more public service delivery, big
charities will inevitably be involved.</p><p><a name="06060754001243"><b><a name="06060754002305">Mr.
Duncan Smith:</b> I really must take up this issue with the
hon. Gentleman. I visit a lot of small community groups around the
country, pretty much throughout the year now, as part of my work with
the Centre for Social Justice. One of the abiding features of what the
people working in those groups tell me time and again is that they do
not want to access local or national Government money because when they
do, they feel that their activities get taken over by the Government
and they fall into the pattern of being &#147;check-listed&#148; by
civil servants. They absolutely fear the hand of the Government. I did
not make that up. The hon. Gentleman should come with me on some of
those visits, and I will show him people in Glasgow, Manchester and
Sheffield who all work hard and all say the same thing: that they fear
big government because it tends to take them over. Those are not my
words, but theirs.</p><br><notus-date day="7" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>7 Jun 2006 : Column 350</b><br><p><a name="06060754001244"><b><a name="06060754002306">Edward
Miliband:</b> Of course, the right hon. Gentleman is right. In
a way, that is what I was talking about when I referred to barriers.
The Government&#146;s relationship with the voluntary sector needs to
be conducted with a light touch, and we need to strike the proper
balance between accountability and the flexibility to spend resources.
I am afraid that the right hon. Gentleman and I simply have a
philosophical disagreement on this issue.</p><p><a name="06060754001245">In the months and years ahead
we will scrutinise the Conservatives&#146; proposals and intentions,
and I hope that there can be consensus on this question. The
relationship between state and voluntary activity is an important issue
for our country, but it is not an easy one. There might be
disagreements, but I hope that we can reach consensus.</p><p><a name="06060754001246">I believe that it is right to
celebrate the work of volunteers. In small ways and large, they are
making a huge difference to our country. Forty years ago this month,
the American politician Robert Kennedy said in a speech to young people
in South Africa that the biggest danger facing our society was the
sense of futility, and the belief
that</p><a name="06060754001407"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;there is nothing
one man or one woman can do against the enormous array of the
world&#146;s
ills.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06060754001247">Every year,
millions of British volunteers are the living answer to the danger of
futility. They are active citizens changing our country for the better.
They have a Government on their side, and I salute their work
today.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="06060754001424">5.57

David Heath (Somerton and Frome) (LD):</b> I very much welcome
the debate and the tone in which the hon. Member for North-East
Bedfordshire (Alistair Burt) opened it. I suspected from the start that
this would be one of the most consensual debates of the year, and, so
far, that has been borne out by the words of the hon. Gentleman and of
the Minister. I think that this is the first time that I have had the
opportunity to welcome the Parliamentary Secretary, Cabinet Office, the
hon. Member for Doncaster, North (Edward Miliband) to his new
responsibilities, after he was so cruelly robbed of that opportunity
during the course of the Legislative and Regulatory Reform Bill. I
congratulate him, and warmly welcome him. I also thank him for what he
has said today. If he makes a habit of quoting that great Liberal,
William Beveridge, in his speeches, he will maintain a welcome from
these Benches.</p><p><a name="06060754001249">We
need to recognise that, although the contributions to the debate will
probably follow more or less the same lines&#151;albeit with some
areas of tension, such as the one that was explored in the latter
stages of the Minister&#146;s speech&#151;the warm feeling that
comes from congratulating the voluntary sector from the Chamber is
insufficient to its needs. To use the time-honoured phrase, fine words
butter no parsnips. The requirement is not only to feel well disposed
towards the voluntary sector, but to help it to do its essential job
and to recognise some of the barriers that stand in its way.</p>

<p><a name="06060754001250">We have already heard about the
huge range of activities across the country that are covered by the
voluntary sector. Those activities are all done for the 
<br><notus-date day="7" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>7 Jun 2006 : Column 351</b><br>greater public good. The citizens advice bureaux, for instance, do a
marvellous job in many of our communities. Those who work with elderly
people are doing work that would otherwise not be done, because it
would not be done by the statutory sector. There are also the special
constables, who were mentioned by the hon. Member for Stockton, South
(Ms Taylor).</p><p><a name="06060754001251">Those
who work in the artistic and cultural heritage sectors are important to
the life of our communities, not only adding to but maintaining that
which we have. The industrial heritage sector in particular is often
unsung. In that sector, people devote their lives to maintaining things
that give instruction and pleasure to people in our local
communities.</p><p><a name="06060754001252">We
should not forget those in local government, who are often forgotten in
their role as volunteers. In fact, local government is made up of
volunteers, particularly at parish council level. Many parish
councillors take on considerable responsibilities in return for few
thanks and little reward, and I am grateful for the work that they do.
Those who volunteer to work for political parties certainly do not
often receive thanks publicly, but they are volunteers none the less.
Many of them give their time because of their commitment to a
principle. They are prepared to do that day after day, week after week
and year after year, and we should say thank you to them. We may feel
that a number of them are mistaken in their political beliefs, but they
are all doing what they do because they believe it to be for the common
good.</p><p><a name="06060754001253">School
governors, who have been mentioned today, take on an extraordinarily
responsible task nowadays, which is probably far beyond what they
thought they were taking on in the first instance. I am worried by some
of the responsibilities that now fall on their shoulders.</p><p><a name="06060754001254">We should also take account of
youth work, in its widest context. I am glad that the hon. Member for
North-East Bedfordshire mentioned his sea cadets, because I think we
should pay special regard to the inestimable value of the work of the
cadet force with young people. It does not merely provide them with the
experiences that it is traditionally so good at providing. Earlier
today, my hon. Friend the Member for Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and
Strathspey (Danny Alexander) told me that at the weekend he had
presented awards for community service to a number of cadets who had
been not climbing mountains, sailing ships or flying planes, but
helping the elderly as part of their training. That strikes me as an
extremely valuable
contribution.</p><p><a name="06060754001255">There
are those who raise funds for all sorts of purposes: organisations such
as rotary clubs and, in my part of the world, carnival associations.
Carnivals are not, in fact, a Notting Hill phenomenon; they are a
Somerset phenomenon. We have the largest and best carnivals in the
country, although they are not known to a great many people. The work
of carnival associations continues throughout the year. They produce
the floats for carnivals such as the Bridgwater carnival, which is
attended by a quarter of a million people. Such carnivals raise a
phenomenal amount of money for good causes.</p><br><notus-date day="7" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>7 Jun 2006 : Column 352</b><br><p><a name="06060754001256">We would not have a sports
structure withoutthe voluntary sector&#151;without the
coaches, the groundsmen and the honorary secretaries, treasurers,
presidents and chairmen of the sports clubs in our constituencies.
Those who work for the environment and conservation give up their time
to make their communities that little bit better. But it is pointless
to highlight particular organisations or individuals, because the list
is endless.</p><p><a name="06060754001257">The
Minister may be relieved to hear that I am not going to invite him to
my constituency&#151;not because I would not be delighted to see him
there, and not because I do not have a huge array of local
organisations that I think would be worthy of his attention, but simply
because I recognise that he has new responsibilities in his Department.
Let me say how glad I am that responsibility for voluntary work has
been removed from the maw of the Home Office and its tottering empire
and given to the Cabinet Office, where I hope more attention will be
paid to it.</p><p><a name="06060754001258">Last, but
certainly not least, are carers. No doubt attention will be paid to
them later. They are, by definition, volunteers. They probably do not
think of themselves as such but rather as people who provide care
either because of an obligation or out of love for the individual on
whom they are bestowing that care. However, they are part of the
voluntary sector. What does the sector provide? It adds value to
statutory activities and fills the gaps that the statutory providers
will never fill. It also strengthens communities, supports families and
reduces crime.</p><p><a name="06060754001259">I want
to highlight the effect of the sector on rural areas. We often think of
urban volunteers as providing services, but that activity is often even
more important in rural areas because of the lack of statutory
provision. If the statutory bodies and local authorities do not provide
various functions, it is left to the volunteers to fill those gaps. I
applaud the point made about the Licensing Act 2003 and its effect on
village hall committees. Village halls are often key components of
voluntary activity in local
areas.</p><p><a name="06060754001260">Volunteering is
done for a mixture of motives. Altruism is one. Care and love for
individuals is another. The feeling that one has skills that are unused
and can be put to better use for the community is a third. The fourth,
and not to be forgotten, motive is fun. It is fun to do a lot of the
activities, and people engage in voluntary activities for that
purpose.</p><p><a name="06060754001261"><b><a name="06060754002308">Ms

join me in saying, that volunteers do many things that the state in no
way, shape of form gets involved in? Alan Wade, a farmer in my
constituency, is putting together eight very large lorry loads of
clothes and medical equipment to go to Chernobyl. No one else is going
to do that. He is valiant&#151;a superb man. There are many Alan
Wades in Great Britain, and we should celebrate them again and
again.</p><p><a name="06060754001262"><b><a name="06060754002309">Mr.

complementarity&#151;one adds to the other, not replaces the other.
However, I say in parenthesis that I share some of the concerns
expressed by the right hon.

stuck in a particular pattern of thinking. As I listened to him, I was
worried that he had a particular pattern of thought as well, which is
about the superiority of public service delivery. If he retains that
view and does not see that there are flaws in public service delivery
that voluntary agencies sometimes highlight, he is missing something,
which betrays a pattern of thought that he needs to
change.</p><p><a name="06060754001266"><b><a name="06060754002313">Mr.
Heath:</b> I thought that the hon. Gentleman was suggesting
that I held that view. I emphatically do not. However, I now understand
that he was referring to the Minister. That debate can be resolved
during the course of the
evening.</p><p><a name="06060754001267">The hon.
Member for North-East Bedfordshire is equally right to point out the
barriers. We should be concentrating on those. It is not enough simply
to applaud what is done, but to say how we can enable that to happen in
a better and more effective way. There are some aspects of voluntary
work in which people are prevented from doing their best, sometimes by
a lack of facilities, such as sports fields, and the lack of investment
in local communities that provides the wherewithal for people to offer
their services effectively. Sometimes it happens because of
bureaucracy. The Criminal Records Bureau is still a live issue for many
people. I welcome what the Minister said about improvement, but I
recognise, because I have come across it in my constituency&#151;all
hon. Members must find the same thing&#151;that the inevitable checks
have a depressing effect on the preparedness of people to
volunteer.</p><p><a name="06060754001268">The checks
and balances that we put in place must be proportionate. Of course we
must protect the young and the vulnerable, but we need to do so in a
way that is consonant with people still providing the levels of support
that they themselves can offer. That also applies to the area of risk
aversion, which has been mentioned. The Compensation Bill goes some way
toward dealing with that.</p><p><a name="06060754001269">However, the problem is often
not the so-called compensation culture&#151;I have never been
convinced that such a culture exists&#151;or litigation being carried
through into court; rather, it is the interpretation by organisations
of their liability through litigation that prevents them from doing
things that they would otherwise do. A huge educative process is needed
in order to tell organisations, &#147;Yes, you can expose people to
appropriate risk in carrying out outdoor activities in particular. That
is not a wrong thing to do&#151;it

that you take reasonable precautions and measures to ensure that they
do not come to
harm.&#148;</p><p><a name="06060754001270">It
worries me that support for the voluntary sector, particularly from
local government, is always vulnerable. By definition, it occurs in
marginal areas of statutory duties, which means that when times are
hard in local government, such support is cut. That principle even
extends to social services and support for carers in many parts of the
country, which is in any case a patchwork of provision and is now under
real threat.</p><p><a name="06060754001271">The key
issue, however, is the financial consequences, and here I shall
concentrate on carers. For many, the restrictions on the carer&#146;s
allowance are a real difficulty. An example is the 35-hour restriction,
which rules out many people. Moreover, when people become statutory
pensioners, they lose the carer&#146;s allowance. I understand the
financial consequences of taking a different view on this issue;
nevertheless, that restriction represents a horror story for many
elderly carers, particularly those who are caring for their even more
elderly parents. People can earn up to a limit of &#163;84 a week,
which is not very much, before they start to lose their carer&#146;s
allowance. Those who are at school, university or college for more than
21 hours a week do not qualify for carer&#146;s allowance. These are
all restrictions on people who are desperate to support their loved
ones in their homes, and who, in doing so, are saving the state vast
sums of money. In addition, such caring is to the advantage of the
individual being cared
for.</p><p><a name="06060754001272">The hon. Member
for Brighton, Pavilion (David Lepper) was right to draw attention to
child carers, who are the forgotten carers. I hope that schools and
colleges become much more aware of this issue, spot the stress
experienced by young people who are caring for a parent or an older
sibling in the home, and make arrangements to support them through
their schooling, so that their education does not suffer, and to
support them socially by acting as mentors and helping them deal with
the problems that inevitably lie in their
way.</p><p><a name="06060754001273">We have a pension
reform programme, which recognises the difficulties faced by carers,
but does not propose to do anything about them during the lifetime of
those who are currently carers. That is an issue of huge
concern.</p><p><a name="06060754001274"><b><a name="06060754002314">Mrs.
Si&#226;n C. James (Swansea, East) (Lab):</b> Will the hon.

Heath:</b> We have very limited time and other Members will
not get a chance to speak if I give
way.</p><p><a name="06060754001276">Finally, it
should be made easier for businesses to release people to allow them to
take part in voluntary activity, and it should be in their interests to
do so. That brings me to a specific question that I would like the
Minister to respond to, if he can. There is a concern about the
definition of carers in clause 12 of the Work and Families Bill. The
Minister will be aware that although this is to be settled by secondary
legislation, the intimation is that the definition of carers will be
restricted to those with a familial connection with the person being
cared for. That is alarming many people in the sector, who realise that
carers can comprise a much larger group. This definition is too narrow
and 
<br><notus-date day="7" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>7 Jun 2006 : Column 355</b><br>restrictive, and even if it is appropriate in the context of the Bill,
its use outside that context and in other aspects of the
Government&#146;s programme would be
counter-productive.</p><p><a name="06060754001277">Because
of the lack of time, I feel that I should shorten my remarks at this
point. To some extent, it is a platitude to express a debt of gratitude
to carers and volunteers in this country, but it is necessary to do so.
We owe them an enormous amount. In cash terms, too, the state owes them
an enormous amount for their work. That makes it all the more necessary
to reduce the barriers in their way and to promote and encourage their
work, which has not always been the case. I am encouraged by the
Minister&#146;s views, but I now want action taken to reduce the
barriers and really encourage those
people.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="06060754001425">6.15

of relevant interests, as a former carer, as vice-president of Carers
UK, as chair of the all-party carers group and as the sponsor of the
Carers (Equal Opportunities) Act 2004. I begin by congratulating the
official Opposition on proposing the debate. I particularly welcome the
positive comments made by all three speakers so far. This debate is a
measure of the progress made in the country and across the House in
advancing the cause of carers and volunteers. It is commendable that
those issues have moved much higher up on all our political
agendas.</p><p><a name="06060754001279">The official
Opposition threw down an intriguing gauntlet by linking volunteering
with caring. I am sure that no one would suggest that carers carry out
their work as volunteers, as I believe that they undertake their
responsibilities out of love for family members. However, many carers
are volunteers above the call of duty when they work in carers&#146;
organisations. We have already heard about many such excellent
organisations and the carers who work in them.</p><p><a name="06060754001280">In my own county borough of
Neath Port Talbot, there are more than 20,000 carers&#151;the highest
proportion in any county borough in the UK. Serving those areas are
some admirable carers&#146; organisations, too numerous to mention,
but I will refer to as many as I can in the limited time
available&#151;the epilepsy support group, Cancer Challenge, the
Special Needs Activity Club, Age Concern and, perhaps most intriguingly
of all, a new carers action movement, chaired by my friend, Mr. Ray
Thomas, who with his wife Margaret has been a carer for 40 years.
Alongside that, he has now formed his own carers action movement. Another interesting initiative involves former carers coming together to
support new carers in the upper Afan
valley.</p><p><a name="06060754001281">The
Government&#151;my Government&#151;have done a great deal to
enhance the lives of carers from the launch of the national carers
strategy in 1999 and the introduction of the carers special grant to
more recent recognition of the right of carers to request flexible
working in the Work and Families Bill and, even more recently, in
respect of the right to decent pensions for carers, particularly women,
in the new White Paper on pensions.</p><br><notus-date day="7" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>7 Jun 2006 : Column 356</b><br><p><a name="06060754001282">This debate affords Members the
opportunity to raise some important policy issues relating to the link
between caring and volunteering. Young carers provide one example. In
my county borough, there are 600 such carers under the age of 16. How
can both the Welsh Assembly Government and the Government in
Westminster help those young carers to become volunteers, beyond their
own caring responsibilities and their school work? I hope that
Education Ministers will deal with that when the Education and
Inspections Bill returns to the
House.</p><p><a name="06060754001283">Beyond the
Bill, I believe that young carers could benefit more if family support
were provided by the expansion of such remarkable schemes as the Winged
Fellowship Trust and the Shared Care Network. More respite care of that
kind is essential for all carers, but particularly for young carers.
Additional funds and awards to such admirable bodies as Crossroads and
the Princess Royal Trust for Carers and local authorities would greatly
assist young and older carers. All that could be part of the
implementation of the Russell Commission recommendations on
volunteering.</p><p><a name="06060754001284">As
carers&#146; rights become more central to public policy in all
Departments, would it not be appropriate to appoint a carers&#146;
champion&#151;a specific Minister, with cross-cutting departmental
responsibilities to enhance and advance the rights of all carers? It
would be admirable, in advance of next week&#146;s carers week, if we
were to hear today some kind of commitment from the Government to
create such a
position.</p><p><a name="06060754001285">In
conclusion, I warmly welcome the comment made by my hon. Friend the
Minister when he said that there is much more to be done for carers.
The debate is worth while in recognising and valuing the indispensable
role of carers and volunteers and the collective commitment of hon.
Members on both sides of the House to achieve more respect, more
recompense and more respite care for carers. I congratulate the

it.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="06060754001426">6.21

biggest problems that I see from the work that I do with the Centre for

volunteer to do important work in the community, such as getting kids
off drugs, helping pensioners who have difficulty getting out or
sorting out problems in the aftermath of family breakdown&#151;I am
sure that all hon. Members will have seen such things every day in
their work&#151;is that they find that there is a growing divide
between their activities and those of the bigger charities, most of
whose work is done by paid people, 
<br><notus-date day="7" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>7 Jun 2006 : Column 357</b><br>who earn a salary and come to work much as many other people do. Worthy
as that may be, there is a big disparity in their access to money and
that of many small community groups.</p><p><a name="06060754001288">Some national charities sit on
very large reserves of money, while still collecting donations. In some
cases, as much as half their national requirements are held in reserves
worth millions of pounds. Many of the groups that I talk to live from
hand to mouth. They struggle every day; they literally go out with the
begging bowl. Sometimes, visiting them as a politician is one of the
ways of getting them publicity, so that people donate some money to
them. Let us never underestimate the worth of that publicity to those
groups.</p><p><a name="06060754001289">In a sense,
there is in part a divided world. Small groups doing all the work find
it more difficult to provide real access to the welfare society. They
often find themselves crowded out by the activities of the national
charities, whose dominance in fundraising squeezes out other charities.
People who have already committed money to the bigger charities find it
difficult to give money to the small community groups. Some of those
things need to be thought through. The national charities need to
rethink their relationship on giving with the smaller communities
groups, and the Government need to do so,
too.</p><p><a name="06060754001290">I want to speak
about a couple of problems, the first of which is the relationship with
the Government. A number of issues have been raised and the Minister
has made some observations&#151;I congratulate him on trying to deal
with some of these things&#151;but many Government agencies find it
very difficult to deal with small community groups and charities. He is
right: he and the agencies like working with the bigger charities. It
is always easier to work with big organisations that are well-organised
and have marketing directors, chiefs of staff and all those other
things. They can talk almost on even terms. Small community
groups&#151;I call them the awkward squad&#151;often involve people
who are challenging opinions and attitudes, sometimes doing things that
others are not sure are right, and they can be more difficult to deal
with.</p><p><a name="06060754001291">I remember
visiting Connexions in my area and asking what it was doing as part of
its brief to support some of the smaller community groups and
charities. Most of its work seemed to be supporting the local
government work in the area, because that was so much easier. The staff
were scared stiff of committing to small community groups because they
were worried about what might happen if they failed or went wrong, or
problems occurred. Therefore, the lion&#146;s share of the money that
the Government had intended to go to some of the small community groups
ended up going to projects set up by the local council. I asked the
staff about one specific project and they said that they had had no
take-up from local sports groups, but they could not understand why. I
asked what requirements they laid on such groups, and it turned out
that they had to have a full personnel check and full liability
insurance before their bids could be assessed. I threw up my hands and
asked how many of those one man and a dog operations that ran two
football teams on a Sunday could afford liability insurance before they
could make a bid for
funds.</p><p><a name="06060754001292">I am not
blaming the staff, because they were good people trying hard to find a
solution, but it had not 
<br><notus-date day="7" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>7 Jun 2006 : Column 358</b><br>occurred to them that people were working hand to mouth and struggling
to run football teams through pure voluntary work. Everybody involved
was giving up time and often money.</p><p><a name="06060754001293">The attitude of the Government
and civil servants to such issues is ingrained. They like dealing with
organisations that are sizeable, orderly, working well and structured.
They find it really difficult to work with small groups. I urge the
Minister to think outside the box and find ways to deal with those
groups, which are doing wonderful work in our community and include
some of the most inspirational people I have ever met. Such
organisations are more like small businesses, with all the same
awkwardness and peculiarities, and they fail at the same
rate&#151;but they can also inspire and grow at the same rate. Unless
we get our thinking around the fact that those social entrepreneurs are
every bit as important to us as economic entrepreneurs, we will not
begin to realise why so much in our society is challenging and broken
down.</p><p><a name="06060754001294">I do not wish to
labour the point about big charities, but we need to rethink the
situation when so many big charities collect vast amounts of
money&#151;and many do very good work with it&#151;and sit on vast
reserves. I visited a charity which received some publicity as a
result. Someone who had grown up in Gallowgate and gone on to great
things in London read about the charity&#151;it is run by Jim Doherty
and is a local community charity that helps people get off
drugs&#151;and offered it &#163;10,000 a year. That is a lot of
money for such a group, but larger charities can have &#163;50
million or more in reserve. Just a tiny proportion of that would go so
far towards helping others out. The same goes for the Government,
because small amounts of money can make a massive
difference.</p><p><a name="06060754001295">We have
talked a lot about how much volunteering saves the nation and delivers
services. What we have not mentioned is that volunteering benefits the
individuals who do it. It makes them better people, and that improves
our society. It is an immeasurable element, but the less volunteers
work in our society, the less we are as a nation. Therefore,
encouraging people to volunteer is arguably every bit as important as
the most encouraging work we do in
economics.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="06060754001427">6.29

Waltho (Stourbridge) (Lab):</b> I support the main thrust of
the motion, especially where it talks of the care and dedication of
carers, but we need to be clear about the definition of carers. They
can be relatives, friends or neighbours who look after someone who
cannot manage without help because of sickness, age or disability.
Carers look after people of all ages and can be of all ages themselves.
They can be male or female, although they are more often women. Parents
who care for a child with a long-term illness or disability are also
carers. Some carers look after someone for a few hours a week; others
do so for24 hours a day, every day. Many carers care in their
own homes, while others support friends living nearby or miles
away.</p><p><a name="06060754001297">My constituency
is located in the Dudley area, where there are 35,000 carers, of whom
7,500 provide more than 50 hours a week. In addition, there are 900
young 
<br><notus-date day="7" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>7 Jun 2006 : Column 359</b><br>carers between the ages of five and 17. That caring support is given
willingly, but it must never be taken for
granted.</p><p><a name="06060754001298">It has been
said that carers need society&#146;s support as well as its thanks,
and that support has led to a great deal being achieved by the combined
efforts of organisations campaigning on carers&#146; behalf. Those
achievements should also be considered alongside the raft of
progressive policy initiatives introduced by this Labour
Government.</p><p><a name="06060754001299">This
Government are the first to recognise the needs of carers as well as
the needs of those who are cared for, and I have seen the effects of
their progressive policies on the lives of carers in Dudley. Those
carers are also assisted by a dedicated and well organised network that
is most ably co-ordinated by a great lady named Christine
Rowley.</p><p><a name="06060754001300">In addition,
we in Dudley are fortunate to have a dedicated helpline that gives
carers the opportunity to talk to other carers. That excellent service
is staffed by volunteer carers, whose experience ensures that they
understand what callers are going through. The aim is to provide a
listening ear, carer to carer, and the service is invaluable to many
people in my
constituency.</p><p><a name="06060754001301">As well
as the advice line, carers have access to a vast amount of information
on financial matters, health, respite care and employment issues. That
access to information is vital, and it is a matter that comes up again
and again when I talk to carers in my constituency. They want to be
recognised for the care that they provide: they make a strong plea that
they should not be called informal carers but that they should be
considered to be the real
professionals.</p><p><a name="06060754001302">I want
to highlight the vital area of training opportunities for carers. In
Dudley, we have established the care link scheme, which is aimed at
people who want to find work in health and social care. Its dedicated
team gives full support to job seekers, providing them with the skills
needed for a satisfying role in the care industry. The scheme is also
open to anyone between the ages of 24 and 59, and full support is given
throughout.</p><p><a name="06060754001303">Carers can
also work for the City and Guilds learning for living certificate, a
personal development and learning qualification for unpaid carers. The
expert patients programme helping people with long-term illnesses has
been welcomed by local carers, and a new programme, &#147;looking
after me&#148;, has been developed specifically for carers who
themselves have long-term illnesses. Tutors are just finishing their
training, and the first course will be offered
shortly.</p><p><a name="06060754001304">Dudley is
well served by a service called Crossroads&#151;named after the much
loved soap opera based in a midlands motel&#151;that provides caring
for carers. The service was praised in 2005 by the Commission for
Social Care Inspection for the work that it does in providing sitting
services to help carers take a break. It is fully funded from Dudley
council&#146;s carer&#146;s grant, and is backed by the Big Lottery
Fund.</p><p><a name="06060754001305">All of the
carers grant is still allocated to carers in Dudley. The money is
directed specifically at carers who want to use it to enable them take
a break. 
<br><notus-date day="7" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>7 Jun 2006 : Column 360</b><br>Flexibility is the key, and some 200 carers will benefit from the
funding next year.</p><p><a name="06060754001306">I
also want, however, to draw attention to the needs of parents of
children with disabilities. Those of us who are parents of able-bodied
children generally expect our responsibilities to decrease over time,
but that is not so for the parents of children with disabilities. Their
caring responsibilities generally increase as their children get older
and less help is provided by the support
services.</p><p><a name="06060754001307">In that
connection, I want to pay particular tribute to the Orchard
partnership, based in Stourbridge. That unique and vital service for
vulnerable children with disabilities and their families was set up by
a group of parents co-ordinated&#151;and, as is often of the case,
chivvied and coerced&#151;by one parent in particular. That parent is
Madeleine Cowley, who is now the chairman of the organisation&#151;a
volunteer, of
course.</p><p><a name="06060754001308">Many children
now survive illnesses that they would not have survived even 10 years
ago, and the Orchard partnership was set up to address their needs and
those of their carers. It helps them to have the same quality of life
that other children enjoy. I have paid several visits to the Orchard: I
have watched its Saturday club run drama workshops, met parent and
carer support groups and seen children and carers benefit from short
breaks. There is also a special youth forum that is focused on raising
the profile of the issues facing young disabled people and their
families during the vital period of transition to adult life. The
parent-led committee continues to support the services offered by the
Orchard partnership and all the services benefit from the contribution
of volunteer support workers. All the volunteers are a valuable asset
and really enhance the services provided to the children and their
families. The Orchard provides a toy library and I was proud to become
patron of that last year, at the launch of the story sacks. That is a
great initiative that allows parents to use puppets when they are
telling stories to their children. I do not quite know who enjoyed that
more&#151;me or the children&#151;but it is certainly a brilliant
initiative.</p>

<p><a name="06060754001309">On a more
serious note, I draw the Minister&#146;s attention to the problem
that such services face when funding streams approach their ends.
Lengthy waits are often endured before hearing about confirmation of
continued funding for future development. Perhaps he can offer some
hope of stability or ring-fencing of funding for such projects in the
future.</p><p><a name="06060754001310">To sum up my
contribution to today&#146;s debate, I will paraphrase my right hon.
Friend the Prime Minister: a lot done, a lot more to do. I am proud to
have been part of a Government who recognise that caring can affect
both the health and the financial status of carers and their families,
that access to employment opportunities helps to maintain financial
security and self-confidence, that training and education enables
people to return to work when they want to or to work flexibly
according to their needs, and that access to leisure services gives
carers time to themselves to recharge their batteries. It is vital that
that is where we target this support. Carers are entitled to the same
benefits as anybody else. Put simply: they have earned them. Some ask,
&#147;Can we afford to support carers?&#148; We should answer,
&#147;Can we afford not to?&#148;</p><br><notus-date day="7" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>7 Jun 2006 : Column 361</b><br><h5 align="left"><a name="06060754001428">6.36

Richard Benyon (Newbury) (Con):</b> I have scythed through my
speech and will get through it in seconds. I just want to touch on some
of the points that have been raised and add a few of my own. In west
Berkshire, I am lucky to have an excellent volunteer centre, which is
run by its director Garry Poulson. He and I talk regularly about what
encourages people to volunteer and what makes the voluntary sector
tick. He keeps interesting statistics showing who walks through his
door and the different areas of volunteering that he guides them
towards. It is fascinating to see the number of young people who are
volunteering, the gender difference and the type of activities that
people wish to go towards.</p><p><a name="06060754001312">My hon. Friend the Member for
North-East Bedfordshire (Alistair Burt) touched on the important
subject of what prevents people from volunteering. I will touch on that
in the few minutes that I have left. As the vice-chairman of our local
citizens advice bureau, I completely take the point made by the hon.
Member for Somerton and Frome (Mr. Heath). I have spent hours
discussing governance issues such as the accounts, the reserves policy,
and whether we should be incorporated. All those sort of things sap
one&#146;s enthusiasm for volunteering. We are interested in what the
organisation does and not necessarily how the mechanics of
administrating it work. We have to look seriously at the pressure that
we put on volunteers in terms of the administration of voluntary
bodies&#151;whether we are talking about the Criminal Records Bureau,
the fear of litigation, the cost of insurance, compliance with the
Disability Discrimination Act 1995, or all the financial regulations
that are involved.</p><p><a name="06060754001313">There is a wonderful book by
Robert Putnam called &#147;Bowling Alone&#148;, which looks at the
problems of American society&#151;many of which are reflected in this
country, as well. He identifies one of the key factors&#151;it was
touched on by my hon. Friend the Memberfor North-East
Bedfordshire&#151;that limits people&#146;s availability to
volunteer: time. Professor Putnam has calculated that every 10 minutes
of commuting cutsall forms of social engagement by 10 per
cent. That is 10 per cent. fewer family suppers and 10 per cent. fewer
local club meetings and other community activities. So, the knock-on
effect of the successful battle that we fought in west Berkshire to
protect our rail service was to increase to a small degree, or at least
sustain, the amount of volunteering. Professor Putnam makes the
poignant point that people who want to volunteer get home from work
exhausted and it is easier to sit down and watch
&#147;Friends&#148; than go out to find and interact with real
ones.</p><p><a name="06060754001314">Can Government
make more people volunteer? Of course, in a direct sense, the answer is
almost universally no. However, they can incentivise and make it easier
for people to volunteer. I want to point to one key example in my
constituency: Vodafone. Vodafone has not had a very good press in
recent days, but it continues to be a force for good in west Berkshire.
There is scarcely a voluntary body that it does not help financially
and, matching that, it encourages employees to participate in
environmental working parties and community reading projects. It
creates a virtuous circle of a diminution in sickness and increase in 
<br><notus-date day="7" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>7 Jun 2006 : Column 362</b><br>productivity. I thus urge the Government to examine the incentives that
they can give to
companies.</p><p><a name="06060754001315">In
conclusion, I ask the Government to accept that it is crucial to
understand the difference between the voluntary sector and the
not-for-profit charitable sector. The latter is an arm&#146;s length
deliverer of Government services, with a huge call on financial
resources, while the other is a wonderfully anarchic network of social
and emotional interaction. As my right hon. Friend the Member for
Chingford and Woodford Green (Mr. Duncan Smith) said, the voluntary
sector should be allowed to exercise its will&#151;sometimes in the
wrong direction, but always with enormous enthusiasm and in the
directionof ultimate right&#151;within the framework of the
Government&#146;s plans for the
sector.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="06060772000107">6.40

Loughton (East Worthing and Shoreham) (Con):</b> We have had
an excellent and brief debate, during which we have heard good and
succinct&#151;in most cases, I am glad to say&#151;contributions
from hon. Members on both sides of the House. I welcome the
Parliamentary Secretary, Cabinet Office, the hon. Member for Doncaster,
North (Edward Miliband), to his post. I welcomed many of the comments
that he made in his maiden speech from the Dispatch Box, especially
when he talked about the Government&#146;s enabling role and said
that the work of volunteers should be complementary to state action,
not a substitute for it. However, some of his other language betrayed
the perception among many in this country that volunteers and carers
are too often used as cheap labour, or that we have volunteering and
caring on the
cheap.</p><p><a name="06060772000006">As my right
hon. Friend the Member for Chingford and Woodford Green (Mr. Duncan
Smith) rightly said, with his great expertise in the area through the
Centre for Social Justice, too many volunteers are discouraged by the
fear of the heavy hand of big government and the box ticking and
regulation that goes with that. Additionally, too many small volunteer
groups are crowded out by a higher tier of the bigger charities, which
seem to be perhaps too close to the Government in many
cases.</p><p><a name="06060772000007">There are also
worries about the complementarity of funding. The national lottery has
not been mentioned today, but there is a real feeling that many of the
things that are funded by the various national lottery funds should be
paid for with mainstream funding for the health service or education.
This week, I was at the annual general meeting of the Friends of
Worthing hospital, of which I am vice-president. Half the money that we
raised in the past year was spent on equipping bathrooms in the local
hospital. That is not complementary funding, but core funding, and
there is thus a worry about the way in which volunteers&#146; time
and effort are
used.</p><p><a name="06060772000008">We have had a
good debate on a subject that is important to everyone inside and
outside the House. My hon. Friend the Member for North-East
Bedfordshire (Alistair Burt) should be rightly congratulated on moving
the motion without a bead of sweat on his brow after completing the
mile in six minutes 22 seconds&#151;I am afraid that he was way ahead
of me.</p><br><notus-date day="7" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>7 Jun 2006 : Column 363</b><br><p><a name="06060772000009">The timing of our debate on this
worthy subject is good, given that we had volunteers week last week and
it will be carers week next week. Hon. Members on both sides of the
House will have been involved in all sorts of projects. I have been
asked to point out that Conservative Welsh Assembly Members have
recently visited hospices, the ChildLine operations in Wales, projects
promoting Welsh produce and superb projects operating with some of the
least privileged and most at-risk children in the United
Kingdom&#151;there is a plug for
Wales.</p><p><a name="06060772000010">I declare an
interest in that I have been a national trustee of Community Service
Volunteers since 2001. The body has operated for more than 40 years as
the largest volunteer organisation in the country and is under the
excellent leadership of Dame Elisabeth Hoodless. The body is
responsible for make a difference day, with which I am sure most people
are familiar. I am sure that hon. Members have participated on the day
by working in charity shops, on environmental projects and with social
workers or NHS hospitals. This year, 100,000 volunteers contributed to
make a difference day.</p><p><a name="06060772000011">For the past five years, as the
shadow children&#146;s Minister, I have been to the young carers
festival in Southampton. Some youngsters do the most remarkable jobs in
enormously stressful situations. They need to be congratulated, but
also helped. However, I shall concentrate on corporate volunteering,
and on young carers in particular. I will not go into all the figures
about the number of people who volunteer and why they are motivated. It
should be noted that 45 per cent. of people who volunteer have a
disability. Of people who volunteer, 44 per cent. are from the black
and minority ethnic communities, while 38 per cent. of those who
volunteer are without formal qualifications. It is an inclusive
activity. Volunteering is a great leveller and a great satisfier for
people who involve themselves in it.</p><p><a name="06060772000012">There is corporate social
responsibility. Recently, we had the Edith Kahn memorial lecture,
during which Jeff Schwartz , the chief executive of Timberland, made an
enormously inspiring speech about how volunteering has worked in his
corporation and in other companies in America. Every employee of
Timberland automatically receives 40 hours of paid time to do
volunteering work. That is from the chief executive right down to the
person working on the front desk. That time is shown on their pay slip
every month&#151;how much time they have used and how much time they
have still got. Everyone is encouraged&#151;it is not
compulsory&#151;to take up
volunteering.</p><p><a name="06060772000013">On one
day last year, across eight different countries, Timberland alone
contributed 50,000 hours of human service for volunteering. Other
companies in the states had similar big programmes. Hallmark has
recently hired a senior leader to be involved in market-based solutions
to social challenges. We have heard from my hon. Friend the Member for
Newbury (Mr. Benyon) about the work that Vodafone does. Many of our big
companies do a great deal of work in this area, but we need to do a lot
more. Jeff Schwartz
said:</p><a name="06060772000094"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Corporate
citizenship must be more demanding than merely complying with all
relevant laws.&#148;</p></ul><br><notus-date day="7" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>7 Jun 2006 : Column 364</b><br><p><a name="06060772000014">He had a vision that commerce and justice
are not just antithetical notions. His definition of citizenship
allowed a business run for profit to demand that sustainable returns
were generated from shareholders, and also that business should be
actively implicated in the strengthening of the civic square. He talked
about inviting the engine of commerce to fit into the chassis of civic
society. There is great complementarity, and it is a rich vein of
volunteering, along with help and persistence for the advancement of
all that we should be doing in this country. How do we go about it? We
need to encourage more corporate schemes. We need to encourage more
people to become involved individually. We need to make it easier and
more convenient for people to become involved.</p><p><a name="06060772000015">I move on briefly to young
carers. One in eight people in England is a carer. Three in five carers
look after someone with a disability. There are 855,000 carers who
provide more than 50 hours of caring per week. The 2001 census
estimated that there were just 17,000 young carers. The real estimates
from the Princess Royal Trust for Carers suggest that the total is
nearer 100,000. People are doing remarkable work in looking after, in
most cases, relatives with serious physical and mental
disabilities.</p><p><a name="06060772000016">Sixty
five per cent. of UK carers believe that their career prospects have
been affected. Seventy four per cent. of carers are currently in paid
employment and use their annual leave for caring. As the hon. Member
for Stourbridge (Lynda Waltho) mentioned, the effect on carers&#146;
health is considerable and we need to do more about that. Any projects
that are designed for carers caring for carers should be applauded.
Young carers come to Parliament, as they did recently with the
all-party children&#146;s group. They face a problem with their
school careers. In most instances, there is not an understanding linked
teacher in a school who can appreciate the particular needs of a young
carer.</p><p><a name="06060772000017">A young carer
may need access to a phone at work because mum or dad, for whom they
are caring, needs to have a visit or needs to be checked on at various
times during the day. Young carers do not have time to grow up. They do
not have the opportunity to spend time with their friends and to
participate in a normal social life that any normal teenager would hope
and expect to enjoy. They chose&#151;often they did not have any
choice&#151;to look after their parents. We should be in the business
of making that job easier, not in the business of putting obstacles in
their way.</p><p><a name="06060772000018">There is so
much that we can do and I have so little time to set things out.
Certainly, we should have a linked person in each school. Ofsted should
have a role in examining young carer strategies in schools. Best
practice should be disseminated more widely to make the role of young
carers easier, and the Minister could make a start by attending the
young carers weekend later this month, where he will learn that
impressive work is under way.</p><p><a name="06060772000019">Finally, the
strength of volunteering is its independence, the harnessing of
people&#146;s good will, freely given, and the diversity of their
interests and involvement. We must appreciate volunteers and carers
more. We must make their jobs easier, not put obstacles and bureaucracy
in their way, including Criminal Records Bureau checks, which are
necessary but must be balanced. Government Departments should do more
to promote volunteering, 
<br><notus-date day="7" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>7 Jun 2006 : Column 365</b><br>and they should sign up to a code of practice on volunteering. We should
streamline funding, as hon. Members have said, as there is too much
paperwork for voluntary organisations, which constantly have to reapply
for
funds.</p><p><a name="06060772000020">There
should be a level playing field for partnerships with volunteer
organisations, and we must acknowledge young carers and do much more
for them. We should offer assistance in schools, and make genuine
provision for respite care. Hon. Members have had a good opportunity to
plug voluntary organisations in their constituencies, and the whole
House has had good opportunity to thank the millions of volunteers and
carers up and down the country who do an invaluable job, day in, day
out, that would otherwise cost the Government an enormous amount. It is
time, as the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome (Mr. Heath) said, to
butter parsnips and do more than offer warm words. Hon. Members should
look beyond the House and acknowledge the contribution of volunteers
and carers, as well as the serious problems that they face, and produce
a timetable for
action.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="06060772000108">6.51

to the many unsung heroes who make us proud of our constituencies and
of our country.</p><p><a name="06060772000022">In a
world of perpetual change, the selfless dedication of volunteers and
carers is a beacon of light that keeps alive the timeless values of
compassion, solidarity and service. Those individuals shatter the
cynicism of people who portray today&#146;s society as one in which
violence, antisocial behaviour and abuse are rife. Carers enable older
and disabled people, as well as people with long-term chronic
conditions, to remain at home with the dignity, autonomy and security
that the rest of us take for granted. Whether it is the adult daughter
or son caring 24 hours a day, seven days a week, 365 days a year for an
ageing parent, or the friend who makes daily visits to an adult with a
learning disability, carers are in the front line in ensuring that all
our citizens have the quality of life that we demand in a civilised and
fair
society.</p><p><a name="06060772000023">It
is right to recognise that carers have their own practical and
emotional needs, distinct from those of the people for whom they care,
although that recognition is long overdue. We must strive to ensure
that statutory and voluntary sector providers treat carers as equal and
valued partners in the care and support offered to vulnerable people in
all our communities. Volunteers are the living, breathing embodiment of
a healthy civic society. Whether working under the auspices of a
voluntary organisation, or simply making their own personal
contribution, they are frequently at the heart of their communities.
This month in my constituency, the Radcliffe carnival took place only
because of the voluntary commitment of Ray and Hilda Veivers and Colin
Jones. Next week&#146;s Prestwich carnival has been made possible by
David Curtis and his Sunshine Team of volunteers. Every day in every
community, volunteers make a difference to the lives of vulnerable
people. The much maligned younger generation is often at the forefront
of that service. Through Millennium Volunteers, faith groups, schools
and universities, young people demonstrate their 
<br><notus-date day="7" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>7 Jun 2006 : Column 366</b><br>idealism, responsibility and commitment to helping others, shattering
the illusion that the vast majority of young people are engaged in
antisocial behaviour&#151;a point made by my hon. Friend the Member
for Bedford (Patrick Hall) and the Parliamentary Secretary, Cabinet
Office, my hon. Friend the Member for Doncaster, North (Edward
Miliband).</p><p><a name="06060772000024">The
Government believe that the state alone cannot transform communities.
We are committed to an enhanced role for third sector organisations in
the development and delivery of high quality public sector services.
The restoration of community solidarity and civic pride requires new,
authentic partnerships between the state, third sector organisations,
the private sector and active citizens. Professionals, volunteers and
carers all have a distinct but crucial role to play in ensuring not
only that we care for vulnerable people, but that they have a quality
of life fitting in a civilised modern
society.</p><p><a name="06060772000025">I
come to some of the excellent contributions made by right hon. and hon.
Members. The hon. Member for North-East Bedfordshire (Alistair Burt),
as usual, presented his argument in a reasonable and fair way,
reflecting great credit on his contribution over many years, first in
Bury, before he went, not entirely voluntarily, to North-East
Bedfordshire. He rightly highlighted the contribution of sports
volunteers. We ought to reflect on the massive contribution that
volunteers made to the success of the Commonwealth games, which my home
city, Manchester, was so proud to host. As we think about the World cup
and our hosting of the Olympics, the careers of many of the successful
footballers and athletes will start on Saturday and Sunday mornings,
when volunteers enable young people to participate in sport. For many
of our sporting heroes, that is how it all
began.</p><p><a name="06060772000026">The hon.
Gentleman mentioned his pride in being Minister for Disabled People for
some time. He did not refer to his time as Minister with responsibility
for the Child Support Agency, which I know was a stretching and
challenging period for him. He rightly drew attention to the success of
the Eden project, which is an excellent example of best practice in
terms of involving young people.</p><p><a name="06060772000027">In debates
such as this, I always say that at the age of 14 I became involved in
voluntary work with people with learning disabilities. By the time I
reached the age of 16 or 17, I had decided that I wanted to work
professionally in the voluntary sector in social care. I do not believe
that I would ever have gone into politics or that I would be standing
at the Dispatch Box making this speech if I had not been connected at
the age of 14 with that voluntary work with those people with learning
disabilities, which made me think very differently about the kind of
society I wanted to live in and the kind of contribution I wanted to
make. That applies to large numbers of young people, who become
involved on a voluntary basis and then decide that they want to make a
contribution through public service. It is not just a matter of what
people give, but of what they get through their own personal
development and sense of
satisfaction.</p><p><a name="06060772000028">My
hon. Friend the Member for Brighton, Pavilion (David Lepper) and the
hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham (Tim Loughton) rightly spoke
about young carers and our responsibility to identify their distinct
needs, understand the pressures that they face daily, and recognise
that in the education system and 
<br><notus-date day="7" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>7 Jun 2006 : Column 367</b><br>the health service we need to be better at identifying those young
carers and providing the necessary
support.</p><p><a name="06060772000029">The
hon. Member for Somerton and Frome(Mr. Heath) spoke about the
definition of carers under the Department of Trade and Industry
flexible working legislation. The Department is consulting on that
legislation and will take account of views about such a definition
before reaching a final decision. My hon. Friend the Member for
Aberavon (Dr. Francis) has made a massive personal contribution in
advancing the cause of carers during his period as a Member of the
House. That was based on his own experiences. The Carers (Equal
Opportunities) Act 2004 will make a tremendous difference to
carers&#146;
lives.</p><p><a name="06060772000030">The
right hon. Member for Chingford and Woodford Green (Mr. Duncan Smith)
made some valid points about the difference between small and large
charities, but I do not believe there is any need to attack larger
charities. We must build the capacity of smaller charities in local
communities. I remember that when I worked in the voluntary sector we
had a slogan: &#147;Voluntary does not have to mean amateur&#148;.
Vulnerable people depend on the activities of charities, so it is
important that we do not think that voluntary organisations should not
be
accountable.</p><p><a name="06060772000031">My
hon. Friend the Member for Stourbridge (Lynda Waltho) spoke about the
contribution of the Orchard partnership in her constituency, which
sounds extremely innovative in its work. The hon. Member for Newbury
(Mr. Benyon) raised a number of issues relating to work-life balance
and family-friendly policies. I am sure he welcomes the
Government&#146;s contribution in that
respect.</p><p><a name="06060772000032">As
we look ahead to the future, carers and volunteers know that the stakes
are high. The Labour party in government is strengthening Britain with
social justice as our eternal mission and as an integral part of our
national success, whereas the Conservative party views the word
&#147;compassionate&#148; purely as a political strategy to win
power, not as the expression of common values. It is right that today,
from all parts of the House, we pay tribute to the contribution of
carers and
volunteers.</p><p><a name="06060772000033"><i> Question

Rennie (Dunfermline and West Fife) (LD):</b> I would first
like to thank Mr. Speaker for selecting asthma services as the subject
for this Adjournment debate. It is a subject close to my heart and I
gather, although not from the number of Members present, that it is
also a subject in which hundreds of thousands of people throughout the
country are
interested.</p><p><a name="06060772000044">I should
like to introduce the background to the debate. World asthma day was on
2 May, and like many other hon. Members I attended a reception given by
Asthma UK in this House. The Secretary of State for Health also
attended the event and made encouraging noises about the need to
improve health care provision for people with long-term
conditions.</p><p><a name="06060772000045">I am
grateful to the Minister of State, Department of Health, the hon.
Member for Doncaster, Central(Ms Winterton), for coming here
today to expand on the Secretary of State&#146;s comments, and I will
be sure to leave her ample time to deal with the detail of the
Government&#146;s
thinking.</p><p><a name="06060772000046">My hope and
intention is that today&#146;s debate can be a constructive one in
which as many Members as possible are able to feed to the Minister some
of their thoughts and concerns about asthma services in the UK. There
is much to be commended in the work that the Government have done for
people with asthma. If that is not clear later on in my speech, it is
only because time is tight and I am keen to flag up gaps in provision
and procedures that could be improved. In particular I wish to pass on
what people with asthma have said to me, because there is no doubt that
they are among the best judges of what does and does not work, and what
could be improved. Much of the Government&#146;s work for people with
asthma is worthy of commendation. If that is not apparent later in my
speech, it is only because time is tight. I am keen to flag up gaps in
provision and procedures that could be improved. In particular, I want
to pass on what people with asthma have said to me, because there is no
doubt that they are among the best judges of what works, what does not
work and what can be
improved.</p><p><a name="06060772000047">I have lived
with asthma all my life. My sister, Caroline, had undiagnosed asthma
for many years, and her quality of life suffered as a
consequence&#151;at one point, she ended up in hospital with
pneumonia. Through my sister&#146;s experience, my shovel-like cough
was identified as a symptom of asthma, which was diagnosed at the age
of two. My elder son, Alexander, has had two extended visits to
hospital in years two and three of his life. My other son, Stephen, who
is just two, is showing all the signs of asthma, but he is yet to be
diagnosed.</p><p><a name="06060772000048">In my
previous life, I worked with Asthma UK&#151;at the time, it was known
as the National Asthma Campaign&#151;on a number of campaigns,
including a campaign on smoking in public places. I am delighted to see
that a similar ban to that in Scotland will be introduced in the rest
of the country, which will makea big improvement to the
quality of life of peoplewith asthma. Other important issues
include the 
<br><notus-date day="7" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>7 Jun 2006 : Column 370</b><br>administration of medicines in schools and the redesign of asthma
services.</p><p><a name="06060772000049">I have
found ways to manage my asthma and, like many others with the
condition, enjoy a number of sports and activities in which I would be
unable to participate without proper medication. At this point, I
challenge other hon. Members to join me in the Scottish coal-carrying
championship, which takes place at the end of June. Competitors are
required to carry a 1 cwt bag of coal for 1,000 m along the undulating
main street in Kelty, my home village. Given the marathon sittings that
hon. Members endure in this House, I imagine that they would find that
a stroll in the park.</p><p><a name="06060772000050">I consider myself lucky that my
asthma is relatively mild and controllable and that I have the
wherewithal to pay for repeat prescriptions. I believe that the person
should control the asthma rather than the asthma controlling the
person. When GPs, nurses and pharmacists ask people with asthma whether
their condition is under control, the people often say,
&#147;Yes.&#148;, but if they are asked whether they can climb
stairs without wheezing, whether they can sleep for a whole night
without wheezing and whether they can run for the bus, they often say,
&#147;No.&#148; People accept far too much of their condition, and
awareness needs to be raised among people with asthma about the quality
of life that they could live.</p><p><a name="06060772000051">I have personal experience of
the benefits of modern medicines and the value of asthma clinics. When
I was in my 20s, I did not control my asthma well, and when I went to
the asthma clinic, the nurse told me that I would die if I continued
not to control it. That information was dramatic, and it shook me up.
The nurse explained that if I did not manage my asthma, the blue
inhaler would not work and my lungs would collapse during my next
asthma attack. I took that information to heart and have controlled my
asthma much better&#151;the modern medicines are fantastic. Nurses
and pharmacists play as an important part as GPs, and they are skilled
health professionals who should be encouraged to do even more. They are
in the front line and face people with asthma all the time, and we
should encourage them to do more to provoke people to reassess whether
their condition is acceptable.
</p><p><a name="06060772000052">Asthma is a disease
of the lungs in which the airways are unusually sensitive to a wide
range of triggers, including house dust mites, cold air, viral
infections&#151;in my case, it is usually colds&#151;or cut grass.
Common triggers also include tobacco smoke and animal
fur&#151;interestingly, people who live with a cat or dog in their
early years tend not to suffer from animal sensitisation in later
years, so not all animals are bad for people with asthma. The airways
react to those triggers and become inflamed, resulting in symptoms of
tightness and wheeziness in the chest. People suffering severe attacks
find it nearly impossible to breathe and require rapid medication.
Approximately 1,400 people die every year from asthma, and 90 per cent.
of those deaths are preventable, which is a huge percentage that needs
to be tackled.</p><p><a name="06060772000053">There
are about 5.2 million people with asthma in the UK, which is one of the
highest rates in the world. It affects one in eight children and one in
13 adults. An estimated 8 million people in the UK have been diagnosed
with asthma at some stage in their lives&#151;an 
<br><notus-date day="7" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>7 Jun 2006 : Column 371</b><br>average of one in seven of the population. There are now three to four
times more adult people with asthma in the UK and six times more
children with the condition than 25 years ago. There is a big debate as
to why that is the case. Asthma is a serious problem encountered by a
large proportion of the population. There is currently no cure for it.
Some people say that the problem largely disappears when they enter
adulthood; many, however, live with it for life. It is a condition that
they manage through their medication and lifestyle
adaptations.</p><p><a name="06060772000054">At the
end of January this year, the Government published their White Paper on
health care outside hospitals, entitled, &#147;Our health, our care,
our say&#148;, which came out of the consultation exercise,
&#147;Your health, your care, your say&#148;. There is much to
applaud in that White Paper and much for which people with asthma have
been calling for many years. In particular, I welcome the recognition
that better community-based care can reduce hospital admissions and
thus costs. I will, however, press the Minister to take that logic
further in relation to prescription charges.</p><p><a name="06060772000055">Several specific proposals will
have come as welcome news for people with asthma. First, there are the
plans to develop so-called information prescriptions and personal care
plans for those with long-term conditions. They constitute an important
recognition that people can be the best judges of their own needs. I
hope that the Minister can confirm that information prescriptions will
be just one part of a larger drive towards self-management of long-term
medical conditions. I am sure that she will know that my colleagues
have long espoused the value of self-management for the estimated 17.5
million people in Britain living with chronic conditions.</p><p><a name="06060772000056">The potential benefits of such
an approach are considerable. For example, a person aware of the nature
of their condition and empowered to control it should be less likely to
require regular emergency treatment, thereby reducing the burden on
stretched NHS resources. Asthma UK estimates that for every
&#163;1.60 spent on personal asthma action plans, &#163;7 is saved
on NHS care. Many people with asthma resent the feeling of
powerlessness that comes with the uncertainty about when attacks might
occur. A successful self-management programme should improve a
person&#146;s mental health and self-esteem as well as promoting
their long-term physical well-being. Self-management programmes could
be integrated with greater use of voluntary sector organisations such
as Asthma UK. There is no doubt that people with asthma looking to
develop self-management programmes would benefit from the expert advice
that voluntary sector organisations can offer and from the chance to
talk to other people with asthma within that context.</p><p><a name="06060772000057">Will the Minister expand on how
the Government see self-management programmes developing? In
particular, may I encourage her to make a commitment to place a clear
duty on local health commissioners to commission self-management
packages for people with asthma involving patient groups in the design,
delivery and evaluation? I hope that she will consult her colleagues in
the Scottish Executive, who are funding a 
<br><notus-date day="7" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>7 Jun 2006 : Column 372</b><br>pilot project for personal health plans using asthma as the test
condition. I am sure that lessons can be learned from each
other&#146;s experience. The White Paper recognises that health
professionals have not always been given sufficient incentives to
manage long-term conditions. I have heard many GPs and consultants say
that asthma is sorted, but when one hears people with asthma tell
stories about what they have to put up with, it is clear that that is
certainly not so.</p><p><a name="06060772000058">As
I said, about 1,400 people die from asthma each year and about 90 per
cent. of those deaths are preventable. It is worth taking a minute to
consider how those deaths could have been
avoided.</p><p><a name="06060772000059">First, it is
important that people who are admitted to hospital with severe asthma
attacks are seen by respiratory specialists. One in five people with
asthma say that they do not get to see an asthma specialist when their
asthma becomes hard to control. There must be adequate provision of
asthma specialists across the board, from GPs and nurses with specific
asthma training to respiratory specialists for emergency admissions and
long-term support.</p><p><a name="06060772000060">Secondly, the Government must
be willing to fund properly research into the causes, treatment, cure
and prevention of asthma. Asthma UK already puts more funding into
asthma research than the Government. A recent report by the UK clinical
research collaborative found that respiratory diseases received
disproportionately low funding, considering the number of people
affected. Indeed, respiratory disease is now the most common illness
responsible for emergency admissions to hospitals and kills more people
than coronary heart
disease.</p><p><a name="06060772000061">Above all,
the Government must be committed to keeping people with asthma out of
hospital by improving their day-to-day support. Nearly 200 people are
admitted to hospital every day with emergency asthma attacks at a cost
of nearly &#163;80 million. As many as 75 per cent. of hospital
admissions are probably preventable with proper long-term care and
support.</p><p><a name="06060772000062">On 20 March,
the Secretary of State called for a30 per cent. reduction in
hospital admissions. She estimated that that would save the NHS more
than &#163;400 million a year. The Government&#146;s health White
Paper commits them to refocusing the quality and outcomes framework of
the GP contract and changing the payment by result system to encourage
greater concentration on managing long-term conditions. I welcome that
and I hope that the Minister can expand on what it might mean for
people with asthma who too often feel deprived of specialist advice on
the day-to-day management of their
condition.</p><p><a name="06060772000063">The role of
the voluntary sector is vital. I hope hon. Members will not object if I
focus on the services provided by Asthma UK as it is the example with
which I am most familiar. That is not intended as a slight on the many
other charities and support groups that provide excellent services for
people with asthma, but I wish to highlight the role of Asthma UK
because it has been developing the concept of self-management for some
time. The Government could learn much from its example and establish a
useful partnership with Asthma UK on the
issue.</p><p><a name="06060772000064">Asthma UK
provides an advice line, which is staffed by specialist nurses, who can
offer advice on 
<br><notus-date day="7" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>7 Jun 2006 : Column 373</b><br>medication and effective self-management. It has also helped thousands
of people develop personal asthma action plans or care plans, which
already deliver genuine benefits in reducing symptoms and improving
quality of life. However, research by Asthma UK suggests that only 24
per cent. of people with asthma have care plans. I know that the
Minister will want to explain how the Government intend to extend such
plans so that people with asthma have access to them.</p><p><a name="06060772000065">The Minister may be interested
to hear about Asthma UK&#146;s control test&#151;a 60-second,
five-point questionnaire that helps people to understand how their
asthma is controlled, with a simple score out of 25. I tried it today
and I am pleased to say that I scored 23 out of 25, which is not too
bad. I encourage hon. Members to take part in the census because it is
a good way in which to assess how well one&#146;s asthma is being
controlled.</p><p><a name="06060772000066">I hope
that the Minister will join me in applauding a joint collaboration
between Asthma UK, the British Heart Foundation and Diabetes UK, which
have worked with primary care trusts, the Department of Health, the
Healthcare Commission and the National Institute for Health and
Clinical Excellence to develop a so-called
&#147;commissioners&#146; toolkit&#148;. It is intended to
outline examples of good practice in the treatment of long-term
conditions such as asthma, heart conditions and diabetes and is to be
made available to all commissioners of health care.</p><p><a name="06060772000067">The final issue that I would
like to raise is, I believe, one of the most important, which ties in
closely with the theme that I have sought to develop, namely reducing
hospital admissions through encouraging self-management of asthma. It
is prescription charges. The current system of exemptions from
prescription charges dates from 1968 and makes little sense now, if it
ever did. The Minister will remember the 2002 report by Mr. Wanless,
entitled, &#147;Securing our Future Health: Taking a Long-Term
View&#148;. In it, Mr. Wanless stated:</p><a name="06060772000105"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;The present structure
of exemptions from prescription charges is not logical, nor rooted in
the principles of the NHS. If related issues are being considered in
future, it is recommended that the opportunity should be taken to think
about the rationale for the exemption
policy.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06060772000068">Members
will be familiar with the general arguments for extending exemptions to
a greater range of long-term conditions, but I hope that they will
forgive me if I reiterate some of the key points. The present system
fails the test of fairness. People with diabetes and certain forms of
epilepsy are exempt from prescription charges, but people with
arthritis, asthma, mental illness and multiple sclerosis are not. Those
with an underactive thyroid are exempt, but those with an overactive
thyroid are not.</p><p><a name="06060772000069">The
present system hits the poorest hardest. The Government&#146;s 2000
NHS plan
states:</p><a name="06060772000106"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;New
charges increase the proportion of funding from the unhealthy, old and
poor compared with the healthy, young and wealthy. In particular, high
charges risk worsening access to healthcare by the
poor.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06060772000070">People with
incomes barely above the income support level have to meet the full
cost of prescriptions, providing them with two disincentives: a
disincentive to work and a disincentive to pay for necessary
prescriptions. The knock-on effects of this problem are precisely those
that we all wish to avoid. Prescription 
<br><notus-date day="7" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>7 Jun 2006 : Column 374</b><br>charges discourage people with asthma from taking medication to control
their condition, and encourage them to think of treatment as something
only to be taken in an emergency. This increases emergency hospital
admissions, thus increasing costs to the NHS. It may also lead to a
number of preventable deaths every year.</p><p><a name="06060772000071">I am pleased to report that the
Scottish Executive are undertaking a review of prescription charges.
They have recognised the innate unfairness in the system, and the
extensive review will include a full literature review, consultation
and debate. I hope that the Government will read the review
documentation and have discussions with the Scottish Executive about
their emerging
conclusions.</p><p><a name="06060772000072">I do not
expect the Minister to make new policy in this Chamber at this time. I
would, however, welcome her personal view on how the system of
exemptions for prescription charges might develop in the future. As she
knows, my party committed itself at the last election to an independent
review to suggest reforms to the system of exemptions. I would be
grateful if she could tell me whether she sees merit in this
suggestion. I would also be grateful to hear the views of others on
this matter. It is my view that free prescriptions for people with
asthma would do much to help them to control their condition and live
normal lives, and I would welcome a range of views on the
issue.</p><p><a name="06060772000073">I would now
like to give the Minister a chance to give a full response, and I hope
that she will make specific reference to the important issues that I
have raised about people with
asthma.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="06060772000112">7.22
pm</h5><p><a name="06060772000074"><b><a name="06060772000118">The
Minister of State, Department of Health(Ms Rosie
Winterton):</b> I congratulate the hon. Member for Dunfermline
and West Fife (Willie Rennie) on securing this important debate today.
I saw by the way in which he set out his personal experiences how
strongly he feels about this issue. I would also like to join him in
paying tribute to the outstanding contribution of bodies such as Asthma
UK, and I shall say more about their work
later.</p><p><a name="06060772000075">As the hon.
Gentleman graphically described, there are approximately 5 million
people whose lives are blighted by asthma to a greater or lesser
degree. The big challenge is to find ways for people to manage their
condition through medication and lifestyle adaptation. Again, the hon.
Gentleman described his personal experience in that regard. Our aim for
patients is certainly to move away from care that is reactive,
unplanned and episodic, and to put in place an approach that is centred
on early detection, disease management and promoting independence. That
will involve offering a personalised care plan and improving care in
primary and community-based services, particularly for the most
vulnerable people. Such an approach will not only improve personal
health outcomes for people with long-term conditions; it will also
reduce avoidable hospital visits. The hon. Gentleman touched on that
issue as well, and I hope that he will welcome our commitment to trying
to reduce emergency bed days by 5 per cent. by 2008.</p><p><a name="06060772000076">This whole programme of work,
which is called &#147;Supporting People with Long-term
Conditions&#148;, was 
<br><notus-date day="7" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>7 Jun 2006 : Column 375</b><br>launched in 2005. It set out a new NHS and social care model
specifically designed to help local NHS and social care organisations
to improve care for people with long-term
conditions.</p><p><a name="06060772000077">From the
outset, self-care has been a vital component of that model. We want to
help NHS organisations to develop a local self-care strategy, which
means working with local agencies, the community, the voluntary sector
and&#151;as the hon. Gentleman said&#151;the people themselves and
their carers. As the hon. Gentleman also said, part of that involves
information prescription. I am happy to reassure him that information
prescription is an important part of our approach to
self-management.</p><p><a name="06060772000078">I am
glad that the hon. Gentleman welcomes the White Paper. The theme of
community-based services and supported self-care for people with
long-term conditions and their families, especially those with asthma,
emerged strongly in our consultation. Here again joined-up thinking and
working is vital, and not just between health and social care partners.
As we said in the White Paper, local strategic partnerships will be
responsible for the delivery of services and for ensuring that they are
genuinely integrated and, crucially, focused on the needs of
individuals.</p><p><a name="06060772000079">The hon.
Gentleman mentioned the work of the Scottish Executive. We shall, of
course, want to hear and learn from our colleagues in Scotland, and
elsewhere for that matter, but I am sure that the hon. Gentleman will
be interested to know that the PRODIGY system that is used in GP
surgeries in England generates personalised asthma action plans based
on guidelines produced by the British Thoracic Society and the Scottish
Intercollegiate Guidelines
Network.</p><p><a name="06060772000080"><b><a name="06060772000119">Willie
Rennie:</b> Will the Minister give
way?</p><p><a name="06060772000081"><b><a name="06060772000120">Ms
Winterton:</b> I will give way, but because the hon. Gentleman
has not left me much time, I may not be able to deal with all the
points that he raised if I
do.</p><p><a name="06060772000082"><b><a name="06060772000121">Willie
Rennie:</b> As I think the Minister will admit, self-care is
not about simply letting people loose or letting them free. It probably
requires harder work to arrange for them to be included in
self-management plans. Self-management plans are not simply about
printed forms; they are about agreements and
partnerships.</p><p><a name="06060772000083"><b><a name="06060772000122">Ms
Winterton:</b> That is absolutely true. The expert patient
programme, for instance, has proved to be a very good way of helping
people to manage their conditions and learn about them. I realise that
it is not always easy, but the benefits are
enormous.</p><p><a name="06060772000084">It has been
the policy of successive Governments that those who can afford to make
a small contribution to the costs of medicines should do so. I assure
the hon. Gentleman that the existing list of medical conditions that
give exemption from prescription charges has been reviewed on a number
of occasions, but no clear-cut case for extending it has emerged. There
is no consensus on additional conditions that 
<br><notus-date day="7" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>7 Jun 2006 : Column 376</b><br>might be included, or on how distinctions could be drawn between one
condition and another or between a mild form of a condition and a
severe one. It is a difficult issue, and it has been considered, but I
am sorry to tell the hon. Gentleman that we currently have no plans to
extend that particular list. What we have been doing is giving priority
to helping those who have difficulty in paying charges. Nearly 90 per
cent. of prescriptions are already issued free of charge because of the
extensive exemption and charge remission
arrangements.</p><p><a name="06060772000085">The hon.
Gentleman described the vital role of the voluntary sector, and I
entirely agree with what he said. He spoke of the work done by Asthma
UK in raising awareness of the condition, and mentioned the reception
attended by the Secretary of State on world asthma day. That
constituted a vital contribution to the development of national
policy.</p><p><a name="06060772000086">The hon.
Gentleman referred to the commissioners&#146; toolkit that Asthma UK
has been working on with my Department. It will be extremely useful in
ensuring that there are good services at a local level for people with
asthma. The Minister of State, Department of Health, my hon. Friend the
Member for Don Valley (Caroline Flint), who is responsible for public
health, has discussed smoking policies with Asthma UK, and I know that
she found that very useful.</p><p><a name="06060772000087">Asthma UK has done a lot of
work at a local level. There is a project in West Sussex that provides
swimming lessons for children with asthma, and a project in Hackney is
training 80 people in self-management and in how to live healthy
lifestyles. Those are exactly the kind of approaches that the hon.
Gentleman set out.</p><p><a name="06060772000088">Last July, my
hon. Friend the Minister for Immigration, Citizenship and Nationality,
in his former role as Minister with responsibility for care services,
announced the Third Sector Commissioning Task Force. Its programme is
to identify barriers to achieving that strong relationship between the
voluntary and public sectors. We want to promote that relationship, but
we must ensure that we look out for barriers and see what we can do to
assist in removing them.</p><p><a name="06060772000089">In terms of asthma specialists,
we have more doctors, nurses and other health care professionals than
ever before within the NHS. It is from that expanded work force that
specialists of all kinds will be drawn.</p><p><a name="06060772000090">The hon. Gentleman also asked
about research. The agency through which we carry out research is the
Medical Research Council. We consider the ways in which we can
contribute to increasing research in all areas.</p><p><a name="06060772000091">I hope that I have given an
indication of how the Government have put the concerns of those living
with long-term conditions at the heart of our reform agenda. Diseases
such as asthma present a massive challenge to the health and social
care system. It is a challenge that will need to be met by services
that benefit not only from the increased funding in the system, but
from the reforms to service delivery. By focusing on the needs of
patients, we empower them to take control of their own health and
care.</p><p><a name="06060772000092"><i> Question put
