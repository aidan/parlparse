 (LD): What plans she has for the disbursement of single farm payments. [10106]
</p>



<p><a name="st_o2"><a name="50707-01_spmin1"><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs  (Jim Knight): </b> 
 As announced in February 2005, the Rural Payments Agency expects to start making payments under the new single payments scheme in February 2006.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o3"><a name="50707-01_spnew1"><b> Andrew George: </b> 
 At the NFU conference in February this year, the Secretary of State made it clear that the Government were minded to make interim payments to farmers under the single farm payments scheme to help the many thousands of farmers who will inevitably suffer cash flow problems, provided that they are within European rules, which has yet to be checked. Will the Under-Secretary confirm that such two-stage payments are permissible within European rules?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o4"><a name="50707-01_spnew2"><b> Jim Knight: </b> 
 We have not ruled out making an advance payment but it would need new EU legislation, something we are discussing actively with the Commission.

<p><a name="st_o5"><a name="50707-01_spnew3"><b> Mr. Lindsay Hoyle  (Chorley)</b> 
 (Lab): I can assure my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary that the measure is very important to farmers all over country. The farmers in Chorley to whom I have spoken are very worried that the February cheques may not arrive and they need that cash flow. Will my hon. Friend ensure that if it looks like there will be a hiccup or that the cheques will not get there, there will be interim payments, without which those farmers will struggle during a bad time, coming up to Christmas?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o6"><a name="50707-01_spnew4"><b> Jim Knight: </b> 
 It remains our priority to ensure that we meet the target date of February of next year. That is what Ministers are actively focused on. Advance payment carries a considerable risk with changes to the new IT system, which have been the cause of some of the teething troubles. We are also in discussion with banks on the cash flow implications for their farming customers of implementing a new scheme.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o7"><a name="50707-01_spnew5"><b> Mr. Peter Atkinson  (Hexham)</b> 
 (Con): I also support the demand for interim payments. The Under-Secretary may not be aware that, in the past few days, the price of fat stock has collapsed by 10&nbsp;per cent. If that continues until the big sales in the autumn, livestock farmers, particularly upland ones, will have a serious cash flow problem. If there is a delay in the single farm payment cheques, farmers will have serious problems.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o8"><a name="50707-01_spnew6"><b> Jim Knight: </b> 
 There is not much else I can add for the hon. Gentleman. Obviously, I take seriously what he says about his constituents, and hill farmers in particular, but we are focused on achieving the February target that we have set. We are also mindful of the difficulties that farmers are facing and we are having the discussions I talked about earlier.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o9"><a name="50707-01_spnew7"><b> Mr. David Drew  (Stroud)</b> 
 (Lab/Co-op): It is good to hear my hon. Friend say that this matter is being given the correct priority. At my rural issues task force meeting on Friday, this was the most important issue to be discussed. A representative of the banks was there and indicated that the Government were asking whether the banks might lend money to farmers free of interest. That is a novel idea that we could examine in other fields, but as long as we can get the message out to those farmers that we will make those payments, a lot of the fears will be assuaged.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o10"><a name="50707-01_spnew8"><b> Jim Knight: </b> 
 As ever, I am grateful to my hon. Friend and I pay tribute to his work in liaising with farmers in his rural constituency and in keeping the House up to date with these matters.

 (DUP): Will the Minister comment on the recent attacks on single farm payments by the Government and will he assure us that that will not hinder any of the payments?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o12"><a name="50707-01_spnew10"><b> Jim Knight: </b> 
 If I heard the hon. Gentleman correctly, he was suggesting that the Government were attacking the single farm payments scheme. We are not. Obviously we are discussing CAP reform in the wider context of the European finance settlement and we are doing that in the interests of the country, of farmers and of European citizens.

<p><a name="st_o13"><a name="50707-01_spnew11"><b> Mr. James Paice  (South-East Cambridgeshire)</b> 
 (Con): The Minister referred to the February target date. He will be aware that the Government&#039;s target is to start paying in February, but to pay 96&nbsp;per cent. by the end of March. Does he accept that most farmers therefore assume that they are looking at March at the earliest, rather than February? Is he aware that some of the single farm payment money has been hived off, or modulated off, to pay for the entry level scheme, and that that scheme, too, is in absolute chaos? Farmers who asked for help six months ago still cannot make their applications. Not only are they facing a delay in their substantive single farm payment, their access to the other money&#151;they see that money as theirs by right because it was originally modulated off&#151;is being delayed even further into the distance. How much longer do we have to wait before the Government make a decision stemming from the remarks that the Secretary of State made at the NFU conference six months ago?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o14"><a name="50707-01_spnew12"><b> Jim Knight: </b> 
 My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State has made no secret of her anger and frustration at some of the delays. As and when we have something to announce with certainty, we will do so. However, as things stand for both the entry-level scheme and the single payments scheme, we remain committed to the February payment.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o15"><a name="50707-01_spnew13"><b> David Taylor  (North-West Leicestershire)</b> 
 (Lab/Co-op): Like many MPs with rural constituencies, I frequently meet National Farmers Union representatives over a quarterly cycle. Could the Minister clarify for those who raised the point with me at our last meeting whether it will be possible to buy or sell land or entitlements after the single payments scheme has started?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o16"><a name="50707-01_spnew14"><b> Jim Knight: </b> 
 I might have to get back to my hon. Friend on that question. Some of the complex aspects of the single payments scheme leave me a little perplexed at times, and that is possibly one of them.

</p>



<p><a name="st_o17"><a name="50707-01_spmin2"><b>The Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs  (Margaret Beckett): </b> 
 Latest figures show that the original 15&nbsp;EU members had reduced their greenhouse gas emissions in 2003&nbsp;by 1.7&nbsp;per cent. compared with the Kyoto base year and are on track to meet their combined Kyoto target of an 8&nbsp;per cent. reduction through planned policies and measures and use of the Kyoto mechanisms. The enlarged EU had reduced its emissions in 2003&nbsp;by 5.5&nbsp;per cent. compared with 1990.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o18"><a name="50707-01_spnew15"><b> Mr. Hunt: </b> 
 Does the Secretary of State agree, given the relatively slow progress being made by the EU towards meeting its Kyoto targets, given that yesterday President Bush once again affirmed that he would not be prepared to accept compulsory emissions targets for the United States, and given that the developing world has consistently said that it will prioritise economic growth 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>7 Jul 2005 : Column 430</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>over environmental targets, today&#039;s discussions at Gleneagles are more about rhetoric than reality? Does she accept that when it comes to securing a global consensus on emissions targets we are going backwards, not forwards, instead of going &quot;Forward, not back&quot;?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o19"><a name="50707-01_spnew16"><b> Margaret Beckett: </b> 
 No, I do not agree. What is more, I am surprised that the tone of the hon. Gentleman&#039;s voice suggests that he would take pleasure from such an outcome. It is definitely not in the interests of the world either for there to be discouragement of attempts to reach agreement to move things forward at Gleneagles or for there to be anything other than a warm welcome if we are able to achieve such movements. It is certainly recognised outside the United Kingdom&#151;whether or not it is recognised here&#151;that already in this G8&nbsp;year this country has done an enormous amount to put the issue of climate change much more prominently on the agenda of leaders across the world and to engage, for example, the Chinese, Indian and South African Governments and others much more fully in discussions about what the global community can do to tackle those problems than has ever been the case before. I think that the whole House will welcome that: it certainly should.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o20"><a name="50707-01_spnew17"><b> Norman Baker  (Lewes)</b> 
 (LD): The EU is definitely taking steps to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and I am sure that the EU states at Gleneagles will argue for a strong post-Kyoto regime as a way forward on the issue. We all want the US to sign up to such a regime. However, I suspect that the choice will be between a coalition of the willing, excluding the US, signing a strong agreement to tackle climate change, and an agreement watered down so far&#151;so that the US can sign up to it&#151;that it is almost meaningless. Which would she prefer?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o21"><a name="50707-01_spnew18"><b> Margaret Beckett: </b> 
 What I would prefer is for the G8&nbsp;to reach a consensus at Gleneagles on something that is strong enough. That will not, of course, satisfy those who have set high and ambitious goals&#151;in some cases, perhaps, deliberately and in others through lack of understanding&#151;that there is no prospect of the G8&nbsp;talks securing. We are anxious to achieve three goals. First, we want an acceptance&#151;whatever the precise wording or exact phrases people are prepared to sign up to&#151;of the direction of travel and that this is a major and significant problem that requires urgent action. Secondly, we would like a plan of action to cut emissions, not just to set targets for cutting emissions, on which the G8&nbsp;could agree. Thirdly, we would particularly like to achieve an agreement to have a forward dialogue about what we do after the first Kyoto commitment period, in which so far no one in the developed or developing world has yet been prepared to engage.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o22"><a name="50707-01_spnew19"><b> Mark Lazarowicz  (Edinburgh, North and Leith)</b> 
 (Lab/Co-op): Most of us who want action on tackling climate change hope that agreement will be reached at Gleneagles, and recognise the work that my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister has done to put the issue on the agenda of that meeting. Whatever happens at Gleneagles, Britain clearly has the opportunity to set the tone for the EU for the next six months and beyond. Will my right hon. Friend confirm that it remains the 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>7 Jul 2005 : Column 431</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>British Government&#039;s view that environmental sustainability goes hand in hand with economic reform as one of the top priorities for the next six months, and there is no way that we should be required to choose between them when setting the direction of EU policy for our presidency and beyond?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o23"><a name="50707-01_spnew20"><b> Margaret Beckett: </b> 
 I strongly share that view, as do the Government. That is a point of view and a track record that we strongly commend to the rest of the world. Whether we like it or not, many countries have significant energy needs and could have a significant impact on climate change, but they might be less prepared&#151;or not prepared at all&#151;to act if they thought that they would have to sacrifice the opportunity of developing or, indeed, of feeding their populations. We have to make it plain to them that they do not face that invidious choice, because they can do both.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o24"><a name="50707-01_spnew21"><b> Richard Ottaway  (Croydon, South)</b> 
 (Con): I recognise that the Government have had considerable success in moving this matter up the political agenda. The right hon. Lady will acknowledge that there is a gulf between those who agree that the planet is warming because of mankind&#039;s actions, and those who do not. Has she considered setting up some form of research, possibly jointly with the G8&nbsp;or the EU, to get the world&#039;s finest scientists to try to nail down whether mankind is causing global warming? If there were such research, it would carry the authority to enable the Secretary of State to make progress on the matter.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o25"><a name="50707-01_spnew22"><b> Margaret Beckett: </b> 
 I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for his support for the goals that the Government have set. I take his point, but in many ways that was what we sought to do through the conference that was convened in Exeter in February&#151;which perhaps did not receive as much publicity as it should have done, because there was rather a lot of publicity about some potential elections. There is no doubt that the conference advanced our understanding that the threat is more substantial and more immediate than previously imagined, and that it will cost less to tackle it than we had previously thought if we begin early enough. That is both an encouraging and a discouraging message. Only a few days ago, the national academies of science of every G8&nbsp;country and China, India and Brazil produced a strong joint statement about their belief that climate change is happening and is man made. Through our G8&nbsp;and EU presidencies, I hope that we will be able to take action to tackle it.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o26"><a name="50707-01_spnew23"><b> Mr. Oliver Letwin  (West Dorset)</b> 
 (Con): I share the Secretary of State&#039;s hope that the discussions at Gleneagles today will produce a way forward that leads to a process, at least, that leads in turn to agreement on action by China, India, Brazil and perhaps the US, as well as the EU. However, the Secretary of State will recognise that the EU also needs to be seen to play its part. While she is undoubtedly right that there has been some slight progress, she will also recognise that the EU has not made great progress. I hope that she also agrees that the UK needs to play its part if it is to take a leading role. Does she accept that at the moment the UK is not

</p>








<p><a name="st_o27"><a name="50707-01_spnew24"><b> Margaret Beckett: </b> 
 Of course, we all want the EU to meet its targets and commitments. Indeed, one of the things that we will do during our EU presidency is try to focus attention on the degree to which that is happening.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50707-01_para0">
<a name="stpa_o0">The signs are more encouraging than the right hon. Gentleman suggested, however. About 15&nbsp;member states, including the United Kingdom, are expected to either meet or exceed their individual Kyoto targets, without taking into account the impact of the EU emissions trading scheme, which we cannot yet quantify. Indeed, in the wider EU, another nine countries are on track to meet their Kyoto targets. The United Kingdom has already met its Kyoto target for greenhouse gas emissions&#151;something that is often overlooked&#151;several years ahead of time. We are on track, even in present circumstances, to exceed our Kyoto target to the degree that the latest predictions are that our greenhouse gas emissions will be down by 20&nbsp;per cent., not 12.5&nbsp;per cent., by 2010.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50707-01_para1">
<a name="stpa_o1">None the less, the right hon. Gentleman is absolutely right that, although we have done better on other greenhouse gases, we have a continuing problem with CO <sub>2</sub> . That is why we are having a review of our climate change programme at the present time to get us back on track. I hope that we will able to show the House that we can do so and that we will have the support of the whole House in that.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o28"><a name="50707-01_spnew25"><b> Mr. Letwin: </b> 
 The Secretary of State will certainly have the support of the Opposition in taking measures to address the CO <sub>2</sub> problem, which I am glad she acknowledges. Does she also acknowledge, however, that her Department needs to play its role in a coherent fashion? If she does, can she explain why the Warm Front programme, which her Department sponsors and pays for and which is doing excellent work in relieving fuel poverty and insulating houses, is also subsidising the introduction of oil-fired central heating? At the same time, the clear skies programme is funding a joint venture involving the same organisation that runs Warm Front to institute photovoltaics. Why is the Department sponsoring at the same time something that increases CO <sub>2</sub> and also something that reduces it, rather than melding the two?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o29"><a name="50707-01_spnew26"><b> Margaret Beckett: </b> 
 Although the right hon. Gentleman is right to identify that my Department funds the Warm Front programme, we do not run it ourselves; we run it through companies and agencies. Without knowing the precise circumstances to which he alludes, I cannot know whether there were specific and valid reasons why oil-fired central heating might have been pursued in a particular case, although I can certainly say, for example, that I have lived in a place where there was no gas supply and very few other options.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50707-01_para2">
<a name="stpa_o2">I cannot comment on a specific case without knowing the circumstances, but it is certainly the case that through the Warm Front programme, and in any other respect, we attempt to be consistent and to ensure that we meet our own goals.

 Many articles were placed by the Government before the general election indicating that they were tackling all sorts of environmental crime, including litter, chewing gum on the pavements, people repairing cars on the streets and other such stuff. Expectations were raised and people expected local authorities to act. The only problem is that most of the really sexy stuff&#151;the stuff with teeth&#151;does not take effect until 2006&nbsp;or 2007, so people are getting very frustrated and they are blaming local authorities, which are also getting frustrated. Will Ministers make clear which bits of the 2005&nbsp;Act are in force today and which bits will come into force in 2006&nbsp;and 2007, so that people do not have frustrated expectations about which bits of environmental crime will be tackled?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o32"><a name="50707-02_spnew1"><b> Mr. Bradshaw: </b> 
 It might take me rather a long time to read out the whole list of which bits come in when. I do not know where the hon. Gentleman gets his idea about 2007, as all the provisions will have commenced by April next year. The provisions that have already commenced include those on litter, adverts, waste and noise. In October, there will be further commencements on abandoned vehicles, and more on waste and crime and disorder. As I said, the rest of the measures will all have commenced by April 2006.

 I would be happy to provide my hon. Friend with the clarification for which he asks, but I say to him and to other hon.

That process requires proper consultation, as I think hon. Members would expect. The details of the provisions of the excellent 2005&nbsp;Act extend across a number of Departments&#151;the Home Office, the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister and local government&#151;and it will involve consultation with other Departments. I hope that he will join me in applauding the provisions of the Act. As I am sure he will agree, local environment issues are high on people&#039;s agenda.

<p><a name="st_o35"><a name="50707-02_spmin1"><b>The Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs  (Margaret Beckett): </b> 
 The UK biscuit industry needs to be able to buy its raw materials at similar prices to others on the world market. We will therefore be looking for substantial price cuts and increased competition as key elements in an EU sugar reform agreement.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o36"><a name="50707-02_spnew4"><b> Mr. Prentice: </b> 
 My right hon. Friend will know that in Pendle we have a celebrated biscuit maker, Farmhouse Biscuits, which exports its tasty biscuits throughout the world. It does so, however, with one hand tied behind its back, as it has to pay &#163;450&nbsp;a tonne for EU sugar, while it could buy world sugar at &#163;150&nbsp;a tonne. Even with the proposed changes in the EU sugar regime, Farmhouse Biscuits will still be paying more for EU sugar than it could get on the world market. I press my right hon. Friend to do something about this matter, because we are now importing more biscuits, cakes and confectionary into the United Kingdom than we are exporting&#151;and that is not very good.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o37"><a name="50707-02_spnew5"><b> Margaret Beckett: </b> 
 I am grateful to my hon. Friend because he not only makes a very powerful point, but gives a perfect example of why the issue of sugar reform is important much more widely than among groups that are usually quoted in respect of their views and understandable concern about the impacts of potential reform. He is right that even if the reforms went through entirely as proposed by the Commission, EU sugar prices would still be twice the world price. That gives a clear picture of why the regime is unsustainable and has to be reformed. I realise that it will be only a crumb of comfort to him to know that the price comes down by a third.

 I am grateful to the hon. Lady. It is very much part of our goal and our wish to see export subsidies as a whole phased out. She is right to identify that one of the areas of concern is the impact of long-needed reform on growers in African, Caribbean and Pacific countries and the least-developed countries. She will probably know that, alongside proposals for the sugar regime, there were proposals for an action plan to help those countries. During our presidency of the European Union, discussions on sugar reform will be on the agenda of every meeting of the Agriculture Council. One of those meetings will indeed hear from ACP and other such producers that are affected.

 We will assist farmers by applying animal health rules sensibly and considering reinstatement of walls and fencing necessary to maintain environmental objectives.

 I am grateful to the Minister for that encouraging reply. Areas around Snilesworth moor and Arden moor, north-west of Helmsley, have suffered utter devastation. Trees have been uprooted and up to 50&nbsp;miles of walls and fences have basically been destroyed. Much of that was paid for by Government grants, so Ministers have an investment. The hill farmers cannot afford to pay to put right the damage. We have established an emergency fund locally, and I hope that the Government will make a significant contribution to it.

<p><a name="st_o48"><a name="50707-03_spnew0"><b> Daniel Kawczynski: </b> 
 I thank the Minister for that reply. I met a farmer recently in my constituency, in the village of Cruckton, near Shrewsbury. He was so desperate about TB that he allegedly shot a badger. He got into terrible trouble with the local police. There is an effective moratorium on the granting of licences for the killing of badgers. This is putting farmers such as my constituent in a terrible position. I ask the Government to look at the matter again and to relax the granting of licences for killing badgers.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o49"><a name="50707-03_spnew1"><b> Mr. Bradshaw: </b> 
 I have every sympathy for the farmer to whom the hon. Gentleman refers. If he proposes relaxing licensing conditions to allow individual farmers at a local level to obtain licences, I must point him to the evidence of our badger culling trials, which show that the localised limited culling of badgers makes the bovine TB situation worse. The hon. Gentleman is wrong to imply that there is no badger culling going on at present. More culling is taking place under our own trials than took place when the Conservative party was last in office.

 (PC): During the NFU conference in February, the Secretary of State responded to a question on this issue. The people in the hall were rather underwhelmed by what she said. This matter has been going on for so many years. Every vet will say that there is a definite connection between bovine tuberculosis and badgers. When will we see a properly structured selective cull? It is all very well talking about receiving evidence from here, there and everywhere, but we are five or six years down the road and nothing has happened. Money is being wasted on destroying cattle and it is a matter of the Government sitting on their hands. It may be unpopular to kill off some badgers, but at some point the Government will have to grasp the nettle, and a proper selective cull will have to be introduced, which in effect will assist the species.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o53"><a name="50707-03_spnew5"><b> Mr. Bradshaw: </b> 
 As I have said on many occasions, the Government are not shying away from difficult decisions on this matter. The hon. Gentleman uses the term &quot;selective cull&quot;. What does he mean by that term? There is currently no live test for bovine TB in badgers. So any cull, by implication, would not be selective. As I have said repeatedly before the House, we are not ruling out badger culling. However, any decision on badger culling must be based on sound science. We must be satisfied that it would be cost effective, would work and would be practicable.

 (LD): Does not the Minister recognise that bovine TB has become an extremely serious issue for farmers, particularly in the south-west and Sussex? It is a big animal welfare problem as well, for both livestock and badgers. Does the hon. Gentleman accept that farmers believe that the Government are kicking this issue into the long grass and not taking early decisions when they could do so? Is it not time that funding was made available for pre-movement tests for cattle movements and a proper test to ensure that we control the badger population where there is an identified link with bovine TB and that population in particular areas?

 I note the hon. Gentleman&#039;s suggestion that more taxpayers&#039; money should be spent on paying for the costs of pre-movement testing. I do not agree with that.

</p>








<p><a name="st_o61"><a name="50707-03_spnew12"><b> Mr. Turner: </b> 
 I notice that the Minister cannot answer the question. It will not surprise him that I refer to Sue Hemmings&#039;s pet crematorium and pet cemetery in my constituency, where five animals a year are buried. She faces licence application fees of &#163;6,000&nbsp;and &#163;1,100&nbsp;a year.

</p>








<p><a name="st_o62"><a name="50707-03_spnew13"><b> Mr. Morley: </b> 
 There are two issues here. Regulation is important and has a sensible role, in relation to pet cemeteries as well as other things. The other issue is the cost. It is not unreasonable to examine the costs to see whether they are proportionate. Of course there has to be an element of inspection and management, and it is 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>7 Jul 2005 : Column 439</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>not unreasonable that people who are part of what is being inspected should contribute towards that. That is a fair distribution of burdens. However, I understand the hon. Gentleman&#039;s point, and the Under-Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, my hon.

</p>








<p><a name="st_o64"><a name="50707-03_spnew15"><b> Mr. Morley: </b> 
 In this case, the cause is not so much the regulatory system as the workings of the market. Like my hon. Friend, I would much prefer recycled plastics to be used in our own country, but I am glad to see that more and more plastics are being taken out of the waste stream; that is extremely desirable. The fact that there is strong demand in China that underpins the market has some benefits in terms of keeping the market going and developing it. Specific kinds of plastics may be available in other countries that fit the demands of some of the processes here. The waste and resources action programme is considering the whole issue of plastics and the market for them, and I am sure that it will address some of my hon. Friend&#039;s points.

<p><a name="st_o88"><a name="50707-05_spmin0"><b>The Minister for Climate Change and the Environment  (Mr. Elliot Morley): </b> 
 We very much welcome the timely publication of the Green Paper, which represents a real opportunity to influence the future development of energy efficiency policy in Europe. We will therefore be taking forward the public debate on the Commission&#039;s proposals during our presidency with the aim of securing an ambitious plan of action.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o89"><a name="50707-05_spnew0"><b> Mr. Crabb: </b> 
 I thank the Minister for that reply. In November 2004, the Prime Minister told his MPs to reject amendments to the Housing Bill that would have increased home energy efficiency targets. What will the Government do to encourage energy efficiency improvements in the UK?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o90"><a name="50707-05_spnew1"><b> Mr. Morley: </b> 
 The Government are implementing a range of initiatives to improve energy efficiency. Those measures must be effective and realistic and they must work. Of course we discussed the warm front programme earlier, which is an important part of the way in which we address fuel poverty. A review of building regulations is ongoing. They will come in from April next year and are designed to reduce energy use by 20&nbsp;to 30&nbsp;per cent. in new buildings. We also have an

<br>&nbsp;<br>Anglo-Swedish initiative on sustainable housing in addition to other initiatives. Energy efficiency features in the climate change review and a joint Treasury energy efficiency review is going on to examine all these matters, because energy efficiency is a serious matter and one of the most effective ways of reducing emissions and meeting our carbon dioxide targets.

</p>








<p><a name="st_o92"><a name="50707-05_spnew3"><b> Mr. Morley: </b> 
 My hon. Friend is quite right: there is real potential for micro-generation. I was pleased with the recent policy statement made by my hon. Friend the Minister for Energy about the Government&#039;s commitment to encouraging micro-generation. We need to examine certain issues, such as planning and the actual technology, but in the near future we will have the real prospect of micro-wind turbines being available for domestic use. We will also have the prospect of micro-combined heat and power plants. We are already encouraging biomass generation and my hon. Friend might like to know that the new Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs office in Gloucester had a biomass central heating system fitted recently.

 (Con): While I accept the importance of the points that the hon. Gentleman has just made, will he pay regard to the fact that he has a responsibility for the beautiful and fragile landscape of these islands? Does he thus accept that wind farms are not a very acceptable way of creating sustainable energy and that, in addition to the things that he rightly mentioned, we need to look carefully at the nuclear option?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o94"><a name="50707-05_spnew5"><b> Mr. Morley: </b> 
 I do not accept the hon. Gentleman&#039;s point and especially his assertion that wind farms are not sustainable. I commend the recent Sustainable Development Commission report to him. The commission examined the whole question of wind generation and reached the conclusion that onshore wind generation is currently the cheapest form of energy generation and that it has increasingly become more efficient and effective. Of course there are questions about the landscape and visual perception, but they are subjective. There are people who do not object to the look of wind turbines and in fact find them attractive. The nuclear generation option was left open in the energy White Paper, but if we consider the possible costs of, and time scales involved in, nuclear power, there is a lot that we can do on clean and renewable energy in the short term, rather than going down the nuclear route now.

However, on the other hand, micro-wind generation is a new British-built technology, so we do not want to put unnecessary barriers in the way of its development and application. The balance that must be struck will form part of our debate on wind generation. It also forms part of the strategy that my hon. Friend the Minister for Energy is considering and that we in DEFRA are considering, too.

However, we should reflect on the fact that not all farmers in my hon. Friend&#039;s constituency&#151;an area that I know well&#151;enjoy enormous financial support from the CAP. I saw a report this week on the plight of hill farmers in places such as the High Peak of Derbyshire, where they certainly often struggle to make ends meet financially. We should not always assume that every farmer benefits enormously from the CAP. That is often far from the case.

 I wonder whether the Leader of the House could give some thought during his busy week to ministerial courtesies. When we in the Opposition were fortunate enough to be Ministers and Members of Parliament&#151;our parliamentary colleagues&#151;asked to see us, we went out of our way to ensure that they did, particularly Opposition MPs, because we were very conscious of the fact that they could not usually nobble us or get to us in the Division Lobby. In the past couple of weeks, I have made written requests on perfectly valid constituency issues&#151;one was on a community hospital, the other on the effect of the closure of a railway line&#151;to see two of his ministerial colleagues that have been dealt with fairly peremptorily by one paragraph letters. The Leader of the House has expressed concern about turnout at general elections. It is not surprising if turnout falls at general elections if Ministers are contemptuous of the perfectly legitimate concerns of Members of Parliament. It is a matter of courtesy that perhaps he could take up with his colleagues.

With that in mind, will he arrange for a debate on the future of state school cricket, so that we can look at ways of making it far more competitive, and put it on an equal footing with the cricket played in the independent sector?

 I once tried to demonstrate how cricket is played to my American family, with conspicuous lack of success. It is certainly important that, in providing the extra funding that goes to sport, such funding is associated not only with the Olympic bid, but with the Government&#039;s overall programme for supporting sporting excellence in this country and that we do not neglect sports such as cricket, which are clearly hugely important to the people of the United Kingdom.

Moreover, there is the question of corruption and of where the money is going. Given that this issue will come before the G8&nbsp;tomorrow, will the Leader of the House draw the attention of the Secretary of State for International Development and of the Prime Minister to this Bill?

 As the hon. Lady said, the issue has been raised previously. There are obviously rules that affect whether the Government are in a position to provide appropriate compensation.

 May I make two points clear to the hon. Gentleman? First, the Government have invested more money in the national health service since we came to power than any Government in history. That money is being used to provide new hospitals and new hospital facilities across the country, and I know that Government Members are extremely proud of that. I doubt that the hon. Gentleman could produce statistics on NHS funding by any previous Government that compare in any way with our investment. Secondly, on his observations about new housing and related planning issues, unlike our predecessors, especially a number of Conservative Administrations, the Government have sought to ensure that new housing permissions are granted only where there is appropriate infrastructure and support for the population. Many of the difficulties caused by new housing in the late 1980s and early 1990s were the result of the then Government&#039;s enthusiasm to build housing without considering the need for accompanying infrastructure. That was a serious planning mistake, and we do not intend to repeat it.

Surely that highlights something rather more important than a difference of opinion: the fact that a clearly thought out and well planned approach is needed to tackle the insurgency, which is rather broader than mere military attacks?

 I thank the hon. Gentleman for his question. On the first part, I do not know of anybody who has said that the American forces would be there for 10&nbsp;or 15&nbsp;years, certainly not in their present configuration. I do know that my opposite number, the Secretary of State for Defence, Donald Rumsfeld, has said that he envisages&#151;in contradistinction to some other comments that have been made&#151;that it will not be an easy or a short insurgency to defeat, and that the insurgency could last for 5, 10, 12&nbsp;or more years. That is not to say that the counter-insurgency will inevitably be led by forces other than Iraqis for that time period. The purpose of what we are trying to do now is genuinely to place the future democratic control of Iraq, with all its difficulties, with all its religious and ethnic groups&#151;Sunni, Shi&#039;a, Kurd&#151;and to accompany that by a democratically controlled security force capable of defending that democracy and taking on the insurgency.

<a name="stpa_64">While it is possible to envisage a prolonged insurgency, through imported terrorism or through disaffected elements of the former regime&#151;or through alienated members of the Sunni population&#151;it is also possible, as the political element and the security of Iraq increase, to envisage that element taking a lead. That means that there is no definite time scale, but rather the prospect of a conditional withdrawal. I assure the hon.

At present, given all the circumstances, I am happy that all the NATO partners are contributing in what is the best way for them, in the light of the position from which they started.

<a name="50707-14_para4">
<a name="stpa_68">I shall now abbreviate and simplify what I was going to say. As this is my first debate on this subject, I was going to outline my personal approach. Over the past few years&#151;ever since the statement that our foreign policy, the foreign policy of a new Government, should have a moral and ethical dimension&#151;it has been easy to gain the impression that we have fallen into what our critics would call a certain pragmatism, and what others would describe as a neo-conservative agenda elsewhere. Let me set out in simple terms my own view of Britain&#039;s role in the world.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50707-14_para5">
<a name="stpa_69">I believe that at home, domestically, as citizens of this country, we do not have absolute rights, and we do not have the right to get ahead irrespective of the consequences of our actions for others. I hope that our political background&#151;certainly that of Labour Members&#151;is one in which the role of a citizen of this country is encompassed by a combination, or balance, of rights, interests and responsibilities. I see our role in the world in exactly the same way. We are citizens of the world, a world that is shrinking almost visibly before us. Acts which, long ago, could be branded as something happening in faraway countries of which we knew little and for which we cared even less are now brought before our eyes every day through new technology and communications. Transportation systems take us from one part of the world to another in unbelievably short times. If we ever believed that our brothers and sisters in other parts of the world were no responsibility of ours, it gets harder by the year to do so. Therefore, in the international community and as a citizen of the world, this country has our rights to defend, our interests to maintain and also our responsibilities to discharge. In doing that, we sometimes have to use diplomacy, finance, aid and trade&#151;all the matters that are being discussed at the G8&#151;and also fighting power.

</p>

<p>
<a name="50707-14_para6">
<a name="stpa_70">Sometimes we have to use fighting power to separate others, and sometimes to bend others to our will. That is the general approach that I take. In other words, I simply reject the view that if we take a form of action that coincides with anyone else&#039;s action, it is because it derives from some imposed neo-conservative view; it is because it derives from our own view of the world, which&#151;at given points in time&#151;coincides with action by those who hold other points of view.

 The Secretary of State&#039;s comments are helpful and enlightening. Do his comments mean that we are not necessarily committed to maintaining our troop presence in Iraq, for example, just because the Americans are there? Is it possible, at least in theory, for us to withdraw our forces even if the Americans are still on the ground?

 I never find these hypothetical questions very helpful. We are a sovereign nation, but we have responsibilities and allies. Chief among those allies is the United States.

Tragically, casualty figures for the Americans in Iraq are now approaching 1,800. We are a sovereign nation, but we will stay as long as the Iraqi Government want us and until the sort of conditions that I outlined earlier have been met.

 The Secretary of State has just given a very impressive little speech on the maintenance of British fighting power. Does he accept that that has depended crucially for the past two centuries on the Royal Navy, which is now&#151;for the first time in all those years&#151;smaller than the French Navy? That is a matter of crucial importance. Will he use his first speech to the House as Secretary of State to show his profound commitment to the Royal Navy and give an absolute commitment that there will be no mucking around with the building of the two new aircraft carriers, which are essential for the maintenance of our effective fighting power?

 I am grateful for the hon. Gentleman&#039;s comments about my nice little speech. I thank him for his nice little speech. Unfortunately, it is wrong. It assumes that bigger is better. He seems to have forgotten the lesson of Trafalgar, even within a fortnight of the 200th anniversary, that our side was smaller than the French and Spanish fleet. Nelson had 27&nbsp;ships, compared with the 33&nbsp;in the fleet he faced. He won, because fighting capability and power cannot be equated with the number of vessels. Fighting power depends on the technology on the vessels, how well trained the men and women aboard are and the morale of the troops. The training and morale of Nelson&#039;s troops gave him a huge advantage over the French and Spanish.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50707-15_para0">
<a name="stpa_72">Let us bring the question to the modern world. Is it possible to have smaller numbers and greater capability? Of course, it is. For example, there were far fewer air sorties in the second Gulf war than in the first Gulf war but they hit far more targets because they used different technologically directed bombs&#151;so-called &quot;smart&quot; bombs as opposed to dumb bombs. Let us consider the number of ships that are necessary for the United States to put out two, three or four carrier task groups. Because of the building of ships nowadays, there is a far higher return on the fleet on the sea active than would have been the case 10&nbsp;or 15&nbsp;years ago. That is why Defence Secretary Rumsfeld&#039;s prediction, when he worked for the Reagan Administration, that his fleet then would be twice the size of the one that he has now does not mean that his smaller fleet now is less capable. It is not.

Of course we can argue about the way in which those responsibilities are discharged, but these decisions are not easy. The decision about Kosovo was not easy, but on balance the House supported us going in there, even though the United Nations Security Council did not&#151;there was a veto. However, the House felt that it had a morally compelling responsibility that superseded that veto.

It is accepted that we must address the political causes of problems, which is why at the G8&nbsp;summit we will talk about not only aid and trade in Africa, but hopefully the middle east peace process. We must do that in addition to using what we would traditionally regard as the defence posture, or physical fighting power. We will debate today the broadest context of our interests and commitments throughout the world.

Some 70&nbsp;million textbooks have been distributed. I do not want to present a glowing picture of the situation in the country, as some politicians have, but steady progress is being made, especially on the political and security sides.

In the midst of the sombre situation in some parts of the country, let us remember that the presidential elections last October were an outstanding success, although that was unexpected in some quarters. The parliamentary elections this September will be a major step forward. About 1,000&nbsp;personnel from all three services are deployed in Afghanistan, along with civilians. They are deployed as part of the NATO-led international security assistance force and also contribute to the US-led coalition. We are working alongside the Afghans and our allies to develop the capabilities and skills of the Afghan security forces, to help train the Afghan national army and to provide advice. Afghans and Afghanistan continue to need international military help. Elements of al-Qaeda and the Taliban remain active there; we have not destroyed them completely.

In my view, no country can develop a stable, sustainable and uncorrupt form of government unless and until that is dealt with. About 90&nbsp;per cent. of the heroin in this country comes from opiates derived from Afghanistan. That position represents a threat both to Afghanistan and the United Kingdom.

In that context, does he agree that it would be helpful if the United States could announce the end of the regime in Guantanamo Bay, which tends to undermine our support for the democratic process and the rule of law elsewhere in the world?

I am not sure that it is helpful, though he invites me, to start giving public advice to our enemies on these matters. I believe that there is an awareness in the US that, in the immediate aftermath of the terrible and tragic events of 9/11, measures had to be taken, but as time goes on, they have to be continually reviewed.

We publicly announced something that had, in fact, been undertaken by the previous Conservative Government: the detargeting of the missiles, which had happened as the cold war thawed. We felt that announcing that publicly and making the information public helped the process. We reduced the number of boats that were necessarily at sea at any given stage, so that there was one. So it takes days, not minutes, to retarget our nuclear deterrent.

We have not taken a decision on that, and when people ask me whether we will have the chance to debate and discuss that, I merely point to the past three Question Times and debates in the House, when hon.

What are we doing to safeguard and protect the fissile material that is scattered around all over the place in the former Soviet Union?

Through our non-proliferation activities and in many other ways, we constantly try to ensure&#151;indeed, we have assisted the Russians in trying to ensure&#151;that the dismantling of their warheads, many of which have been dismantled, and the storage of that material, and so on, is as secure as it can be.

In doing so, I pointed out that we have tried to de-escalate the number of warheads to less than 200, for example, so we have been playing our part. Yes, I am disappointed that we did not get an agreement on the non-proliferation treaty. The United Kingdom played a reasonably important part in those discussions&#151;in fact, in some conference sessions we acted as European Union representative&#151;and we tried to secure agreement on certain elements. I am sorry that we did not do so, but that does not mean that there are no other ways of making progress. I can assure my hon.

<p>
<a name="50707-16_para5">
<a name="stpa_89">I want to turn briefly to an issue that has already been raised: the nature of our relationship with Europe and the United States. We continue to believe that a strong Euro-Atlantic partnership, with NATO at its heart, underpins our security policy. NATO is an enduring alliance and it has been hugely successful in adapting to a changing strategic environment. On the other hand, we do not believe that our commitment to NATO is in any way incompatible with developing a European security and defence policy and related activity. We try, wherever possible, to ensure that the two institutions act in concert and in partnership&#151;not in competition&#151;and that they do not duplicate resources in, for instance, Darfur or Sudan. After assuming the EU presidency on 1&nbsp;July, we will continue to try to develop the ESDP, and to lead the EU in a fashion that dovetails with our belief in NATO as a successful military alliance.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50707-16_para6">
<a name="stpa_90">In a sense, the current strategic environment, the complex nature of the necessary security response&#151;as opposed to simply a defence response&#151;to many of the problems that we face nowadays, and the obligation to accompany defence with political initiatives and financial, diplomatic and humanitarian assistance, plays into the character of the European Union. It allows us to accompany NATO alliance capabilities with a degree of civil-military partnership through the EU. That, in turn, enables us to grow both institutions effectively in terms of cohesion, activity and capability, and to make them complementary rather than competitive.

</p>

<p>
<a name="50707-16_para7">
<a name="stpa_91">Those three words&#151;cohesion, activity and capability&#151;will mark anything that I do as pro tem president of Europe&#039;s Defence Ministers. We need to increase our capability, but it has to be usable capability. There is no good in having shop-window forces or great numbers on paper if none of them can be used, if they are not fit for purpose, or if they are not the flexible, deployable, expeditionary-type outreach forces that are necessary in the world today. Secondly, we need to ensure cohesion. We need to bring together the necessary political, diplomatic, financial, humanitarian and military responses, to use what we need when it is needed, and to make the right judgments on the right occasions.

 Some tasks require multinational activity in which the United States may not want to be involved heavily or at all. There is currently a requirement for a presence in Bosnia, but the US might fail. It contributed towards the presence but Bosnia is not primarily a responsibility of the other end of the transatlantic alliance; it is primarily the responsibility of the European end. I tell the hon. Gentleman what I sometimes say to my French colleagues: it is possible to maximise the utility of NATO and the EU in a non-competitive way, provided that we shape slightly different roles for them. The EU offers an opportunity especially for bringing together prevention, rehabilitation and civil-military organisation on the ground. That is not as easily achieved by NATO. Indeed, some of our transatlantic partners in NATO may not be especially enthusiastic about getting involved in those matters.

<a name="stpa_93">For example, let us consider Darfur.

<a name="stpa_94">When people ask why someone is not doing something, we have a duty to respond. However, we cannot always be in the lead. For example, in Darfur, it is right that the African Union should lead. We cannot always go in with only military means. Sometimes we have to go in under other leadership, for example, the African Union, and give an array of assistance, which is necessary for security but is not purely defence. I believe that we can develop some of the EU&#039;s possibilities and potential and the European security and defence policy without threatening NATO.

<a name="50707-17_para5">
<a name="stpa_97">This week&#039;s events ensure that we will pass on the torch of remembrance to our younger people. There are three lessons. First, there is the unimaginably terrible cost of war. I am not sure that anyone in the Chamber has been involved in a war. I have not, and I do not think, however graphically it was described to me, that I could understand what it means to take part in war. The hon. Member for Blaby (Mr. Robathan), however, may have been on active service, even if he has not been to war. It is difficult for my generation, whose fathers, mothers, grandparents were involved in war, to understand it, but it is much more difficult for younger people. Veterans&#039; week is partly meant to bring home to them the high cost of war.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50707-17_para6">
<a name="stpa_98">Secondly, we must remember that difficult judgments about war can show us that the costs increase with appeasement. It is always difficult to make judgments, but one thing that we can learn from the 1930s and 1940s is that if we are not prepared to take a stand on certain issues early enough, those issues will not go away; and instead of thousands, tens of millions of people may die. Thirdly, we must learn the benefits of peace and partnership. Whatever our differences with our colleagues in Europe, it must be considered an unmitigated success that in the last 60&nbsp;years, after centuries of war and loss of life on a grand scale, we have managed to maintain peace in western Europe through the European Union. That would not have been likely in every part of the present EU had that institution not existed.

We maintain our position in the world and we act, I hope, through the discharge of our responsibilities as a force for good. Ultimately, that is because of the courage and hard work of the armed forces and the civilians who support them.

Without them, none of us would be here today to defend and participate in democracy on behalf of a free people in a free country.

That is a very serious accusation indeed.

<a name="stpa_122">The NAO report should shame the Government. I have to say that I feel sorry for the Secretary of State because I believe that his heart is in the right place in relation to defence and our armed services. Certainly, much of what he said today indicated that. However, in the strategic defence review, for which he can take personal credit, the shortfalls that we are dealing with at present were not envisaged. His frustration at the bad stewardship of his predecessor, the current Leader of the House, on whose watch all that occurred, must be as great as mine. I hope that the Secretary of State will not be as supine as his predecessor in the face of the Chancellor of the Exchequer, who is really the cause of the trouble.

The Ministry of Defence spent &#163;5,000&nbsp;on torches for the SAS that could not be used because they rattled.

 I do not have the full details of that and I would not want to answer the hon. Gentleman on that basis. However, I remember certain areas of expenditure, not on defence, but on the dome and in other areas, where the Government have shown themselves to be very insensitive to the way in which they waste public money. In this case, what makes it worse is that they are not only wasting taxpayers&#039; money, but doing so in a way that is reducing the security of this country and letting down our armed forces.
</p>

<a name="50707-19_para0">
<a name="stpa_126">The Government should be even less proud of the gaping vacuum that is growing in the vital context of training. The squeeze on the defence budget has had a devastating effect. Reductions in training have a progressively damaging effect on fighting power and ethos, and its maintenance should be central to the Government&#039;s policy. While a heavy commitment to operations can offset some of these disadvantages, particularly in respect of command training, reducing activity levels for field force units that are not committed to operations is a self-inflicted wound. It is important that our servicemen and women be properly trained&#151;certainly as well as previously, if not better. That is simply not the case today. Individual soldiers are less well trained than they were, training standards are too low, gunnery and field firing camps are cancelled, and training between infantry, tanks, engineers and those parts of the Army that may have to co-operate and fight together rarely takes place. I understand that the Ministry of Defence is even examining whether to cut brigade level training further.

<a name="50707-19_para1">
<a name="stpa_127">The Territorial Army, the Royal Naval Reserve and the Royal Auxiliary Air Force have traditionally supported and complemented our regular forces. Without their dedication, our regular forces would not be able to function as they do. They have become an integral part of our ability to operate on the ground, not least in conflict situations. But is it right to put such pressure on them, and on their families and jobs, just because the Government will not face up to the damage to regular recruitment caused by their defence policies? The trend in recruitment should be ringing louder alarm bells. Far from being buoyant, as it was described by a Minister a month ago, official figures that we have received from the Government in answers to written questions show that recruitment to the RAF has more than halved in the past three years, while the Royal Navy has experienced a 30&nbsp;per cent. fall and the Army a 20&nbsp;per cent. drop.

What are the geographical limits within which we will judge whether the job has been done sufficiently for our troops to start coming home?

That is an important question, because drawing down ultimately depends on restoring adequate stability and security to Iraq, which itself depends on the presence in those areas of sufficiently trained Iraqi security forces.

The violence in Afghanistan, as we know, has recently heightened. There are new fears that Taliban forces will escalate attacks in the run-up to the September elections.

The question I have for the Minister of State is this: what is our priority and what will be our priority over the next years in Afghanistan&#151;to quell the insurgency or to curtail poppy production? In both cases, what genuine support can we expect from Afghan forces?

Now NATO and the EU will run side-by-side airlift missions, supposedly co-ordinated through offices in Addis Ababa in Ethiopia. Britain, in order to be friendly to both sides in this extraordinary situation, will be involved in both. It could not be worse. This unseemly spat and the grubby compromise that has followed it is bad for the suffering people of Darfur, for Europe and for the transatlantic alliance.

Separate European military structures are a self-delusion that can only weaken Europe and undermine NATO. With profound changes of thinking in America, they might eventually even decouple the US from the defence of Europe. It is a high-risk strategy and one that I totally deplore.

NATO must remain the cornerstone of our national security and we must continue to play our full part in it. We must strengthen rather than weaken our armed forces. We need more infantry and more front-line capability. We believe that our Navy is now dangerously small and weakened and that scaling down our air power risks our security.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government&#039;s defence policy owes more to the Chancellor&#039;s long-term ambitions than to the security requirements of the nation.

Four or five weeks ago, I learned a huge amount from Robert McNamara, who spoke in the Moses Room in the House of Lords. Opposition Members were present. It was as if I were in touch with history. Robert McNamara was 88&nbsp;years old and as sharp as a tack&#151;slightly deaf, but so impressive. There he was, 40&nbsp;years ago, in the Oval Office at 4.30 pm on Saturday 27&nbsp;October 1962&#151;not as a note-taker but as an active participant, advising the President on how to respond to the Cuban missile crisis. There were three people in the Oval Office: McNamara himself, President Kennedy and the chief of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Robert McNamara referred to him as &quot;the chief&quot;.

I was a paper boy at the time, frightened out of my wits like everyone else. Kennedy was told that there was a flotilla approaching Cuba with those nuclear warheads. The military said &quot;You have got to invade, Mr. President.&quot; Of course, Kennedy did not invade. The flotilla turned round and went back to the Soviet Union.

Had they decided, at 4.30 pm on Saturday 27&nbsp;October 1962, to invade, there would probably not be a planet Earth now&#151;or it would be just a charred sphere circling the sun.

 I do not doubt that, but Robert McNamara says that more should be done. It is an incontestable fact that those dumps exist and that they are not secure. They should be safeguarded.

I am not being fanciful. We must wake up to the possibilities. We need our Ministers to talk to the Americans and the others on the UN Security Council to get them to start taking the issue seriously.

He told me of his time as a serviceman, when he was sent to Christmas island for the British nuclear tests. He and the others were told to dress in white overalls. When the bomb was about to go off, he was told to turn his back to it, screw up his eyes and put his hands over them. He did that, but he told me that, when the bomb went off, he saw a blinding flash of light through his hands. He has not forgotten that and, when he told me about the Christmas island experience, I thought we should perhaps educate or re-educate people about the consequences of nuclear weapons and the terrible instability that they cause.

<a name="stpa_173">I wholeheartedly endorse the decision of the Secretary of State and others to proceed with this debate. It is right to do so, as it sends an important signal to those who wish to destroy our democracy. I thank the Secretary of State, who is no longer in his place, for his courtesy in giving me advance notice that, because of other serious commitments, he would probably not be present to listen to the speeches of myself and others. We fully understand that.

<a name="stpa_174">For all the disagreements in the House on different aspects of defence issues, there is a consensus that we live in a rapidly changing world. The uncertainties of old have changed but not disappeared and we are still coming to terms with the ugly new uncertainties of the 21st century. Our armed forces have to grapple with those uncertainties day in, day out, and I echo the tributes of others to the professionalism, dedication and bravery of all who serve on our behalf. The reputation of our armed forces is second to none, so we are right to be proud of them and grateful to them.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50707-21_para6">
<a name="stpa_175">This year, we mark the 60th anniversary of the end of world war two, which is a sobering reminder of the costs and horrors of war. This week, we have been paying tribute to veterans of all wars and conflicts, and I applaud the Government&#039;s initiative in establishing the event. Last week, many of us were fortunate enough to participate in the magnificent Trafalgar celebrations on the Solent&#151;a fantastic tribute, on which all involved should be congratulated. It was a privilege to be there. All those commemorations and events are a reminder of the freedoms that we enjoy and we must never take them for granted.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50707-21_para7">
<a name="stpa_176">As part of the Trafalgar celebrations, some of us had the good fortune last week to attend a reception on HMS Invincible in the presence of Her Majesty the Queen. What we did not necessarily appreciate at the time was the fact that it may have been the ship&#039;s swansong, as we now hear that it is to be mothballed.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50707-21_para8">
<a name="stpa_177">The fate of HMS Invincible is symbolic of the major changes taking place as a result of the defence White Paper. Across our armed forces, a small-scale revolution is taking place at the same time as we witness some of the highest levels of commitment in the post-war period. The Defence Committee&#039;s fourth report of the last Parliament raised serious questions about the ability of the Ministry of Defence and the armed forces to manage that process. The Secretary of State has given a forthright response. In so doing, he has set his Ministry some very challenging tasks at a very difficult time.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50707-21_para9">
<a name="stpa_178">Iraq remains the country&#039;s most pressing overseas commitment. Like other hon. Members, I pay tribute to the professionalism of those in the British armed forces who have served and continue to serve there. Similarly, I convey my condolences and those of my right hon. and hon. Friends to the families and friends of those who have given their lives in the conflict. We should not forget those who are recovering from the injuries and wounds that they have suffered there.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50707-21_para10">
<a name="stpa_179">To say the least, the security situation in Iraq remains perilous&#151;with more than 1,000&nbsp;deaths since the formation of the new Iraqi Government in April and the recent kidnapping of the Egyptian ambassador-designate and the attempted assassinations of the Bahraini and Pakistani ambassadors this week&#151;but some progress has been made in the provision of basic public services. With the Iraqi Ministry of Health reporting that more than 75&nbsp;hospitals and nearly all the primary care clinics that were damaged or looted during and after the 2003&nbsp;conflict have been rehabilitated and with further work under way to construct new&#151;and rehabilitate older&#151;hospitals in Iraq, progress looks good. However, we should not deceive ourselves that Iraqis are enjoying anything approaching a normal life, and they will continue to have a long, hard haul over the coming months and years.

<a name="50707-21_para11">
<a name="stpa_180">Over what is now a very short period, the people of Iraq must finalise the constitutional arrangements that will enable them to take full control of their own sovereignty. The constitution must be drawn up by the 55&nbsp;member committee by the middle of August to allow a referendum by the end of September that will, in turn, allow fresh elections to be held by the middle of December. None of that will be easy.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50707-21_para12">
<a name="stpa_181">There are some positive signs, which we welcome. The constitutional committee has agreed to the membership of 15&nbsp;Sunnis and the head of the general conference for Sunnis in Iraq has said that Sunni clerics will soon encourage people to register with the electoral commission and vote, raising hopes that political efforts by the Shi&#039;a and Kurdish-dominated Government to draw the Sunnis into the political process may now be bearing fruit.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50707-21_para13">
<a name="stpa_182">As that political process develops, the ongoing role of the coalition forces is increasingly in the spotlight. While recognising the key security role of the multinational forces, it is clear that the Iraqis themselves see the occupation, however mandated, as an ongoing political problem, not least because, as yet, there appears to be no clarity about an exit strategy. The signals from Washington are mixed: the Vice-President says that the insurgency is in its last throes, while the US Defence Secretary says that it may take a dozen years to quell the insurgents.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50707-21_para14">
<a name="stpa_183">The Iraqis are right to want a clear exit strategy for the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;multinational forces and it is the coalition&#039;s responsibility to set out one. The Secretary of State for Defence gave some signs of that happening in his interview on the &quot;Today&quot; programme earlier this week and in his response to the questions from the shadow Defence Secretary on Monday and, indeed, in his speech today. We have started to see the beginnings of a strategy, and we are encouraged by that, as far as it goes.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50707-21_para15">
<a name="stpa_184">Liberal Democrat Members remain of the view that we can make the greatest contribution to Iraq&#039;s internal stability and the development of its body politic by setting out a clear timetable for a phased withdrawal of our forces in line with the United Nations mandate authorised by Security Council resolutions. That must take account of the security situation, the state of public services and the completion of the constitutional process, but without such a strategy, the chances of a swift improvement in the terrible conditions in which Iraqis lead their lives will be minimal and the risks that we will become mired in a situation outwith our control will become all the greater.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50707-21_para16">
<a name="stpa_185">In Afghanistan, we face a different set of challenges and realities, and we are taking on greater commitments. Much progress has been made since the fall of the Taliban Government in 2001&nbsp;and another important step will be reached with the parliamentary and provincial elections due in mid-September, but the security situation in the country is bleak. As the UN special envoy, Jean Arnault, reported to the Security Council a couple of weeks ago, it is going through a &quot;negative evolution&quot;, with almost 400&nbsp;people killed by the Taliban this year. The soaring levels of heroin production are another indication of a country that is still in deep trouble and the statistics that the Secretary of State offered us earlier highlight that starkly.

<a name="50707-21_para17">
<a name="stpa_186">We support the efforts that the Government are making as part of the international community&#039;s programme to bring long-term stability to Afghanistan. The leadership role being taken by the United Kingdom is a reflection of the skills and qualities of our armed forces, and they are to be congratulated on that. Like others, we look forward to hearing details of the forces to be deployed, as the headquarters Allied Rapid Reaction Corps takes on its responsibilities, as anticipated, in 2006. But this commitment comes at a time when the armed forces are seriously stretched. Squaring the circle of these substantial commitments will be no easy task.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50707-21_para18">
<a name="stpa_187">The recent National Audit Office report, which has been referred to already, set out some real problems in respect of readiness. It gave the MOD credit for its readiness reporting system, but throughout the document serious questions are raised about our armed forces&#039; ability to react swiftly to new and unforeseen threats or operational imperatives. It makes for stark reading. In the period under review, more than a third of our armed forces had &quot;serious weaknesses&quot; in their readiness levels. The NAO identifies intense pressure on supplies and personnel, which, it says, have been redistributed to a point where effective and well-equipped fighting forces can only be assembled by widespread cannibalisation of military units and supplies. It concludes that the MOD


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_24">&quot;relies heavily on redistributing people and equipment to bring Force Elements up to sufficient strength to deploy on operations and expects to continue to do so&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="50707-21_para19">
<a name="stpa_188">The NAO report is clear that military activity levels have consistently exceeded defence planning assumptions, and that that will remain the case for the foreseeable future. Inevitably, this brings into question the very assumptions themselves and the sustainability of the current, unexpected levels of commitment. We will doubtless hear more on this issue during the wind-ups, but a detailed MOD response to the report is surely needed as a matter of urgency.

</p>

<p>
<a name="50707-21_para20">
<a name="stpa_189">Echoing the conclusions of the NAO report, recently published figures reveal shortages of essential personnel across the services. Answers to parliamentary questions have highlighted that the Army is short of more than 600&nbsp;medical personnel&#151; including nurses, surgeons and anaesthetists&#151;400&nbsp;intelligence personnel, 900&nbsp;logisticians and more than 1,300&nbsp;engineers. The Royal Marines are short of more than 600&nbsp;engineers. These are essential personnel. Our armed forces&#039; ability to carry out demanding operations rapidly, effectively and safely must surely be put in jeopardy without these essential specialist and support personnel. Again, we need to know what action has been taken to address these shortfalls.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50707-21_para21">
<a name="stpa_190">It is not just the specialists who are under strength. The MOD&#039;s own figures show that the Army has at least 1,600&nbsp;fewer soldiers than the target strength, and it has been suggested that the shortfall figure is expected to increase. The Army&#039;s full-time fighting strength, as of 1&nbsp;April, was some 102,000, yet the official training requirement is for more than 104,000. The Army&#039;s size is being cut by the regimental restructuring announced last year, and it is now short of well over 1,000&nbsp;soldiers.

<br>&nbsp;<br>two ways? First, it will free up more skilled personnel to support infantry battalions and, secondly, having larger congregations of military bases will make it easier to recruit personnel with specialised skills.
</p>








<p><a name="st_176"><a name="50707-22_spnew1"><b> Mr. Moore: </b> 
 I fully understand the objectives of the Government&#039;s policy and realise that there may be a time lag between setting out those objectives and achieving them. However, the discrepancies are worrying, and I hope that the Minister can offer the House some reassurance about what is going on when he winds up.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50707-22_para0">
<a name="stpa_191">The peacekeeping or peace-enforcement tasks that the Army is increasingly required to undertake are manpower-intensive and will surely prove increasingly difficult to carry out without sufficient troops. Fewer troops are being asked to do more and, as a result, some battalions have had only months at home between demanding operational tours&#151;far less than the two-year interval target. That has substantially restricted essential rest and recuperation time, time spent with families, and training time. If that continues in the medium term, it will inevitably undermine the Army&#039;s effectiveness. As has already been pointed out, in the Navy there is an equally serious shortage of more than 1,700&nbsp;personnel.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50707-22_para1">
<a name="stpa_192">At the moment, it does not appear that recruitment will be the answer to some of these problems. In each year since 2002, there has been a significant fall in the number of civilian applications to join the United Kingdom regular forces&#151;in each service, whether for officer or other ranks. Civilian applications to join the Army outside the officer ranks fell from nearly 37,000&nbsp;in 2002&nbsp;to just over 28,000&nbsp;in 2004&#150;05. Non-officer civilian applications in the same period in the RAF and the Navy fell by more than 4,000&nbsp;and 2,000&nbsp;respectively.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50707-22_para2">
<a name="stpa_193">That is a picture of dramatic decline in interest in joining the services, which is reflected in similar problems in attracting reservists. If we add to the mix the difficulties with fitness, regimental restructuring and changes in terms for redundancy, it makes for a serious list of problems that need urgent attention in the Ministry of Defence.

</p>

<p>
<a name="50707-22_para3">
<a name="stpa_194">The future replacement of the nuclear deterrent is reappearing on the national agenda, as the hon. Member for Pendle (Mr. Prentice) highlighted. Given the long lead&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;times in any decision-making process, that is understandable. However, we must not lose sight of the overwhelming responsibility on all the nuclear powers to seek ways of achieving multilateral disarmament.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50707-22_para4">
<a name="stpa_195">The Secretary of State rightly drew attention to the Government&#039;s significant reductions in nuclear weapons since 1997. We applaud that, but internationally, there is still a long way to go. In the aftermath of the failure of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty review conference in New York a few weeks ago, we are in a worrying position.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50707-22_para5">
<a name="stpa_196">We know that some countries such as India and Pakistan have obtained nuclear weapons and that others, for example, North Korea, are trying to acquire them. There is therefore a pressing need to create the international political climate in which multilateral disarmament can take place. We must also not lose sight of the danger of proliferation through the passing of expertise and materials from the former Soviet Union. Those should be our first priorities.

<a name="50707-22_para6">
<a name="stpa_197">Although we must not lose our focus on those issues, we will in due course have to consider any future replacement of Trident. On Monday, the Secretary of State said:

 I begin by endorsing the final comments of the hon. Member for Berwickshire, Roxburgh and Selkirk (Mr. Moore). It is usually a great pleasure to speak in our less frequent defence debates in the House, but anything we discuss today is bound to be overshadowed by the dreadful events taking place around us. Although we emphatically accept the Home Secretary&#039;s earlier comments that we should not prejudge matters or speculate about what has happened, the events are a sign of the changing nature of the threat that we face. The country now faces an asymmetric threat, with which it has probably never seriously been confronted in the past. That has an impact on Government defence policy and our defence in the world.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50707-22_para10">
<a name="stpa_201">The Government were right in their early years to produce the strategic defence review to deal with the changing threats and subsequently to add a further chapter and a new White Paper, focusing especially on the new sorts of threat that we face, especially from international terrorism. I, for one, am a great supporter of the Government&#039;s policy in that area. Their defence review has proved to be one of the best in the world, and it has stood the test of time. It is used by other countries, especially in NATO, as a model for reforming the old cold war structures of our armed forces to meet new challenges and the changed security environment. I am, however, the first to recognise that there is a difference between introducing a new policy and deciding where we want to be in future and actually getting there. The hon. Member for Berwickshire, Roxburgh and Selkirk made some valid points, as he acknowledged the dangers that we face in trying to achieve our goals. 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>7 Jul 2005 : Column 505</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>The&nbsp;Government are undertaking a major and necessary restructuring of our armed forces to meet the challenges and make sure that we are more responsive and flexible. That will enable us to address concurrent threats, travel to places quickly in smaller groups, and achieve a bigger impact when we arrive.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50707-22_para11">
<a name="stpa_202">No one in the House would disagree with those objectives, but some of us are concerned about how we will get from A to B, so I shall spend most of my time on the excellent fourth report by the Select Committee on Defence, on the future capabilities of the British armed forces. If we do not get that right, we cannot deliver any of our future objectives or meet the challenges that we face. The Select Committee did the House a service in questioning the Executive about their ability to deliver future capabilities through their defence policy. I do not intend to address all the matters covered in the report, but I recommend that hon. Members read it. I shall address three of its recommendations on a crucial area of future defence policy&#151;the maintenance of our front-line fast jet capability.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50707-22_para12">
<a name="stpa_203">In any new scenario that we face, whether it is ship-based, or involves infantry battalions or battle groups, we are dependent on the availability of front-line jets. For the foreseeable future, we will not be dependent on multi-role jets but on the good old Harrier GR9&nbsp;and the Tornado GR4. That will certainly be the case for the next 12, 15, 18&nbsp;years and, who knows, possibly even longer. They constitute a reliable platform that has served our military exceptionally well in many of the recent conflicts that have been mentioned. It is the policy of Her Majesty&#039;s Government to change the way in which they maintain that fast jet capability. We will no longer use the tried and tested services of highly skilled civilian engineers based in the Defence Aviation Repair Agency, the successor organisation to the military agencies that used to do that work. DERA was created by the Government only three or four years ago to meet the demanding need to maintain our aircraft effectively so that those jets are available when we need them in times of crisis. Her Majesty&#039;s Government have decided completely to ignore their previous policy, which was also scrutinised by the Defence Committee, and they support the creation of a special agency of civilian engineers working in a commercial environment to provide all militarily non-essential jet repair and maintenance.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50707-22_para13">
<a name="stpa_204">Some work on our jets has to be carried out on the battlefield or the front line&#151;jets have to be kept in the air and filled with petrol, and the tyres have to be kicked now and then&#151;but there is no military requirement for the factory maintenance of fast jets to be carried out by military personnel. Under the original SDR, which I greatly supported, it was made clear that, for reasons of value for money and the maintenance of maximum efficiency, the military would not be required to carry out non-essential military tasks, and that we would seek other, more cost-effective means of carrying out those tasks either in the competitive private sector or, in DARA&#039;s case, by commercialising a department of the Ministry of Defence, so that it would operate in precisely the same way as a commercial company, dependent on customer revenue for its income and acting as a trading fund not dependent on vote money from this House.

<a name="50707-22_para14">
<a name="stpa_205">In the past three years, DARA has performed tremendously well. It has achieved every one of the targets set for it, including its targets for customer income. DARA has transformed the way in which it does business, and by the middle of last year it could compete with anyone in the world, private or public sector, in the maintenance of the front-line fleet of fast jets. However, in March last year, the Government, in their wisdom, decided to take Harrier jet maintenance from DARA and transfer it to RAF Cottesmore, where that task would be carried out by military personnel, in the belief&#151;I accept that Ministers believe this&#151;that military personnel operating in a military environment are more productive, more efficient and more cost-effective than civilians working in a commercial environment.

<a name="stpa_206">There are hon. Members on both sides of the House who, like me, have had military experience&#151;my experience happens to have been in the Royal Air Force. All will know what utter nonsense that view is. There is no doubt that military personnel are quite capable of repairing aircraft to the highest standards and doing the job that is required of them. Ours is one of the best air forces in the world, even though it is comparatively small, and its personnel will deliver when asked to deliver&#151;the examples given of the way in which they have operated in difficult circumstances as far as resources are concerned prove that. However, that is a military function; it is utter nonsense to argue that they can carry out factory maintenance and repair of aircraft more competitively and provide better value for money&#151;that they are more efficient&#151;than civilians working in commercial environment.

<p>
<a name="50707-22_para16">
<a name="stpa_207">None the less, in March last year the Harrier jet was transferred to RAF Cottesmore. I share the view of the 150&nbsp;skilled engineers who lobbied the House this morning, many of whom are ex-RAF technicians, that the work being done on the Harrier jet at RAF Cottesmore is a disaster. Not only is it costing the British taxpayer money, but&#151;more worrying to me&#151;it could be undermining front-line capability. I have put the evidence to the Minister of State and asked him to investigate independently, but he has gone to the MOD and RAF for reports on my complaints and told me and others in writing that the transfer has been a huge success&#151;that a production line in a hangar in an air base somewhere in the middle of England is out-competing the world&#039;s greatest. But we know that that is utter nonsense. The turnaround time for a Harrier jet at that facility is now twice what it was when this work was being carried out by skilled civilian engineers at DARA, St. Athan at the beginning of last year. The average turnaround time is now 200&nbsp;days per aircraft.

Furthermore, ZD402, ZD376, ZD470, ZD472, ZD408, ZD404&nbsp;and ZD466&nbsp;have all been so seriously damaged that they are now having to be repaired by contractors outside the base at RAF Cottesmore.

<br>&nbsp;<br>not trying to say, &quot;I told you so&quot;. The reason I am drawing this matter to the House&#039;s attention is that if we carry on at this rate, we shall continue to lose flying time for our Harrier jets.

<a name="stpa_210">This debate is on the Defence White Paper, &quot;Future Capabilities&quot;, and the matter that I have raised relates to an essential future capability for the effectiveness of our forces. There are dire problems at the facility at Cottesmore. I want to place it on record that I am asking the Minister, as I have done before, for goodness&#039; sake to carry out an independent evaluation of what has happened since the Harrier jets were taken from DARA, St. Athan in the Vale of Glamorgan in south Wales, where our jets had been repaired for 50&nbsp;years, and given to a military operational base at RAF Cottesmore. I do not think that that is an unreasonable request. For goodness&#039; sake, let us get someone in to evaluate the project.

<a name="stpa_211">I know that the Minister intends to carry out a post-project evaluation, but not for another five years. I am afraid that it will be too damned late in five years&#039; time. We will have lost the capacity in the Ministry of Defence, and we might have difficulty meeting our requirements for airworthiness and air availability for our Harrier jets. We might also see jets grounded and withdrawn from service, with no way of putting them back in the air. Of course, we have made similar mistakes in the past. The famous Airworks contract on the Tornado and the Hercules air transport planes cost the previous Conservative Government an enormous amount of money.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50707-22_para21">
<a name="stpa_212">I ask all hon. Members to listen to my argument. The reason I am putting this case to the House is that we are about to move the entire Tornado GR4&nbsp;fleet&#151;the premier front-line fleet of the Royal Air Force&#151;to another military operational base at Marham, and to ask RAF personnel in blue uniforms to do the maintenance work that should be carried out in a factory environment by skilled engineers, not in an operational environment. My primary concern is that that could seriously damage our future capability. If we do not have an effective air force with front-line fighting capacity, we can forget all our other commitments to the defence of this nation in the world and to the threats that we face across the globe.

<a name="stpa_230">This debate gives us an opportunity to take a strategic look at the threats that exist around the world. I shall not speak about the work of the armed forces in areas such as Darfur, or in other places where there are problems with famine or welfare, but I will consider the nature of the threats that exist world wide. The armed forces define threat as military capacity combined with hostile intent. I shall examine those areas from which threat may emerge. After all, on the whole we can choose our friends, but our enemies tend to choose us. I believe that the intelligence services still regard the IRA as a more immediate threat in this country than al-Qaeda. However, the ground in Northern Ireland has been well harrowed, so I shall not speak about the experience there.

<a name="stpa_231">Both world wars started in Europe. Those who criticise aspects of the EU may forget that the way in which European countries have drawn together has made it impossible for another war to start in Europe. Trade, travel, the media and inter-marriage have all contributed to that. These days, we talk less about manufacturing than about assembly, and car manufacturers get components from all over Europe and the world. That globalisation means that there is no longer a risk of war starting in Europe.

<a name="50707-23_para9">
<a name="stpa_232">Similarly, the cold war has moved on. The Soviet Union is no more. Russia remains a former imperial power with enormous resources, but its economy is roughly the same size as Belgium&#039;s or Denmark&#039;s. Ukraine has shown how Russia may evolve in due course. The forces of democracy triumphed there and we wish that country well. The old attitudes are still evident in Russia and visitors who talk to politicians there will hear as much. A member of the Duma told me recently that Russia has the most free press in the world. Many people there continue to delude themselves in that respect.

It is, of course, a nuclear power and it is growing at a dizzy speed, with internal stresses as a result. It is stretching out to Taiwan and has massively increased the size of its armed forces. There is a great need for an understanding of China, and I regret very much the fact that the BBC did not replace the programme &quot;Letter from America&quot;

We must develop that understanding lest China fails to understand our own aspirations. Korea&#151;which I suspect may well be a nuclear power already&#151;is not permeable to western information channels. Our entry to Korea is through China, which acts as an intermediary, and it is clear that there are serious problems there.

</p>

<p>
<a name="50707-23_para13">
<a name="stpa_236">Islam is a different kind of religion from Christianity. A Muslim has to redeem history. That means that state affairs are not a distraction from spirituality, but the stuff of religion itself. I quote from a book on Islam:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_33">&quot;If state institutions did not measure up to the Quranic ideal, if their political leaders were cruel or exploitative, or if their community was humiliated by apparently irreligious enemies, a Muslim could feel that his or her faith in life&#039;s ultimate purpose and value was in jeopardy.&quot;</p>

<a name="stpa_237">We have here the background fabric from which extreme views and determination can flow. Muslims look around the world and some see in the west people who do not live up to their own beliefs and ideals. In particular, in the United States and Europe we are lacking in the standards that they have; we are not devout, as they are; we eat food that they think unclean; we drink alcohol; we allow our women to walk around in a manner that they regard as half-naked; and many of us support the Zionist cause, which is their ultimate enemy.

<p>
<a name="50707-23_para15">
<a name="stpa_238">There are two extreme elements within Islam, the first of which is Wahhabism, which derives from the Hambali school of jurisprudence. The strength of Wahhabism derives from the agreement between Abd al Wahhab and Mohammed ibn Saud, the leader of Saudi Arabia. It was an alliance that unified the disparate tribes on the Arabian peninsula and it means that the Saudi royal family is indebted to Wahhabism and linked to it. The royal family is pledged to return to the fundamentals of Islam and regards others as dissident heretics. The Saudi Arabian royal family significantly funds Wahhabism.

<p>
<a name="50707-23_para16">
<a name="stpa_239">The other sect of significance is Hezbollah, which derives from the teaching of Ayatollah Khomeini in Iran and the Shi&#039;ites, who make up 10&nbsp;to 15&nbsp;per cent. of Muslims. Many known acts of terror can be attributed to the sect and its alliance with Iran. It is thought by some to be a greater threat than al-Qaeda because Hezbollah is more sophisticated.

<a name="stpa_240">So much for the people who might pose a threat. The way to deal with it is through diplomatic and political review, promoting understanding and democracy.

<a name="stpa_241">The possibility of intent exists in some people. As to the means, globalisation has meant that chemical, biological and nuclear weapons are so much more readily available and so much easier to deliver. Since 9/11, the introduction of the concept of the suicide bomber has completely changed the nature of terrorism and the manner in which we deal with the threat of terrorism. We need to wage a war on terrorism, but we also need understanding and mutual respect. There is not enough emphasis on hearts and minds. The United Kingdom, with a strong tradition in the greater middle east, has a great role to play. Earlier, we heard criticism of the CIA. My own experience of the CIA does not lead me to believe that it is an entirely reliable body.

<a name="stpa_242">How are we shaping ourselves to cope with these random threats? I turn to the practical and the immediate, and matters relating to the Ministry of Defence. Our reserve forces have always had two roles. One is to reinforce the regular forces when the regular forces need that reinforcement. My right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Devizes (Mr. Ancram) argued that the use and overuse of reserve forces had placed a tremendous strain on the reserve Army, Air Force and Navy, especially the reserve Army and the Territorial Army. People simply will not volunteer if they think that they will be called up on a regular basis. The reinforcement element represented by the reserves is being overstretched.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50707-23_para20">
<a name="stpa_243">The second main role of the reserve forces is as a framework for regeneration and expansion of the armed forces. During the last war, units formed from reserve units were hugely superior in quality to units formed without that framework. We may need to expand our armed forces with reserves, not to repel an invasion in the traditional sense but to provide a structure for civil defence.

<a name="stpa_261">As I said, I served on the Defence Committee in the last Parliament and that gave me a great opportunity to meet many members of our armed forces in different parts of the world, including Iraq and Afghanistan. I echo the comments of other Members about the professionalism and dedication that our armed forces show in their duties across the world. In addition to the work that they do in Iraq and Afghanistan to fight terrorism, I saw good examples of the reconstruction work that they carry out. For example, the projects at Mazar-i-Sharif in northern Afghanistan involve military doctors working with local hospital doctors to bring health care to parts of Afghanistan that had never had it. We must bear in mind the fact that our armed

</p>

<p>
<a name="50707-24_para7">
<a name="stpa_262">If we are to ask our armed forces to undertake the necessary and sometimes dangerous tasks that they face, they must have the best equipment possible and the funding to go with it. I am pleased that the Government have committed extra expenditure to the defence budget&#151;&#163;3.7&nbsp;billion over the next three years. That is the longest sustainable growth in the defence budget for more than 20&nbsp;years. The Government can be proud of that. It is also important that the armed forces get the equipment that they need on time.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50707-24_para8">
<a name="stpa_263">I welcome the publication of the defence industrial policy. We should not forget the jobs that the defence industry sustains and the skills that it maintains. The policy was welcomed by industry and it set out clearly how the record expenditure that the Government are putting into defence could also benefit large and small industrial companies in this country. It also gave a clear commitment to deal with some of the legacy issues that were left over from the previous Conservative Government. The right hon. and learned Member for Devizes (Mr. Ancram) reeled off a long list of what this Government had got wrong or had overspent on, but it is interesting that he seemed to forget the &#163;900&nbsp;million hole that they left at Rosyth when they took the clear political decision to move Trident submarine refit work to Devonport.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50707-24_para9">
<a name="stpa_264">I also refer to the legacy issues that we had to take on, such as the Astute and other projects. They went way over budget and were unrealistically framed in the first place. We have done good work, but that has meant putting more money into those projects. I visited Barrow a few months ago, and the Astute project is now back on schedule. I pay credit to the work force there who have put in a tremendous amount of hard work.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50707-24_para10">
<a name="stpa_265">I have criticisms, however, of the Defence Procurement Agency. I know that the Defence Committee was very critical of the way the organisation operates. It was interesting to hear the hon. Member for Gosport (Peter Viggers) refer to urgent operational requirements. I want more of them, because they seem to get equipment on to the battlefield or into people&#039;s hands a lot quicker. They ensured that the equipment arrived. The problem with the system, however, is that it is over-burdensome and so-called smart procurement does not deliver equipment to the front line or ensure that it represents better value for money.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50707-24_para11">
<a name="stpa_266">The other problem with the Defence Procurement Agency and smart procurement is the effect on small and medium-sized enterprises. I know that my right hon. Friend the Minister is aware of the organisation Northern Defence Industries, that has done sterling work trying to put supply chains together to ensure that small and medium-sized enterprises can get into defence work. That is paying dividends because many companies in the north-east are for the first time getting into projects in which they would not have participated in the past.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50707-24_para12">
<a name="stpa_267">There is a bar, however, because under the prime contractor route the problem is that the prime contractor is selected, but the supply chain is somehow thought about afterwards. We need to sharpen up procedures so that we ensure not only that we know the 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>7 Jul 2005 : Column 516</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>position of prime contractors when they are appointed, but that we have a locally sourced supply chain in place, because many companies will happily participate in such projects if they are given the opportunity to do so.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50707-24_para13">
<a name="stpa_268">A further criticism that I make of the Defence Procurement Agency is its turnover of staff. The Defence Committee discovered that the turnover rate is some 30&nbsp;per cent. of its staff, which leads to inefficient procurement for new projects. If Lord Drayson, the new defence procurement Minister, has the legendary business expertise about which I am told, he needs to take a clear, hard look at the way in which simple projects can sometimes take far too long after they get stuck in the Defence Procurement Agency in Bristol.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50707-24_para14">
<a name="stpa_269">I have already mentioned urgent operational requirements. The Defence Committee examined lessons that could be learned from our operations in Iraq during Operation Telic. The urgent operational requirements worked well&#151;the hon. Member for Gosport referred to the Minimi machine guns. However, other problems that we have raised have, alas, not been addressed. I am worried that although the Defence Committee and others highlight such problems, we seem to have to wait the gestation period of several African elephants before any action is taken. For example, logistics supply is even more important now that we have a style of warfare that is more expeditionary, which will be reflected in future projects. It is thus important to get the logistics chain right, but it was clear that there were problems during Operation Telic when trying to find out where things were in the supply chain.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50707-24_para15">
<a name="stpa_270">One of the Committee&#039;s conclusions was that such problems were not new because they had been highlighted after the first Gulf war of 1991. The lack of an asset-tracking system in Operation Telic caused numerous serious problems in theatre, including problems with the distribution of critical items such as body armour and nuclear, biological and chemical equipment. The Committee&#039;s report said we needed to urge the Ministry of Defence to come up with a solution to the problem as a top priority.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50707-24_para16">
<a name="stpa_271">We also heard evidence that an off-the-shelf solution had been bought to take a lot of equipment back to the UK. The American system allows containers to be asset-tracked throughout the supply chain, so people know not only where they are, but what is in them. However, lo and behold, the Ministry of Defence and the DPA want to reinvent the wheel by trying to wed together the three existing Army, Navy and Air Force systems, which do not talk to each other. I sometimes wonder whether we should just buy equipment off the shelf, instead of thinking that we need a home-grown solution for such complex systems. That solution would take a long time to develop, which would not only delay equipment from getting to a vital theatre, but mean that it would take a long time before new developments occurred.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Overall, we should be proud of the men and women of our armed forces and their commitment. Given the community that I represent, it is rewarding to see the opportunity that the armed forces give young men and women from deprived backgrounds to fulfil their potential. When I meet those men and women, wherever they are throughout the world, I never cease to be amazed by their dedication and the large responsibility that rests on some very young shoulders.

 It is a pleasure to follow the hon. Member for North Durham (Mr. Jones), who dealt with some problems that have been around&#151;it is a shame to say&#151;for a long time. The Government must face the problem that the slow procedures of defence procurement&#151;the hon. Gentleman compared them to the gestation period of several African elephants&#151;take such a long time to run their course that the equipment being bought has been superseded and is out of date by the end of the process. The hon. Gentleman suggested that it would be helpful to have more urgent operational requirements and I believe that the Government solved many problems in Iraq by following precisely that procedure, though they created new problems as well. The Government&#039;s moves towards increasing the speed of procurement started about 15&nbsp;years ago with Peter Levene: they have improved things a little, but not solved all the problems.

<a name="stpa_273">In his customary very knowledgeable way, my hon. Friend the Member for Gosport (Peter Viggers) went through some of the recommendations of the Defence Committee. I would particularly like to follow up his point about recommendation 5, which is for a destroyer or frigate to be made available in the Caribbean only during the higher-risk hurricane months. My hon. Friend is right that that will leave a serious gap. In 2003, I visited Key West with the Intelligence and Security Committee. People were hugely complimentary there about the work that our ships do in the Caribbean on drugs interdiction. They wanted not less, but significantly more of that contribution, as we did the job so well. It is a shame that the Government&#039;s decision announced in their response to the Defence Committee report was not the subject of a statement on which they could be properly questioned. I am not at all sure that it is the right decision.

<a name="stpa_274">Today in London, we know how vital it is to have security and defence forces of which we are proud. It is good to know that they are well resourced and able to take on the unpredictable challenges that we all face nowadays. Let us not forget, however, that the incidents that have occurred today in London are the sort of events that have happened on a regular basis in Iraq and that our troops are working with courage and persistence to restore order in that country in sometimes difficult and extraordinarily unusual circumstances.

<a name="stpa_275">The Secretary of State drew attention on Monday to a crucial matter. He said that it was a pity that the praise and gratitude showered on our forces in Iraq for trying to maintain normality there is not always echoed by the media at home. He is right about that. It is not in the least surprising that the work of our troops in Iraq is not news, because it is the media&#039;s role to report &quot;news&quot; in the sense of something unusual. The fact that&#151;day in, day out&#151;8,500&nbsp;of our servicemen and women are working hard to help the Iraqis to lead a normal life is not news.

 At the weekend, I met a squaddie who had just returned from Basra and I had a drink with him.

That is certainly no surprise to me, as someone who has regularly met members of the Queen&#039;s Lancaster Regiment; but I simply wish, as the right hon. Gentleman says, that it was more widely known among people in this country. It is not more widely known because of the way in which the press distort what is actually happening.

<a name="stpa_277">I should like to hear from the Minister when he responds to the debate how he believes that recruitment to the armed forces is going. What does he believe is the structure of the recruitment process? There are suggestions that the process has been stripped out to provide people and equipment to the front line. That may be a short-term answer to what is a medium and long-term problem. I should like reassurance from the Minister when he responds.

<a name="stpa_278">Similarly, the Armed Forces Pay Review Body is important and needs to preserve its independence in everything that it does&#151;independence not only from the Executive, but from the Treasury. My hon.

<a name="stpa_281">As we remember this weekend the end of the second world war, I want to turn our thoughts to the immense bravery and sacrifice of so many of our citizens. It is indeed a very fitting time to be debating defence in the world. At the end of the first world war, there was a determination that such slaughter should never happen again, and the League of Nations was set up. As we all know, in spite of idealism and optimism, the League of Nations did not live up to the great expectations of it.

</p>

<p>
<a name="50707-25_para10">
<a name="stpa_282">The United Nations was set up at the end of the second world war and in a mood of optimism. Its history has not been easy, and there have been many setbacks. Now, on the 60th anniversary of the end of the second world war, it is vital that we again recognise the importance of international collaboration, and that we rededicate our efforts to working at a European and a global level. We are a major world player. We are influential and with that influence comes responsibility&#151;a responsibility to use that influence effectively.

<p>
<a name="50707-25_para11">
<a name="stpa_283">It is so heartening that vital issues such as tackling poverty and climate change and promoting fair trade, which were once the cries only of minority groups and the Churches, are now mainstream issues that are being discussed at the highest level&#151;at the G8. That is due in no small measure to this Government&#039;s conviction and activities. Too often, however, efforts to eradicate poverty are thwarted by armed conflict. We now need to use our influence to strengthen the United Nations, and to work at a global level to eliminate pointless massacre. We know that in dealing with some bullies and tyrants, talking is unfortunately not enough. We need a strong deterrent force, and to show that we are prepared to use it. Given our influential position in the world, we need to work with a broad range of countries. We must maintain and develop our defence capacity not just for our own defence, but as part of our contribution to global peace.

I said that if they handled that event in the wrong way, they would create 10,000&nbsp;bin Ladens. Does anyone doubt that 10,000&nbsp;bin Ladens at least have been created by the events of the past two and a half years? If they do, they have their head in the sand.

<a name="stpa_296">Given that one cannot defend oneself against every angry man among the enrag&#233;s of the earth, it follows that the only thing we can do is address what the Secretary of State called the causal circumstances that lie behind these events. That means trying to reduce the hatred in the world and trying to deal with the political crises out of which these events have flowed. If, instead of doing that, we remain in this consensual bubble in which we have placed ourselves, we will go on making the same mistakes over and over again. We will go on with Guantanamo Bay. We will go on as we are doing, making Abu Ghraib not smaller as we were told would happen after the photographs were published, but bigger. We will go on with occupation and war as the principal instruments of our foreign and defence policy. If we do that, some people will get through and hurt us as they have hurt us here today, and if we still do not learn the lesson, that dismal, melancholic cycle will continue.

<a name="stpa_297">It ought to be common sense that people start from the standpoint that the only thing that matters is whether what we plan to do will make things better or worse. I listened to the Secretary of State lay out the success story of Afghanistan and Iraq, and his account bore no relationship to the truth or reality. He talked about Afghanistan as a success story and about the President of Afghanistan, when everyone knows that Karzai is the president of the congestion charge area of downtown Kabul and no more. He talked about an Afghan army&#151;it is a fantasy. Afghanistan is a patchwork quilt of warlordism, where the warlords&#039; armies dwarf the so-called Afghan national army. He talked about drugs and narcotics: before we invaded the country those lunatics of the Taliban were reducing heroin production in Afghanistan, but the people whom we have put into power there have increased production by 800&nbsp;per cent. Our armed forces are in Afghanistan and our taxes are being used to support a political structure that is producing 90&nbsp;per cent. of the junk that ends up in the veins of our young people in Glasgow, east London and many other places in the world.

It is impossible for the Secretary of State to say we shall withdraw in any given time frame, because Iraq is getting worse, not better. There are more people being killed in Iraq now than there were before. More military operations are being conducted by the Iraqi resistance than before. Last Saturday alone, 175&nbsp;military operations were mounted by the Iraqi resistance on one day.

Eighty-eight other young men from this country are dead as a result of this, yet our Ministers roll out their jokes and their cod philosophy here today. They have absolutely no grasp of the gravity of the situation, or of how unpopular their stand has become outside these walls.

I am sorry that the Secretary of State made no mention of our reserve forces in his opening remarks, although I realise that he was pressed for time. I shall consider in some detail the ongoing TA future army structure review.
</p>

<a name="stpa_307">The Government have repeatedly tried to maintain that our armed forces do not suffer from overstretch, yet by their own definition, according to the 1998&nbsp;strategic defence review, overstretch is

</ul>

</p>

<p>
<a name="50707-27_para5">
<a name="stpa_308">It is blindingly obvious that our armed forces are working under those conditions. The two accepted measures for dealing with overstretch are to increase recruitment and retention and/or to reduce overseas commitments. Instead, the Government&#039;s defence policy includes cutting existing numbers, freezing recruitment and increasing our commitments, be it in&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the Balkans, Afghanistan, Iraq, East Timor or elsewhere.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50707-27_para6">
<a name="stpa_309">Our armed forces also have UK commitments, such as the 2001&nbsp;foot and mouth crisis, flooding or Operation Fresco, the reaction to the firefighters strike. Although our armed forces have always risen to those challenges with the professionalism for which they are renowned, they highlight in no uncertain terms the pressures under which our armed services are working.

</p>

<p>
<a name="50707-27_para7">
<a name="stpa_310">The imbalance between commitments and capabilities has led to an unfair over-reliance on reservists.

<p>
<a name="50707-27_para8">

<a name="stpa_312">We have already seen that operations in theatres such as Bosnia, Kosovo, Afghanistan and Iraq could not have been undertaken without the use of reserve forces. About 8,500&nbsp;personnel are currently deployed in Iraq, down from 46,000&nbsp;at the peak of the fighting phase. About 6,170&nbsp;TA personnel were mobilised on Operation Telic. I accept that that may seem only a small percentage of the total TA force, but we must remember that only TA soldiers deemed fit for role can be mobilised&#151;those who have been trained in their proper profession and who are suitable for the job that they are

<br>&nbsp;<br>being held against. As there is a high turnover of TA personnel&#151;it can be up to 25&nbsp;per cent. in any one unit in any one year&#151;the pool of TA servicemen who can be called on at any one time for operational service is much smaller than the overall figure that is given.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50707-27_para10">
<a name="stpa_313">I have recently left a bomb disposal regiment and I know that the soldiers available to fill the slots required in Iraq are very few indeed. The same people are called again and again. I have been mobilised for operational service twice in the past four years. The TA is a shotgun that can be fired, but I am not convinced that the Secretary of State is fully addressing the regeneration issues caused by the constant mobilisation of the same personnel.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50707-27_para11">
<a name="stpa_314">With that in mind, it is perhaps unfortunate that, last December, the Government announced plans to increase the total number of part-time servicemen deployed in Iraq to 1,000&nbsp;by May 2005. According to the MOD, under the SDR, TA personnel will be considered for service in Iraq for as long as that conflict continues. The Iraq war has created a few problems for TA members. Many did not receive any pay in the first weeks after mobilisation. It was appalling that, while they were at war, they had to arrange finance to cover loans and mortgages, adding unnecessary work and anxiety, and that &#163;40&nbsp;million in additional retention bounties due to be paid out March 2004&nbsp;was retained by the MOD because of computer problems. There are also concerns about insurance, especially as many reservists had little notice of their mobilisation.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50707-27_para12">
<a name="stpa_315">A survey of TA personnel sent to the Gulf found that 80&nbsp;per cent. did not expect their employer to support any future development, 63&nbsp;per cent. of medical and technical staff said that they were thinking of resigning from the TA, 73&nbsp;per cent. said that the NHS would lose vital skills because of deployments and 39&nbsp;per cent. were worried about the effect on their job security.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50707-27_para13">
<a name="stpa_316">That said, on a positive note, I am encouraged that much has been learned from the experience of Operation Telic and the attitude surveys of soldiers returning from deployed operations. That has led to a progressive overhaul of, and gradual improvements to, TA conditions of service and employer and welfare support. The MOD&#039;s support for reservists is improving&#151;I give credit to the Government for that&#151;and includes providing demobilising reservists with information regarding their legal rights. Another step in the right direction is the SaBRE&#151;supporting Britain&#039;s reservists and employers&#151;campaign. However, more needs to be done, as two independent reports commissioned by the Government show that employers&#039; awareness of SaBRE in the first year of its existence was very low.

<a name="stpa_317">Although reservists are given statutory protection under the provisions of the Reserve Forces (Safeguard of Employment) Act 1985, some reservists have problems in retaining their jobs while serving in the armed forces. The Reserve Forces Act 1996&nbsp;states that, if a reservist loses their job, they can take their employer to an industrial tribunal, but crucially the MOD does not act on their behalf. Also, although that Act rightly gives reservists safeguard of employment, it does not give safeguard of promotion.

Reservists are being mobilised once, coming back, realising that they must give priority to their primary career, not to the Territorial Army, and resigning. That is putting even greater pressure on current members of the reserve forces because the pool from which people can be drawn is getting smaller and smaller.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50707-27_para16">
<a name="stpa_319">I think that under the circumstances I have probably gone on for too long. Since other Members want to speak, I will not proceed to my second point.

In the light of the tone of the debate, or most of it, I do not want to attack the Government over what has gone wrong or what has gone right.

<a name="stpa_322">Just before the general election, I was with the brilliant Scots Guards in al-Amarah in Iraq. I served with the Grenadier Guards, and the Scots Guards is nearly as good a regiment. In my time, the Guards formed a very self-contained unit, with its own medics, paras and signallers. It was very proud of its ability to deploy fully and integrally by itself.

<a name="50707-28_para3">
<a name="stpa_323">I was enormously proud to see the Royal Gibraltar Regiment serving with the Scots Guards in al-Amarah. The people from Gibraltar can be very proud of their work, but I had to ask the colonel in charge why the Scots Guards had to deploy with other detachments. He told me that the regiment was no longer able to deploy on its own and that it now had to work with other units. There is a severe shortage of guardsmen and especially of experienced NCOs. The Secretary of State must address that problem, to which I shall return later.

<a name="50707-28_para4">
<a name="stpa_324">As I walked around the camp, I noticed the fantastic Warrior armoured vehicles, of which the Scots Guards are very proud.

<br>&nbsp;<br>duty. That was because the new Bowman radio system, for which we waited for what seemed like a decade, does not fit into the Warrior&#039;s turret. That is why all the vehicles had to be adapted, and could not be used while the adaptation was carried out.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50707-28_para5">
<a name="stpa_325">I cannot believe that that was not foreseen. The Bowman equipment is only a little box. Earlier, the Secretary of State used the phrase &quot;not rocket science&quot;;. It is not rocket science to realise that a little box needs a little hole, but this little hole was too little. That was demoralising for the very brave troops trying to do their job in the field.

<a name="50707-28_para6">
<a name="stpa_326">As for accommodation, it was hard to remember that we are in the 21st century. Our troops were deployed with troops from all over the world and accommodated in very nice tents whose air conditioning does not always work. When that happens, troops open both ends of the tent and let the wind blow through. In the middle of a desert, the British Army has to live in tents: just 400&nbsp;yards up the road, the American armed forces have deployable pods with air conditioning, showers and other facilities.

<p>
<a name="50707-28_para7">
<a name="stpa_327">I accept that operational problems occur, but this is the 21st century. The American pods were brought in by contractors. When I was in Germany in the 1970s, the Americans came off exercises and went for showers in massive articulated lorries. We stood and watched, as proud as punch and smelling like anything because we had not had a shower for nearly two weeks.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50707-28_para8">
<a name="stpa_328">I accept that that is how the British Army works, and it is why we have the best soldiers in the world. However, on such a long-term deployment as the one in Iraq, it cannot be right that the problem with the tent that I have set out should have occurred.

<p>
<a name="50707-28_para9">
<a name="stpa_329">When I was in the military, we were all very proud of the NAAFI, which has done a wonderful job of looking after our troops for many years. I asked the guys in al-Amarah how much they used the NAAFI shop there. They told me that they tried not to use it at all, because the locals sold goods such as CDs, batteries&#151;or even drink&#151;more cheaply. I know that a parliamentary question on this matter was tabled before the Secretary of State came to office, but why are the goods that we sell to our troops more expensive than the ones that they can obtain privately from local sources? It is ridiculous. The NAAFI is there not to rip off our troops, but to serve them in the field.

<a name="50707-28_para10">
<a name="stpa_330">Probably the biggest bugbear in the British Army since the time that I joined in 1974&nbsp;and still today is the personal webbing and kit of a soldier in the field. We had the debacle of the SA80&nbsp;and whether it would be refurbished or not. The new SA80&nbsp;A2&nbsp;is a damn good weapon. We accept that. The troops said to me, &quot;The first one was a heap of rubbish, sir. This one actually works.&quot; That is fantastic news, but we should have got it right at the start.

I asked why that was. When I served in the Guards, I could not even put a pair of bootlaces into my boots without my sergeant major saying, &quot;That&#039;s not issue, lad. You&#039;re not having it in there.&quot; When I asked the commanding officer in Iraq what was going on, he replied, &quot;Our decision is now, sir, if the soldiers can buy it and are willing to buy it, and it&#039;s better than what they get on issue, we&#039;ll let them wear it.&quot;

<a name="stpa_332">I was astounded. The Guards, of all the regiments, would never have let that happen. The reason it is happening is that the kit that the taxpayer is buying and that we are procuring for our troops is not suitable for use. We need a full review. I know the Minister disagrees, but we need a review of personal kit. Before the election, I met a mother whose son had just joined the Royal Engineers. She had spent &#163;1,000&nbsp;out of her own money buying kit for him. The average sum spent, the soldiers in Iraq told me, was &#163;750. That cannot be right. Taxpayers&#039; money is being spent, yet these guys and girls are still going off and buying equipment.

I suggested that lots of nurses must have been called up through the Territorial Army. &quot;We&#039;ve called up all we can, Mr. Penning,&quot; they said, &quot;but we are still desperately short of nurses.&quot; I asked how they were filling the gap. &quot;Well, Mr. Penning, I mustn&#039;t tell you this, but we are using a company called Frontier Medical. That&#039;s an agency. We have agency nurses here in al-Amarah, supporting our troops in the field.&quot; I praise the agency nurses for having the guts and determination to go out there, but they are on &#163;600&nbsp;a day.

They are going before their commanding officer and asking to purchase their discharge from the armed forces. Why are senior NCOs leaving the armed forces after six, seven, eight or nine years? The answer is that they are going back to Iraq, Minister. They are going back to be part of the security services out there because they can earn in a day what our guys are earning in a fortnight. That must be wrong. We must assess why that is happening.

The Minister knows that, as it has come up time and again. Our experienced servicemen are going back home. The Scots Guards have gone back to Munster. Even before they have left the area, it is known that most of the senior and middle-ranking NCOs will leave the armed forces. Something must be done to encourage them to stay. They joined the armed forces because they wanted to be in the armed forces, but they are being undermined while they are out there serving.

I fear&#151;I am not saying this just because he is not present&#151;that his comments will probably have caused even more problems for morale in the armed forces. They are the last thing that our troops need to hear. What really worried me, though, was his saying that a 17-year-old soldier had been deployed to Iraq. I was a boy soldier, but could not be deployed even to Northern Ireland until I was 18. If what the hon. Gentleman said was incorrect, I hope that the Minister will let us know. Soldiers must be 18, and that is how it should be. Boy soldiers should not be deployed, and God forbid that they ever will be.

 Today&#039;s debate is all about defence in the world. The fact that Britain is a major military power means that we have a tremendous amount of responsibility in regard to where we deploy our armed forces. Obviously, there are parts of the world that we must protect. Places such as the Falkland islands and Gibraltar depend on us, and the British public understands why we are sending our troops to those places. In fact, they support us. They support the Government wholeheartedly, and approve of the spending of money and other resources on protecting the places where we send our troops.

Some of our NATO allies are helping. Countries such as Poland and Italy have sent troops. They are with us there, supporting us in bringing democracy and stability to the country. However, I disagree with the Secretary of State for Defence, who assured me that all NATO members were doing their bit. I do not believe that they are. I think that NATO is meant to be a bloc of total solidarity between nations. If we do something, all the member countries in that bloc should participate, but I believe that some NATO allies have not done as much as they could to support us in Iraq.

 If I may, I shall explain briefly why we have troops in Sierra Leone and what they are doing there. They are part of an international military training team, of which they form the greatest number. Their purpose is to train the Sierra Leone forces so that they can take on the problems internally in that country to maintain stability and to enable them to work with neighbouring countries to try to bring stability to that region.

We have seen such difficulties in Iraq. Although the British troops have lots of experience of dealing with difficult situations in Northern Ireland, the actions of the American troops and the anger that they cause have an impact on the British troops and put them in a difficult situation. When we find ourselves, as we do now, with great constraints on resources throughout the world, we end up stretching our troops very thinly and facing difficulties with kit. As a result of the Government&#039;s defence policy, we put the troops in a situation that is unacceptable in many ways.

 I wish to start with a quotation from that great public servant, the late Lord Ismay. He served as Churchill&#039;s representative on the Chiefs of Staff committee throughout world war two and later became the first Secretary-General of NATO. He therefore spanned a great deal of the history of the 20th century, and in his active service as a young officer, he had something to do with insurgencies as well. When he was looking back on this unparalleled career, he wrote:

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_43">&quot;It is easy to criticise peaceful democracies for their habitual lack of preparedness when a war breaks out, but it is only fair to recognise that the dice are loaded against them. Dictators, bent on aggression &nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. are masters of their own timetable. They are free to decide when to strike, where to strike and how to strike, and to arrange their armament programmes accordingly. Their potential victims, the democracies &nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. with their inherent hatred of war, do not know when or where the blow will fall, or what manner of blow it will be.&quot;</p>

</p>

<p>
<a name="50707-29_para14">
<a name="stpa_353">I will not speculate about who did this, but I will make a prediction. My prediction is that it will be found in the end that very small numbers of people indeed were involved in carrying out these atrocities, just as very small numbers were involved in carrying out the atrocities that we have seen in a variety of countries since September 2001. I do not know whether the people carrying out these atrocities have a real understanding of the resilience of democratic societies under such circumstances. Again, I agree with the hon. Member for Bethnal Green and Bow to the extent that, from the point of view of the victim, it makes very little difference whether they are killed by a suicide bomber on a bus or by a high explosive dropped from an aircraft.

What is it that people of this sort really expect us to do? Do they really expect us to hand over a country such as Iraq to people, for the most part foreigners, who would destroy any chance of freedom for the millions of people who make up that society? Did they expect us to have done nothing in Afghanistan? I remember that a Member in the last Parliament said that we should have bombed Afghanistan with bread, not bombs, and subsequently identified with, and empathised with, suicide terrorists in the middle east.

<a name="stpa_356">When we consider the defence in the world that we have to undertake, we must recognise that the people who are mounting these campaigns fully understand the importance of having maximum impact for minimum effort. We must fight on the ground where we are strongest, not where they are strongest. The hon. Member for Bethnal Green and Bow said that some of those people are prepared to sacrifice their lives if they can take thousands of people with them. Yes, indeed they are, which is why there is only one threat about which we really must worry as a nation, as opposed to as individuals, families and people who may get caught up in random or planned acts of terrorism: people of that sort must never be allowed to get their hands on weapons that could possibly kill thousands or tens of thousands because we know that they would unhesitatingly use them if they could get hold of them. That is why the threshold has been lowered for intervention internationally. That is why one cannot take the chance of allowing other countries with dictatorial regimes that might think it in their interests to make such weapons available to such terrorists to continue to have the possibility of owning those weapons, unless they can satisfy the international community that they absolutely have renounced them.

However, I say to him that those two propositions have nothing whatsoever to do with each other. Whether or not we have a successor to Trident will of course not diminish the problem of terrorists getting their hands on fissile material, but it would certainly add to our dangers if we got into a situation in which other countries continued to possess nuclear weapons while we renounced ours.

Nothing could be better calculated to increase the dangers to our troops working in Iraq than the knowledge that the insurgents had to hold on only for so long and those troops would be gone. If we are to fight a campaign of this sort, the message has to be that there will be no withdrawal until the enemy are defeated, so they may as well give up now because they are not going to win. Anything less than that message and we may as well not have got involved in the first place; otherwise, we will be heading for unnecessary casualties and ultimate costly failure.

Whatever one thinks of the rights and wrongs of the Arab-Israeli dispute, one must recognise that the incidents that have happened on such a heavy scale in Israel have no chance whatever of overthrowing the Israeli state.

The answer is that people with a career that points them in a certain direction during its active phase sometimes, with a view to history, like to rewrite it or reshape it during their retirement.

<a name="stpa_374">This debate has taken place on a solemn day in solemn circumstances. These circumstances remind us that we have to protect ourselves, and they do not suggest that the way to protect ourselves is always to do everything that our enemies and opponents want us to do. It is not enough to say that the suicide bomber should have his cause understood. It is not enough to say that it was predictable that these events would happen. Of course it was predictable, but that does not mean to say that we could have done anything other than what we did, which was to try to take on the godfathers of, and root causes of, terrorist movements in countries far from here. If we do not take them on far away from these shores and tackle them in the way we have, on a bipartisan basis, we can expect more&#151;not less&#151;aggravation, atrocities, death and destruction within these shores.

<a name="stpa_376">Once again, we have had a vigorous, healthy and well-informed defence debate that has shown the importance of our armed forces to us all. I may not agree with many of the points made by Opposition Members, or even with some of those made by Labour Members, but I&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;think that we will all agree&#151;with perhaps one exception&#151;that the praise that we give to the armed forces is well deserved. The services deserve our thanks and admiration for their selfless efforts, in often dangerous and unpredictable circumstances, in countries throughout the world. They serve this nation well and they can take justifiable pride in all that they do as a force for good.

</p>

<a name="50707-30_para3">
<a name="stpa_377">I thank for their contributions the right hon. and learned Member for Devizes (Mr. Ancram)&#151;I understand that he cannot be in his place to hear the wind-ups&#151;my hon. Friend the Member for Pendle (Mr. Prentice), the hon. Member for Berwickshire, Roxburgh and Selkirk (Mr. Moore), my hon. Friend the Member for Vale of Glamorgan (John Smith), the hon.

I also welcomed the contributions from the hon. Members for Shrewsbury and Atcham (Daniel Kawczynski) and for Birmingham, Yardley (John Hemming), and, of course, from the hon. Member for New Forest, East (Dr. Lewis).
</p>

<p>
<a name="50707-30_para4">
<a name="stpa_378">In opening this debate, my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State referred to some of our successes in helping to make this a better and more secure world. To that end, our armed forces have served with distinction in Iraq, Afghanistan, the Balkans and west and central Africa, as well as in Northern Ireland. Our forces will remain committed in all those areas for as long as they are needed. However, it is obvious that the challenges that we face today&#151;international terrorism, the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and the risks posed by failed and failing states&#151;cannot be solved solely by military solutions. An effective response to these problems requires integrated planning of military, diplomatic and economic actions at national and international levels.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50707-30_para5">
<a name="stpa_379">My right hon. Friend made it clear that NATO and the Euro-Atlantic partnership remain a cornerstone of our defence. My right hon. Friend also made it clear that the European Union has a distinct role to play in addressing today&#039;s security challenges. Our presidency of the European Union provides us with the opportunity to continue to develop the European security and defence policy. That is an opportunity to improve European capabilities and achieve greater co-ordination between the civil and military components of the response to an emerging crisis.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50707-30_para6">
<a name="stpa_380">The work reflects our efforts nationally to join up the activities of different Departments and improve our ability to address the threats of today and tomorrow. The Ministry of Defence is working ever closer with the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, the Department for

<br>&nbsp;<br>International Development and other Departments to try to deal with threats and tensions before they escalate into conflict.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50707-30_para7">
<a name="stpa_381">The global and Africa conflict prevention pools that were set up in 2001&nbsp;provide us with a unique cross-Whitehall structure for co-ordinating military, diplomatic and development activity to tackle the long term and underlying causes of instability overseas. Our policy is to focus our engagement on those countries and regions where we believe that the United Kingdom can make a genuine difference. Through that strategy, we have achieved notable successes in several countries across the globe, from Belize to Indonesia.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50707-30_para8">
<a name="stpa_382">Let me give some practical examples of what our people achieve through their activities. The British peace support team in east Africa has been training African Union personnel so that they can undertake peace support operations in Darfur. Following our successful support for Kenyan de-miners, operating with the United Nations in Eritrea, the Royal Engineers are assisting the Kenyans in developing the international mines action training centre in Nairobi. I had the honour of officially opening that centre last year. The hon. Member for Shrewsbury and Atcham asked why we are in certain places. I hope that he considers that activity to be beneficial and therefore justified.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50707-30_para9">
<a name="stpa_383">The United Kingdom also leads the world in expertise on security sector reform. That work develops potentially unstable countries&#039; security structures so that they can provide their own security and reduce their reliance on assistance from us and other nations. Let me give two examples. Our experts have supported the Jamaicans in developing their national security strategy and are training the Indonesian military in the importance of civilian oversight and the democratic accountability of the armed forces. Does the hon. Member for Shrewsbury and Atcham agree with that deployment? If not, why not?
</p>

<p>
<a name="50707-30_para10">
<a name="stpa_384">The conflict prevention pools also fund security sector reform activities to support post-conflict stabilisation in Afghanistan, Iraq and the Balkans. In Afghanistan, the Ministry of Defence supports Afghan defence reform, demobilisation and disarmament. That work is complemented by DFID and FCO-led programmes for reintegrating its competence and reforming the police. Does the hon. Member for Shrewsbury and Atcham believe that that is a place where our commitment is worth while? <i>[Interruption.]</i> He questioned where we are, what we are doing and the merits of it.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50707-30_para11">
<a name="stpa_385">Of course, we can always improve on the way in which we do things. We especially acknowledge the challenge that conflict prevention and stabilisation work presents in the period that immediately follows conflict. We are in a crucial period, when we need several Departments to react quickly and in a co-ordinated fashion to begin reconstruction activities as soon as the security situation allows. We recognise some of the weaknesses in our approach to Iraq, but as a result of our experience we decided last year to establish a cross-Government, post-conflict reconstruction unit. I could provide other examples but I want to deal with the debate.

<p>
<a name="50707-30_para12">
<a name="stpa_386">The right hon. and learned Member for Devizes made several points that other hon. Members also mentioned. He referred to the National Audit Office report on capabilities and military readiness. He mentioned Afghanistan and our work on counter-narcotics and he asked about recruitment. The NAO report on military readiness suggested that 38&nbsp;per cent. of the forces reported serious weaknesses in readiness for new operations. Critically&#151;I emphasise that word&#151;the report showed that only 2&nbsp;per cent. of forces reported critical weaknesses that would make it impossible to deploy them on operations. Of course, those have been addressed and corrected. By the end of March, no forces were reporting critical weaknesses.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50707-30_para13">
<a name="stpa_387">Some weaknesses are inevitable given the current operational commitments, especially in units recuperating from operational deployment. It is important to understand what is happening and to put in place measures to correct that. It is important to represent the balance of the NAO&#039;s views. The report specifically says that the MOD has a


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_50">&quot;good understanding of risks to readiness&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="50707-30_para14">
<a name="stpa_388">and, importantly,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_51">&quot;good plans&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. to mitigate them&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="50707-30_para15">
<a name="stpa_389">Let us look at the impact. The armed forces are heavily committed, but the number of regular armed forces deployed on operations was reduced from 20&nbsp;per cent. to 18&nbsp;per cent. over the course of the year, and has gone down from the 35&nbsp;per cent. peak of the war-fighting stage in Iraq. We believe that that is challenging but sustainable, and that we can do more if need to.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50707-30_para16">
<a name="stpa_390">The impact on the Royal Navy was also examined. It has been said that in the worst-case scenario little more than half the fleet would be able to deploy within the allocated time as the result of a deliberate decision by the MOD to run down the Navy&#039;s readiness. In paragraph 2.8, however, the report makes it clear that as it continues to be likely that the greatest operational demands will be made of the Army and some parts of the RAF, the MOD has deliberately taken risk against peacetime levels of some maritime forces. I believe that that is sensible&#151;one has to balance priorities and needs. To mitigate that risk, however, the Navy has introduced a system of reduced support periods for some ships to make sure that those that we are most likely to need are available. Again, that appears to be working well. The Navy is not currently indicating any critical weaknesses and the NAO report shows how readiness might decline if remedial action is not taken. It acknowledges in paragraph 2.11&nbsp;our decision to put additional funds into the Navy to ensure that the worst-case scenario does not come to pass. Once the problem has been measured, mechanisms are put in place to address it.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50707-30_para17">
<a name="stpa_391">On the cannibalisation of equipment, the removal of ship&#039; fitted equipment&#151;STOROB&#151;is not a new concept. It is only used, however, to make high-readiness operational commitments when a donor ship is either reducing in readiness towards upkeep of disposal or is already in upkeep. Sensible STOROB management is an effective way of dealing with the problem. It becomes a matter of concern, however, if we are doing that to such an extent that we cannot deliver the Navy&#039;s requirements. Hon. Members have expressed deep concern about cannibalisation, but only 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>7 Jul 2005 : Column 541</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>4&nbsp;per cent. of requisition stores preparing ships for putting to sea used that method. It would be great to make it 0&nbsp;per cent., but it is effective management.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50707-30_para18">
<a name="stpa_392">Counter-narcotics is without question a very big issue in Afghanistan. People present the argument that it is a problem, but no one comes up with an answer about how to tackle it or what resources need to be put in place to deal with it. We understand the nature of the country and the people better, but we have only been there a short time. We have clearly identified that the best solution will be achieved through the Afghans themselves, who must take on the challenge as much as us. They must accept that they need to strengthen their resources so that they can deal with the problem specifically and effectively. That is part of the mission in which we are engaged&#151;it is about lifting the capabilities of the Afghan army in the special anti-narcotics force and in the Army as a whole so that it can tackle the problem.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50707-30_para19">
<a name="stpa_393">A survey of the 2004&nbsp;poppy crop in Afghanistan revealed that cultivation had gone up by 64&nbsp;per cent. and that production had gone up by 17&nbsp;per cent., which is clearly unwelcome. There are early signs this year, however, that there may be an overall reduction in opium poppy cultivation, but we must wait for assessments later this year from the UN and the US. If people identify the problem, they must suggest mechanisms that we need to put in place to deal with it. We are trying not only to bolster the strength and ability of the Afghan Government to deal with the problem militarily, but to work across the whole civil administration in Afghanistan using measures on law enforcement, alternative livelihoods, criminal justice, eradication, demand reduction and regional co-operation. Narcotics is a big issue, but one that I believe we are beginning to tackle vigorously.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50707-30_para20">
<a name="stpa_394">We must always pay close attention to recruitment and retention. Trends happen before we necessarily understand that they are trends, and we are always in the position of having to deal with them in terms of our best understanding of their impact. By the end of financial year 2004&#150;05, the services had achieved 96&nbsp;per cent. of their overall recruiting target. That is a significant achievement, even though the targets had been reduced because we set them in line with the size that we wanted our armed forces to be. However, we still found it hard to achieve 100&nbsp;per cent. of that reduced target. Anyone who has seen the energy, effort and intensity of work that the recruiting teams put in will know that that was not for want of trying.

</p>

<p>
<a name="50707-30_para21">
<a name="stpa_395">We are up against a range of factors. We have a problem with the gatekeepers. The economy is strong, which makes recruitment in a particular age cohort difficult. All those issues have been addressed by the armed forces and we shall continue to do the best we can on recruitment. If there is a problem of retention, we need to understand why it is happening and what remedial measures can be implemented. If those measures do not work&#151;sometimes they do not&#151;we will have to find other solutions. The process is sophisticated and we are making great efforts to address the problems.

<a name="stpa_396">The hon. Member for Berwickshire, Roxburgh and Selkirk mentioned the fleet review last week&#151;a wonderful occasion. He also spoke about HMS Invincible as though something new had happened. In fact, we simply brought forward by a number of months what we were going to do anyway, and those who followed what was happening in relation to the utilisation of our carriers would have known that that was going to happen.

<a name="stpa_397">The hon. Gentleman called for a timetable for withdrawal from Iraq; interestingly, he did not call for a timetable for withdrawal from Afghanistan. I question why. If withdrawal is right in principle in one country, it should be right elsewhere. I do not believe that it is right to set a timetable because it simply establishes a target at which those forces that are out to do evil can aim. I do not think that they would sit around and wait for the timetabled withdrawal. Rather, they would escalate their activities to precipitate an earlier withdrawal, causing greater loss of life, not necessarily among coalition forces, but among their own people. That is what is happening in Iraq and in Afghanistan.

That is one of the reasons why we are restructuring the British Army. We are taking approximately 2,500&nbsp;posts, redefining them and then reinserting them as key enablers.
