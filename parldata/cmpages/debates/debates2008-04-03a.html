He is perfectly right to say that the UK Government are giving active consideration to other technologies and designs for new nuclear reactors. The agreement that we have made in relation to regulatory co-operation with the French authorities is a perfectly sensible one and I hope that it will shorten the time required for the important reactor assessment work, but we are also looking at other designs, and the agreement does not exclude proper consideration of other technologies.</p>

 In this brave new world that our Prime Minister and the French President have been fashioning, have they taken account of the full commercial cost of decommissioning and nuclear waste disposal? A report published by Ian Jackson just a few days ago estimated that unless the charges to the new nuclear station operators are kept at about 10 per cent. or less of the full commercial cost being charged to external and foreign disposers now, the whole project will be imperilled and we shall be adding yet further to the &#163;73 billion national cost of cleaning up existing waste.

 The Government are looking at and taking advice on a variety of different sources, as one would imagine, but it is important, as we have always made clear both in the White Paper and other ministerial statements, that we expect the operators of any new nuclear plants to meet the full commercial costs of decommissioning and waste disposal. Dr. Tim Stone, my principal adviser on the matter, is in consultation with the potential developers as we speak, a document has been published and the process is full, transparent and open. We are building a proper margin into the fixed price for waste disposal and decommissioning to ensure that the taxpayer does not meet any residual liabilities, and it is important that we are all clear that we should proceed with new nuclear development in the UK on that basis.</p>

My concern about the stance taken by the hon. Gentleman and his party is that there is a real danger that that interdependence will be compromised.

 Further to the Secretary of State&#146;s answer to my right hon. Friend the Member for Fylde (Mr. Jack), why has it taken until now for the Government suddenly to wake up to the fact that we should be co-operating with France over nuclear power? In 2005, for example, the Italians took a 12.5 per cent. stake in a major nuclear power plant right on the Normandy coast, our nearest geographical point in France. Is it not the case that over 10 years, the Government have been very indolent at planning for our nuclear power decommissioning and left the UK very exposed, given the length of time that it will take to build a new nuclear power station?</p>

 There has been no recent discussion with the five mobile network operators on the regulation of the trade in mobile ringtones. A code of practice was introduced in the autumn of 2005 by the Mobile Entertainment Forum, which required information providers and aggregators who trade mobile ringtones to be more explicit about cost, terms and conditions. In particular, mobile network operators have made it easier for customers to cancel subscriptions: they simply need to send a message consisting of the word &#147;STOP&#148;. I understand that that has resulted in a reported 62 per cent. fall in the number of complaints.</p>

I have just two points to make about the trade deficit: it was much higher at some point in the 1980s than it is now, and, more importantly, UK competitiveness depends more on productivity, so I am glad to be able to say that on that we are narrowing the gap between the UK and our principal economic competitors.</p>

 Obviously, we are always looking at ways to support the rural post office network with new business opportunities, and I know that Alan Cook, the chief executive, is fully committed to doing that. I should also make another point, of which I am sure the right hon. Gentleman is aware. The Government are heavily subsidising the rural post office network. My hon. Friend the Minister for Employment Relations and Postal Affairs has made clear in questions today the extent of that support and what would happen if it were not available. Post offices in the right hon. Gentleman&#146;s constituency, and in many other rural constituencies, would find it impossible to operate if it were not for that subsidy. So, the size of the network is being sustained, and it is being significantly built on compared with what it would be if we were just relying on an ability to run a commercial service. That is the right and proper thing for us to do, because we recognise the important role that post offices play in every constituency in Britain, including our rural areas.</p>

With household bills, mortgage repayments and everyday prices rising&#151;even the <i> Daily Mirror</i> today published a table showing how the poorest will be worse off, under the headline &#147;Fury at 10p Tax Axe&#148;&#151;her denial seems staggering. However, it may be no wonder that we should learn today that although the Government usually publish the annual child poverty figures in March, this year they will bury the bad news by delaying publication until after the local elections. So can we have a statement from the Work and Pensions Secretary to explain that decision?</p>

Many eco-towns are the subject of fierce local opposition, and there are real concerns about the planning process that will apply to them. Will the Leader of the House do her job and give hon.

We have done a great deal to lift pensioners out of poverty, but we have also been concerned about the standard of living of single people.

Stage 2 will then involve a sustainability appraisal. Stage 3 will involve the planning policy statement, which will be discussed and debated in the House.

We completed consideration of only one of six groups of amendments. There was full debate on only three of 20 Government new clauses, only 29 of 109 Government amendments, only five of 18 Opposition new clauses, and only four of 98 Opposition amendments. Clearly, it was a completely ridiculous failure to scrutinise large parts of the Bill. The Leader of the House has helpfully said that she will look into finding a process that means that Government amendments get extra time that does not detract from Opposition scrutiny time. Please may we have a change to the system before we consider the remaining stages of further major Bills, so that they do not suffer the same fate?</p>

 The hon. Gentleman has continued to raise concern about the Government&#146;s handling of the Housing and Regeneration Bill&#151;a matter that was brought up last week in business questions. There are two issues: the first is the volume of amendments and the second concerns timing and the question of when the amendments were laid before the House. I think that we all recognise that if points are raised in Committee, and the Government agree to respond to those points, amendments have to be tabled, and I think the majority of the amendments tabled for the remaining stages were the result of issues raised in Committee.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o44"><a name="80403-0004.htm_para32"><a name="08040378000221">As far as the timing is concerned, my hon. Friend the Deputy Leader of the House and I looked into the issue. The overwhelming majority of the amendments were tabled on the Tuesday before the debate, which was held on the following Monday. Obviously it would have been better if they had been tabled earlier, but as they were tabled on Tuesday, the House not having sat on the Monday, hon.

We want to make sure that we restrict unskilled migrants coming to this country. That is what the points-based system, which to be debated in the House in the coming weeks, is designed to do. The Conservative policy does not have a shred of credibility. The Opposition say they want a cap on migration, but they will not say what the level of the cap would be.

 Will my right hon. and learned Friend consider an urgent debate, when the House returns, on greed in the financial services sector?

 My hon. Friend raises an important point, which touches on a number of issues. It is totally unacceptable for employees to get big bonuses unconnected to their performance in the company, or even in spite of disastrous performance in the company. People think that is very unfair. That is why the Government have introduced measures to ensure that there is transparency and shareholders can see what remuneration committees are deciding about the awarding of bonuses.

 May we have a debate on the implementation by local authorities of the new Government travel concession for pensioners and disabled people? Despite pensioners in Milton Keynes applying well in advance for their new passes, the Liberal Democrat-controlled Milton Keynes council deliberately delayed sending out the passes and then sent them out by second-class post, and as a result, a great many of my constituents are not able to enjoy the concession that they should have been able to from the beginning of this week. May we have a debate to reveal whether this is an isolated incident of incompetence, or a pattern across the board of Liberal Democrat-controlled councils?</p>

 Milton Keynes council should get on with it. Councils should not have to be dragged kicking and screaming to ensure that pensioners get their rights to travel. We first introduced this concession in 2000 when we required councils to make half price fares for pensioners and disabled people&#151;that was a struggle, but at least it was brought in&#151;we then required councils to ensure that within their own area all disabled people and people over 60 should have free bus passes, and we now require them to ensure that not only in their own area but in any area pensioners and disabled people can have free travel. This is important. People should be able to get out and about, and public authorities should be seizing this opportunity not dragging their heels.</p>

 In my constituency, 14 post offices are due for closure, of which eight will be offered outreach facilities, most of which will be mobile services, yet the people living in those communities, particularly in Llanwrtyd Wells would prefer a hosted service in a shop, community centre or pub.

I think that when someone in a Department is answering a question, if it refers to a previous answer they should not just give the <i> Hansard</i> reference but repeat the previous answer, because they have it in front of them and its saves hon.

If what they are doing, having answered the question, is making a reference to a more general, bigger document of 200 pages, that is fair enough. However, it is not fair enough for parliamentary answers just to be signposts in six different directions&#151;they should attempt to meet the Member&#146;s point and be accountable. I agree with the specific points that hon. Members have raised. My hon.

Members whom I can see around me on both sides of the House for the contribution that they have made to the development of the drug strategy that we published a few weeks ago. Their contribution to what is an incredibly important debate in many of our communities has been welcomed. Although they may not agree with all the various points in the strategy, I hope that they recognise some of the differences and changes that have been made. In particular, some of my hon. Friends&#151;and, to be fair, Opposition Members&#151;have said that while it is important to concentrate on the enforcement side, we must also, in order to reduce harm to communities, consider what to do about dealing in the street, crack houses, and those who run gangs in order to supply drugs in a neighbourhood.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o66"><a name="80403-0006.htm_para10"><a name="08040378000318">We must also think about treatment. We have been very successful in increasing the numbers going into treatment, which has been welcomed by all Members. We have taken on board what people have said to us about ensuring that treatment is effective, that it is not only about numbers but outcomes, and that when people enter treatment and seek to leave it we not only consider whether abstinence is appropriate but take into account all the other services that are necessary to support somebody in those circumstances. That means closer relationships with housing and employment services, the benefits system and so on. We try to reflect that in the new strategy.</p>

 I hope that the Minister will focus on the role played by prisons. Far too often, people go into prison as drug addicts having committed volume crimes to feed their addiction. They come out a few months later&#151;a very few months later in many cases&#151;still drug addicts, with no testing beforehand to check whether that is the case. Moreover, there are still too many people who take drugs for the first time in prison. Will he dedicate some time to explaining what is being done in prisons to stop the proliferation of drugs?</p>

 Certainly, one of the things to consider is how drugs get into prisons and to ensure that we are robust in that respect. A lot of measures have been put in place. We have increased the amount of money that is available for prison drug treatment, and it is now about trying to ensure that that treatment is effective. I know that the hon. Gentleman takes a real interest in these matters. He is right to say that just because somebody is locked up that does not mean that they stop being a drug addict, and we need to take measures to deal with that. We need to consider not only what happens to somebody when they are in prison and what is the effective treatment in that situation, but what support is given to them when they leave prison. There are sometimes difficult issues to deal with involving chaotic lifestyles  <br>

and so on. If that support is not available for somebody in those circumstances, the possibility of their returning to crime, whatever the rights and wrongs of that, is increased.</p>

 A good place to start would be to look at the outcome of the billions of pounds that have been spent and the results of the policies adopted 10 years ago, which, I am sorry to say, have failed abjectly. One of those policies was to reduce drug taking among young people by 50 per cent. Virtually nothing has worked in 10 years of effort by this Government. Can we not at least say, &#147;Let&#146;s look at what happened&#151;it went wrong&#148;, and examine why it went wrong?</p>

 I am sorry about that. I discuss and debate many of these matters with my hon. Friend at great length. We have tried to learn from what happened under the previous drug strategy. I know that he welcomes many of the things in the new strategy, such as support for families and making treatment more effective. I point out to him that the British crime survey figures show a fall in the number of 16 to 59-year-olds using all drugs in the past 10 years, during which period the proportion of 16 to 24-year-olds reporting the use of drugs in the past year has also fallen. He asks whether what has happened is good enough, whether we are where we want to be, and whether we want to do more. Of course we want to do more and to be more effective. My point was that in developing the new drug strategy and trying to take forward the agenda, it is important to recognise that the previous drug strategy delivered a reduction in the numbers of those taking drugs, adults and children alike.</p>

 Does the Minister agree, though, that one of the most obvious ways in which we could tackle the problem of supply is to end the absurd situation whereby it is possible readily to buy seeds for strong strains of cannabis on the internet, which also gives advice on how to obtain resin from those strains?</p>

 As the hon. Gentleman and I have discussed on several occasions, we need to monitor certain things that happen in respect of the internet. We keep all these matters under review. I am concerned about the availability of cannabis seeds on the internet, as well as some of the paraphernalia that is available from shops and elsewhere. He makes a reasonable point, and we need to consider what we can do about it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o68"><a name="80403-0007.htm_para0"><a name="08040378000326">The new drug strategy provides the Government and their partners with an opportunity to build on some of the successes of the previous strategy and to achieve a substantial and sustained reduction in the harms caused by drug misuse. Drug misuse poses significant challenges. It damages health, undermines family life and gives rise to high levels of crime. The costs to society are enormous in financial terms and lost opportunities. Reducing the harm caused by drugs must therefore remain one of the Government&#146;s top priorities, and it is obviously a priority for this House.</p>

and discussing these issues, which are incredibly important to us and to our constituents. I thank him for agreeing to reconsider the question whether khat should be a banned substance. It causes extreme difficulties, particularly within the Somali community, some of whom have recently been in touch with me and are very grateful to him for his intervention on this matter.</p>

<p><a name="st_o195"><a name="08040378000328"><a name="80403-0007.htm_spnew6"><a name="08040378001124"><b>Mr. Coaker:</b>
 A lot of representations have been made to me, particularly from the Somali community and from Members of Parliament. Indeed, I have just written to Members about the issue. We are looking to see what evidence there is with respect to this matter. We have asked for it to be looked into, and we are developing how we deal with it. We shall examine what comes back to determine how we proceed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o69"><a name="80403-0007.htm_para1"><a name="08040378000329">The Government are committed to be responsive to the needs of communities and to the views of our stakeholders and partners. The drug strategy will be delivered in partnership, and it is for that reason that it was developed in partnership. It is informed by the findings of a detailed, extensive and independently conducted consultation. Following the consultation, as hon. Members will know, the new drug strategy was launched on 27 February, and we are now working with stakeholders to put in place mechanisms to deliver the strategy in the most effective manner.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o70"><a name="80403-0007.htm_para2"><a name="08040378000330">I am pleased to note that those same stakeholders, along with representatives of service users and members of the public, have generally welcomed the new strategy and provided very positive feedback. The new strategy builds on the very real achievements of the previous 10 years, while learning lessons, as my hon. Friend the Member for Newport, West (Paul Flynn) has pointed out, and it draws on the experience of all those involved in its delivery. A few of the achievements that we can point to include drug use being at its lowest level since 1998; the fact that the number of people entering drug treatment has more than doubled over the same period, with average waiting times having fallen significantly so that 96 per cent. of clients are receiving treatment within three weeks of being assessed; a fall in drug-related crime of around 20 per cent. since the introduction of the drug interventions programme in 2003; and the introduction of a range of new powers that have allowed the police and other partners to strengthen our enforcement effort, seizing more drugs and drug dealers&#146; assets and closing crack houses, which can be so destructive to the confidence of communities. I am pleased to say that since the introduction of those powers in 2003, more than 1,000 crack houses have been closed, and all of us would like to see even more of them being closed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o71"><a name="80403-0007.htm_para3"><a name="08040378000331">Those achievements have delivered real improvements to the lives and experiences of families and communities all over the country, but we know that more remains to be done, including closing crack houses that are still open. Although we can see where the drug strategy has been successful, we can also see where more work is needed, or where we need a change of approach. For example, while drug-related crime has been driven down, we recognise that further support needs to be given to help people rebuild their lives, so that they do not fall back into drug use and crime&#151;a point made by the hon.

proposed &#147;shooting galleries&#148;&#151;injecting rooms. Has the Minister had the chance to consider the right hon. Gentleman&#146;s idea, and does he intend to introduce such a proposal? If he does, please do not let it be in my constituency.</p>

 We have no intention to introduce so-called shooting galleries anywhere in the country, including my hon. Friend&#146;s constituency.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o72"><a name="80403-0007.htm_para4"><a name="08040378000334">The Government&#146;s vision is to produce a long-term and sustainable reduction in the harm associated with drugs, where fewer people start using drugs; where early intervention prevents and reduces the harms caused by substance misuse, particularly among those most at risk; where people with drug problems receive the treatment and support that they need to move on to lead healthy, productive lives; where communities are relieved of drug-related crime and the associated nuisance; and where organised trafficking networks are dismantled and their assets are recovered. That means that we want fewer young people and families to be harmed by drug misuse. We want to make sure that treatment is as effective as possible and that people get access to the support they need to re-establish their lives.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o73"><a name="80403-0007.htm_para5"><a name="08040378000335">We want to continue to drive down drug-related crime, and we want to put communities at the heart of our approach, working with them to tackle problems and communicating more effectively with them to improve confidence. We have set four targets that will help us to achieve that vision: to increase the number of drug users in effective treatment; to reduce drug-related offending; to reduce the number of people who think drug-related antisocial behaviour is a problem in their area; and to reduce substance misuse among young people. The new drug strategy and the associated action plan set out the action that the Government and our partners will take to reach those targets. Both documents are based around the four priorities of protecting communities, preventing harm to children, young people and families, adopting new approaches to drug treatment and social reintegration, and communications and community engagement.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o74"><a name="80403-0007.htm_para6"><a name="08040378000336">Before I say any more about those priorities and protecting communities, in the time I have left, I want to say something about cannabis. Our message has always been that cannabis is harmful and illegal. Although its use is decreasing, there is real public concern about the mental health effects, and it is our role to be prepared to respond to new evidence that shows a new threat or potential for increased levels of harm. We must be confident that we have the right position on classification, which is why the Home Secretary asked the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs to review its position. The ACMD is continuing its review and will submit it and its advice to the Home Secretary at the end of this month. A decision about the reclassification, or not, of cannabis will be taken at that time, when we have received that evidence from the ACMD.</p>
<a name="08040378000840">
<p>In conclusion, we believe that we made progress under the previous drug strategy. The new drug strategy will have an emphasis on enforcement, but it will also place emphasis on ensuring that treatment is more effective. We have to look at the outcomes that come from treatment, and much of that will relate to the support we give, not only to get people into treatment, but to ensure that such treatment is effective, allowing people to move towards drug-free lives as far as is  <br>

 Despite the Minister&#146;s fine words, the UK has the highest level of problem drug use in Europe. In 10 years, total recorded drugs offences have increased by 43 per cent., and, by the Government&#146;s own admission, class A drug use remains stubbornly high. The Government&#146;s latest strategy to &#147;protect families and communities&#148; has therefore been greeted with understandable scepticism and, in some quarters, derision. Class A drug use generates an estimated &#163;15.4 billion in crime and health costs every year. The drug and alcohol charity Addaction estimates that since this Government came to power the total cost amounts to &#163;110 billion, which is more than the NHS budget.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o75"><a name="80403-0007.htm_para7"><a name="08040378000338">It is a question of not only the monetary cost, but the human cost of drug addiction. In 2006, the number of confirmed hepatitis C infections reported from laboratories in England rose to 8,346&#151;a rise of 10 per cent. in a year, with the Health Protection Agency forecasting an increasing number of deaths, transplants and hospital admissions for hepatitis-related end-stage liver disease.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o76"><a name="80403-0007.htm_para8"><a name="08040378000339">The single biggest risk factor is injecting drug use. Illicit drugs are cheaper than they have ever been. Since 1997, the average price of cocaine has fallen by a third and the price of heroin has dropped by 40 per cent. Even the simplest economic and market analysis tells me that if the price has gone down that much, the Government have failed to control supply. That is reflected by declining enforcement. In 2005, 1,082 people were prosecuted for the unlawful importation or exportation of drugs and 1,061 were convicted. In 2006, the number had fallen to 904 prosecutions and 870 convictions.</p>

In reality, it is the existing border control badged under a different name. The effect is that it will not be able to arrest a single person caught with drugs. So much for the Prime Minister&#146;s promise that this force would have police powers to deal with those suspected of criminal offences.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o87"><a name="80403-0007.htm_para19"><a name="08040378000352">Fundamentally, the Government&#146;s approach is not about ridding people of addiction, but switching people from an illicit drug to a substitute prescribed drug. The necessity of abstinence, which is recognised as the key step on the road to recovery in other European countries, is notably absent from the approach. As the prisons and addictions forum of the Centre for Policy Studies says in its critique of the latest strategy:</p>
<a name="80403-0007.htm_brev4"><a name="08040378000853"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;The harm reduction techniques that are espoused to achieve this goal, when stripped bare, seem to rely almost entirely on replacing one substance with another as a way to manage and solve dependency without addressing the issues underlying it. Government policy in the treatment domain is revealed, like the emperor&#146;s new clothes, as not being treatment at all.&#148;</p>

 Thanks to the Centre for Social Justice, I spent four days at St. George&#146;s Crypt in Leeds, which deals with homelessness and addiction because the two usually go hand in hand. I commend that work to my hon. Friend.

 I am grateful to my hon. Friend for recommending that work. It is important to recognise the great work that so many charities, voluntary organisations and the third sector do in providing treatment and support.

The cost of methadone prescriptions has increased by &#163;6 million in only two years to &#163;22 million. Last October, the BBC revealed that, of 180,000-odd people signed up for treatment, 20,000 never had any, 80,000 did not complete their treatment and only 5,000&#151;less than 3 per cent.&#151;left the Government programme free of illegal drugs.</p>

 Methadone has its place in the treatment regime, for example, when sex workers move from addiction and genuine desperation. My point is that people should not be kept on methadone, but moved from that through abstinence-based treatment, so that they beat their addiction.</p>

Even if there were a hypothetical need for more rights, the complete failure of the Assets Recovery Agency, necessitating its merger with Serious Organised Crime Agency, underlines where the real focus and attention should lie.</p>

One was introduced in the House&#151;I recall the debate 10 years ago, when there was great optimism. The drugs tsar was to be appointed and things were going to change enormously. A reduction of 50 per cent. in drug use was proposed&#151;a ludicrously ambitious figure. We are also signed up another policy; indeed, the whole free world is signed up to the United Nations policy. It was decided in the same year, 1998, and its aim is the complete eradication of or a substantial reduction in all drug cultivation and use. Who could sign up to such a thing or believe that that was possible? That policy comes to fruition this year, but we have made virtually no progress on it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o97"><a name="80403-0008.htm_para3"><a name="08040378000367">What has happened since 1998? We have spent billions of pounds, with the agreement of every party in the House; there was only dissenting voice to the policy in 1998. The result is figures&#151;I will give just one, as I do not want to spend my whole 10 minutes talking about the figures&#151;that show a reduction in the number of deaths caused by heroin. There has not been a reduction; what has happened is that the base year was changed. A reduction of 2 per cent. is being claimed on the basis of setting the base year as 1999, but if we use 1998, the proper base year, we see that there has been an increase in deaths of 10 per cent.</p>

problems, which the right hon. Member for Witney (Mr. Cameron) well understands. We need to get to the heart of them, and that is happening elsewhere.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o98"><a name="80403-0008.htm_para4"><a name="08040378000370">There are two, or possibly three, optimistic signs. One is at the United Nations, which has recognised that world opinion is changing. There was a time when this country had very few drug users&#151;fewer than 1,000 addicts. We became tough and had a zero-tolerance policy, doing all the things that the Opposition spokesman in this debate wants to do, but sadly we did not become intelligent about drugs. We had that policy in 1971. The result is that we now do not have 1,000 addicts; we have 280,000 addicts. We have a problem that is permanent and a great scourge among our young people.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o99"><a name="80403-0008.htm_para5"><a name="08040378000371">We did not show an example to the people in eastern Europe, who effectively said, &#147;When the iron curtain fell and drugs came into our countries, we looked to you guys in the west to tell us how to deal with them.&#148; What they heard was a babel of conflicting voices and advice. The result is 5 million addicts in the Russian Federation. I had the experience of visiting a hospital in Moscow&#151;I can feel the emotion churning up as I think of it&#151;that was filled with thousands of patients, every one of whom was a child of a drug user or sex worker born with AIDS. Those things have happened because of our failure to tackle poverty and because of the self-gratification of the politicians. We want popular policies that give us good headlines in the daily papers, which do not tell us that we will go to pot if we are found in possession of an intelligent idea or something that works.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o100"><a name="80403-0008.htm_para6"><a name="08040378000372">There is a new European convention, which was presented by a British rapporteur in the Council of the Europe in September and is supported by all parties in the House in the Council and by all 47 countries there. The convention is similar to another document called &#147;The Rome Consensus&#148;, which enjoys the support of more than 120 nations and the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies. Those two documents&#151;&#147;The Rome Consensus&#148; and the new European convention, which is yet to go to the Council of Ministers&#151;say a great deal, but the basic argument is that our reliance on the criminal justice system for solving the problem of drugs has not worked. Substitution has worked. Every &#163;1 that we spend on substitution, treatment, needle exchanges and so on is worth &#163;12 that we spend on the criminal justice system.</p>

I had the awful experience of visiting the family of two young people my constituency who would be classified as two of the great successes of our system, because they went into prison as heroin users and came out clean. The system was working&#151;what a triumph; how wonderful. Indeed, I am sure that those young people are named somewhere in the figures. The young man who came out lived a day; the woman who came out lived a week. They went back to their drugs because they did not have the chance of being looked after. That is an abject failure.</p>

point where we recognise that, despite all our self-satisfaction as politicians&#151;our desire to get good headlines to get ourselves re-elected&#151;we are failing a generation whose lives are being destroyed by drugs. That is the lesson of today.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o103"><a name="80403-0008.htm_para9"><a name="08040378000375">I believe that there will be a change. The atmosphere is changing in the United Nations, which determines everything. The United Nations went along with the myth that we can control drugs at the supply&#151;we tried that in Colombia for nearly 30 years and in Afghanistan, but it has been an utter, abject failure. After &#163;250 million of taxpayers&#146; money being spent on drug eradication in Helmand province, the result is that the drug crops there are the highest in history and the price of heroin on the streets of London is the cheapest that it has ever been. That is failure from both angles.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o104"><a name="80403-0008.htm_para10"><a name="08040378000376">Let us stop congratulating ourselves on what clever politicians we are, on what great successes we have enjoyed or on the press supporting us, including on the completely foolish idea of reclassifying cannabis, especially when all the evidence is that reclassifying it probably made very little difference, because fashion and many other things were involved. Indeed, the use of cannabis went down, and everyone admits that. There is another demand to reclassify it upwards, but the whole of drug-taking policy, in my 20 years in Parliament, has been an evidence-free zone that is rich in prejudice, ignorance and denial.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o105"><a name="80403-0008.htm_para11"><a name="08040378000377">We are all drug users in many ways. We should look to a policy that puts the emphasis on education, the truth and the things that work. They include drug substitution, which has been mentioned, not some idiotic idea about zero tolerance, which does not work, or the other foolish idea, about khat. Khat is a drug with its own dangers, but if we decide to prohibit it, we will immediately drive a wedge between the Somali and Yemeni communities and the police, and drive the trade underground. Khat is currently legal, but if it became illegal, Somali areas would be divided up into territories that were guarded with guns. If we want to create another minor crime wave, we should prohibit khat, because people will keep using it&#151;they have used it for centuries as part of their tradition.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o106"><a name="80403-0008.htm_para12"><a name="08040378000378">Prohibiting khat is another instant solution that appeals to politicians. I urge the House to consider the position in the real world. We have a terrible record as politicians, but when I saw the parents of the young man who died in my constituency, did I blame myself for what I had done? I know that if the policies that I and others advocated in this place 20 years ago had been put into practice and come to fruition, those young people would probably still be alive today.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o107"><a name="80403-0008.htm_para13"><a name="08040378000379">We have taken a path that is not based on the truth or on the practical ways of dealing with the problem. One of the best examples from other countries is from Portugal, which has already been mentioned. In 2001, the Government in Portugal decided to de-penalise all drugs. It was not a popular policy&#151;the Government there were howled at by the press and the public thought that the politicians had gone mad&#151;but the result was a reduction in the total number of deaths from drugs in Portugal of 50 per cent. in five years. That is the most spectacular result of any drugs policy anywhere in the world. Other countries have adopted bold policies&#151;the shooting-up galleries, for instance&#151;that have been unpopular with lots of people, but that is not the path  <br>

None of them has been achieved. We have had 10 years of utter, abject failure from all angles&#151;from the waste of money involved to the fact that not a single prison in this country is free of drug use. One Conservative Member told me that he went into a prison and was told by a prisoner, &#147;I&#146;ve got a toothache that I&#146;d like to get an aspirin for, but I have to wait until tomorrow morning to see a doctor, yet I can go from my cell and get every illegal drug you&#146;d care to mention within a quarter of an hour.&#148; That is the reality of life in prison. </p>

 I welcome this topical debate. The reason for its topicality was the drugs strategy, but there has also recently been a leak from the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs, the panel of 23 experts who are apparently going to recommend that there should be no reclassification of cannabis. That leak reminds us that we need to ensure that our decisions are based on evidence and science if we are serious about tackling the scourge of drugs, as the hon. Member for Newport, West (Paul Flynn) suggested.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o110"><a name="80403-0008.htm_para16"><a name="08040378000383">The leak also prompts a number of questions, which I hope the Minister will be able to answer. If the leak is accurate, is he in a position to confirm whether he will follow the advice of the advisory council? Will he confirm that, if the Government chose not to follow that advice, it would be the first time that that had happened? Will he also tell us whether he has considered putting the advisory council on a more formal footing, to allow more expertise to be brought in and perhaps to give it a wider remit? Such a change could create the equivalent of a standing royal commission to look at the issue of drugs, to ensure that we were using science and evidence-based facts to devise the most effective policy for tackling the problem.</p>

 Would the hon.

However, the advisory council chose to ignore that evidence. It would be unsurprising if the council chose to stand by its earlier decision, but should we not be cautious about accepting its recommendation, given its record on this matter?</p>

 The hon.

<p><a name="stpa_o111"><a name="80403-0008.htm_para17"><a name="08040378000386">We need to focus on all the links in the drugs chain, from production through to supply, if we are to tackle this issue. I am sure that the Minister would agree that one aspect of the problem is the glamour that is often associated with drugs. This was highlighted in the recent annual report from the International Narcotics Control Board, which stated that treating stars leniently undermined people&#146;s faith in the criminal justice system and had a damaging effect on adolescents. Celebrities who are users might well be able to use their wealth to buy their way out of their habit through rehabilitation, but others might not be in that fortunate position. The Minister will undoubtedly agree that those so-called stars should be treated in exactly the same way as anyone else who is caught in possession of drugs.</p>

The Government are going to have to demonstrate how they are going to achieve those aims. I had a useful meeting a few days ago with a member of the Metropolitan Police Authority, in which she referred to a family in which the mother lived off the proceeds of crime, the daughter was dealing and the son was in prison for having dealt drugs. There were also two children of primary school age in that family. It is exactly that type of scenario that the Government&#146;s drugs strategy needs to address. How can we help all the different members of that family to get out of the situation that they are in? In particular, how can we ensure that those young children do not inevitably follow the line of business that the elders in that family have regrettably taken?</p>

 I can confirm that that is our policy. I am sure that, if the advisory council were to come up with a recommendation that cannabis should be reclassified, we would want to look at that policy area very carefully. However, the leak suggests that that is not what it is going to recommend. As the hon. Member for Newport, West said earlier, the evidence shows that cannabis use went down as a result of the reclassification, rather than up.</p>

 I can only say that our policy will be strongly influenced by the advisory council. I cannot prejudge what recommendations it might come up with in the next five years that might conflict with existing party policy. We shall have to cross that bridge when we get to it, but our policy is that we would like to establish a standing royal commission so that these issues can be addressed in a scientific and, perhaps, independent way. I think that most Members would admit that that is extremely difficult to achieve at the moment, because of the pressures that we face from outside. That sometimes makes it difficult for science to dictate the decisions that we make here.</p>

Our drugs policies are barely keeping a lid on this devastating plague. As other Members have pointed out, this country has one of the most punitive approaches to drugs, while also having among the highest levels of use. We need to combine placing a greater emphasis on tackling drug use as a public health issue with taking a much more focused approach to the dealers and organised criminals who peddle these drugs, destroying lives and fuelling criminal activity. If that is what the Government&#146;s drugs strategy delivers, we will support it.</p>

I prefer to wage a war on the causes of drug misuse, which, as far as I am concerned, are social exclusion and poverty. I know which party put people into poverty.

There is more talk about helping families, rather than about individuals who are addicted. An addict causes havoc in the entire family, not just the immediate family. There is also more talk about early intervention. As we know, in the case of all drugs, including alcohol and tobacco, the problem tends to start when a person is nine, 10, 11 or 12.

<p><a name="stpa_o120"><a name="80403-0009.htm_para1"><a name="08040378000400">On 7 March this year the United Nations Commission on Narcotic Drugs published a very interesting document, which I commend to Members. It is called &#147;Making drug control &#145;fit for purpose&#146;: Building on the UNGASS decade&#148;, and was provided for a conference in Vienna between 10 and 14 March. It looks back over the 100 years during which we have tried to control the misuse of substances throughout the world. I shall return to the report shortly, but the main point that I want to make is that any war on drugs, any zero-tolerance approach or any hard action of that kind merely displaces the problem. There are a number of instances in which we have caused ourselves serious problems.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o121"><a name="80403-0009.htm_para2"><a name="08040378000401">The Moroccans have been waging a war on the farmers who have been growing cannabis in their country. Seventy per cent. of the cannabis sold in Britain used to come from that source. It is noteworthy that Moroccan cannabis contained only 5 per cent. of the psychoactive ingredient tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC. It was smuggled across the straits of Gibraltar to the Costa del Sol. The Spanish were waging a war on drugs all along the coast, and as a result the import of cannabis from Morocco to Europe, including Britain, almost ceased. That created a vacuum in this country, which has now been filled by Thai and Vietnamese criminals who have started to farm cannabis in rented houses all over Britain. In Bolton alone, the police have invaded 30 houses in three months. People have been caught farming cannabis from the cellar to the attic.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o122"><a name="80403-0009.htm_para3"><a name="08040378000402">Seventy per cent. of the cannabis that is now sold on the streets of Britain is home-grown rather than imported. By stopping the Moroccan trade in cannabis with a 5 per cent. THC content, we have put on to the streets, through our own war on drugs, cannabis with a 15 per cent. THC content, which is causing our young people immense problems. Of course if children of nine or 10 start smoking cannabis of that sort they will blow their minds, and probably even damage their minds.</p>

structure of that country. So, of course, there was a war on the use of opium in China. What did we do? We displaced it to the golden triangle. Then we had a war on the use of opium in the golden triangle, and what happened next? It was displaced to Afghanistan. Ninety per cent. of the heroin that comes into this country now comes from Afghanistan. Every time we take action, we displace the problem.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o124"><a name="80403-0009.htm_para5"><a name="08040378000406">Another example is cocaine production in the Andean countries. Everyone knows that Colombia is, or was, the main source of supply. The Americans sprayed the crops. They gave the Colombian Government arms with which to tackle the rebels who were using the profits of cocaine manufacture to try to take over the Government. What happened there? We displaced production of the coca bush to Bolivia and Peru. The message that I am trying to get across is that the war on drugs does not work.</p>

There were terrible problems with the selling of cocaine to European countries, including Britain. What did we do? We sent the Royal Navy into the Caribbean, and we have had huge successes there, but that has not ended the problem. Although cocaine is still coming into Britain via Jamaica, it is arriving in smaller quantities. Most of it is now going to west Africa, and some west African countries are now experiencing the corruption and deaths that Jamaica has experienced for decades.</p>

They do not want to go to prison, and they do not want criminal records. But there are plenty of drugs available on the internet, and there are plenty of drugs in the doctor&#146;s parlour&#151;he will provide a prescription for them&#151;and those are the drugs to which people are turning now.</p>

I say &#147;By all means adopt a zero-tolerance approach, but you will not stop people seeking relief from the turmoil that their minds are causing them.&#148; For that is the reason why people turn to drug misuse: it is triggered by something that has gone wrong in their lives, perhaps the death of a close relative or a friend. We ought to intervene and help those people instead of locking them up.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o132"><a name="80403-0009.htm_para13"><a name="08040378000414">The UN says that drug misuse is a &#147;disease of development&#148;. What it means by that is that we in the more developed countries are more subject to stress; we are always increasing our performance and productivity, which increases our stress levels, and we sometimes need to escape from reality in order to get some relief. That is why people turn to misusing not only controlled drugs, but increasingly prescription and over-the-counter drugs.</p>

Methamphetamine was not a classified drug at one time, but it came on to the scene and we recently bunged it into class A. As a medicinal chemist, I know that every time we classify a drug into categories A, B or C, there will be another drug that is not yet illegal waiting in the queue for some person&#151;or, rather, thousands of people&#151;to misuse. All of this will never stop.</p>

This debate about whether cannabis should have been kept in class B, as previously, or should remain in class C, where we have now dropped it, or be put back into class B again is yo-yo politics, and it will have absolutely no effect at all on young people. They want to know which drugs give them a buzz, regardless of whether they are illegal. They want to know how much those drugs cost, too, and as the street prices of drugs are falling, more and more people will, of course, be tempted to try them. It is not the classification of drugs that matters; it is economic factors such as price that switch people on to drugs once they have had a problem in their lives.</p>

A satirical programme managed to gain admittance to this House and interviewed me about a drug called &#147;cake&#148;. Lord Newton of Braintree had the Minister&#146;s job at the time. His officials answered the questions we tabled on &#147;cake&#148;; we as Members of Parliament did not know whether &#147;cake&#148; was a slang term. I am hardly a superstar, but even nowadays sometimes when I walk along a street a very young person will run up to me who has seen that bit of television footage&#151;it is shown over and again. What I usually say to them is, &#147;Okay, you thought it was funny, but did it actually put you off taking drugs?&#148; Obviously, the parents of Leah Betts were not particularly pleased at the trivialisation of the matter.</p>

 One of the pressing arguments that persuaded the then Home Secretary to change the classification was evidence from parents of young people who had died of heroin poisoning. They said that their young people had gone through the following journey. They had been told that cannabis is a terribly dangerous drug, but then when they used it they found that they did not have great problems with it. Therefore, they disbelieved the fables they had been told, so they then disbelieved what they thought were fables about heroin.

There may be a vagueness in being united about the fact that we will do something about it, but what politician would say publicly or privately, or would even think to themselves, &#147;Well, we&#146;ll do nothing about the issue of drugs, and pretend it isn&#146;t there.&#148;</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o144"><a name="80403-0009.htm_para25"><a name="08040378000432">One of the problems with drugs debates in this House&#151;this weakness has hidden some of the successes of the Government&#146;s drugs policy&#151;is the use and misuse of statistics. The key weakness in the Government&#146;s drugs strategy is not the strategy itself, but the assessment of outcomes and the precise measurements. Let us consider the example of cannabis. Everybody knows, and the research on this will soon come through to show&#151;it is only just emerging&#151;that there has been a huge fall in cannabis use. The cause is pretty obvious to me: it is called the smoking ban. That makes me particularly pleased that I voted for the smoking ban.</p>

 With respect, I do not think there is time to take interventions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o145"><a name="80403-0009.htm_para26"><a name="08040378000435">People are smoking far less, so people are smoking cannabis far less. I have seen no evidence of any diversion towards people baking cannabis cakes or anything like that. Cannabis use is decreasing. That does not mean that where someone does use cannabis, it is more or less of a problem than it was before.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o146"><a name="80403-0009.htm_para27"><a name="08040378000436">The information is there. I am sure that all hon. Members have read my 2002 report to the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association, in which I described in great detail hydroponics and cannabis, the experience of the Vietnamese ex-pat community in Australia, in Melbourne in particular, and what would happen here when those techniques were used. In essence, people would grow for profit in their houses, using the latest techniques, on an industrial scale. That happened in Australia, because a market existed, and it has happened in the UK. Wherever the new markets in drugs emerge&#151;the most difficult markets will be in chemical concoctions of one kind or another that are created not abroad but here in the UK&#151;the drugs involved will be the new wave that will come into this country. The drugs I am talking about are already here, but their use will grow. We can see all this from the evidence of what has happened elsewhere.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o147"><a name="80403-0009.htm_para28"><a name="08040378000437">However, monitoring outcomes would give the Government some good news. They would be able to declare, as they will at some stage, that cannabis use has declined. More importantly, analysis of school exclusions in respect of drugs and alcohol demonstrates absolutely that drugs and alcohol are not a major problem in schools. There is no evidence of such a problem; minor numbers are being disciplined. If my schoolkids are asked, they say, &#147;A few teachers come in the worse for wear for alcohol, but do you think we would be stupid enough to buy or use drink or drugs in school? We know where to get it outside if we want it.&#148;</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o148"><a name="80403-0009.htm_para29"><a name="08040378000438">Let us examine one of the great myths, because the Government have the statistics to quantify things. My hon. Friend the Member for Newport, West (Paul Flynn) is wrong about overdose deaths. On the basis of the classifications used by coroners&#146; courts, the number of deaths from heroin overdose in this country is falling. Nowhere is that more the case than in my constituency, where the fall has been huge. In 2002, 11 of my constituents died because of heroin, but only two have done so in the past four years. The matter is quantifiably provable.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o149"><a name="80403-0009.htm_para30"><a name="08040378000439">As for accident and emergency admissions, I recommend that every hon. Member ask their local hospital whether the drugs strategy is working in their area and monitor the situation. The figures on accident and emergency admissions for an overdose of injectable drugs give a clear trend line. In my area, a fourfold reduction has taken place, which means that the drugs strategy, particularly with regard to heroin, is working there. Strangely, the biggest reduction in Britain in the number of house burglaries has occurred in my area&#151;and I suggest that there is a correlation. In monitoring those outcomes, the Government should be pulling those correlations together. I do not care who takes the credit&#151;the police, the Government, the health service or charities. Everyone can have some credit.</p>

down Bridge street in Worksop five years ago, they would not have got five yards without being accosted by a young person on heroin. Now, although there are one or two problems with the Tory council, lots of cars are being parked illegally, the Tory leader drove illegally the wrong way when he made his fleeting visit, and the police are failing to tackle cyclists, someone walking down Bridge street would struggle to find a drug addict. That is what is happening in the real world, so quantifiable proof exists: I recommend cost-benefit analysis.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o151"><a name="80403-0010.htm_para1"><a name="08040378000441">The other thing that I strongly recommend to the Government&#151;this concurs with what my hon. Friend the Member for Bolton, South-East (Dr. Iddon) said&#151;is to examine causation. My analysis of my constituents who have been on heroin is that the vast majority have now come off it since my heroin inquiry in 2002. By far and away the key factor in young people getting involved with drugs is major trauma. That can be identified in different ways. For example, it might be a major change in economic circumstances, but it is more likely to be the death of a parent, often a father&#151;my amateur research base tells me that&#151;or a messy divorce, a split in the family situation, abuse or attacks. Those are by far and away the factors that lead young people into drug addiction. Such things can be identified. It is now far more acceptable to talk about things such as child abuse within a family in society and societal organisations than it was 20 or 30 years ago. Such things can be addressed, but we do not pull the two issues together. That is where the improvement to the Government&#146;s strategy can be tweaked in a big way. We can use the data on outcomes, but we must put them together more cleverly. We must examine the question of causation, and in particular, the role of major trauma among children and young people in leading to addiction.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o152"><a name="80403-0010.htm_para2"><a name="08040378000442">We know what the Government&#146;s drugs strategy is, and we know that not all Labour Members have agreed with it. I generally do agree with it, because it generally works. We know what the Conservative policy is, because it has been outlined recently: before, everyone would have been put into residential rehabilitation, but now they will be put into secure residential rehabilitation. The proposal has not yet been costed, although my costings of it show that it would be quite expensive, and the definition of &#147;secure&#148; has been left a little vague. Unfortunately, the hon. Member for Hornchurch (James Brokenshire) did not outline it further. I am sure that he and his colleagues will take the opportunity to explain about the 280,000 secure residential places&#151;or however many the number is; a figure has not yet emerged. The Conservatives&#146; recovery policy has also been clearly outlined, even though their leader repeatedly and consistently took totally the opposite approach&#151;his was more in line with that of my hon. Friend the Member for Newport, West; it could have been the same speech. The Tory leader is out of synch, but I am sure that he is accommodating himself to the current policy and learning it. There will be some interesting tensions there.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o153"><a name="80403-0010.htm_para3"><a name="08040378000443">We know, from a speech made by Fergus Ewing today, that the Scottish National party has stolen lock, stock and barrel the Tory party policy of recovery and abstinence. We know that Mr. Souter, who has helped the SNP in various ways, has inspired its new policy in his recent meetings with the party. At last the SNP has a policy! It is identical to the Conservative party&#146;s policy, which will make for some interesting debates.</p>

 In the few minutes remaining, I am pleased to contribute to the debate. One of the first things I did when I was elected to this place, as a member of the Select Committee on Home Affairs, was take part in an investigation of drugs policy entitled &#147;The Government&#146;s drugs policy: is it working?&#148; I do not often agree with the hon. Member for Newport, West (Paul Flynn), but I agree that the policy was not, and still is not, working. I do not think that any of us would underestimate the enormity of the problem, or the task of dealing with it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o155"><a name="80403-0010.htm_para5"><a name="08040378000448">Everybody here has the good will to acknowledge that there is a problem, and to try to do something about it. Of course, opinions on how to deal with it are varied. During its investigation, the Committee took evidence from across the opinion spectrum. We took evidence from the legalisation lobby&#151;from people who would make all drugs freely available and supplied by the Government. At the other end of the spectrum, we heard some heartbreaking stories from parents who had lost children to a drug habit. My view, then and now, is that there is an imbalance in drugs policy. It focuses too heavily on harm reduction and the provision of rehabilitation, important though that is, and not enough on drug prevention. The hon. Member for Bolton, South-East (Dr. Iddon) said how important it is to warn very young children about the dangers of drugs. The age at which that needs to be tackled is, sadly, getting younger and younger.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o156"><a name="80403-0010.htm_para6"><a name="08040378000449">I was unable to agree with the outcome of the investigation, and I was the only person on a cross-party Committee to do so. I tabled about 80 amendments, all of which were blown out of the water. I thought that I was right then, and I still think so now.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o157"><a name="80403-0010.htm_para7"><a name="08040378000450">Today&#146;s announcement&#151;or leak&#151;from the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs was disappointing to me.

taking such drugs is not only legal but harmless, and a purely social occupation from which no harm will come&#151;is very important. We all know, not least from the evidence heard by the Committee and that which we have seen since, that mental health professionals are extremely worried about the increase in psychotic illnesses, depression and so on that arise from cannabis use. If it transpires that the council advises that cannabis should not be reclassified, I hope that the Home Secretary will think long and hard about the evidence that comes from other quarters before she makes her decision.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o158"><a name="80403-0010.htm_para8"><a name="08040378000451">The hon. Member for Newport, West thought that reclassification was of no importance. I fundamentally disagree with him. The message given to young people is very important. No young person should be in any doubt about the dangers that can flow from the use of illegal drugs. We have to start with cannabis, which is probably the most easily available. Most drug dealers now are poly-drug dealers. If young people buy cannabis, the range of harder, more harmful drugs is readily available to them. The temptation to try other drugs, which can lead to serious habits from which there is often no return, is an important message that would come from any reclassification.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o159"><a name="80403-0010.htm_para9"><a name="08040378000452">Several hon. Members have referred to the availability of drugs in prisons. The challenge of ridding prisons of drugs is enormous, but we have to take every action we can to help people with drug habits who have been given custodial sentences because of acquisitive crime, because they will not get rid of their habits if drugs are easily available in prison. People who are given custodial sentences for other reasons, and do not have a drug habit, often acquire a habit while they are in prison, and add to the body of people who require rehabilitation treatment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o160"><a name="80403-0010.htm_para10"><a name="08040378000453">I want to make some brief comments on the Government website Frank. I looked at it yesterday and today and it provides a helpful A to Z of drugs, including yaba, zero and isobutyl nitrate. I learned more about drugs from looking at Frank than I would ever have found out in any other way. It has videos about parties where drugs are being taken, jokey commentaries, and comic cartoons about replacement brains. I do not think that that website will deter a single young person from taking illegal drugs. It does not present the subject in anything near a serious enough way. I am dismayed to notice that I have run out of time. I had so much to say&#151;<i> [</i><i> Interruption.</i><i> ]</i> The Minister tells me I can have a little longer; that is very kind.</p>

We need to give young people serious warnings about what they are doing to their future, their education, their employment prospects and their families, friends, colleagues and neighbours. People do not take drugs in isolation. They affect all the other people around them. Nowhere on the site could I see a simple message such as, &#147;Don&#146;t do it. It&#146;s illegal and it will harm you.&#148; We need to get down to plain simple language rather than wrapping it up in jokey cartoony videos that do not do what the site is intended to do.</p>

of him. The debate shows some of the difficulty in reaching a drug strategy that commands general support. With drugs charities, drug misusers, others Members of Parliament, parliamentary groups and all sorts of individuals, I have tried to build consensus around the new drugs strategy. We have tried to get away from the false debate about whether we should crack down hard on dealers and those who bring misery to our communities&#151;whether we are therefore tough on drugs&#151;or whether we should support families, provide better treatment and ensure that the outcomes of treatment are more effective, to avoid the sorts of horror that have been described, which is what my hon.

The new strategy was not met with derision, because we had tried to reach that consensus. That does not mean that every person in the country and every group would support it wholeheartedly. One or two would deride it, because they want drugs to be legalised or completely decriminalised. The Government attempted to ensure that we had a radical policy that moved forward, and moved away from the false choice between tough enforcement and just treatment. We tried to bring those together. Our approach was not met with derision, with due respect to the hon.

made in the few minutes I have left, but it is essential that we enforce the law against those who deal in misery in our communities by dealing drugs. Every person in this House will accept that. The asset recovery panels are significantly different, because they allow us to take action on arrest rather than on conviction. They will enable us to take the action that people want against those in our communities who deal in drugs.</p>

Member for Hornchurch and others read page 28 of the drug strategy, they will see that it mentions abstinence, and states that we need a menu of options, and that a person&#146;s needs will be a matter for a clinical decision, made by a doctor, as to what is appropriate for them. For some people that will be methadone&#151;and I agree that we should not just abandon people on methadone. For others it will be residential treatment, but it is a clinical decision based on the person&#146;s individual needs that will make the treatment effective, not some grand statement that everybody should go into abstinence straight away or that everybody should be on methadone. It is about ensuring that there is appropriate treatment for the individual.</p>

Yesterday, I met Caroline Ellis of the Royal National Institute of Blind People to discuss how we can ensure that digital television is fully accessible to people with sight problems and to examine some of the latest technology. Television plays a pivotal role in the lives of people with sight problems. Some 73 per cent.&#151;nearly three in four&#151;spend five hours or more a week watching television. It is a major source of information, news and entertainment, and 86 per cent. of people with sight problems would watch more television if more programmes were accessible.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o170"><a name="80403-0010.htm_para20"><a name="08040378000467">With that in mind, the RNIB is encouraging more of the 2 million blind and partially sighted people in the UK, including about 3,000 in my constituency, to watch TV by switching on a free existing service called audio description. Many of the nation&#146;s favourite TV moments have never been fully enjoyed by blind and partially sighted people. Relying on the soundtrack means that they cannot follow what is going on.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o171"><a name="80403-0010.htm_para21"><a name="08040378000468">I was shown a clip of a programme yesterday&#151;it was &#147;Doctor Who&#148;, which is one of my favourites and has a new series starting on Saturday. If I closed my eyes or looked away from the screen, I could not tell what was going on. One advantage of audio description is that in addition to the speech in the programme, there is commentary that fits in between the dialogue and describes the body language, expressions and movements of people on the screen. It makes the story clear through sound and is a fantastic innovation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o172"><a name="80403-0010.htm_para22"><a name="08040378000469">As well as giving people with sight problems access to the nation&#146;s favourite entertainment and drama programmes, audio description stops people feeling isolated and excluded, because they can discuss programmes with family and friends who are watching at the same time. At the moment, about 13 per cent. of programmes on digital TV have audio description, which is not nearly enough. Many of those programmes are repeats on channels  <br>

such as The History Channel. It is still worth while tuning in, but we need to ensure that more programmes have audio description.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o173"><a name="80403-0010.htm_para23"><a name="08040378000470">The service can be accessed on Sky, Virgin Media and some freeview boxes and integrated digital TVs. People can call an audio description hotline to get help, and I believe that the service brings a clear benefit to those with sight problems. The downside, as those with digital TVs will know, is that one has to navigate one&#146;s way through visual menus on the screen to select programmes to watch, which is difficult and frustrating for people who are blind or partially sighted. Audio description may be available on a programme, but they cannot access it because the digital menu is visual in nature. We need to take action on that so that people who are blind or partially sighted can navigate around the screen and secure access to the new services. We cannot have a large proportion of our population, including, as I have said, about 3,000 people in Telford alone, excluded from the service, given that in future digital television will be the only option.</p>

I know that there will be a help scheme to ensure that households that have a disabled person or an elderly person over 75 in them, including those registered blind or partially sighted, can convert to digital TV on one set. Eligible people who are partially sighted or blind could do with securing a quality set-top box with audio description and easy-to-use remote controls, so that the TV guide on the screen tells them what programmes they are selecting and what is coming on next.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o175"><a name="80403-0010.htm_para25"><a name="08040378000472">The Government have not yet committed to ensuring that providers put audio description support into set-top boxes. It is important that they do so soon, so that all digital services have a talking menu, and a talking recording menu if there is a hard drive on the box. It would be good if the Government could commit to that initiative, which I am sure will secure cross-party support. It is important to thousands of people in constituencies across the country, and I would like to see it delivered as soon as possible.</p>

This week, we had the long awaited announcement about post office closures in Telford. I think that it is fair to say that the impact on the constituency was not as great as many had predicted. It had been suggested that at least four post offices would close in Telford, but in fact just one, at Randlay, has been named for possible closure. Ten others will remain intact. The main problem with Randlay post office is that it is very close to Telford town centre and a short bus ride from a Crown post office less than a mile away. I have spoken to the postmaster at Randlay, visited the post office there and written to every resident in the community. Throughout the six-week consultation period, I will help local people to make the case for the post office to stay open.</p>

schools, hospitals or local policing. Additionally, our shopping habits are changing and we are increasingly using the internet, the telephone and other outlets to purchase services and things we used to buy at the post office. New technology and the increasing preference for direct payments and online services have, and will continue to have, a significant effect on how post offices provide services to their customers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o178"><a name="80403-0011.htm_para1"><a name="08040378000475">We should not forget that locally, we have had some real successes in relation to post offices in recent years. I particularly want to thank the Co-op for its work to ensure that many post offices in Telford stay open. Three post offices have moved into Co-op stores: that has been extremely successful, and I am sure that similar moves have been successful elsewhere across the country. In Oakengates, Trench and Dawley the post office service is provided in the Co-op, where the environment is much better than that in the old offices. Post office services will remain at those three sites, and we will also be keeping services at Horsehay, Ironbridge, Brookside, Madely, Sutton Hill, Overdale and Telford town centre.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o179"><a name="80403-0011.htm_para2"><a name="08040378000476">Some people have suggested that I voted in this House for the closure of post offices. That is absolute nonsense, and a display of the worst kind of political opportunism. The Opposition motion that we debated that day would merely have postponed the consultation exercise while options such as having local councils taking over post office services were examined.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o180"><a name="80403-0011.htm_para3"><a name="08040378000477">In that debate, the Opposition made it clear that they would provide no new resources for post offices, and they were not even able to commit to maintaining the existing Government subsidy over the next decade. Also, I have seen no evidence that the Conservative-run Telford and Wrekin council will step in to save post office branches in Telford. If it were going to do so, it should give us the details of the plans and the precise amount of the council tax increase that would have to be imposed.</p>

inscribed in the UNESCO world heritage site list in 1986. The inscription relates the area&#146;s role in the birth of the industrial revolution, and even people who have not visited will know the iconic image of the iron bridge over the River Severn.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o184"><a name="80403-0011.htm_para7"><a name="08040378000483">The world heritage site is also a living community, with a resident population of about 4,000. They run businesses and live in the area, and there are also various museums along the gorge. The gorge itself attracts about 750,000 visitors a year, and about 300,000 pay to visit one or more of the 10 museum sites. The iron bridge was completed in 1779. As a symbol of the industrial revolution, it is recognised around the world. It is owned by the local council, under the guardianship of English Heritage.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o185"><a name="80403-0011.htm_para8"><a name="08040378000484">The gorge is one of the UK&#146;s most important visitor attractions. Through various sources, the nation has spent tens of millions of pounds of public money over the years to make sure that it acts as a tourist magnet and an engine for the local economy. The gorge is therefore incredibly important, but it is under threat from land instability caused by a combination of natural geology, past mining activity and the fact that its hillsides have been loaded with tipped waste, buildings and infrastructure.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o186"><a name="80403-0011.htm_para9"><a name="08040378000485">That instability is exacerbated by the flooding on the River Severn that happens every two or three years. A flood barrier has been established for the Wharfage, but the floods still cause significant erosion along the gorge. Generally, the land movement is quite gradual, but the times when it has been great and fairly catastrophic have resulted in the partial blockage of the river and caused the destruction of buildings and property. There is always the possibility that a blockage of the river could cause major flooding and damage, both upstream and downstream. Moreover, life and property could be put at risk if the clearing of that blockage caused a rapid release of water.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o187"><a name="80403-0011.htm_para10"><a name="08040378000486">A lot of work has been done in the gorge, much of it in recent times. Studies into the scale and extent of the flooding problem have been carried out, and they have identified the areas at greatest risk. Ground investigations have been undertaken by the council and land movement is being carefully monitored. The local council and the Government have acted in a partnership to invest in stabilisation, at Jiggers bank in 2002 and at the Lloyds phase 1 in 2007.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o188"><a name="80403-0011.htm_para11"><a name="08040378000487">Residents are aware of the problem. An information pack has been made available so that they can report incidents of land instability or any problems that they might encounter on their property. There is also an emergency plan covering the worst-case scenarios of what might happen in the gorge, but there is a need for further investment to ensure that the environment is stabilised.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o189"><a name="80403-0011.htm_para12"><a name="08040378000488">The local council, in partnership with the Government, has undertaken a cost-benefit analysis, and it is estimated that we need to spend about &#163;86 million to ensure that the gorge is safe in the long term. If we delay, the cost may rise to more than &#163;100 million&#151;an enormous amount of money, and one that the local authority on its own clearly cannot come up with. I am therefore working with the local council to try and lobby Ministers to ensure that we get a fair share of resources so that the required works can be carried out.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o190"><a name="80403-0011.htm_para13"><a name="08040378000489">I shall set out a list of the works that need to be done. We need to complete the stabilisation of the Lloyds and Lloyds Head on opposite sides of the River Severn; we need to stabilise the hillside and rebuild the road between Jackfield tile museum and Maws craft centre; and we need to complete the ground investigations in central Ironbridge, reconstruct the riverside wall along the Wharfage, stabilise Lloyds Coppice and carry out work to stabilise the Lloyds phase 3.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o191"><a name="80403-0011.htm_para14"><a name="08040378000490">That is a significant amount of work. The key issue is that, when a national Government put a site forward for world heritage site status, they accept that the UNESCO charter requires them, as the state party, to ensure that the site is preserved for future generations. It is crucial that we invest in the Ironbridge gorge. It is a significant asset for the nation, and an iconic site that ranks alongside all the other incredible world heritage sites around the globe. I hope that Ministers will look closely at the partnership work being undertaken to secure the gorge&#146;s long-term future as a national asset.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o192"><a name="80403-0011.htm_para15"><a name="08040378000491">Finally, I want to say something about the importance of manufacturing for the west midlands. I am delighted that Advantage West Midlands has published its manufacturing support strategy for the next three years. It is an excellent document and it outlines how important manufacturing is for the area. Manufacturing is the largest wealth generator of the west midlands sector, accounting for about 27 per cent. of the regional gross value added&#151;23 per cent. directly and an estimated further 4 per cent. from its supply chains.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o193"><a name="80403-0011.htm_para16"><a name="08040378000492">During the early 1980s, when I left school&#151;some Opposition Members will find that comment somewhat surprising&#151;unemployment in Telford was running at just under 10 per cent. I am very proud to say that we have ensured that unemployment has come down over the past few years&#151;it is now running at about 3 per cent.&#151;but to give credit where it is due, one of the most important initiatives in Telford was undertaken by a partnership between a Conservative Government and a Labour council: the designation of the enterprise zone. That extremely important initiative secured cross-party support at the time, and it did a lot for Telford. We also secured the connection to the motorway network, with the opening of the M54.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o194"><a name="80403-0011.htm_para17"><a name="08040378000493">Those two decisions in the 1980s were very important for Telford, and they were taken in the long-term interests of the town. I should like to thank the politicians that were involved for making those decisions, because they ensured that, in the long term, we were able to grow the manufacturing sector in Telford and draw new companies into Telford. In fact, we were a focal point for Japanese investment for many years. Indeed, we still have a large number of Japanese companies, such as Ricoh and Maxell, in the town, providing thousands of jobs.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o195"><a name="80403-0011.htm_para18"><a name="08040378000494">We now need to continue to support the manufacturing sector in the region. Such manufacturing will be connected particularly to car manufacture and engineering, but increasingly, in Telford, we are looking at high-tech jobs and innovation. That is why I very much welcome the commitment in the recently published document to the technology corridor between Wolverhampton and Telford. It is crucial that we ensure that we have jobs growth along that M54 corridor and that organisations, such as the university of Wolverhampton, are party to supporting  <br>

Some clarion voices locally in Telford have suggested that we should not get involved in the city region. In my view, that would be a complete disaster. In the longer term, resources to support manufacturing, the skills sector and training will be decided by organisations such as the city region.</p>

I very much welcome that, and I urge the council to continue to ignore some of the clarion voices and the doom merchants who suggest that we should withdraw from the city region. It is important that we invest in it and that our skills and manufacturing strategy develops on a regional basis. On that note, I will go off in search of Easter eggs.</p>

Unusually, this year, the nation is slightly confused by these things, because the good old western Christian Church, which fixes its Easter according to certain risings of the sun, I think, and the moon, has had its earliest Easter for about 80 or 90 years&#151;I gather that it will not be as early again for another 80 or 90 years. This year, Easter was on 23 March, and technically, it could only have been one day earlier than that. Obviously, it almost coincided with the first day of spring this year. I notice just in passing that, in 2011, it will be on 24 April, which must be pretty well the latest date that it can ever be, too.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o199"><a name="80403-0011.htm_para22"><a name="08040378000499">I have no objection about the fact that Easter moves around&#151;it adds a bit of variety and interest in an otherwise over-routine world&#151;but there is an issue that affects our conducting business well. My hon. Friend the Member for West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine (Sir Robert Smith), who helps me on House matters and directly shadows the Deputy Leader of the House, would have been here, except that he is not here, by permission, for a very good reason: his children are on their school holidays, and he and his wife have decided to take their children, who are in London today as opposed to Scotland, to see &#147;The Lord of the Rings&#148;. There is an issue for Members and children with regard to the coincidence of our sitting times with school holidays. That is not an easy issue to resolve. Clearly, there should be a break at Christmas, at or around Easter and in the summer, but when we plan our recesses, I would be grateful if the Deputy Leader of the House were to ask her officials to try to make our terms coincide with the bulk of school term times and holidays around the country.

When I asked my hon. Friend the Member for Brecon and Radnorshire (Mr. Williams) what the position was in Wales, he pointed out that there is a common view that the holidays run from 21 March to 7 April, but the summer holidays vary. Of course, some Scottish summer holidays start as early as the end of June and run until the middle of August. Obviously, this would need the consensus of the House, but I would be grateful if the Leader of the House were to get officials to draw up a matrix of school holiday plans&#151;they vary, but they can generally be foreshadowed&#151;to try to ensure that our term times match, as far as possible, school term times and holidays.</p>

They dovetailed our term times and recesses with the school holidays, by and large, for England and Wales. Usually, it has worked extremely well. There is a problem with Scotland. There always will be a problem with Scotland, because the term times and summer holidays there are completely out of sync with the rest of the UK.

 Neither was I being churlish, nor did I say or imply that nothing had been done. Indeed, I indicated that the Government have tried to deal with the issue, but the situation could be even better. For example, a week&#146;s difference now would have given more people a coincident school holiday and break here. It certainly needs to be addressed for colleagues from Scotland, for whom school holidays run throughout July as well as the bulk of August. Some of us have argued at length over many years that we should not have a three-month summer holiday. It is nonsense that we should break for so long. If we had a shorter summer holiday, one of the problems could be more easily addressed.</p>

 Of course, I am not pretending that the issue does not affect other people. If we in this country are moving towards having five weeks&#146; annual holiday, one would hope that that holiday could always be taken. Normally, families can, by and large, choose when they take their holidays, although teachers cannot. There are other people, too, whose holidays are inflicted on them, as it were, and who must take their holiday at times entirely connected with their profession. I have made my point. This is not a self-interested question; I just request that the issue be considered in the light of continuing requests from colleagues who think that we can do better. We have made progress, but we can do better still.</p>

Member for Telford (David Wright) did. There are three local issues on my list, one of which&#151;post offices&#151;is on everybody&#146;s local list. Yesterday was the closing date for responses to the consultation on post offices across Greater London. As I said in Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform Question Time earlier today, eight closures are proposed in my borough, four of which are in my constituency, and I have made representations. It is also proposed that a Crown post office be changed to a non-Crown post office and moved from an established Crown post office site on Borough high street to an as yet unopened&#151;and, I think, entirely unbuilt&#151;Costcutter store. That is taking trust a bit too far; it is cost-cutting with a vengeance. We might base our objection to the proposal on the fact that we do not believe that the building will be there until we see it, which might be a good reason for objecting.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o203"><a name="80403-0011.htm_para26"><a name="08040378000507">I want to make two points on the subject that partly tie in with an earlier interchange. I believe that three of the four post offices for which closure is proposed in my patch are now profit-making. They include the one at Dockhead on the riverside in Bermondsey, where there is family commitment and where the postmistress is extremely keen to continue, and the one on Ilderton road, which is on the Bermondsey-Lewisham border near Millwall football ground. A family have been running that post office since 1979, and they are keen to continue. There is a third on Maddock way, which is on the Brandon estate, near the Southwark-Lambeth border. It probably was not profit-making, but it has a new postmistress who believes that she has just turned the business around. She wants to stay there, because she believes that the business is viable. The fourth one in East street has not been profit-making, and the owner has been trying to get out of the business for some time, but the Post Office is resisting.</p>

Post Office Ltd should be willing to tell Members of Parliament, with the agreement of the postmaster or postmistress, what an office&#146;s commercial viability is&#151;it is far too secretive about such things. It should share all the information that is relevant to a post office, with the agreement of the postmaster or postmistress. If it did that, a business case could be made for many post offices, although not necessarily as free-standing offices&#151;they might be linked to a grocery or other store on the premises or nearby.

There can be devastating effects on parades of shops and in areas where there is deprivation. We need to consider that. The local authority is in many cases willing to be helpful, and the Post Office must take that into account.</p>

That is the unit to which people refer poisons, or potential poisons from all over the world for analysis and assessment, both in the context of crime and in the context of general medical treatment. It is to have its funding withdrawn, which is not a central Government matter, but a matter devolved to the Department of Health. The unit is well-established, and has an excellent national and international reputation. I hope that the final word has not been said on whether the money will be withdrawn, and I hope that the unit can remain in place in view of the quality of the service. I ask the Deputy Leader of the House to help me to find out what is going on, so that we can get some information and debate the subject in the open rather than behind closed doors. I hope that we can put, and win, the case for the unit to stay open.</p>

Members will know. It is on the right when one comes over Tower bridge from the north, next to London City Hall. It has been a derelict car park for many years, and is next to a very nice park. Southwark council and Berkeley Homes, both of which own part of the site, have at last come to an agreement to go back to the drawing board and together plan a new design for a cultural centre worthy of a landmark world heritage site. We have just heard a speech about an eminent landmark world heritage site in Shropshire that I know and admire. The design will replace the horrible eight pillars&#151;a more vulgar name has been given to them&#151;in the design that currently has planning permission. I hope that the Government and the new Mayor of London, whoever that will be, will support the new agreement, and that it will provide something to which the community can sign up, instead of the horrible monstrosity that we were to have inflicted on us, and which the community almost universally opposed.</p>

back to Iran he could be in severe trouble, or worse, because it had been announced publicly that he had had a gay relationship in Iran. I am not sure of all the historical facts, and it is not appropriate to share all of them now, but he makes the case that a former partner of his has been executed on the basis of his sexuality and sexual behaviour in Iran.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o209"><a name="80403-0012.htm_para5"><a name="08040378000513">It is unarguable that the Iranian regime behaves in that way to gay people, as well as to other categories of people, including women and political dissenters. The request being made to the UK Government is that they review the policy in relation to sending people back to places such as Iran and, still, Zimbabwe and Saudi Arabia, when it is obvious that because of Government policy particular people are at particular risk. It is unacceptable that there is a policy under which people are expected to go back to certain countries of the world under certain regimes at certain times and to believe that they will be safe, and I hope it will be reviewed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o210"><a name="80403-0012.htm_para6"><a name="08040378000514">In the case that I mentioned, the Home Secretary, to her credit, said to me at the beginning, when I requested a stay after the initial hearing, that the Home Office would look at the case again. My constituent fled to mainland Europe, thinking that that might be a safer place, but if the Dutch authorities, as I expect, send him back to the UK, I am sure the Home Secretary will do that job properly. However, that job would be much easier if there were a general moratorium on deportations in such cases, where the vulnerability is established without argument and where people would be at huge risk if they were sent home.</p>

I hope that the Deputy Leader of the House understands the importance of that. We need to maximise turnout and participation and minimise fraud. We are not there yet; it is work in progress.</p>

The director&#151;I think that is her title&#151;of the Office for National Statistics, the new boss of the ONS, has made it clear that the system is not sufficiently robust or up to date. The Greater London assembly carried out a survey which suggests that in a borough such as Southwark we probably underestimate our population in official figures by between 5,000 and 10,000.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o215"><a name="80403-0012.htm_para11"><a name="08040378000521">When population figures are wrong, there is a knock-on effect on the local government settlement. Ministers accept that, but they say that they cannot do anything about the settlement that has just come into effect. We believe that boroughs get less support than they ought to, because the assessed population is lower than it should be. If we are to have a fair system for distributing funds around the country, we need a fair and up-to-date system for assessing how many people live in an area&#151;how many adults, how many children and how many retired people&#151;so that we have up-to-date figures.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o216"><a name="80403-0012.htm_para12"><a name="08040378000522">My suggestion, which I have made before, is that every year we have, effectively, a census day combined with electoral registration day on a date that people can remember&#151;say, 1 March, with a countdown throughout February that can be tied in with publicity&#151;and that we use those figures not just for electoral registration, but as the latest best estimate on a rolling census basis. A big census would take place every 10 years; another census would take place on a five-yearly basis; and the annual figures would be fed in to update our population count. That would not disadvantage anybody. I hope that it would advantage everybody in Government and local government and be accepted as a good idea.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o218"><a name="80403-0012.htm_para14"><a name="08040378000525">I draw the attention of the House to a 1920 Cabinet memo in which a prominent politician wrote about the occupation of Iraq, which was then Mesopotamia. He described it as</p>

That encouraged me to penetrate <i> Hansard</i> further to see what the debates were like on the subject of Iraq in those far-off days, long before our time. I wish I had been alive and had participated in them, because they were much livelier. Members in all parts of the House were involved in discussing the issues. For example, we can see that Lloyd George&#146;s Government and all his senior Ministers were involved in various debates over  <br>

four years or more. The senior members were Curzon, Churchill, Chamberlain, Milner, Montagu, Bonar Law and the Prime Minister himself, Lloyd George&#151;not a bad line up for a premier division team. One can imagine how heavily focused those debates would have been on the subject of the invasion.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o221"><a name="80403-0012.htm_para17"><a name="08040378000528">I think that those debates were more entertaining and more interesting because they discussed the costs of the new territorial acquisition. Discussions took place in both Chambers and Army and Air Force estimates were looked at in open debate over several sittings. In those days, the essential feature of debates was that they occurred before the decisions had been made. They did not ratify something in an earlier estimate that led to spending; there was genuine discussion of how much should be invested in a particular year and in a particular foreign field. It was interesting.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o222"><a name="80403-0012.htm_para18"><a name="08040378000529">Looking at our behaviour over the past few years, we see that there has not been complete lack of scrutiny&#151;of course not; it happened elsewhere, in Select Committees and so on&#151;but the financial cost has been pushed aside. It is not irrelevant to discuss that too. I tried to raise it the other night in a serious debate on the need for an inquiry and was told, quite sharply, that it was irrelevant. I do not think that it is entirely irrelevant, and I shall try to explain why.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o223"><a name="80403-0012.htm_para19"><a name="08040378000530">It seems to me that people feel guilty about talking a lot about Iraq because we are letting the side and the soldiers down. I feel that, and I am sure that everybody round here does too, but I do not feel at all guilty about raising this subject. When I go back to Norwich, I get it all the time when I talk to constituents and hear that the pensioners cannot heat their homes. A few will write in&#151;not a massive number&#151;and there are always a few who come to see me. I always say, &#147;Well, we can&#146;t cost up everything.&#148; Their answer, which I am sure all hon. Members have received, is, &#147;You don&#146;t have any trouble finding money for Iraq and Afghanistan.&#148; I see heads nodding. People make a human response. Perhaps they do not understand the detail of it all&#151;I do not think that I do, either&#151;but I understand that kind of response.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o224"><a name="80403-0012.htm_para20"><a name="08040378000531">I carried out some research with an old colleague of mine&#151;a professor at the university of East Anglia&#151;on the cost of the war to the British Government, which is about &#163;9.9 billion at the minute. That is a minimum estimate, as it takes into account only operational capital expenditure, rather than indirect costs such as higher oil prices, loss of investor confidence and the possibility of a global recession&#151;all the things in which the war has probably been a factor. I am not saying that it has been a major or a minor factor, but expenditure on the war has been a factor in such events across the world.</p>

He claims that the war in Iraq alone will end up costing the UK more than &#163;20 billion. His book is called &#147;The Three Trillion Dollar War&#148;. It is very significant and well worth a read in the next few weeks when people have the time to do that.</p>

in Thorpe St. Andrew. Set up by the Government early on, it has had &#163;531,000 taken from it. At the same time and over the same period, we have put in &#163;3,297 million to service the work in Iraq and Afghanistan. That funding seems to have no end, as we heard this week with the continuation of the events in Basra and so on. We do not know where this will end up. Contrasting those things in the minds of the constituents whom we all serve, we can understand why there is a little feeling of unease about how well we perform in making financial assessments. The walk-in centre is successful: 5,000 people a month go for treatment of minor injuries and illnesses, skin complaints, muscle and joint injuries, minor cuts and wounds, and so on. It was very much opposed by GPs, on grounds that only they can handle such things, and is staffed completely by nurses. It is a great success&#151;seven days a week, 24 hours a day&#151;and it is wonderful. It sits next to a big supermarket, so people drift in with their problems.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o227"><a name="80403-0012.htm_para23"><a name="08040378000534">A polyclinic may be set up central Norwich, which I see as a means whereby GPs can find their way back into the process. They may have a role to play, but it should not be at the expense of the walk-in clinics. Central Norwich had the opportunity to have its own walk-in clinic in the early days of the Labour Government and the GPs rejected it. I am all for progress, but in a big sprawling city, two centres are needed so that people can easily access treatment for minor complaints, so axing such services should not be part of our agenda. They are popular with the local population and they have received huge press coverage; there will probably be more of it during the next few months.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o228"><a name="80403-0012.htm_para24"><a name="08040378000535">The nurse practitioners say that the centre can be run at a fraction of the cost of the war. We should be rewarding those places for the work that they do, encouraging and expanding it. When something is successful, we should not suddenly do away with it. I make a plea for the funding of the walk-in centre to be restored in full, so that the kind of services that the Government have been talking about this week, including pharmacies, continue. We do not need a GP for many of the functions at the primary level of our health service. I am not saying that we should take money from the war and put it into such services. We must find the right balance. I am not saying that troops should be brought back; that is an argument for another time and place. But the cost of the war should be balanced against these cuts. We have also heard about post office cuts, but in rural Norfolk and parts of Suffolk, as well as Telford, London and elsewhere, they are very important, and we should be finding the resources for them.</p>

We are in a position to get the Treasury to act in such areas and our constituents expect us to do so.</p>

feel should be brought to the House&#146;s attention before we go into recess. We have already heard during today&#146;s debate about sub-post offices, but the first issue that I want to raise concerns Chelmsford Crown post office.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o230"><a name="80403-0012.htm_para26"><a name="08040378000538">Until last summer, Chelmsford Crown post office was an extremely fine institution on the ground floor of a stand-alone building close to disabled car parking and accessible to shoppers in the centre of Chelmsford. Solely as a penny-pinching, cost-saving exercise, the Post Office decided to close down that post office and to move it to the first floor of WH Smith in Chelmsford High street. That is not a problem inasmuch as the location is still in the centre of the town with easy access from the outside of the building, but the problems begin on the inside, because as always with such deals the services are on the first floor. No retailer will give up its prime ground floor site where people enter the shop from the street to buy its products. The important issue is whether there is good and proper access to the first floor for members of the public&#151;particularly those in wheelchairs, the frail and those with disabilities. As far as the Chelmsford Crown post office in WH Smith is concerned, the short answer is that there is not.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o231"><a name="80403-0012.htm_para27"><a name="08040378000539">Before this happened, I warned the Post Office that there would be problems, but my warnings were brushed aside. Unfortunately, the Crown post office has been in WH Smith for six or seven months and, sadly, my fears have been fully realised. There is a staircase to the first floor and one escalator; there is not an up escalator and a down escalator, so that is a problem. However, the Post Office says that that is not a problem because there is a lift. Indeed there is: it is small, so if people in wheelchairs want to use it, queues form. Inevitably, the lift breaks down. It did recently, and that caused tremendous problems. In the past seven months, people&#151;certainly on one occasion&#151;have had to be carried down by paramedics to get from the first floor out of the building. It is unforgivable that such a service is being provided in exchange for the first-class service that we received when we had our own stand-alone post office.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o232"><a name="80403-0012.htm_para28"><a name="08040378000540">There is another problem. People can get in through the WH Smith high street entrance from the same level, although if they are going to the Post Office they then have to use the escalator, go up the stairs or, if they can, get into the lift. However, the only way to come in through the other entrance&#151;in the London road, where all the buses stop&#151;is down four very steep steps. There is no access for wheelchairs, so wheelchair users have to go all the way round to the other entrance. For those with non-motorised wheelchairs, that is a long distance. That is unacceptable.</p>

The best solution would be to go back to the status quo of a year ago. I fear, however, that that is not a viable option; the Post Office has made the move and is saving money. It does not seem that concerned about the quality of the service that it provides its customers, because people have to buy stamps and take their parcels, so they are, up to a point, a captive audience. That is particularly true because in previous waves in the past five years&#151;although not this wave&#151;the company closed many of the sub-post offices in the  <br>

surrounding area, saying that the Crown post office could become people&#146;s sub-post office. Despite the lip service that it pays to the interests of its customers, the Post Office is not desperately concerned; otherwise it would not have moved the Crown post office to that unsuitable site and it would certainly have done something about access to it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o234"><a name="80403-0013.htm_para1"><a name="08040378000542">Something has to be done; the situation cannot carry on in this way. I have presented the petition to the head of the Post Office and I have been told that the regional manager of WH Smith will visit shortly to have a look at the situation. That is good of him; I am grateful, and I hope that he does visit. However, I also hope that he realises the problems and comes up with concrete ideas to overcome them. One such idea would be to put a proper access way at the London road entrance so that wheelchair users, the frail and those with mobility problems would be able to use the entrance. Many of them use buses to come into town and the buses stop immediately outside the entrance.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o235"><a name="80403-0013.htm_para2"><a name="08040378000543">The second issue is that when people finally get upstairs, there are queues before they can get served. It would be sensible if there was a counter on the ground floor for the elderly and those with disabilities or mobility problems. That would save them having to go upstairs in the first place. I suspect that that is pie in the sky, because WH Smith does not want to impinge on its ability to make profits. However, if it is going to use its premises as a short-changed way of providing a Crown post office, perhaps it could sacrifice a little bit of space to help its customers.</p>

It is incomprehensible to me, as someone who is as honest as the day is long, that someone can say one thing to their constituents outside this place, then come here and, at the behest of Government Whips, do something else in the Division Lobby. I find that slightly uncharacteristic of Labour MPs. It is the hallmark of Liberal Democrats every day of the week.

answers to the same question that is asked of them. But c&#146;est la vie&#151;that is what old warhorses in the Conservative and Labour parties have come to expect from the Liberal Democrats. That is why I am surprised that in the vote on post offices only about 30 Labour Members of Parliament abided by what they were telling their constituents and joined us in the Division Lobby. However, that is on their consciences, and I am sure that the truth will out.</p>

Friends in the Division Lobby in the post office vote. Perhaps he was convinced by the arguments of the junior Minister who wound up for his party at the end of the debate, although having listened to that speech I would be slightly surprised if that were the case. I think that the hon. Gentleman might have been more convinced by the fact that he is Parliamentary Private Secretary to the Financial Secretary to the Treasury. Greater love hath no man for his job on the way up the greasy pole, in the hope that perhaps by the time the election comes in two years this will all be long since forgotten and he will survive.

It is one of the main feeder roads into the east of England and East Anglia. It serves not only the county of Essex, but the ports at Harwich and Felixstowe. The serious problem is that this road is old and constantly having to be repaired and, sadly, because of the increase in traffic&#151;some of it domestic vehicles and a lot of it business generated by the ports&#151;it is becoming too congested to be viable as a through road and a main road into one of the most important regions of this country.</p>

If one goes from that point to my constituency of West Chelmsford, which means travelling 13 miles of road, one will see that about half of it is made up of three lanes, and the other half, two lanes. Beyond that, on the way to Colchester and Ipswich, the road constantly changes from two lanes to three lanes, which enhances the congestion problems.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o240"><a name="80403-0013.htm_para7"><a name="08040378000550">Another problem is that investment is needed to improve the road to make it one worthy for the demands made of it, and to enhance it for domestic and business travellers in the region, and to and from the region and its ports. There was a crackpot idea some years ago, in the early 1990s, when the then Government suddenly unveiled in one of their White Papers on road building that they proposed to build a brand new motorway known as the M12 from a point off the M25 right up to Chelmsford, going west of the existing A12. That came as a considerable surprise to most people because no  <br>

one had been calling for a new motorway. I thought that it was particularly noble of the then Secretary of State for Transport to come up with the idea, because the road passed within about 200 yd of the garden of his house, which seemed rather extreme to me. Fortunately, though, cooler and saner heads prevailed and the then Government abandoned that cockeyed scheme. It has not been resurrected, even though when the current Government were carrying out inquiries and investigations on how to improve the road situation around Ipswich and the knock-on effect down the A12, it was looked at. Rightfully and thankfully, however, it was dismissed as a non-starter.</p>

There is a simple solution to the existing problem, which is to invest in the infrastructure by upgrading the existing A12 in order that all the stretches of only two lanes have three lanes. That will cater for traffic and reduce congestion problems, costs for industry and the road safety problems that result from the bottlenecks. I asked the Under-Secretary of State for Transport, the hon. Member for Glasgow, South (Mr. Harris), about the matter on 4 March, and I was pleased to find that he shares my view that the road is of national importance and that it needs a major upgrade.</p>

It would be quite nice if she popped into Essex at some point as she is the Minister for the East of England, and no doubt, at some point, she will. She has had that job since the beginning of July, and she has not yet stepped into the county council area of Essex, which is the county with the largest population in the region for which she is the Minister. We look forward to welcoming her to Essex at some point when, in the course of her busy duties in the east of England, she can find time to visit us.

extension replaces what was there before. In effect, the paper is trying to have us believe that the extension is not an extension, but a completely new scheme replacing the existing scheme.</p>

This was meant to be a great extension to the scheme, but I&#146;m now being told, &#145;You can&#146;t get on this bus,&#146; &#145;You can&#146;t get on that train,&#146; or &#145;You can&#146;t bring so-and-so with you.&#146;&#148; Some people with disabilities have told me, &#147;I have no choice when I travel. I only do 16 hours a week, but this helps me get to work. Now I&#146;m going to have to pay &#163;9 a week.&#148; There has been absolute outrage.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o254"><a name="80403-0013.htm_para21"><a name="08040378000565">I have raised the issue with the Prime Minister and the Secretary of State for Transport, and on several occasions with my right hon.

<p><a name="stpa_o255"><a name="80403-0013.htm_para22"><a name="08040378000566">I want to look back at how the council got where it is now. In 2000 a mandatory half fare scheme was introduced for the over-60s and disabled people. In 2006 that was extended to free travel on local buses, although people complained that it extended only as far as their local authority boundary, unless groups of local authorities in their area decided to club together. This year&#146;s scheme is an extension of that scheme.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o256"><a name="80403-0013.htm_para23"><a name="08040378000567">I checked on the funding for the scheme. In 2006-07 the Government provided English local authorities with an additional &#163;350 million through the rate support grant to implement free local bus travel. That money will increase in subsequent years. In 2008-09, it will increase to &#163;377 million and by 2010 it will be &#163;396 million. Then I looked further, into the funding to tie that in with the extension. In 2008-09, the Government are providing an additional &#163;212 million for the extended travel, on top of the rate support grant moneys, which will also increase year on year. That equates to an average funding increase of about 30 per cent. throughout the UK. I have checked with Ministers, who have told me that councils had their free scheme, but with the national scheme they can choose to add extra bits here and there, which is what North Lincolnshire council is doing&#151;through, for example, companion travel and half fares on local trains.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o257"><a name="80403-0013.htm_para24"><a name="08040378000568">The average increase in the region in which my constituency lies is 25 per cent., but let us examine the two neighbouring local authorities covering my constituency in more detail. Until now, North East Lincolnshire council has invested about &#163;1.6 million in the concessionary fares scheme, while neighbouring North Lincolnshire council has invested &#163;1.1 million. Both councils have had additional funding for the extension to the travel scheme. North East Lincolnshire has received &#163;603,000, and North Lincolnshire has received &#163;409,000. My maths might be a wee bit ropey, but that increase, at around 35 to 37 per cent., seems to be above the average. That is a pretty good increase in funding. Within the former Humberside area, the East Riding of Yorkshire has had a 24 per cent. increase, and Hull city has received 33 per cent., so the two authorities in my  <br>

Family members live on either side of the boundary, and while one lot can travel free at peak times, the others will now have to pay, having enjoyed free travel for the past two years. There is only one way to describe this: it is a cut, pure and simple. I think that it is one of the meanest cuts I have ever seen. At one end of the two local authority areas is the town of Scunthorpe, with Grimsby and Cleethorpes at the other. Pensioners can get on a bus at either end and travel across the area. Some will have to pay full fare, but others will enjoy free travel. That is absolutely ludicrous.</p>

I think that people there pay an administration fee of about &#163;15, but they then enjoy free local travel.</p>

That caused something of an outcry, and they were finally released and allowed to join their families in the Netherlands.</p>

 It is a pleasure to have been called to take part in this Adjournment debate. Although I shall address some local issues, as is the custom in such debates, I also wish briefly to touch upon a couple of events that have been reported in today&#146;s news media and which are far from constituency based.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o270"><a name="80403-0014.htm_para9"><a name="08040378000586">I have read today that at the Bucharest NATO summit Macedonia&#146;s application to join NATO has been turned down. Although Croatia and Albania have been asked whether they would like to join, Macedonia has not. That saddens me, as Macedonian forces have been fighting alongside our own and NATO forces in various theatres. It is openly acknowledged that its application has been turned down purely because Greece objects to Macedonia being called Macedonia; it wants to call it the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. That seems rather bizarre, particularly in the current age when we in Europe are all trying to get along together. The British Government must play their part in trying to resolve this matter. If we are trying to welcome countries in, we must reject the idea that their past somehow stays with them; such territorial disputes often go back a long way in history and are not really disputes at all any more but largely imagined, and they are no part of today&#146;s Europe.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o271"><a name="80403-0014.htm_para10"><a name="08040378000587">The other event in today&#146;s news is particularly close to my heart: the Government have published their draft Marine Bill. That is much to be welcomed&#151;although judging by its size it will provide Members with a considerable amount of reading material in the coming weeks. I have been closely associated with this subject ever since I attempted to introduce my own Marine Wildlife Conservation Bill, which was reasonably successful as it got as far as the House of Lords before it was holed below the line.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o272"><a name="80403-0014.htm_para11"><a name="08040378000588">I do not want to be churlish, but it has taken a long time for this draft Marine Bill to be brought forward, yet it was part of all three major parties&#146; manifesto commitments in the 2005 election. After the draft Bill has been subjected to the scrutiny that it is designed to  <br>

receive, I urge the Government to introduce a Bill before the House as soon as possible, because urgent action is needed as there is very little protection for the marine environment. Members know from the reaction not only to my Bill, but to various organisations&#146; campaigns, that this subject is very dear to the hearts of most of our constituents, regardless of whether we represent inland or coastal seats.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o273"><a name="80403-0014.htm_para12"><a name="08040378000589">I shall now turn to my Uxbridge constituency. Like many other MPs, I have been taking up the issue of the closure of post offices. As the hon. Member for North Southwark and Bermondsey (Simon Hughes) said, the consultation closed yesterday, and I have made representations for the Moorfield Road and Uxbridge Common Park Road sub-post offices to remain open. When Members look into this matter, all of us realise&#151;even those whose wish to save their post offices does not always translate into votes in the House&#151;how much these post offices are valued, particularly by the elderly and the vulnerable. That is to do with so much more than just the services they provide, such as selling stamps or foreign currency. The sub-postmasters and mistresses are still in that great breed of retailers who want to give service and who are part of the community, and the loss of that would be the most tragic loss of all.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o274"><a name="80403-0014.htm_para13"><a name="08040378000590">I still think that the Post Office has not examined how it could provide that sort of service, because not all the requirements are necessary. Members of the community who want to renew their road tax can do so online or they can use their car to go to the next sub-post office, but people who want to collect a pension or to post a parcel may not have such access&#151;a bus does not even go nearby the Moorfield Road post office. As I mentioned in the debate a couple of weeks ago, a system of services must be put in place. My retail outlet sells stamps, but it is not allowed to do anything more than that. I cannot help feeling that it would not be beyond the Post Office&#146;s wit to supply the weighing machines that produce the stamps&#151;not the ones that people put on things, but the labels&#151;so that some of that service could be provided by other outlets. It is a great shame that the Post Office is rushing ahead with this whole closure programme without thinking about how to improve its service&#151;it just keeps cutting back all the time.</p>

<p><a name="st_o252"><a name="08040378000591"><a name="80403-0014.htm_spnew3"><a name="08040378001181"><b>Simon Hughes:</b>
 The hon. Gentleman prompts me to respond on that point. One frustration is that offices that say that they would happily deal with tax discs or passports, that to do so would make the difference and that people keep asking for that service only to be told that it cannot be provided are being turned down by the Post Office when they request to provide them. Their opportunity to be more profitable is hindered from upstairs by Post Office management, although it would help everybody on the ground.</p>

<p><a name="st_o253"><a name="08040378000592"><a name="80403-0014.htm_spnew4"><a name="08040378001182"><b>Mr. Randall:</b>
 The hon. Gentleman is right. One of the things that I find most frustrating in today&#146;s world is that the Post Office seems to be cutting its own throat. It should be able to provide the things that people want in more outlets rather than restricting them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o275"><a name="80403-0014.htm_para14"><a name="08040378000593">I was interested to hear the comments made by my hon. Friend the Member for West Chelmsford (Mr. Burns) about the Crown post office in Chelmsford having already moved into WH Smith. I believe that on 17 April, the Uxbridge Crown post office will move to the local  <br>

WH Smith. Although I made representations, met representatives of the Post Office and was given various assurances about the services that would be provided to ensure that there would be no difficulties in respect of access and the number of windows open, his experience fills me with dread. I try to be positive&#151;I am not someone who always objects to change for the sake of it&#151;but I have heard about several of my hon. Friends&#146; experiences with these transfers of Crown post offices to WH Smith and I am concerned. I can tell the Post Office and WH Smith that I shall make several wanders down the high street in Uxbridge in the coming weeks to see for myself exactly whether they have lived up to their promises or whether a terminal 5 is taking place in a mini world in Uxbridge. I am concerned about that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o276"><a name="80403-0014.htm_para15"><a name="08040378000594">Another local issue of great concern that is constantly being raised with me is what is these days called &#147;garden grabbing&#148;. It occurs when family homes in suburban streets are destroyed or knocked down as developers put up flats, when gardens disappear through infilling and so on. That practice, which is destroying the character of many of our roads and communities, is happening in many areas of my constituency, but it is at its worst in Fairfield road, Uxbridge, where 35 per cent. of the properties have some sort of application lodged or an appeal going on. The poor residents of that road say, &#147;We are going to stick it here, as we have lived here all our lives&#148;, but they see another development going up and another being granted on appeal. That is one of the most frustrating things&#151;the local authority understood exactly what the application would mean and therefore rejected it, but it was then granted on appeal.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o277"><a name="80403-0014.htm_para16"><a name="08040378000595">One of the problems is that the inspectorate considers the individual planning application rather than looking at the area in a street or a road, which would make a lot of difference. The London borough of Hillingdon planning department is as frustrated as anyone else and it is trying to look at the strategy to see whether it can change it, but it is frustrated at every level.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o278"><a name="80403-0014.htm_para17"><a name="08040378000596">I have raised the subject before and the Government must look hard at it. Uxbridge is a pretty present place to be, although it has its problems, but many of the ills of our society emerge as we destroy the fabric of our communities and of community life. If we destroy that community feeling, that will only bring more problems. We have seen that happen elsewhere, and it is about time that such things were regulated in a much fairer and better way. We should put the residents&#146; interests first.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o279"><a name="80403-0014.htm_para18"><a name="08040378000597">The hon. Member for North Southwark and Bermondsey made a plea about the parliamentary holidays and for us to be able to spend time with our children. I agree that it is incredibly important for all families to spend as much time together as they can. My children&#146;s holidays have not on this occasion matched the parliamentary recess, but I was able to spend the weekend away on a rugby tour with my daughter, who is the only girl in the boys&#146; team. It will be her last tour away because once players get past the under-12s, they are not allowed to play mixed rugby any more.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o280"><a name="80403-0014.htm_para19"><a name="08040378000598">I want to pay tribute to all sports that get our kids actively involved. I am sure that the hon. Ladies on the Labour Benches will be delighted to hear that I am an advocate of women&#146;s sport. That has probably come from having a daughter who is keen on sport. I have seen its benefits. Sports are incredibly important for both boys and girls, especially team sports, because of  <br>

their fitness levels and also to help them to bond together. Although such activity is mainly for the kids, the parents can find some diversions here and there. I am sure, Mr. Deputy Speaker, that you have no idea what goes on on such occasions, but they are very civilised. In fact, it is akin to what goes on in the Opposition Whips Office, as far as I can see.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o281"><a name="80403-0014.htm_para20"><a name="08040378000599">As it is the last season for my daughter, I want to thank Ruislip rugby club and those involved with the under-12s, especially the coaches, Mr. Terry Russell, Phil Skelton and Robin Nelson. They have done so much. At least 40 kids turn up on a Sunday morning to play in all weathers, which is a tribute to the coaches.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o282"><a name="80403-0014.htm_para21"><a name="08040378000600">I shall be doing my own bit for fitness in the weeks of the recess, as I shall be walking the streets of Hillingdon as a part-time postman for my hon. Friend the Member for Henley (Mr. Johnson) and his ambitions to become London Mayor. All of us who love this great city of ours realise that that gentleman will keep it a great city. I hope that when I return hon. Members will see a slimmer, fitter Member for Uxbridge.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o283"><a name="80403-0014.htm_para22"><a name="08040378000601">Finally, I cannot not mention the most pressing issue for most of my constituents, which is the proposed third runway at Heathrow. We had a debate on the subject yesterday during the Liberal Democrats&#146; Opposition time, when I was disappointed that the debate turned into a party political one. It is a very serious matter and people from all parties have views on the subject. I find it particularly sad that on that matter, and incidentally on an inquiry into the war in Iraq, the Liberal Democrats do not seem to like anybody else to agree with them. They seem to think that it is their own particular thing, and they are rather sad if anybody dares to agree with them. <i> [Laughter.] </i>Liberal Democrat Members laugh, but such things are very serious. When I have spoken to many Liberal Democrat Members at public meetings there has been no difference between us, but they suddenly seem to turn on those of us on the Conservative Benches who share their views when they are in the glare here. I find that particularly worrying. It is a different matter in Westminster Hall, which speaks volumes for that chamber.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o284"><a name="80403-0014.htm_para23"><a name="">I have been discussing with my hon. Friends some of the things that people do not understand. One of my hon. Friends said to me, &#147;But they&#146;re not going to increase flights, are they? I have been told by BAA that it is not going to increase flights&#151;it is just to make the capacity a bit bigger so that there is more space.&#148; But 220,000 extra flights a year is, I think, an increase.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o285"><a name="80403-0014.htm_para24"><a name="08040378000602">There is another thing that is incredibly important for all Members to understand, which Members who do not live nearby or have not taken a special interest do not realise. When we talk of a third runway, one could almost say, &#147;Well, what are they worried about? It is a bit of tarmac. It&#146;s just going to go down the road a bit, it&#146;s not really a problem.&#148; In fact, there are a couple of Labour wards that I could put a bit of tarmac through quite happily, but it does not work like that. It will not just be a third runway and a sixth terminal; what is proposed is a whole new airport the size of Gatwick being put alongside Heathrow. That is what people do not understand.</p>

 I was not able to be at yesterday&#146;s debate. I have it to read, but I have yet to do so. I share the hon. Gentleman&#146;s view that if there can be cross-party agreement on such issues, we all benefit. Although I am not a west London MP, having been to see colleagues and friends in west London and beyond, it seems to me that he and his constituents are right to seek support from others on what is not just a little expansion but a transformation that will go far beyond the inconvenience and environmental pollution that they already suffer from.</p>

 I endorse and echo the good wishes of my hon. Friend the Member for Uxbridge (Mr. Randall) to all Members of the House and to all those who help and service the House. For their patience and kindness, often to a very new Member, I am deeply grateful.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o287"><a name="80403-0014.htm_para26"><a name="08040378000607">I do not propose to detain the House for long, but I want to draw attention to a number of matters that deeply affect the constituents whom I have the honour to represent. My constituency is profoundly rural, encompassing a large part of the north Devonshire coast. It contains a number of coastal communities, which are particularly affected by factors such as seasonal work, coastal erosion, outward migration and deprivation. In fact, it is not widely known that Torridge and West Devon contains two of the most deprived wards in England. People are often surprised to learn that&#151;including a Minister whom I and a number of constituents from the town of Bideford met yesterday.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o288"><a name="80403-0014.htm_para27"><a name="08040378000608">My constituency includes part of the north Devon coast, and in the south it embraces a large part of Dartmoor. The moor is characterised by hill farming, but it also has a considerable amount of deprivation and rural isolation. Today, I want to speak specifically about the matters that affect people living in its fragile rural communities. I have been aware for some time that people in my constituency feel a sense of helplessness that arises from their belief that they are no longer able to affect the fate, future and destiny of their communities. Increasingly, that power is being removed to a remote and unaccountable quangocracy that includes the regional development agencies and regional assemblies, as well as bodies such as Natural England.</p>


<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080403/debtext/80403-0015.htm"/>

Moreover, it does not always consult the people likely to be affected. For example, Natural England has declined to assist people living in the coastal town of Northam, in the northern part of my constituency, who are facing acute problems with erosion in an area known as the Northam burrows. It is a beautiful spot: when the spring breezes tease the flowers from their buds, nowhere is nicer for a refreshing walk.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o290"><a name="80403-0015.htm_para1"><a name="08040378000610">The Royal North Devon golf club&#151;one of the old fashioned clubs that sprang up on the sand dunes and grassy banks of our coastline&#151;is situated in the Northam burrows. However, the tide has been advancing relentlessly for some years, and it has begun to erode the pebble ridge that offers protection from the sea&#146;s depredations. The pebble ridge is an idiosyncratic feature of the area, and it is a precious and protected site, but only the other day we lost 25 m of it to erosion.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o291"><a name="80403-0015.htm_para2"><a name="08040378000611">The people of the communities that I represent cannot understand why the responsible authorities&#151;the district and county councils&#151;do not take the action that their fathers and forefathers took to protect the Northam burrows against coastal erosion. Simply recharging the pebble ridge would afford protection against the oncoming tide and the erosion that it causes. No such action has been taken because Natural England no longer believes that recharging the pebble ridge is the right thing to do, even as an interim measure. Instead, it believes in what is called managed retreat. I do not contest that there are sound reasons for that belief, but managed retreat means that the cycle of tides in that part of the Torridge estuary should be allowed to do its work, and it also means that interim measures are not in the interests of the Northam burrows.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o292"><a name="80403-0015.htm_para3"><a name="08040378000612">If Natural England is right, it is vital that its reasoning be communicated to the people who live in the area, because they are the ones who are affected by coastal erosion. Their houses and communities are at risk, as are the precious Northam burrows that they have loved and lived in for decades and centuries. They feel that the policy has been devised at a distance from them and has not been one on which they have been consulted and that, in any event, it lacks the justification and substance that it ought to have.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o293"><a name="80403-0015.htm_para4"><a name="08040378000613">There is an additional problem&#151;a problem that, I hope, when I reveal it, will make apparent to hon. Members why the community is so concerned. On the Northam burrows&#151;this is common to many precious and protected sites&#151;many years ago, a landfill site was deemed appropriate. On that landfill site, which closed 40 or 50 years ago&#151;certainly, 30 or 40 years ago&#151;there was placed, pre-war and in the 1940s, a whole range of the odious and the bad. It is believed that there are many tonnes of asbestos of the most dangerous kind, that there may be medical waste and that it is all lying in a vast mound in the middle of the Northam burrows.</p>

None of us knows what is in the site. We believe that it contains asbestos&#151;we are pretty confident that it does&#151;and we know that it will contain something very unpleasant. As the tide encircles it and begins to erode it, we can only speculate and greet with some fear and trepidation what may be uncovered by the tide.</p>

urgently necessary, since the records of the landfill site were lost by the county council many years ago, that some urgent steps are taken to investigate what lies beneath. Yet month has followed month and year has followed year, but no such investigation has been carried out, while the tide continues to advance, while the pebble ridge continues to recede and be eroded and while the danger increases step by step, nearer and nearer to the communities that I represent.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o296"><a name="80403-0015.htm_para7"><a name="08040378000616">So I use this opportunity to raise in the House, I hope, in as clear and compelling a way as I can, the urgent necessity for Devon county council to act now. Those whom I represent believe that, as the tide encircles that landfill site not a catastrophe but certainly a very dangerous situation indeed could arise. The county council has committed itself to move forward with those investigations now for many months, if not years, and those investigations must commence. My constituents cannot understand the delay, and they cannot understand the policy of not recharging the pebble ridge and thus protecting the landfill site from the further inflow of the tide.</p>

I believe and hope that these words will be heeded, as will the cries and pleas of the local communities that I represent. That is the first issue, which illuminates, as I believe, why those whom I represent resent the sense of a quangocracy at a great distance from them not listening to the interests of the fragile rural communities in Torridge and West Devon.</p>

Member for Telford (David Wright) has mentioned, a critical question that is, even now, bearing on the consciousness of those whom I represent. We are in the middle of the stage of identifying the sub-post office branches for closure. I have never experienced such a process. It is characterised by what I can only describe as a rather sinister sense of intimidation. I have postmasters ringing me quietly in the night, afraid even to speak to their Member of Parliament because of confidentiality clauses and the implied and unspoken suggestion that if they speak to their Member of Parliament, make a fuss or draw their position to public attention, they may lose their compensation. They whisper to me in corners, and they telephone me confidentially. They are anxious and troubled&#151;it is not too much to say that they are afraid.</p>

Some of the post offices affected are in the heart of the most vulnerable, distant, remote, isolated and rural communities that I represent. It is well known that Devonshire has the largest county-wide network of roads in the country, some of which are of third-world standard. Even the manager of Stagecoach, the local bus company, has said that many of the roads in Devon&#151;I represent one of the most far-flung regions in Devon&#151;are inaccessible to bus services generally. Villages may have one bus a week, and certainly no more than one a day, yet post offices are to close, and the frail, the elderly, the vulnerable, and those in wheelchairs and electric buggies will have to negotiate their way to the post office on the roads that I have described.

The process of post office closures in my constituency is as brutal and as bad for the communities that I represent as any measure that the Government could have permitted. It is characterised by fear, secrecy and want of transparency. The hon. Member for North Southwark and Bermondsey (Simon Hughes) has told us that it is only right that full disclosure be made in relation to a post office. I agree with him entirely, but when one asks the Post Office, there is immediately a clamming-up and an unwillingness to disclose facts that could furnish information relevant to the submission and information on which the case could be made for a particular post office or number of post offices.</p>

We are one of the most deprived constituencies; we have no bus system, and no public transport system that would enable those affected to travel.

It is 3.9 miles to the nearest post office, if her local post office closes. How is she to get there? There is one bus a day. She would have to remain in the other village all day waiting for the bus, merely to buy a stamp or send a parcel. Or, as the lady told me, with her Union Jack on the little basket on the front of her buggy&#151;the House may have detected that she is indeed a Conservative voter, God bless her&#151;she will set out in her buggy around the winding roads with their pits, holes and divots for the nearest village 3.9 miles away.

There are so many problems with services that affect rural communities and give rise to the state of mind among them that London, the House and the Government are not listening. Broadband is a minor irritation, it might be thought by the House, but there are dozens of villages in my constituency that cannot receive it.

 Yes, a Liberal Democrat council. Nevertheless, I cannot blame the council for everything, and I do not seek to do so. [Hon. Members: &#147;Go on!&#148;] No, no. Perish the thought that I should blame the Liberal Democrats. Speaking for myself, I have always enjoyed the most cordial relationship with the Liberal Democrat county council, and I think that the Liberal Democrats try to do their best&#151;it is not always a good best, but they try to do it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o310"><a name="80403-0015.htm_para21"><a name="08040378000634">The county operated a bus concession scheme that allowed people to travel from 9 o&#146;clock in the morning. Hon. Members might think 9 o&#146;clock is a sensible time to begin, because that is when most of the buses go. They do not go after 9.30, because if people want to leave their villages and get to work, the buses must go before then. Unfortunately, however, the Devonwide partnership, which runs the scheme, felt unable to continue the original scheme, which was local, and introduced a start time of 9.30. That means that the scheme is almost useless for dozens of my villages, which people cannot get out of until after 9.30.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o311"><a name="80403-0015.htm_para22"><a name="08040378000635">Why does the scheme now start at 9.30? I will tell hon. Members the reason, which might provide an answer for the hon. Member for Cleethorpes (Shona McIsaac) and which is certainly the answer in Devon: the Government have simply not provided enough money. At the moment, the Devonwide partnership does not dare take the step of starting the scheme at 9 o&#146;clock rather than 9.30. Why? Because the Government have done no serious study as to the number of visitors who will arrive in Devon. Those visitors, and the distances involved, would take up much of the Government&#146;s money. So, for the first year, the scheme starts at 9.30, not 9, which makes it automatically of little use to thousands of those who will have the card.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o312"><a name="80403-0015.htm_para23"><a name="08040378000636">Additionally, it has not been possible to extend the companion for carers scheme to the county. That, too, is a devastating blow to those who are disabled and those with autistic children, which is a subject close to my heart. Their companions will be unable to travel on the buses, because the scheme has not been extended. Having done the maths, the Devonwide partnership simply does not believe that enough money has been provided to fund it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o313"><a name="80403-0015.htm_para24"><a name="08040378000637">The local scheme started at 9 and gave carers the right to accompany the disabled. The new national scheme starts at 9.30 and does not give carers that same right. I submit that that is another reason why hon. Members, were they living in one of the villages or market towns that I represent, would regard this as another meaningless, mysterious, peculiar, baffling decision taken remotely from them that hit hard their quality of life and their confidence that they could survive living in those remote and rural communities.</p>

respect many of them; they are perfectly decent people&#151;that they have done their maths and there simply is not enough money, particularly as Devon is rich in tourist attractions. We have the south Devon coast, Dartmoor and the north Devon coast. The assessment is that the number of tourist visitors who will take up the benefit of the national concessionary scheme is so great that the money simply is not enough to cover it. That is why this is a problem that will adversely affect those whom I represent.</p>

Mine is a livestock farming constituency, and it is probably the single most densely infected area. Dozens if not hundreds of farms are locked up in restrictions associated with the disease. For years now&#151;certainly since I entered the House nearly three years ago&#151;I have repeatedly urged the Government to take action, and the only way to do so, certainly in my area, is, as the Select Committee recently recommended, to grasp the nettle and order a humane badger cull in properly controlled circumstances. I am sorry to have to offend Labour Members in their sentiment and proper regard for those beautiful animals, but all scientists now agree that unless we tackle the disease in the wildlife reservoir, the disease, which costs &#163;100 million a year, will go on inflicting devastating distress upon farming families as they see their livelihoods, their herds and their farms simply being washed down the plughole, putting them out of business, and we will go on experiencing this unacceptable and corrosive problem in the countryside.</p>

It must be done where the vets and the scientists agree that it will have effect&#151;in the dense hot spots where we must eliminate the disease not only from the cattle population but from the wildlife population. We must bear down on both sides of the disease. We cannot simply replace infected cattle with clean cattle, leave infected badgers on the farms and expect TB not to break out again. That is what is happening, and it is time that the Government decided to end the scourge.</p>

The aim of that legislation is to improve the standard of road safety for motorcycle and moped riders. There are good arguments for improving the test for motorcyclists because a disproportionate number of the accidents on our roads involve motorcyclists.

generally. Despite the benefits of the new testing regime, there are serious deficiencies in the way in which the Government are introducing it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o317"><a name="80403-0016.htm_para1"><a name="08040378000644">In order to carry out the new practical test, the Government are constructing multi-purpose test centres. A few years ago, they agreed that most learners should be able to reach a test site within 45 minutes&#146; travelling time and by travelling no more than 20 miles from their home. However, the construction of the new test centres is running well behind schedule. For example, in Scotland only two test centres are operational, one in Glasgow and one just outside Edinburgh. By September, when the new test becomes compulsory, the Driving Standards Agency expects only three more sites to be operational in Scotland&#151;in Wick, Inverness and Kirkcaldy. That will leave a very large part of Scotland, including nearly all my constituency, well outside the 20 miles. In fact, some of the learner motorcyclists on the mainland parts of my constituency will have a round trip of well over 200 miles and even greater problems will face learners from the islands.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o318"><a name="80403-0016.htm_para2"><a name="08040378000645">For example, at present the test can be carried out on the isle of Tiree. However, in future someone from there will have to make a three-day round trip, with two nights away from home, to sit the test. The DSA says that it is negotiating for other sites. Oban in my constituency was on the original published list of sites, but what the DSA terms the &#147;Oban site&#148; may end up in Fort William&#151; 44 miles from Oban and well over 130 miles from Campbeltown, which is at the other end of my constituency. Even if the Fort William site proceeds, and that is by no means certain, it will definitely not be ready by the time the new tests start in September.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o319"><a name="80403-0016.htm_para3"><a name="08040378000646">There are no transitional arrangements; on 29 September, every learner in the country will have to go to one of the new test centres to sit their test. The new system has already resulted in a business casualty in my constituency. Just a few days ago, a motorcycle school in Oban closed; the owners said that there was no point in continuing to teach motorcyclists if they had to travel all the way to Glasgow to take their tests, rather than take their tests locally as they can at the moment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o320"><a name="80403-0016.htm_para4"><a name="08040378000647">I ask the Government urgently to rethink their plans for test centres. Better testing may well save lives, but only if it is accessible to learners. Under the current proposals it is not; round trips of hundreds of miles, or three-day round trips for islanders, cannot be considered to represent accessibility. I have already seen one motorcycle school close and I am sure that others elsewhere in the country will do so. Furthermore, there is a risk with the new scheme: people will be tempted to skip the test and use their motorcycles illegally if the test centre is too far away. Given the cost to society of a fatal accident&#151;the human cost, plus the estimated &#163;1.5 million financial cost&#151;I urge the Government to ensure that there is an easily accessible range of test centres and to remember the 45-minute, 20-mile commitment that they gave a few years ago.</p>

would involve recording each individual sheep&#146;s identity when a batch of sheep was being moved, but that is simply not necessary; recording the batch movement itself would be just as good for the purposes of disease control and food safety.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o322"><a name="80403-0016.htm_para6"><a name="08040378000649">Batch recording is in use at present and delivers a sustainable and robust method of recording sheep movements. It delivers food traceability and disease monitoring, as was demonstrated during last year&#146;s foot and mouth outbreak. Through the batch recording of sheep movements, every sheep in Scotland was traced within three days of the outbreak on 3 August. The current proposals are completely impractical in a hill farm setting, where flocks can be made up of more than 1,000 animals. The price of sheep is so low that the sheep farming industry simply could not sustain the price of electronic identification technology. When a batch of sheep is moved, recording batch movements, rather than each individual sheep&#146;s identity, is perfectly adequate for disease control and food safety purposes. I urge the Government to ensure in the negotiations at EU level that the proposed regulations are modified to reflect that.</p>

The shipbuilding industry supports thousands of jobs in Scotland and is desperately waiting for the new aircraft carrier contract. I hope that the Government will sign that contract soon to allow the work to start. I also want to make the case for the carriers, once they are in service, to be based at the Clyde naval base at Faslane. Faslane has superb facilities. It is a superbly sheltered anchorage that gives enough clearance for large ships such as the new aircraft carriers to dock at low tide. There is enough space round about to accommodate all the back-up support that the carriers would require, as well as plenty of skilled workers within easy travelling distance and plenty of empty Ministry of Defence housing. Faslane has the setting, in the Gareloch, and the local infrastructure and work force to be an ideal location for basing the new carriers.</p>

I welcome that recommendation because the current supermarket code of practice has proven ineffective at protecting farmers and other suppliers from exploitation. A good example is the huge difference between the price of milk at the farm gate and on the supermarket shelf. When the Select Committee on Environment, Food and Rural Affairs investigated that, it could never quite get to the bottom of where all the money was going, and the new code of practice and ombudsman are ideal for that purpose. I hope that the Government will take those proposals on board and give them their backing, and that GSCOP and the ombudsman will quickly be put in place.</p>

 My hon. Friend is right to be concerned, because sometimes even when one is given a promise, as we were during the last set of closures, that is not the end of the matter.

If the Post Office is not successful in being given the POCA, I can envisage far more post offices in my constituency being forced to close. A warning of what could happen came when the TV licence contract was given to PayPoint. PayPoint has a large network of shops throughout the country, but they nearly all tend to be in towns and large urban areas&#151;they do not have a rural network. For example, several islands in my constituency have a post office but no PayPoint outlet, so people cannot pay their TV licence over the counter any more, and the whole of the rural north Argyll area has no PayPoint outlet but several post offices. There is fear that the Government may give the contract to the likes of PayPoint or a consortium of banks, which do not have the rural network that the Post Office has.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o327"><a name="80403-0016.htm_para11"><a name="08040378000656">I urge the Government to write into the specification of the contract that whoever wins it must have a rural network&#151;and an island network, which is important for my constituency. If the Post Office does not win that contract, it will mean the axe for a huge number of other post offices, and it will make it difficult for people to collect their pensions and benefits. I urge Ministers in the Department for Work and Pensions to specify that whoever wins the contract, it must have a large rural network. I believe that the Post Office is the only organisation that can deliver that contract. The announcement must be made fairly soon to give security to postmasters and mistresses.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o328"><a name="80403-0016.htm_para12"><a name="08040378000657">Thank you, Mr. Deputy Speaker, for giving me the opportunity to raise those issues.

 I am grateful to be able to raise a few issues on behalf of my constituents, although I can certainly relate to a number of the other issues raised by hon. Members today.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o329"><a name="80403-0016.htm_para13"><a name="08040378000659">The first issue is the minimum wage and the low-paid. We have heard a lot over the past few weeks about the minimum wage rising to &#163;5.73 an hour, but when we look at the moneys that people actually receive on that sort of wage, we find a 40-hour week giving &#163;11,950 a year. If we add the basic working tax credit and the  <br>

child tax credit, we have a total of &#163;14,295. We are told that the poverty level is anything below &#163;15,000 a year, so we can see that there are significant problems with the level of the minimum wage. I support the comments of the right hon. Member for Sheffield, Brightside (Mr. Blunkett), who said that the minimum wage needs to be reviewed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o330"><a name="80403-0016.htm_para14"><a name="08040378000660">I am told that the average wage in my constituency is &#163;18,000 a year. If we take a simple figure of 10 people, with one of them earning &#163;100,000 and the other nine earning &#163;10,000, we find that the average is &#163;19,000. But only one of them would be on a significant wage, so averages are very misleading. If we take out those on significant earnings, such as the Member of Parliament, local authority officers, doctors and nurses, we find that the people earning lower wages in factories and shops are nowhere near even the average wage in my constituency, but we expect those people to pay rising fuel bills and council tax bills. That shows just how difficult it is for people to survive.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o331"><a name="80403-0016.htm_para15"><a name="08040378000661">My constituency has the highest rate of band D properties in Wales. According to any of the other statistics that we could look at, it is one of the poorest boroughs&#151;we have high deprivation levels&#151;but we pay the highest council tax, at band D level. The average house price is &#163;110,000. Even if someone was on the average wage&#151;if it was &#163;18,000&#151;how on earth would they afford a property that cost &#163;100,000?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o332"><a name="80403-0016.htm_para16"><a name="08040378000662">Alongside that is a case that has been discussed in this House on many occasions&#151;council housing. There should be support for councils so that they can have a level playing field with housing associations and other providers of social housing. The worry is how long social housing lasts. Is it up to the first buyer, or the second buyer? How long is shared equity? Is it for life? How do those who buy at shared equity levels ever move on? It is necessary to ring-fence social housing to ensure that affordable housing is always available. It is extremely difficult for people with an income averaging at about &#163;15,000, &#163;16,000 or &#163;17,000 to get a mortgage at the level of &#163;60,000, &#163;65,000 or &#163;70,000.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o333"><a name="80403-0016.htm_para17"><a name="08040378000663">I support wholeheartedly the scrutiny of MPs that has been initiated during the past few months with regard to how we operate, how we are paid and how we are paid expenses, but it should apply to all those paid by the public purse, including local councillors and MEPs. It should not stop at the House. I asked several local councillors and officers for whom they work, and the answer was invariably the same: the local authority. I asked again, &#147;Who do you work for?&#148; and they answered again, &#147;The local authority.&#148; Not once did anyone say that they work for the people, that they are paid from the public purse and that they are there on behalf of the people. There will always be times when they cannot deliver the people&#146;s expectations, but hiding is not the answer.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o334"><a name="80403-0016.htm_para18"><a name="08040378000664">We have heard about planning and house building. If land is in the ownership of the borough council, who owns it? When a borough council decides to sell off its land, surely it should ask the people. Around our community, there are fields and green areas owned by the borough council, but sold off for development with almost no consultation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o335"><a name="80403-0016.htm_para19"><a name="08040378000665">There is a huge difference between consultation and negotiation. If there is to be consultation, it should be meaningful. If there is no intention to listen and pay  <br>

heed to those consulted, it should not be done. The credibility of politics is a problem for all of us. Not listening to the people whom we represent is a cardinal sin. We may not like what comes back from the community, but we walk away from it at our peril. We are driving people away from the political process. When we have local consultation and the involvement of local people, they should drive the decisions. They should be involved at every opportunity, but we do not involve them; we isolate them at every opportunity in the hope that perhaps they will go away.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o336"><a name="80403-0016.htm_para20"><a name="08040378000666">The previous debate was about the drugs strategy. I intended to speak then, but I hoped to contribute to the current debate, so I left my comments until now. I pay tribute to the hon. Member for Bolton, South-East (Dr. Iddon) for his work on the all-party group on drugs misuse. Recently, we met a group of young people from all over the country to discuss the drugs strategy. The first thing on which they picked up was the lack of input from young people. There are few conversations with young people. They do not have to be with those who take drugs; they could be with those who would argue against that. We should ask for their input on what we should do to prevent young people from becoming addicts. Schools and education are huge topics, and time and again young people say, &#147;No one asks us. We are told what education we should receive, but we&#146;re not asked.&#148;</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o337"><a name="80403-0016.htm_para21"><a name="08040378000667">Let me consider inactivity. When the Government pledge funds to community facilities, I am sure that we all support that. The problem is how long the funding will last and whether it is short-term funding, with borough councils then saying that they cannot afford to help and support community centres and youth projects. It is no good funding something for six months, 12 months or two years. If we cannot fund according to need, there is no point in funding.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o338"><a name="80403-0016.htm_para22"><a name="08040378000668">We need to fund more youth workers and social services so that the contact with those who need them happens where the problems occur. I recently spoke to some of our police officers, who said that they were providing cover because there is no input from social services and not enough youth workers. We need to be proactive, not reactive. At the moment, we put pressure on our police forces to be reactive rather than putting permanent structures in place. Yes, that means money, but if it is well spent, it will pay dividends in future. I hope that the Government will listen to some of those arguments.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o340"><a name="80403-0016.htm_para24"><a name="08040378000671">There are 10 points that I wish to raise before the end of this April Adjournment debate. Because of the shortage of time I will rattle through them, but the deputy Leader of the House is very good at ensuring that I receive answers to my points in due course. My first point is about parliamentary questions&#151;a subject that was raised at business questions earlier. The Leader of the House gave an assurance that the practice of Departments referring hon. Members to websites would no longer be seen as satisfactory.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o341"><a name="80403-0016.htm_para25"><a name="08040378000672">The reason why I ask a lot of written questions is that I do not always receive answers to my original questions. To give the deputy Leader of the House just one example, last year I asked the Home Secretary about her meetings with Sir Ian Blair. I did not expect her to tell me the detail of every location and so on, but the process of answering that question has been tortuous, and at the end of it all I am still none the wiser. Some Departments are splendid and give good answers, but others are very tardy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o342"><a name="80403-0016.htm_para26"><a name="08040378000673">Now that my hon. Friend the Member for West Chelmsford (Mr. Burns) has returned to the Chamber, I want to congratulate him on his campaign to improve the A12 network, which, as an Essex MP, I know would certainly benefit my constituents.</p>

 I am grateful for my hon. Friend&#146;s generous comments, but it would be unfair of me to take all the credit for what is happening. Essex county council is doing tremendous work, as he knows, but I also pay tribute to the <i> Essex Chronicle</i>, my local paper, which, in the finest traditions of all local papers, has mounted a vigorous campaign to get action to redress the problems on that important road.</p>

 In the true modest style of an Essex Member of Parliament, my hon. Friend is not taking the credit for the campaign. I join him in congratulating his local newspaper on its campaign.</p>

There is a type of arthritis called&#151;I hope that I can pronounce this properly&#151;ankylosing spondylitis, which is a chronic degenerative arthritis of the joints that causes inflammation at the sites where ligaments and tendons attach to the bone. Ankylosing spondylitis is an incredibly painful type of arthritis that is quite difficult to treat and for which there is no known cure. However, there are treatments and medications available to reduce the symptoms and the pain.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o344"><a name="80403-0016.htm_para28"><a name="08040378000677">The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence recently undertook an evaluation of the latest treatments for adult patients with severe forms of the condition. After considering all the evidence, NICE recommended that the two most cost-effective treatments should be available to patients through the NHS. Those treatments can also be administered by the patient at home instead of in hospital, thereby enabling them to take control of their condition and medication. That is a good decision, supporting a modern NHS.</p>

this week, could lead to further delays before guidance is finally issued. I would therefore ask the deputy Leader of the House to have a word with the Minister of State, Department of Health, the right hon. Member for Bristol, South (Dawn Primarolo), to see whether something can be done to expedite matters.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o346"><a name="80403-0017.htm_para1"><a name="08040378000679">My third point concerns people using mobile phones while driving cars. My view on mobile phones was shared by the late and much lamented Eric Forth. I have asked the Department for Transport a series of questions about the number of prosecutions of people using mobile phones. The answer, from the Under-Secretary of State for Justice, the hon. Member for Liverpool, Garston (Maria Eagle), was very instructive. I am absolutely baffled by the disparity between regions. The legislation was introduced in December 2003, but in some areas no prosecutions or proceedings have ever been instituted, so the law is simply not being enforced throughout the UK. I have lost count of the times I have been stuck behind a lorry whose driver is obviously involved in an interesting phone call and showing no regard for other road users. This is a serious problem, and I hope that we can start to take it a little more seriously than we seem to at the moment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o347"><a name="80403-0017.htm_para2"><a name="08040378000680">Dr. Vini Khurana, an eminent neurosurgeon in Australia, has just produced an interesting paper stating that there is a direct causal link between people using mobile phones and the incidence of brain tumours. Once upon a time, Members used to present petitions about mobile phone masts and similar issues. That all seems to have gone very quiet at the moment, but it has certainly not gone quiet as far as I am concerned.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o348"><a name="80403-0017.htm_para3"><a name="08040378000681">I was honoured to be the only UK representative at the recent Taiwanese elections. Compared with what has been going on in Zimbabwe, it was a joy to go to Taiwan and to see people enthusiastically grasping the opportunity to vote in an election. The election was fought rigorously between the KMT and the ruling Democratic Progressive party, and the KMT won, receiving the largest percentage and number of votes in the history of Taiwan. I was also fortunate enough to meet the new President, Ma Ying-jeou, on the evening of his election. I was struck by his warmth and humanity, and by the clear vision that he had for the future of his country, given all the challenges of trying to work with China and of not becoming isolated.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o349"><a name="80403-0017.htm_para4"><a name="08040378000682">I hope that the Deputy Leader of the House will pass on my thanks to the Minister of State, Department for Transport, the right hon. Member for Doncaster, Central (Ms Winterton). In the Christmas Adjournment debate, I made a plea for money to help to tackle cliff slippage, and she listened to my plea. I was supported in my representations by my hon. Friend the Member for Rochford and Southend, East (James Duddridge), and we were delighted to receive the extra funding. It is being well used, but I am sure that the Deputy Leader of the House can guess what I am going to say next. Southend needs more money, because there is now further slippage closer to the town centre, so I hope that the hon. Lady will once again be able to work a charm offensive with her right hon. Friend.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o350"><a name="80403-0017.htm_para5"><a name="08040378000683">Another issue that hon. Members are trying to deal with at the moment is that of hospital parking charges. I remember clearly when those charges were first introduced. Labour Members who were then in opposition protested about them, but they are now widely accepted. My  <br>

hospital in Southend is land-locked; there is no room for it to expand. My constituency has a huge number of elderly people. They are not lazy; they need their cars to get to the rheumatology clinic, for example. The parking charges can range from &#163;2 to &#163;4, and that can soon mount up for people visiting a loved one with cancer, for example. The hospital is now building a multi-storey car park, but that is causing further difficulties. Will the Deputy Leader of the House have a word with her ministerial colleagues to see whether they have a view on this matter?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o351"><a name="80403-0017.htm_para6"><a name="08040378000684">Another issue that I have raised before in these Adjournment debates concerns a constituent named David Clark. Ten years ago he was working for Essex police as a police officer. He was forced to retire from his job on medical grounds, following bullying and harassment by senior officers. This is too complex a story to develop in just a minute, but it is all to do with whistleblowing. My constituent did a splendid job in his time with the police force. His maltreatment followed his managing an investigation into theft and stolen goods in 1997. He did the right thing and decided to pursue legal action against the chief constable of Essex in July 2006. In the recent High Court hearing, Mr. Justice Tugendhat ruled in my constituent&#146;s favour and, nine months on, in June 2007, he received &#163;93,000 in compensation from Essex police force in an out-of-court settlement. What is not acceptable is that the costs of the case&#151;&#163;35,000&#151;have still not been paid, which is putting my constituent under a huge amount of strain.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o352"><a name="80403-0017.htm_para7"><a name="08040378000685">During the High Court hearing, the judge condemned the detective sergeant involved as &#147;not capable of belief&#148;, and said that he could not be regarded as a &#147;candid witness&#148;. He made a number of criticisms of the organisation of the Essex police, which he said was in stark contrast to my constituent, whom he considered to be a &#147;careful and honest witness&#148;. Most frustrating of all, my constituent has tried over and over again to arrange a meeting with the chairman of Essex police authority, to absolutely no avail. I find that desperately disappointing.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o353"><a name="80403-0017.htm_para8"><a name="08040378000686">The hon. Member for Argyll and Bute (Mr. Reid) raised an issue involving his local driving test centre. My hon. Friend the Member for Rochford and Southend, East and I are confronting exactly the same issue, and we are very concerned about it. I will not be disloyal to my former constituency, Basildon. I will simply say that to relocate the entire test centre to Basildon will cause huge problems in Southend, because it means a journey of nearly 14 miles. I strongly support of the efforts of the Southend and District Driving Instructors Association to save the Southend centre.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o354"><a name="80403-0017.htm_para9"><a name="08040378000687">The penultimate issue that I wish to raise concerns Mr. and Mrs. Eeles, who came to my surgery recently. The couple, aged 71 and 76, took a one-day coach trip to Belgium to buy cheap tobacco. They acted within the law: they bought 3 kg. The customs officer stopped Mrs. Eeles and detained her&#151;an elderly person&#151;for two hours, confiscating her legal amount of tobacco. That was absolutely crazy. Mrs. Eeles is very upset, and I support her in all the representations that she is currently making.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o355"><a name="80403-0017.htm_para10"><a name="08040378000688">Finally, I want to say something about a young lady in my constituency called Felicia Cantone.

She had to have that horrific operation to prevent the spread of bone cancer&#151;a rare type of cancer called Ewing&#146;s sarcoma, which was first diagnosed when she was seven. She is an incredibly brave girl, and she returned to school in two days. Apparently, the operation increased her chance of survival from 20 per cent. to 40 per cent.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o356"><a name="80403-0017.htm_para11"><a name="08040378000689">The point that I want to make&#151;and I do not say this is a joke&#151;is that Felicia needs a prosthetic leg, and cannot obtain one from the national health service. I am baffled by the reasons for that, but there are all sorts of problems: for instance, she is very young and is growing quickly. The family are fundraising locally in order to send her to America. It is an extraordinary case. I hope that after I have written to the Deputy Leader of the House with more details, she will ask the Department of Health to consider it.</p>

First, I beg the indulgence of the House as I wish to return to the matter of post offices. It is often forgotten that a reduction in the urban network is also a major issue. Under the rather Orwellian-sounding urban reinvention programme, my constituency has lost six post offices in the last six years, reducing the total from 23 to 17, and we fear that when in July the proposals are put out for consultation across Cambridgeshire&#151;and Northamptonshire, I believe&#151;we may lose another six to eight just in the Peterborough constituency. I know that my hon. Friend the Member for North-West Cambridgeshire (Mr. Vara) is leading the campaign in his constituency against post office closures, and I pay tribute to Sir Peter Brown, the Cambridgeshire cabinet member for communities, who is co-ordinating all the local authorities and other key stakeholders in Cambridgeshire to put the case for keeping those post offices open.

Sadly, its manager, Georgina Butters, recently left because there is insufficient funding. Although it has had some money remitted via English Heritage, there is not sufficient funding to develop both the artefacts and the tourism and leisure side of the site. It would be a great shame if Flag Fen were to be left to close, and its great attractions were to be lost to Cambridgeshire and the country as a whole.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o362"><a name="80403-0017.htm_para17"><a name="08040378000696">Members will know of my consistent interest in the issue of the fortification of some foods with folic acid, which is mainly as a result of the fact that the Association for Spina Bifida and Hydrocephalus is located at Park road in Peterborough. There is an unanswerable case that folic acid helps to reduce massively, if not completely eliminate, neural tube defects and appalling disabilities such as spina bifida and hydrocephalus, which afflict hundreds of families a year and cause hundreds of elective terminations. That can be ameliorated if folic acid is introduced into women&#146;s diets before they become pregnant. Last year, the Food Standards Agency cleared the way in making that case, but unfortunately there has been a delay in respect of a ministerial recommendation. I hope Ministers will look very favourably on the huge weight of scientific evidence, because this is about people&#146;s lives&#151;it is about the quality of children&#146;s and families&#146; lives. It is time that we followed the lead of the United States and 32 other countries across the world, and embraced the fortification of some foods with folic acid.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o363"><a name="80403-0017.htm_para18"><a name="08040378000697">Another major health concern in my constituency is chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. In Peterborough, about 2,700 people suffer from the condition; it is the fifth biggest killer in the United Kingdom, and the people in my primary care trust area are 10 per cent more at risk of hospital admission than those elsewhere in the UK&#151;indeed, it is described as a COPD hot spot in the east of England. I was recently privileged to attend and speak at an event at the Thomas Walker medical centre in Huntly grove: a British Lung Foundation reception and launch for its &#147;Breathe Easy&#148; campaign. It is important that Government understand how important this issue is. We do not know why the condition particularly affects Peterborough. Long ago, Peterborough moved on from being a large industrial engineering city and a railway city, but agricultural materials are burnt in the area, and agriculture, food processing and packaging takes place across the area. The combination of those things might mean that our area is particularly afflicted by that condition, and, indeed, by asthma, which is also a significant problem. The last figures showed that my local Peterborough primary care trust was ranked 32nd highest for asthma admissions out of 300 trusts nationwide.</p>

It is a badge of dishonour that my constituency and the city of Peterborough is the teenage pregnancy capital of the east of England, and that, regrettably, the trend in my area is either stable or rising, rather than reducing, as it is in so many other parts of both the east of England and the country as a whole. That is particularly the case given that some 43 per cent. of the 190 young women  <br>

between the ages of 15 and 17 who fell pregnant in 2006 in my area chose to have an elective abortion&#151;that is a tragedy and social catastrophe. We must do more. We must not just repeat the mantra of sex education and more access to contraception. Although it may be unfashionable, there must be a moral aspect to this issue, and girls and young women should be given different paths to go along. This is not just about sex education.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o365"><a name="80403-0017.htm_para20"><a name="08040378000699">The main substance of my remarks will not be about that issue, but about the report produced earlier this week by the House of Lords Select Committee on Economic Affairs entitled &#147;The Economic Impact of Immigration&#148;. It is timely that we debate that report, albeit during the debate on the April adjournment. I hope that Ministers will find Government time in the next Session to debate the issue, because I believe that unfettered, unrestricted and uncontrolled immigration has, in many respects, been a social disaster for this country in terms of social cohesion, community relations and the economic situation in many towns and cities, particularly in the east of England.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o366"><a name="80403-0017.htm_para21"><a name="08040378000700">Immigration has had a massive impact in a small number of areas, not only Peterborough, but Breckland, King&#146;s Lynn, Boston and other parts of both the east of England and the rest of the country. It has had a big impact on the delivery of housing and health services&#151;indeed, I was advised only today of a big increase in tuberculosis in the Peterborough city council area. That is just one of the side effects of large-scale, unfettered immigration. It also has an impact in respect of policing, the issue of people trafficking and the sex trade, adult social care and, in particular, education.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o367"><a name="80403-0017.htm_para22"><a name="08040378000701">The issue that I would like to discuss most is the entrenching of welfare dependency, particularly in the host community. Who would have believed that a Labour Government would have allowed such uncontrolled immigration as to leave us nationally with a situation where 5.2 million people are on benefits, where we have to recruit low-skill, low-wage people to do jobs that our own people should be doing and where we tolerate slum housing, low wages and poor working conditions because we are told spuriously the Government&#146;s bogus argument, advanced by the Minister for Borders and Immigration, the Home Secretary and others, that immigration has produced benefits to the value of &#163;6 billion a year? That argument has been conclusively demolished by the report produced earlier this week. I feel vindicated by that cross-party report, which has been produced by experts and has rubbished the Government&#146;s campaign of misinformation on unprecedented and uncontrolled immigration. Sadly, it is five years too late. I feel that I have ploughed a lonely furrow on this issue. If one ever mentioned the subject hitherto, one was inevitably accused of racism even though it is incumbent on every Member to judge the situation in their constituency and to speak up for their constituents, irrespective of their race, religion, creed or colour. I have done that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o368"><a name="80403-0017.htm_para23"><a name="08040378000702">I have never taken the view that immigration per se is a bad thing&#151;I believe that controlled immigration is a good thing. Such massive economic and social change has come at a high price, with a massive strain on community resources, the delivery of public services, resentment between communities irrespective of racial group and, in particular, the embedding of a low-wage, low-skill economy and the pricing out of many people onto jobseeker&#146;s allowance and other benefits.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o369"><a name="80403-0017.htm_para24"><a name="08040378000703">If we consider the situation in Peterborough over the past few years, we see that the number of those on active jobseeker&#146;s allowance rose from 1,640 to 2,280 between 2001 and 2007. The median gross weekly rate wages have declined from &#163;447.10 to &#163;421.90 over the past two years. The number of NEETs&#151;those not in employment, education or training&#151;has risen. In fact, there was no change overall in the five years between 2002 and 2007. Some 4,500 people in Peterborough have been on benefits for more than five years.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o370"><a name="80403-0017.htm_para25"><a name="08040378000704">Did no one think that this would happen? When the Government told us that between 8,000 and 15,000 people would come from the European Union countries in 2004, did they consider what the impact would be on a constituency such as mine? In my constituency, 49 per cent. of pupils achieve five GCSE grades from A to E, the lowest in the east of England. We have the third lowest proportion of adults with degree-level qualifications and the third highest with no qualifications. We have 10 super output areas of the most deprived 5 per cent. of the region. One in 14 of my constituents is on incapacity benefit and 24 per cent. of jobseeker&#146;s allowance claimants are in the 16 to 24 age group. Self-employment levels are low and the resident earning figures reduced over the past few years.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o371"><a name="80403-0017.htm_para26"><a name="08040378000705">We were told that mass immigration was a panacea, and the Government told us that it was a &#147;good thing&#148;. There was no proper methodology or analysis and no economic study was undertaken to see the impact on a low-skilled, low-waged, low-educational attainment constituency such as mine, which is moving from a heavy industry, railway-focused economy to a more service-based economy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o372"><a name="80403-0017.htm_para27"><a name="08040378000706">It could be said that Peterborough is the victim of its geographical circumstances. It is on the A1 and the A47. It is a transport hub and naturally the sort of place where businesses would consider developing the service industry, the food processing and packaging industry, transportation and logistics. It is at the centre of a rural area near south Lincolnshire, Northamptonshire and the rest of Cambridgeshire. However, no thought was given to the impact of 20,000 EU migrants coming to the city and what would happen to primary care, primary schools, transportation, policing and other services.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o373"><a name="80403-0017.htm_para28"><a name="08040378000707">It has been lonely to put this case. It has not always been fashionable to make the arguments that I have made today. I have held two Adjournment debates on the subject over the past two years, one last June and one the year before that. I feel vindicated by the report. I feel that I have done my duty to my constituents. I welcome those who want to make a better life for themselves and their families and contribute to my community, but the Government have failed dismally in their responsibility to have regard to social and community cohesion, a good balance and proper controlled migration. When I talk to my constituents I find that when the election comes, this Government will be driven from office.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o374"><a name="80403-0018.htm_para0"><a name="08040378000709">First, I want to raise some issues affecting my constituency that have the common theme of housing. My hon. Friend the Member for Southend, West (Mr. Amess), who was hoping that I would launch straight into cannabis, in which case he would have stayed, now knows that he is free to depart, unless he wants to stay for quite a long time.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o375"><a name="80403-0018.htm_para1"><a name="08040378000710">I turn first to the provision of accommodation for Travellers and Gypsies in my constituency. Like everybody else, they need homes, and we have to provide accommodation for them somewhere in the eastern area. Following the lead of my hon. Friend the Member for St. Albans (Anne Main), I raised the matter in a debate in the House, and I wish to return to it because we did not get a satisfactory answer about two things from the Minister who responded. The first was why such a high rate of growth of the population of Travellers in the eastern areas is assumed. Why is it assumed that the Traveller population is increasing more rapidly than the population of Africa, which has the highest growth rate otherwise known in the world? Why is such a large growth rate built into demands for provision that are being imposed on local authorities?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o376"><a name="80403-0018.htm_para2"><a name="08040378000711">Secondly, we want to know the rationale behind the policy of requiring the local authorities that already have the highest number of sites for Travellers to provide the highest number of additional sites. People in the part of my constituency that falls within the St. Albans area are particularly incensed, because St. Albans already has by far the largest number of sites for Travellers in Hertfordshire, yet it is being required to provide nearly twice as many as most other local authorities, and the highest number in Hertfordshire. Surely that is not fair. I hope that the Government will require the Government office for the east of England to think again and advise the East of England regional assembly likewise that it should not follow such a policy. It puts a blight on my constituency, because so many sites have to be considered. The sooner the whole matter is resolved, the better it will be for everybody, Travellers and settled population alike.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o377"><a name="80403-0018.htm_para3"><a name="08040378000712">The settled population&#151;the vast majority of our constituents&#151;also need homes. In Hertfordshire, we have in the past met the targets for building new homes for the existing population, and we have done so without building on the green belt in my constituency. That is becoming increasingly difficult, because the targets imposed on us have been raised, raised and raised again.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o378"><a name="80403-0018.htm_para4"><a name="08040378000713">North Hertfordshire district council now has to provide an additional 15,000 homes. The Government have already given permission for the building of an initial 3,600 homes west of Stevenage&#151;the largest incursion on the green belt that has ever been known&#151;yet that additional demand has been put upon us. My constituents are worried, because in seeking sites for that large number of homes, the local authority has to consider an even larger number of potential options. So, large areas of the constituency are being examined as potential areas although&#151;thank heavens!&#151;not all will be selected to meet that target.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o379"><a name="80403-0018.htm_para5"><a name="08040378000714">That problem has caused concern, disturbance, anger and resentment, but those emotions are nothing compared with the outrage that has greeted the discovery&#151;the exposure&#151;that officials from the Department for  <br>

Communities and Local Government have had meetings with their counterparts in Luton borough council, South Bedfordshire district council and Bedfordshire council, as well as with representatives of the developers, Blore Homes, to consider building homes in the North Hertfordshire district council area of my constituency. Moreover, they met without informing or inviting officials or councillors from North Hertfordshire district council or Hertfordshire county council, and they did not let me know that the meetings were taking place.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o380"><a name="80403-0018.htm_para6"><a name="08040378000715">In other words, the DCLG considers that it can meet its targets by building in our district, on the beautiful stretch of land between Luton and the ill-named but extremely lovely part of my constituency known as Lilley Bottom. That name has nothing to do with me, although it may possibly have something to do with my ancestors. I wrote to the Minister for Housing a couple of weeks ago, as soon as I learned what had been going on. I wanted to know why Government officials had met developers and local authority staff to consider building in my constituency without letting my local authority or me know. So far, I have had no reply.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o381"><a name="80403-0018.htm_para7"><a name="08040378000716">The Deputy Leader of the House will respond to the debate. Although she will probably not be able to explain why I have received no reply, or give me the answer that I need, I hope that she will make sure&#151;post haste&#151;that her colleague replies to me. The anger in my constituency will only be compounded if Ministers fail to tell us about what is going on, or to apologise for what has gone on so far.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o382"><a name="80403-0018.htm_para8"><a name="08040378000717">Why do so many homes need to be built? Why have the targets been raised? Sixty per cent. of the additional homes that we need are simply the result of the existing population living in smaller households. That happens because people are leaving home earlier and living longer, and also&#151;sadly&#151;because families split up. The average household size declines each year, with the result that a county such as Hertfordshire&#151;or anywhere else&#151;needs roughly 0.5 per cent. more houses each year. That accounts for the 60 per cent. of additional homes to which I have referred. However, those additional homes will require little extra infrastructure. We will not need more schools or hospitals, and probably no more roads, electricity or water. We need that extra infrastructure only when there is an increase in total population, and that is exactly what is happening in this country.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o383"><a name="80403-0018.htm_para9"><a name="08040378000718">The excellent report from the House of Lords Economic Affairs Committee highlighted the fact that net immigration into this country is causing a substantial increase in population. Based on the Government Actuary&#146;s projection, I calculate that our net population will increase by 190,000 a year through net immigration&#151;and, of course, we must not forget those people&#146;s offspring. Indeed, nearly 40 per cent. of the new households that we need in this country will be the result of the policy of allowing immigration to exceed by so much the number of people returning home or emigrating.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o384"><a name="80403-0018.htm_para10"><a name="08040378000719">The Economic Affairs Committee report also said that two thirds of the new households in Greater London are the result of net immigration. Although there is remarkably little direct immigration into Hertfordshire, we see its consequences. People of all ethnicities move out of London into the county and, individually, they are welcomed&#151;after all, many of the people in Hertfordshire came from London originally. However, the net inflow into London has also produced a huge  <br>

<p><a name="stpa_o385"><a name="80403-0018.htm_para11"><a name="08040378000720">We have had 17 statements about housing demand and supply in the 25 years that I have been a Member of Parliament&#151;no, 17 statements in the 10 years that the Government have been in power&#151;not one of which has mentioned net immigration as a cause of the extra demand and the need for extra supply. So, the Government have been trying to obscure what is going on.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o386"><a name="80403-0018.htm_para12"><a name="08040378000721">Personally, I have always taken the view that most immigrants are not, as they are often caricatured, scroungers, criminals or welfare-dependent. They are hard-working, law-abiding, decent people who want to come to this country to work hard for the benefit of themselves and their families and to make a contribution to society, but they need homes. It would be monstrous to allow people to come to this country and then not to provide the additional homes that they will need in due course. I want to highlight the hypocrisy of parties that encourage immigration and oppose restrictions on immigration but then campaign against the need to build additional houses whenever and wherever it occurs. I hope that the hon. Member for North Southwark and Bermondsey (Simon Hughes) is listening to my remarks, because he has said in the past that one way in which he diverges from me and cannot understand me is on my desire to place a restriction on immigration to this country.</p>

Friend the Member for Peterborough said that his had been a lone voice in highlighting the issue&#151;not quite alone, because I have been doing so for some while. In 2005, I published a pamphlet called &#147;Too Much of a Good Thing? Towards a balanced approach to immigration&#148;. Instantly, of course, Liberal and Labour opponents declared that I must be a racist, because I was discussing immigration. They were laughed out of court, because people in my constituency know that I have spent the past 25 years working extremely hard with the Bangladeshi, Pakistani and Sikh communities to integrate them into the broader community. So that attempt to silence me did not work and probably rebounded on those opponents, as was shown in the subsequent election result.</p>

to take given this country&#146;s size. Secondly, I was a dissenter in my own party when the view was taken that we should have no delay in the new east European entrants being allowed in immediately. I took the view that we should do as the French and others did, which was to have a gradual process, which was eventually done for Bulgaria and Romania. Thirdly, I am certainly always willing to engage with colleagues from any party, if they believe that they cannot have extra house building in their own communities when the population nationally is going up. I spend a lot of my time telling my own colleagues as well as others that everywhere must take its fair share of additional housing and the additional number of people who come to this country.</p>

First, they revert to asserting, &#147;But still net immigration contributes &#163;6 billion a year to the economy.&#148; They are using a half-truth in a way that would be monstrous if they were to use the other half. It is true that immigrants contribute an extra &#163;6 billion in goods and services to the gross domestic product, but it is equally true that they consume &#163;6 billion in goods and services from GDP. It would be monstrous if anyone said therefore that immigrants are a net burden of &#163;6 billion on the economy, but that could be done with as much veracity as Ministers saying that immigrants are making a net contribution of &#163;6 billion. Immigrants produce &#163;6 billion, and they consume &#163;6 billion. Most of us roughly consume as much as we produce. Indeed, the nature of Government statistics means that they automatically produce as much as they consume.</p>

 Does my right hon. Friend agree that it is strange that in the week when the 10p tax rate was abolished&#151;a change that will affect 5.2 million people who earn between &#163;5,000 and &#163;18,000&#151;the Lords report found that it is the low-skilled, low-wage work force who, under a Labour Government, will be most disadvantaged by the policy of uncontrolled and unfettered immigration?</p>

 It is, and that is an indictment of those who have tried to pretend that that is not happening. The Lords Committee made the important point that if we try to meet so-called labour shortages&#151;skills shortages&#151;by importing skills from abroad rather than by skilling-up our own people and rewarding those who acquire those skills, we will permanently keep an unskilled, low-paid element of our population. That is one of the most malign consequences of the policy that the Government have been pursuing for the past 10 years&#151;a policy that I hope they will bring to an end as a consequence of the report.</p>

those who come here as students and relatives of people who live here would not be covered by it,&#148; but exactly the same is true of their points-based system, which they flaunt as though it will be the solution to high levels of immigration. They cannot have it both ways. The truth is that we should return to the situation that we were in before the Government were elected, when we had much firmer control and restrictions on immigration, and allowed people to come and settle here only if they were genuinely needed&#151;the aim was not that they should effectively replace the existing population.</p>

Members in this debate and in the previous debate&#151;the issue of drink and drugs. As was emphasised by a constituent who recently came to my surgery, too often we put too little emphasis on the problems of drink, relative to the problems of drugs. My constituent has benefited from the care provided by Hertscare, a local anti-addiction organisation to which she paid tribute, and I join her in paying that tribute. She felt that it was not given enough resources to cope with those who suffer from alcoholism, as compared with those who suffer from drug addiction. It is important that we get the balance right, because overall the damage done by addiction to alcohol is at least as great, if not greater, than that done by drugs.</p>

One aspect of it concerned the response to rumours that the Government&#146;s Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs is to reject the Prime Minister&#146;s suggestion that the cannabis classification be upgraded again&#151;it was downgraded at the request of his predecessor on the advice of that body. As far as I know, I am the only Member of the House who has served as a Front Bencher, both in government and in opposition, who has never taken cannabis and has no desire to take cannabis&#151;</p>

 Sorry; shall we say the only Cabinet-level Member who has not taken cannabis? It seems particularly true of Cabinet Ministers that they find themselves forced to admit that they have tried cannabis. I have not taken it, and as a result I have a clear enough head to know that one cannot enforce or defend a policy of banning cannabis in a country where we allow nicotine and alcohol. It simply does not work, has not worked and will not work.</p>

All too often, we push people into the arms of those who persuade them to move on to heroin and cocaine. In that pamphlet, I put forward the highly unpopular policy that we should not simply de-penalise the sale of cannabis, but legalise it in a controlled fashion.</p>

Blairite response that achieved the worst of all possible worlds. It was an attempt to manipulate the headlines to make it appear that he was doing something that would appease his Back Benchers who wanted a more liberal policy, without in fact altering the law in any significant way. It sent out the signal that cannabis use was tolerated, while leaving it against the law and allowing no method of getting it except from gangs who also push hard drugs.</p>

These things are second order and not important. What we need is fact-based, evidence-based realism on the issue of drugs, and that we clearly will not get from the present Prime Minister, any more than we did from his predecessor.</p>

 I share the right hon. Gentleman&#146;s view. I have always taken the view that if one sets up such an eminent body to advise, there must be a mighty good reason for not accepting its advice. Our system should presume that the advisory council&#146;s recommendation would have effect unless Parliament consciously votes to overturn it. If the Government could step away from that, we would have a much better debate and outcome.</p>

 That is a valid point, although I would not go that far. We should not hand over and put out to commission the powers of the House. If the advisory council offers advice, we should consider it. It may be good advice or bad advice, but I always took the view that Ministers are responsible for the advice that they take and should never blame their advisers. The House is responsible for the advice that it takes and should not leave it entirely to its advisers, but it should listen to the advice before it rules out taking it or commits itself to taking it.</p>

For a year or two after the Labour Government came to power, we were told that that was going according to budget and plan, but then they suddenly announced that it was not, cancelled it, pocketed what they thought was the saving and found themselves going down exactly the route that I predicted.

However, we ought to put the blame where it is due, which is on Ministers who adopted the policy against the advice of their officials. I have constantly asked Ministers to acknowledge that they were told that that would be the consequence, but they have refused either to admit it or to deny it&#151;I am sure that they would have denied it, if they had been able to.

Indeed, according to all the opinion polls, it is now considered among the most important issues by our constituents, for the obvious reason that they can see what is going on and do not need the Lords report to point it out in the way in which we experts do. I wish you, Mr. Deputy Speaker, a very happy recess.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o402"><a name="80403-0019.htm_para0"><a name="08040378000754">The hon. Member for Telford (David Wright) began proceedings with a detailed speech. The House will share his concerns about the fact that many blind people do not have access to television, despite the fact that technological advances mean that they can partake of it. I have to say that the arguments he made in attempting to claim that he did not really vote for post office closures when we all know that he did were disingenuous to say the least.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o403"><a name="80403-0019.htm_para1"><a name="08040378000755">The point was aptly made by my hon. Friend the Member for Peterborough (Mr. Jackson) when he said that such behaviour contributes to the cynicism about all those who work here and does not help our cause in trying to establish that we are a reputable profession and people who are trying to do the best for their constituents. My hon. Friend the Member for West Chelmsford (Mr. Burns) rightly pointed out that the fact that the hon. Member for Telford happens to be Parliamentary Private Secretary to the Financial Secretary to the Treasury may have had something to do with his about-turn, by which I suspect his constituents will not be convinced.</p>

Member for North Southwark and Bermondsey (Simon Hughes) spent the first seven minutes of his speech talking about matters to do with the fact that the recess does not match the school holidays. He seemed to be under the impression that the debate was a continuation of this morning&#146;s business questions. I have to take issue with his point about long summer holidays. He may be taking a long summer holiday between July and October, but the majority of his colleagues in the House will be doing constituency work. I have sympathy with Mehdi Kazemi, the Iranian gentleman whom he mentioned, and I hope very much that the Deputy Leader of the House will have taken on board the concerns that were raised.</p>

Member for Norwich, North (Dr. Gibson) said that this debate was an opportunity for Members of Parliament to speak about constituency matters and get things off their chest, and for his sake I hope that he was able to do both those things and that he feels a lot better for it. He touched on the issue of Iraq, and I hope again that those points were noted, and he also spoke of the funding for a walk-in medical centre in his constituency, arguments that were well put, and I am sure that his constituents will feel well served by him in today&#146;s debate.</p>

Friend the Member for West Chelmsford (Mr. Burns) gave a typically forceful speech, and I have every sympathy with his arguments on Chelmsford Crown post office. He rightly put into perspective the difficulties now experienced by people who visit the post office compared with when it was in a stand-alone building. He said that that was unacceptable, and I agree and wish him well in trying to resolve the difficulty that his constituents face. I also agree that the Government should review their road-funding programme.</p>

Her constituents will have noted that she has aired their concerns about the inconsistencies in bus travel passes, and I am sure that they will be grateful to her for having put on the record the blip in the historical records of the connection between Immingham and the Pilgrim Fathers.</p>

At this point, I should say that we need more role models, such as Charlotte Edwards, the captain of the England ladies&#146; cricket team.

We cannot fail to have noticed his observation that the police have to double up to do social work. Their position is not in any way assisted by the fact that they also have mountains and mountains of paperwork to add to their workload.</p>

I suspect like many Members, I agree entirely with him that the answers that Ministers provide are often very inadequate and that there is a discrepancy between different Departments in respect of the efficiency with which questions are answered. Many of us share that concern. The House will have been staggered by the revelation that Felicia Cantone, the brave 10-year-old girl in his constituency, cannot get a prosthetic leg because she is deemed to be too young.</p>

Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform the request to share information about individual post offices and their commercial strategies, along with all hon. Members&#146; remarks, which we will submit to the Minister responsible.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o421"><a name="80403-0019.htm_para19"><a name="08040378000778">My hon. Friend the Member for Telford spoke about audio-description in his excellent speech. I do not know whether he is aware that the Communications Act 2003 sets minimum targets for audio-description, and it is the responsibility of Ofcom to ensure that they are met. He also spoke about Ironbridge, the world heritage site. I can remember visiting that as a child and seeing a coracle, which only goes to show that I am much older than he is. I understand that the Department for Culture, Media and Sport and regional Ministers have set up a group that is looking into how to protect Ironbridge. He also spoke about manufacturing in the west midlands and the importance of inward investment in creating new jobs.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o422"><a name="80403-0019.htm_para20"><a name="08040378000779">The hon. Member for North Southwark and Bermondsey rightly spoke about the importance of the timing of recesses. I will undertake to update the work that we have done on that by reviewing which local authorities hon. Members send their children to school in so that next year we can take that into account when we set the timetable.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o423"><a name="80403-0019.htm_para21"><a name="08040378000780">The hon. Gentleman spoke about an important site in his constituency and the importance of getting a sensitive development there. He went on to talk about the case of Mr. Mehdi Kazemi, an Iranian. I do not know whether the hon. Gentleman is aware of this, but the Home Secretary has agreed that that case should be considered in the light of representations that were made by the House of Lords, because every case must of course be considered on its individual merits, and people&#146;s human rights must be taken into account when decisions are taken. That is the policy that the Home Office follows. The hon. Gentleman also talked about electoral under-registration, which is, as he knows, very significant. I will forward those remarks to the Ministry of Justice.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o424"><a name="80403-0019.htm_para22"><a name="08040378000781">My hon. Friend the Member for Norwich, North (Dr. Gibson) spoke about the costs of the Iraq war. He cited an extraordinary figure, which I have checked. The Government estimate that by the end of 2006-07 the conflict will in fact have cost the British taxpayer some &#163;5.5 billion, which is considerably below his figure. He raised the reasonable point that we should have more discussion before sums of money are committed to. I know that the Public Accounts Committee and the Treasury have discussed improving the scrutiny of estimates. In addition, next year we will have a debate when the spending announcement is made in recognition of the significance of this issue. My hon. Friend also talked about the decisions of Norfolk primary care trust with regard to walk-in services, and I hope that he will take part in that consultation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o425"><a name="80403-0019.htm_para23"><a name="08040378000782">The hon. Member for West Chelmsford spoke about the A12. I understand that the Highways Agency is aware of the issues and is trying to manage the traffic flows better through electronic messaging and so forth. I realise that his request was for more investment, and I will pass that message on to the Department for Transport. However, I would like to defend the allocation of funding around the regions and remind him that grants are made in the light of circumstances, not politics.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o426"><a name="80403-0019.htm_para24"><a name="08040378000783">My hon. Friend the Member for Cleethorpes (Shona McIsaac) proved what a hard-working Member she is by coming in to make a speech on her birthday, and I would like to join others in congratulating her on that, as well as congratulating the people of Immingham on the 400th anniversary of the Pilgrim Fathers. I would also like to congratulate North Lincolnshire council on its excellent implementation of the bus pass extension. What sounded particularly good about its scheme was the flexibility involving trains.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o427"><a name="80403-0019.htm_para25"><a name="08040378000784">The hon. Member for Uxbridge raised a number of issues, including the size of the Marine Bill. The Bill is as large as it is because it includes a plain English version so that more people will be able to read and understand it more easily. He spoke about his daughter, who is a very good rugby player. The Government take the issue of women&#146;s and girls&#146; participation in sport seriously, which is why Kelly Holmes is the national school sport champion; she also chairs something called the GirlsActive service.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o428"><a name="80403-0019.htm_para26"><a name="08040378000785">The hon. and learned Member for Torridge and West Devon spoke about the serious problems faced by his hill farmers and of the coastal erosion of the Burrows. I would remind him that spending on coastal erosion has doubled, and by 2010 it will be &#163;800 million. He made a wide-ranging speech, which I felt in the end became a rural version of Monty Python&#146;s &#147;I lived in a shoebox&#148; sketch. I found that I could not reconcile the number and severity of the problems that he raised with my picture of Bideford, which I know to be an exceptionally beautiful place where my parents-in-law met. I would also remind him that the decision on bovine tuberculosis is one that will be taken in the light of scientific, not sentimental interests.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o429"><a name="80403-0019.htm_para27"><a name="08040378000786">The hon. Member for Argyll and Bute spoke about the problems his constituents have in taking motorcycling tests. His constituents have an exceptionally long journey to take, and I understand that that is a problem for them. I will take his concerns to the Department for Transport, although I am sure that he will understand that in rural areas and in western Scotland, access will not be as close as it is for those in large cities. He asked about the delay in the shipbuilding contract, and I refer him to a parliamentary answer given in the Lords last week, which explained that the main manufacturing contract for the aircraft carriers will be made when the commercial arrangements and the work schedule have been completed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o430"><a name="80403-0019.htm_para28"><a name="08040378000787">The hon. Member for Blaenau Gwent (Mr. Davies) spoke about his constituency. The hon. Member for Southend, West (Mr. Amess) is to be congratulated on having made the most efficient speech of the afternoon, raising 14 issues in 10 minutes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o431"><a name="80403-0019.htm_para29"><a name="08040378000788">The hon. Member for Peterborough (Mr. Jackson) and the right hon. Member for Hitchin and Harpenden (Mr. Lilley) talked about immigration. I would like to point out that this Government&#146;s policy is not to have uncontrolled immigration, which is why we are introducing a points-based system. We are also investing in skills and training for people in this country so that they can benefit from economic opportunities. All those policies on increasing participation in higher education and increasing the number of apprenticeships were opposed by Conservative Members.</p>

Millions of people choose to bring about social change and to solve the problems we face through the third sector. In every part of our society, voluntary organisations, community groups and social enterprises are making people&#146;s lives better, are fighting inequality and are creating a better environment for us to live in.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o442"><a name="80403-0020.htm_para5"><a name="08040378000803">If the Minister thinks that that is an uncharacteristically grandiloquent opening statement for one of my speeches in the House, the reason is that I did not write it. It is the statement that the Prime Minister made in his foreword to the Cabinet Office report on the future role of the third sector in social and economic regeneration. Not for the first time, he was absolutely correct to identify the fact that week in, week out, day in, day out, the British people&#151;often quietly and often on their own&#151;work to bring about social change and improve the lot of their fellow citizens and others around the globe.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o443"><a name="80403-0020.htm_para6"><a name="08040378000804">I congratulate my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary and other colleagues in the Cabinet Office on their extraordinary engagement and on the Government&#146;s commitment to developing the third sector, not least through the &#163;500 million that they are investing in it in the current comprehensive spending review round. However, I am not here simply to congratulate the Government; I am here to ask the Minister to consider one way in which we might be able to help the charities in our country to make an even stronger impact on social change than they do now.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o444"><a name="80403-0020.htm_para7"><a name="08040378000805">At the end of December last year, there were 190,541 charities on the Charity Commission register. Of those, 21,244 were subsidiaries or constituents of other charities. That means that there were 169,299 main charities on the register, which are required to prepare accounts. That figure includes 2,498 group charities, which are separate charities that nevertheless share the same registered number, because they have been grouped together for ease of administration.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o445"><a name="80403-0020.htm_para8"><a name="08040378000806">When the income of those charities is broken down and itemised against the individual charities, a remarkable pattern emerges. Many of those 169,299 so-called main charities are very small indeed. Indeed, one fifth of them&#151;more than 35,000 charities&#151;have an income of less than &#163;1,000 a year. Nearly 60 per cent. of all registered charities in the UK have an income of less than &#163;10,000 a year. More than 95,000 charities&#151;almost 60 per cent.&#151;have a combined income of less than 1 per cent. of the total charitable income each year.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o446"><a name="80403-0020.htm_para9"><a name="08040378000807">The financial wealth of registered charities, measured by their annual incomes, is concentrated in a few very large charities indeed. Just 8 per cent. of charities receive more than 90 per cent. of the total annual income recorded on the Charity Commission register. Perhaps most extraordinarily of all, out of the 169,299 main charities, a tiny minority&#151;just 679&#151;attract more than 50 per cent. of the total income, so that &#163;22.4 billion goes to 0.4 per cent. of all charities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o447"><a name="80403-0020.htm_para10"><a name="08040378000808">I want to make it clear that I am in no way speaking against big charities. They do wonderful work, and I  <br>

applaud their professionalism and success. I want to focus on the logical implications for the 92 per cent. of charities that operate on only 10 per cent. of the total income. That 92 per cent. represents 142,367 charities, all of which seek and apply for funds, accrue administration and funding costs, and have staff and trustees who are passionate about and devoted to their cause&#151;yet those charities often compete with others in their field, rather than collaborating with each other.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o448"><a name="80403-0020.htm_para11"><a name="08040378000809">I do not want to stop any charity, or any person in any charity, doing their bit to make a world a better place by alleviating suffering, promoting education, finding a cure for disease, protecting animals, cleaning up the environment or reducing poverty. However, I hope that the Minister agrees that there must be a more efficient and effective way of harnessing all the incredible human resources, commitment and good will that those 142,367 organisations represent.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o449"><a name="80403-0020.htm_para12"><a name="08040378000810">The question presents itself: how much more effective could those charities be if there were an easier, cost-effective, integrated and secure way of generating a steady revenue stream into their good causes? What if they did not have to rely on the jumble sale, the bucket collection, the Christmas raffle or the fun run as their main fundraising event of the year?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o450"><a name="80403-0020.htm_para13"><a name="08040378000811">Charitable fundraising in the UK has developed enormously in the past decade or so. It is now possible to donate to television appeals such as Sport Relief or Children in Need by giving credit card details over the phone. It is possible to donate over the internet, or even by downloading a British Legion poppy as the background image for one&#146;s mobile phone. All of that is tremendous. Ease of giving is one of the most important elements of charitable giving.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o451"><a name="80403-0020.htm_para14"><a name="08040378000812">Just as important, however, is the research that shows that people prefer to donate to the charities that have the lowest cost overheads. The CharityFacts website, set up by Professor Adrian Sargeant at the Bristol business school, states that, in general, it costs between 15p and 25p to raise &#163;1. The average gearing is 1:5, with 20 per cent. of income spent on fundraising. That increases slightly with face-to-face collections, to between 20 and 25 per cent., whereas text message donations give almost as much money to the mobile phone company as to the good cause.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o452"><a name="80403-0020.htm_para15"><a name="08040378000813">According to research carried out by the university of London, the reason why collection tins continue to be one of the most popular ways for the public to give money is that such giving is spontaneous. In fact, spontaneous giving accounts for 83 per cent. of giving in this country. Planned donations account for just 17 per cent. Here, we begin to see a recipe: low overheads, quick and easy, and spontaneous. Convenience and immediacy are key drivers. How can we turn that formula into a means of resolving the issues that beset the 142,367 charities, all with administrative and fundraising costs, that are competing with one another?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o453"><a name="80403-0020.htm_para16"><a name="08040378000814">Let us imagine a situation in which, whenever anyone in the UK purchased anything in a supermarket, a petrol station, a clothes shop or any retail outlet where they could pay by credit card, they had the opportunity to round up the cost of their purchase to the nearest whole pound. Let us imagine that, instead of purchasing a camera for &#163;69.99, they could send the extra penny to bring water to an African village or to campaign for human rights in Burma. Which one of us would not do  <br>

that? Pennies4Change is a new charity that has set up a mechanism for precisely such fundraising. It is efficient and convenient, with low overheads. It is quick, easy and spontaneous. With luck, it might also be habit-forming.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o454"><a name="80403-0020.htm_para17"><a name="08040378000815">Pennies4Change integrates seamlessly into the global financial payments system. On the card reader at the payment terminal, the customer will be discreetly invited to round up their transaction. One touch of the green button will round it up to the nearest pound. One touch of the red button will decline. If neither button is pressed within a couple of seconds, the default cuts in to decline and no donation is made, ensuring that there are no lengthy queues at the till. No new card is required, and the consumer does not need to sign up to anything. No staff intervention is needed. It simply involves a spontaneous choice with each purchase.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o455"><a name="80403-0020.htm_para18"><a name="08040378000816">For the retailer, too, the process is straightforward. No new hardware is required, just a small change to the software running alongside the existing payments chip and pin system, all co-ordinated through the card-acquiring bank. The innovative technology that makes Pennies4Change possible applies just as much to the local corner shop as to the large supermarket chains.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o456"><a name="80403-0020.htm_para19"><a name="08040378000817">Equally, the shared platform for all those retailers requires the collaborative effort of the acquiring banks. Pennies4Change gives the banks an opportunity to be seen to work together to enable the generosity of the British people to be released. It will drive down that 20 per cent. average overhead of charitable fundraising, increasing the effectiveness of charities, and it aims to improve their efficiency by promoting co-ordination and partnership.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o457"><a name="80403-0020.htm_para20"><a name="08040378000818">What, then, am I asking of my hon. Friend the Minister? First, I hope that he will wish to congratulate Pennies4Change on bringing charitable giving into the electronic age. Secondly&#151;in the light of my points about income and gearing&#151;I ask him to arrange for his officials, as part of their work on the third sector, to investigate how Government can help these charities  to achieve their aims. I suggest that he ask his officials to meet members of Pennies4Change, who have already done much work in this area.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o458"><a name="80403-0020.htm_para21"><a name="08040378000819">Finally, I ask the Minister to recognise that the greatest threat to the success of this project lies in fragmentation. Pennies4Change is not about a few people giving occasionally; it is about the impact of millions of people giving very small amounts every day; it is about the power of pennies. However, its success will come from the simplicity of a single scheme that is undifferentiated across the country. Would my hon. Friend consider meeting a group of the major retailers and banks, which I would be happy to convene for him, in order to ensure that there is common and united action, and that different multiples and majors do not attempt selfishly to brand this good idea with their own logo, thus undermining the simplicity, integrity and national unity of the scheme?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o459"><a name="80403-0020.htm_para22"><a name="08040378000820">In the foreword that I quoted at the beginning, the Prime Minister went on to say:</p>
<a name="80403-0020.htm_brev5"><a name="08040378000880"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;At the heart of our approach is our desire to support those thousands of small community organisations who play such a vital role in our society. We want them to be free to access the funding or advice they need in a way that suits them.&#148;</p>

 I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Brent, North (Barry Gardiner) on bringing Pennies4Change to the House&#146;s attention. I also thank him for his kind remarks at the beginning of his speech in recognition of the work undertaken by the Office of the Third Sector and, indeed, my role as a champion of the third sector. This is the only country that has a Minister for the third sector.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o461"><a name="80403-0020.htm_para24"><a name="08040378000823">My hon. Friend spoke of the needs of the very smallest charities&#151;those voluntary and community groups which, in every constituency in the country, are doing such vital front-line work with local communities. Our new grassroots grants funding programme will give those front-line, often volunteer-led organisations with very low turnovers and incomes access to grants. It will be rolled out later this year, and I hope that many of the smallest charities that my hon. Friend rightly celebrated will take advantage of it. It is an endowment scheme: the money that the Government provide can be used to set up local endowment funds. The endowment itself will never be spent, but the interest generated by it will be there, not just in one year but in continuing years, as a regular, sustainable stream of income providing small grants for those small front-line organisations.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o462"><a name="80403-0020.htm_para25"><a name="08040378000824">Let me now deal with the specific initiative raised by my hon. Friend&#151;Pennies4Change. Like him, we want very much to encourage a culture of giving in this country. Pennies4Change in part helps to do that, and such projects are always of great interest to the Government.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o463"><a name="80403-0020.htm_para26"><a name="08040378000825">Almost three quarters of us regularly give to charity, and there are lots of new market developments and schemes that have the potential to increase charitable giving and therefore lead to more income going into the third sector. They can be very powerful in the arena my hon. Friend is talking about. Through innovative means such as Pennies4Change, people are encouraged to donate small sums or make small changes to their everyday behaviour, and that can make a huge difference.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o464"><a name="80403-0020.htm_para27"><a name="08040378000826">My hon. Friend mentioned a couple of such schemes, and I would like to mention a couple more. As anyone who has been on an aeroplane recently will know, under the British Airways &#147;Change for Good&#148; partnership with UNICEF people are encouraged on flights to donate small amounts of their left-over foreign currency. Since 1994, that has raised more than &#163;18 million for charities. My hon. Friend mentioned an innovative mobile telephone scheme. There are new websites such as the &#147;Everyclick&#148; search engine, which encourages people to use its services, and every time they click, money gets donated to charities of their choice. There are charity credit cards, too, that donate to specific charities following every transaction. There are other schemes like Pennies4Change, which enable people to make small donations at the checkout. They have the potential to open up an entire new way of giving to significant numbers of people. This is therefore an important area of work, and I am very happy that people are showing concern about this issue and are willing to share ideas on how to increase charitable   <br>

giving. It is important for further discussion to take place over the next few months about the implementation of such schemes and maximising the potential of the pennies in people&#146;s pockets, as my hon. Friend puts it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o465"><a name="80403-0020.htm_para28"><a name="08040378000827">As my hon. Friend mentioned, the scheme has very attractive features: convenience, immediacy, spontaneity and the fact that it is quick and has low overheads. I will be happy to facilitate a meeting between my officials and all the relevant stakeholders&#151;my hon. Friend listed many, and there may be others&#151;to hear more about their plans and to find ways to overcome the potential pitfalls he described.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o466"><a name="80403-0020.htm_para29"><a name="08040378000828">Let me say a few words about our wider strategy on giving, in which schemes such as that my hon. Friend mentions sit, which includes engaging with primary and secondary schoolchildren to instil an ethos of giving, working with charities to help make the most of tax-effective giving, and just improving the evidence base so we can better meet the needs of donors and charities. Progress on all of that has been very good. For example, we are establishing the Centre for Charitable Giving and Philanthropy to look at the huge number of organisations that exist and where the money goes. We have set it up with the Economic and Social Research Council to underline the importance of understanding giving: why people give, how they give, and how charitable giving can be encouraged and increased. The centre is intended to be a practical asset to the sector, developing valuable information for answering those questions for practitioners, and not just advancing academic knowledge but taking into account ideas such as those my hon. Friend described and then sharing them more widely.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o467"><a name="80403-0020.htm_para30"><a name="08040378000829">I am delighted to say that the centre is chaired by Professor Nick Deakin, a well known figure in the charity world, and it will be a &#147;hub and spoke&#148; model with programmes on a range of issues. The centre will be formally launched in the next few months. We would encourage all strategic partners and everyone within the sector to engage with the centre and make use of what it has to offer.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o468"><a name="80403-0020.htm_para31"><a name="08040378000830">In the same vein, and following up on our &#147;A Generous Society&#148; programme, &#147;Go-Givers&#148; is an initiative run by the Citizenship Foundation, funded by us, which has developed curriculum materials specifically for use in primary schools to raise awareness of charitable giving. Over the next three years, the programme will expand by training staff to act as co-ordinators. It will also provide increased support through its dedicated website, which already provides teaching plans to teachers, with the aim of registering 5,000 teachers by 2011. Since the programme was fully launched in June 2007, 975 teachers have already registered on the site from 650 schools, and about 17,000 primary schoolchildren are benefiting from the materials. In addition, more than 70 learning activities have been developed including eight original &#147;Go-Giver&#148; stories. The feedback from teachers has been universally positive. As children and young people learn about what charities are and what giving is about, they will tell their mums, dads, grandparents and other relatives about it when they go home, and we will start to see the spread of the culture of giving in the generous society that is the United Kingdom.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o469"><a name="80403-0020.htm_para32"><a name="08040378000831">With our funding, the Citizenship Foundation also delivers the giving nation challenge in secondary schools. The challenge brings together the goals of education about charities in the classroom and enlivening the school environment through extra-curricular charitable  <br>


<meta name="Date" content="3 Apr 2008">

<notus-date day="3" month="4" year="2008" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><b>3 Apr 2008 : Column 1026</b><br>
activity. It is a good scheme. The giving nation challenge gives a year group within a school &#163;50 per class, and each class must then do as much good as it can with the money, using the rest of the school as an audience or as potential recruits. Each class acts as a mini charity, whereby the pupils act as fundraisers. They have the job of generating as much income or positive activity as they can. The &#163;50 start-up money is then returned to provide money for the next year group&#146;s participation in the challenge. Some 144 schools have registered to take up that challenge and 85 have claimed the grant to get their project going, which means that about 22,000 pupils are involved across the country. I am delighted to be able to use the debate that my hon. Friend has brought to the House to announce that the project will continue with Office of the Third Sector funding over the next three years.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o470"><a name="80403-0020.htm_para33"><a name="08040378000832">A third element that we have been developing is gift aid. In 2006-07, gift aid was worth some &#163;820 million to the charities sector. Following the recent gift aid consultation, the Government have further renewed their commitment to promoting that tax-effective giving. The relationship between gift aid and these other forms of mass giving, if I may call them that, is an interesting one to be explored. The package of measures set out in Budget 2008 by the Chancellor is good news for the charities sector&#151;if I may say so, achieving it was a bit of a win for the Office of the Third Sector. In a tight fiscal climate, we have protected the interests of the third sector. By offering transitional relief at 22 per cent. over the next three years we have in effect protected some &#163;300 million-worth of charities&#146; income over that period. We are delighted that the charity world&#146;s response to that clear statement of commitment in pounds, shillings and pence to third sector income has been so positive.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o471"><a name="80403-0020.htm_para34"><a name="08040378000833">I return to the issue of small charities&#151;those front-line groups to which my hon. Friend&#146;s scheme is desperate to feed income. We are providing funding for a small charities training programme, marketed to, and tightly focused on, charities that have a turnover of less than &#163;1 million. We are also developing and facilitating an online gift aid mentoring forum. That bit of jargon means that we want to give some of those smaller charities and voluntary groups access to a network of experienced professional fundraisers and practitioners so that they, too, can benefit from gift aid and all that it delivers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o472"><a name="80403-0020.htm_para35"><a name="08040378000834">My hon. Friend has mentioned a particular business initiative. I am delighted to say that businesses give in many different ways to charities across this country. In a way, we are most used to the role that businesses play in simply giving resources, be it through their corporate social responsibility packages or their work to support their local charities. Such giving, whether it is done through donations, community projects or sponsorship, is terrific. Businesses support charities in all manner of ways, but I would like to see them go that bit further.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o473"><a name="80403-0021.htm_para0"><a name="08040378000835">Perhaps some businesses could buy from the third sector, using their purchasing power so that those third sector organisations&#151;social enterprises in particular&#151;that are looking for sustainable sources of income to enable them to carry on doing what they do become more enterprising in how they generate that income. If we could get private sector organisations to build third sector organisations into their supply chains, be it in respect of basic supplies, services for their employees or  <br>

even delivering its core business by buying from a third sector organisation, we would get so much more from them. To push it even further, what about investing in the third sector? Many charities, particularly small ones, find that access to funding and finance is one of the biggest barriers to their growth and development. Perhaps we could promote that, too.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o474"><a name="80403-0021.htm_para1"><a name="08040378000836">May I rather mischievously use this debate to announce an event called &#147;Good Deals&#148; that we are holding on 6 May to explore all the issues about how we might progress? I hope that Members will find an interest in that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o475"><a name="80403-0021.htm_para2"><a name="08040378000837">I am delighted to return to the focus of my speech, and my hon. Friend&#146;s promotion of Pennies4Change. It is an extraordinarily positive way for individuals to give  <br>

spontaneously and to make giving an integral part of their everyday lives, and it would be the cultural shift that he described, which is so important. He will appreciate that I am not allowed to endorse a specific proposal, but I thank him for highlighting the project and for giving us the chance to explore it in its initial stages and to see how it might contribute to the wider range of good work that I have tried to map out tonight which is being carried out in the sector as a whole. I shall certainly facilitate the meeting that he asked for to reinforce the initiatives that are already being championed by the Government through the Office of the Third Sector.</p>
