 I fear that the hon. Gentleman should read his brief from Conservative central office more carefully. If the guidance suggests that the problems that he describes in fact exist, perhaps he should take that up with its authors. Let me share with him some of the recent capacity enhancements that the Government have delivered. For example, the ongoing Great Western high-speed train refurbishments are increasing seating capacity by about 20 per cent. In addition, the Chiltern route upgrade between London, Marylebone and Birmingham was completed in 2005 and is increasing frequency, while the introduction of Meridian Trains on the midland main line in 2004-05 resulted in increased capacity. The hon. Gentleman is right: we recognise that there is more to do, given that more people are using the railways. That is why between February and March 2007 there was 12-car running on the south-west mainline between Southampton and Portsmouth and London Waterloo, why a new service between Kettering and London will be introduced in December 2008, and why new domestic services will be introduced on the channel tunnel rail link between Kent and London in 2009.

I do not believe it would be wise to break the west coast main line into the 14 component parts represented by the train operating companies that work on the line. The more sensible approach is to recognise that the stability of the industry structure that we have secured in recent years and the sustained investment have not only enhanced capacity on the railway but increased performance and safety.</p>

 I am grateful for that reply. I am sure that the Minister is aware that good transport links are an important factor in stimulating local economies. Will he ensure that there is sufficient capacity in his departmental budget, and in the regional development agency budgets, to make sure that local economiescan be stimulated by new road links to any new developments built in the period that I mentioned?</p>

 Of course my hon. Friend is absolutely right, and the regenerative effects of new road links are one of the things that have to be taken into account when road schemes are prioritised. However, it is important for him to interact with local stakeholders, whose advice we now rely on when prioritising funding. The funding that we get for road improvements will be distributed fairly across the country, and then we will work with local stakeholders to decide how to prioritise the spending.</p>

At the moment, the scheme is prioritised, but it will not happen as quickly as the hon. Gentleman would want. It is for him to go back to regional stakeholders and increase the priority of the scheme. By the bye, it might be a good idea if he and his colleagues supported some of the measures that the Government have put forward to raise the money to pay for the road improvements that he and his colleagues want.</p>

 My hon. Friend makes a very important point. As I have often said at the Dispatch Box, the fact that 3 million people are not on the register who should be on it is a slight to our democracy and something that we must challenge. He is quite right, too, that the Electoral Administration Act has given local registration officers further powers to use all means of registration to ensure that people who are eligible to vote are on the register and able to vote. I am constantly hearing about new ways of trying to provide further opportunities for registration officers to make such changes.</p>

 Frankly, Sir Alistair Graham made no such thing. In that speech, which I have read in detail, Sir Alistair Graham waved about the figure of 390 cases of electoral fraud. In fact, the Electoral Commission has been conducting a detailed analysis of those cases, and so far it has discovered that very few of them include allegations relating specifically to voting offences. Sir Alistair Graham and the hon.

 We should be cautious in this field; let me give an example of why that is. We must be careful about introducing legislation in some of these areas where we would then have the undesirability of their being overseen by the courts, which would not necessarily be a good thing. Indeed, it should be for Parliament, rather than the courts, to comment on some of these issues. The Government have to be accountable to Parliament for their decisions, including decisions on the deployment of armed forces. Parliament&#146;s rights are therefore fully protected under the existing arrangements. That does not mean to say that the Government are not prepared to look at prerogative powers again.

 The hon.

Approximately3.5 million people who should be on the register in England and Wales are not. That is a great democratic deficit.

 No, there is not the slightest likelihood of that happening. I am anxious to encourage smaller firms to stay in business. The family fees do not represent financial suicide; they have been put together with a lot of input from the profession, for which we are very grateful. Nor do the criminal fees, which have also been put together with the greatest possible care. They are based on the average claims in the areas of the police station duty rotas. All of this involves the same budget as before. Everyone should have the confidence to go through the transition, as the signatures on the contracts now suggest is happening.

 With great respect to the hon. Gentleman, he is not correct to say that firms are leaving in droves. Of the solicitors who had signed up to the last contract, 94 per cent. have signed up to the new one. That does not suggest that they are leaving in droves; it represents a pretty average fall-away.

</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o7"><a name="70417-0004.htm_para1"><a name="07041779000175">I must say that this is the best attended 10-minute rule Bill debate that I have ever come across. The title of the Bill is unlikely to set the world on fire. It will certainly not result in dancing in the streets or spontaneous outbreaks of public joy. I am sorry, folks, but the Planning (Consultation) Bill sounds profoundly dull&#151;[Hon. Members: &#147;Hear, hear!&#148;] I am getting cheers of support. In reality, however, it is important to everyone.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o8"><a name="70417-0004.htm_para2"><a name="07041779000176">The law of planning has become a dangerous, bureaucratic minefield. It is said that there are only three people left in England who are capable of understanding it: one died young; one fled the country; and the other expert has now gone completely mad. It is understandable why. Anything to do with planning usually involves piles of paperwork, loads of legislation and acres of anxiety. People who are seeking permission to put up a porch at the front of their house will know, as will hon. Members, exactly what I am talking about. That person needs the householder application form, perhaps listed building consent and, let us not forget, the full and outline applications and the lawful development certificate. He will even need to give a consent form to the council to put up a notice. By now that person will have filled up enough of an official&#146;s bumper mailbag to paper the walls of Buckingham palace and Westminster abbey. The application will have been scrutinised by planning officers, subjected to all the rigours of building regulations and put out to the public for their views&#151;or will it?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o9"><a name="70417-0004.htm_para3"><a name="07041779000177">I am concerned about several aspects of the existing public consultation. The whole process is extremely vague and open to different interpretations by different officials in different town halls. What happens in one place is not necessarily what happens in the district next door, but with the agreement of the House I hope to introduce an improvement&#151;something to make life more sensible for those at the sharp end of the planning maze.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o10"><a name="70417-0004.htm_para4"><a name="07041779000178">Consultation should mean what it says on the packet. We need a decent definition of the word itself. The &#147;Pocket Oxford English Dictionary&#148; suggests the following meaning:</p>
<a name="70417-0004.htm_brev2"><a name="07041779000529"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;seeking information or advice...taking into consideration the views of people&#148;</p>

</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o12"><a name="70417-0004.htm_para6"><a name="07041779000180">I am quite sure every planner and politician in the land would endorse those sentiments and vow that consultation is a splendid thing and part of everything they do for everybody. However, it is rather like motherhood and apple pie: no one could possibly disagree with the general idea. But with such a woolly meaning, consultation can be as good or as bad as politicians or planners prefer.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o13"><a name="70417-0004.htm_para7"><a name="07041779000181">The trouble is that too many planners and politicians are prepared to settle for the barest minimum when it comes to the standard consultation period. The blame lies, I am sorry to say, right here in Westminster. The House has always fought shy of spelling out what consultation should be&#151;how local people are to be canvassed, how views are to be assessed, what account is taken of opinions, how many meetings will be held, or whether there be any meetings at all. The remit to consult is certainly written into all local government legislation, but dotting the i&#146;s and crossing the t&#146;s has always been left to the locals. Basically, the House has, I am afraid, copped out.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o14"><a name="70417-0004.htm_para8"><a name="07041779000182">The aim of my Bill is to give an exact definition of the term &#147;consultation&#148; and to ensure that the relevant people are consulted. Surely it is such a sensible aim that nobody could possibly object to it. I still wonder why it was not introduced years ago. To illustrate my point, I shall give a real-life example of how our planning system can let down the people whom it is meant to protect. A farmer wanted to put up a new poultry unit in my constituency. Farmland frequently straddles authority boundaries. This farmer bunged in the planning application to the council for the area where the unit was proposed, but the council had no legal obligation to tell the people a couple of hundred yards away about it because they lived in another local authority area. The result was a lot of disgruntled folk who thought that they were being cheated.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o15"><a name="70417-0004.htm_para9"><a name="07041779000183">The problem is not just a rural one, however. If someone wants to build anything in his urban back yard and the local authority boundary is close by, the people who ought to have a say do not get it. That is plainly wrong and should be put right, and this is where the political controversy may begin, because there seems to be a conflict between those who want to free up the planning process and see applications go through more quickly and those who would like the public to get a bigger voice. I believe that the two goals are not incompatible.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o16"><a name="70417-0004.htm_para10"><a name="07041779000184">I am absolutely certain that the law as it stands leaves an awful lot to be desired. It also leaves a lot of people dissatisfied. Some things have been done to ease the burden of those who wish to submit planning applications, and in almost every area it can be done online by computer, cutting out paperwork and trips to the council offices. The quid pro quo is that councils are beginning to use their online services as an excuse for consultation. Someone can make an online planning application and people can see it&#151;<i> [Interruption.]</i></p>

In Wandsworth, here in London, 30,000 consultation letters were sent last year. However, the obligation actually to do anything is non-existent. The only requirement is for a period of 21 days during which action can be taken. The planning authority has a duty to put up notices,  <br>

usually in small print on A4 pieces of paper pinned to telegraph poles. One needs a magnifying glass to decipher what they say, and one would have to be a planning anorak to stop and read one in the first place. Bigger developments require a planning authority to buy one tiny advertisement in the local paper, which is usually hidden away on page 99 if it gets that far. There is a woolly commitment to consulting interest groups, residents and&#151;how I hate this word&#151;stakeholders. The politician who coined the word should be made to use a stake himself.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o19"><a name="70417-0004.htm_para13"><a name="07041779000189">There are good intentions, but they are not law. Every planning authority can do as much or as little as it likes to keep people posted; no planning authority has any legal obligation to tell people outside their areas what is going on. That means that unless there is a planning application to build a nuclear power station, an airport or a Tesco store, they will not be told. That deficit in the planning process makes a mockery of the existing law, and seriously undermines what has become a major cross-party commitment to be seen to be consulting.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o20"><a name="70417-0004.htm_para14"><a name="07041779000190">The Government swear by consultation. Hundreds of different consultations are currently taking place: we need only look at the No. 10 website to see that. Those with strong opinions and ample time should be free to add to debates, but there is one small drawback. Consultation does not involve any debate at all. The public are invited to pour in opinion, which can then be conveniently polarised, twisted or ignored. The scale of the consultation industry is reminiscent of the old maxim &#147;Divide and rule&#148;. There are now so many official consultations that it is impossible to keep abreast of any of them. Moreover, the Government have opened up consultation far too widely.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o21"><a name="70417-0004.htm_para15"><a name="07041779000191">Consultation involves small complications, but big complications are much more serious. Consultations are voluntary, they are not binding, and no one has a say. There has to be a proper &#147;code of conduct&#148;. Imagine what Moses would have said if God had handed him a code of conduct instead of the ten commandments. &#147;Thou shalt not covet thy neighbour&#146;s ass&#148; has a better ring to it than &#147;Perhaps we should leave the neighbour&#146;s donkey alone&#148;.</p>

It must no longer be acceptable to insert a tiny notice in the form of a classified advertisement in the local paper. Under my Bill, the nature of proposals must be crystal clear, and they must be advertised so that people can see notices, understand them and&#151;more important&#151;respond to them.

 The plans for the pension tax raid were, strangely enough, dreamt up in a hotel room.

Member for Coventry, North-West (Mr. Robinson), who I see has also brought a copy of his book into the Chamber. He is the Chancellor&#146;s former paymaster in more ways than one. It is all there in the hon. Gentleman&#146;s memoirs, which are titled &#147;The Unconventional Minister&#148;.

 We will wait for the right hon. Gentleman&#146;s speech, when he can tell us about the second blow to pensions. I did read his article in which he talked about the changes that Lord Lawson made and the tax on the pension surpluses, but as the right hon. Gentleman says, by 1997, the pension system was in extremely good shape. He has said that on several occasions. While of course he makes the point about Lord Lawson&#146;s tax, the fact was that when this Government came in, the occupational pension system was strong and the right hon. Gentleman, as the Minister for Pensions at the time, did not know&#151;as the electorate did not know&#151;that the Government were planning to abolish dividend tax credit.</p>

The lifeboat fund would start making payments immediately to top up pensions to PPF levels&#151;90 per cent. of the total expected pension package. It would include the 6,000 people whose employers remain solvent, but whose pension scheme has gone bust. I agree with the hon.

The annual cash requirement begins at around &#163;30 million, rises to a peak of perhaps three times that in 20 years&#146; time and then falls to zero. To get the money flowing now, the Treasury should make a loan to the lifeboat fund. That is the precedent of what the Government did with Robert Maxwell. The Treasury should then recover the money, on behalf of the fund, from the hundreds of millions of pounds of unclaimed pension assets that the industry itself confirms exist.</p>

Why did not the shadow Chancellor start by also recognising that, retrospectively, we are helping those employees whose companies have gone bust? That is the means by which we are helping the 125,000 who suffered not because of a dividend tax credit, but because their company went bust. We are also&#151;the shadow Chancellor does not recognise this&#151;the first Government to address seriously the mis-selling of pensions that we inherited from the Conservatives. When we came in in 1997, 2 per cent. of the mis-selling had been dealt with. Within two years, the figure was 98 per cent.

 I used at least to have some respect for the right hon. Gentleman&#146;s grasp of basic economics, but what actually happened was this: in 1993, the current Leader of the Opposition advised Lord Lamont to remove part of the dividend tax credit, but the Conservatives did not replace it with a cut in corporation tax. There was no cut in corporation tax. When we made our change, we cut corporation tax by 2p. What happens when corporation tax is cut by 2p? First of all, companies are more profitable. Secondly, they can pay more in employer contributions to pension funds. Their dividends rise and they are able to pay more dividends to pension funds. I have to tell the right hon. Member for Wokingham (Mr. Redwood) that all his assumptions are wrong, because what actually happened after the corporation tax changes was that companies paid more in employer contributions, dividends rose, payments to pension funds rose from &#163;34 billion to &#163;39 billion, and the assets rose from &#163;549 billion to &#163;820 billion.</p>

 The Chancellor is carefully eliding and shuffling a few dates and events, so may I help him with his recollections? When he was shadowing me as Chancellor, neither of us realised that both of us were looking at the same proposition of a reduction on the tax dividend credit on pensions. In the Treasury, I discussed that proposition with my right hon. Friend the Member for Charnwood (Mr. Dorrell), who was then the Chief Secretary to the Treasury, and in the Grosvenor House hotel, he discussed it with the current Economic Secretary to the Treasury and the hon. Member for Coventry, North-West (Mr. Robinson). We rejected the idea because we were satisfied that it would do damage to occupational pension funds. The Chancellor decided that it would not damage them, and he is still using the preposterous argument that it was responsible for the stock market boom that followed, but I seem to recall that the boom had something to do with the dot.com bubble in the United States. Is he still saying that the Grosvenor House mob came to the right conclusion, and that we came to the wrong one?</p>

 First of all, the ex-Chancellor supported, during the period in which his party was in government, the reduction of the dividend tax credit from 33p to 30p, then from 30p to 27p, then from 27p to 25p, and then from 25p to 20p. It was virtually halved in the period in which the Conservatives were in government, and it was halved on the advice of the Leader of the Opposition; he advised Lord Lamont to go ahead with the move. As far as the ex-Chancellor is concerned, the problem is that in 1997 and 1998, he thought that there would be a recession in Britain, so it was not the right time to deprive companies of those resources, but I took the view that the economy would continue to grow. I was proven right: instead of a 7 or 20 per cent. cut in share prices, shares continued to rise, profits continued to rise and investment continued to rise. The ex-Chancellor said:</p>

We introduced the pension credit, and the only plans that do not add up are those of the Scottish National party, which assumes billions in oil revenues that do not exist, which promised to spend money that it does not have, and none of whose figures add up. The hon. Gentleman should go back to Scotland and explain why his policies and plans are economically illiterate and cannot make a difference to the people of Scotland.</p>

Far from the shadow Chancellor announcing anything new today, he is reheating an announcement made by the Pensions Secretary weeks ago. If the hon. and learned Gentleman is worried about the condition of his pensioners in the meantime, perhaps he should now support the pension credit, the winter allowance, free television licences and the minimum pension guarantee, because I have not heard many Conservative party members or Conservative MPs who are anxious to come out and support those things.</p>

 The right hon. Gentleman had better be careful in joining this debate. He was the author of plans on pensions that virtually lost his party the 1997 election. I have just explained to him that companies paying into pension funds are paying employers&#146; contributions, which rose by &#163;2 billion between 1996 and 1999. It was wrong that so many companies were taking employer holidays, and it was also wrong that the share of wages paid in pension contributions was only between 1 and 2 per cent. Those companies had unfortunately been encouraged to take those holidays by the taxation regime operated by Lord Lawson, which was why those pension funds were not receiving employer contributions as they should have done. Once we made the change, employer contributions started to rise. They have now risen to &#163;33 billion a year, and I hope that the right hon. Gentleman will acknowledge that employers are now paying a fairer contribution to the pensions of their workers. In my 1997 Budget&#151;this is why the shadow Chancellor was completely wrong when he tried to suggest that this was not in the 1999 Budget&#151;I said that employers had been taking holidays for too long and that it was time for them to restore contributions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o91"><a name="70417-0007.htm_para8"><a name="07041779000371">Most sensible people who look at what happened will find that because we cut corporation tax, employers were able to pay more contributions, which rose by&#163;2 billion in that period. At the same time, of course, there were higher dividends, so the effect of the dividend tax credit was wiped out. The whole argument put by the shadow Chancellor this afternoon was dependent on a 7 to 20 per cent. fall in the stock exchange, which was the worst scenario drawn up by Treasury officials. We decided that that would not happen and took the view that the economy would not experience that share cut. We were right and share prices rose&#151;they rose by 12 per cent. in the quarter and by 27 per cent. It is about time that the Opposition, who pride themselves on having some knowledge of economics, understood that because we acted on corporation tax, which they failed to do, we were able to recycle revenues to both pension funds and higher dividends, which meant that the assets and incomes of pension funds rose between 1996 and 1999.</p>

The result of our change was not that the share price fell&#151;it rose. All the figures that the shadow Chancellor gave today are wrong. Investment in the economy rose as a result of the measure.

The second mistake involved the damage that was undoubtedly done to pension schemes. We can now quantify that damage in retrospect. Estimates have been made, for example, of the impact in a money purchase arrangement on someone who was aged 25 in 1997. That person will probably have lost about 17 per cent. of their pension benefit. However, there were not many people in that category.</p>

That is a substantial sum, and those people are angry about that. However, it is 5 per cent., not 50 per cent. We must look at this in some sort of context.</p>

 Estimates have been made by people who are far more authoritative than us. Perhaps I can refer the hon. Gentleman to a careful study carried out by Watson Wyatt of the overall impact of the measures. It took the view that there is currently the equivalent of a deficit of about &#163;540 billion in occupational pension schemes. It arrived at that figure by calculating that that is the sum that would be required to be made up if pensions were self-financing through an insurance arrangement. It also calculated that the damage done by the Chancellor&#146;s changes was about 10 per cent. of that total. So we are talking about damage, but it is one factor among several.</p>

 That is a good point logically, but it is factually wrong. I noticed that the Chancellor made the same point. Research after the 1997 Budget by City university business school tried to analyse the impact on investment&#151;whether the abolition of the dividend tax relief did what it was designed to accomplish. It came to the conclusion&#151;it had no political axe to grind&#151;that the impact was zero. The claim that it would change investment behaviour was simply wrong as a matter of fact.</p>

 I believe that the figure that the hon. Gentleman quoted was for 1997. Was that not a little early to make an accurate assessment? Does he agree that, looking at the stock market, the FTSE has gone up from something like 4,500 in 1997 to 6,500 now, and that the all-company index has gone up from, I think, 2,800 to 3,500?

 I am touched that Labour Back Benchers have such faith in the stock exchange as a measure of business behaviour. The study was done several years after the 1997 Budget and established my point that despite the Government&#146;s expectations, which may have been reasonable, they did not achieve their aim. There was no change in investment behaviour.</p>

One of the unforeseen negative consequences was the impact on public sector schemes, in particular local authority schemes, which accounted for about 10 per cent. of pension fund assets. The effect of the change was to increase the Bill for local authorities by about &#163;300 million. That was a substantial increase in council tax which was regressive and had a significant effect on local authority funding. It was clearly something that had not been thought through.</p>

 Does the hon.

Is not the more accurate deficit for ongoing pension schemes the FRS 17 deficit? Is it not the case that the current cumulative FRS 17 deficit is about the same as the actuaries&#146; figure for the losses as a result of the tax switch?</p>

 The right hon. Gentleman makes a good point. Others take the view that the FRS criterion is very demanding, but he makes the valid point that we are dealing with a set of assumptions and could come up with different numbers. However, the work in the City suggests that damage was done as a result of the measures but that it was not one of the most important factors.

In 1997, the life expectancy of a man coming up to the pension age of 65 was another 19 years. It is now20.5 years. That is an 8 per cent. increase.

benefit would fall by 8 per cent., so demography has played an important part. Low interest rates contributed to the problem of annuities, which we have discussed often. One of the other contributory factors was the behaviour of many of the private companies.</p>

 I am coming to that. In many instances, private companies behaved appallingly to their employees.

They are flourishing and highly profitable multinationals, whose offices can be seen by those driving out to Heathrow airport. A few years ago they took advantage of the existing arrangements to close their occupational pension funds to new entrants, and effectively to wipe out their obligations to existing pensioners. They did that within the law, but quite cynically. They shipped into the United Kingdom trustees who had been appointed at head office in the United States, and used the maximum scope that they had within the legislation to&#151;&#147;defraud&#148; would be putting it too heavily&#151;reduce the benefits of their employees substantially in a very cynical way, for which they had absolutely no justification in terms of their position.

 The hon. Gentleman is producing a thoughtful analysis of the problem, but he has omitted one factor. I think that companies&#146; perception of risk, particularly when deficits were exposed more vividly in accounting terms, altered during the period that we are discussing. Companies also became aware of the relatively low weight that a good-quality pension scheme carried as part of a retention and recruitment package. That was certainly my perception. My company&#146;s pension scheme closed to new entrants while I was there, before I became a Member of Parliament in 1997, partly because the company did not consider it a valuable enough tool for retaining and recruiting quality staff.</p>

 Those are very good points, which add to my basic argument about the complexity of the decline of the occupational pension scheme.

The reason for that is that the new plan is targeted at low-paid workers who might potentially be in receipt of benefit; I understand that about 50 per cent. of the target audience for the new personal accounts are potential recipients of benefit, and particularly pension credit.</p>

We will have a situation in which some people will face the equivalent of an 85 per cent. marginal rate of tax on their new pension, and many will face a marginal rate of tax of 50 per cent. Many such people would be strongly advised not to take out such personal accounts. Yet one has a sense that the Government are so committed to this scheme that that advice will not be given and that many people will be lured into a scheme that is clearly not in their interests.  <br>

Many companies have told me that despite the good efforts of the Financial Reporting Council and others, one good measure is being built on another, so that the system becomes complex and difficult to apply, understand and compare. One company wrote to me this morning with an example in which the same transaction can be correctly accounted  <br>

for in three different ways with quite different impacts. There is something wrong with such a system. That cannot be laid at the Government&#146;s door, but it is a responsibility for them. We urgently need to simplify accounting and make it more transparent, and that should also be part of the debate.</p>

 The right hon. Gentleman makes some good points about the collateral harm to pensions and the lack of confidence caused by FRS17 and other regulations. The problem today is whether the Chancellor, in making the decision in 1997, realised the size of the impact it would have. The previous Conservative Government considered the move, but rejected it because of the impact it would have. The question today is whether the Chancellor fully understood, even on the Treasury advice he received, the damage it would do to pension schemes.</p>

 That is a very good question, but Conservative Governments reduced the relief five times, from 35 per cent., so some in the hon. Gentleman&#146;s party took a different view.</p>

I was in the City yesterday, and I asked one of the practitioners there about the decision taken 10 years ago. I was told that the market goes up and down on a daily basis, and that decisions must be judged according to whether they achieve their objectives. No one can see 10 years into the future, as the correspondence published in the <i> Financial Times</i> over the past few weeks demonstrates.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o118"><a name="70417-0009.htm_para12"><a name="07041779000453">In a letter dated 3 April, a chartered financial planner named Peter Cave said that we should put the pensions issue into context. He said:</p>

What is the average dividend in shares? Let us pretend it is...5 per cent. a year&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o119"><a name="70417-0009.htm_para13"><a name="07041779000454">That is ambitious in today&#146;s environment, but Mr. Cave went on:</p>

So the current annual loss to a pension fund, through Mr. Brown&#146;s tax change, is 0.5 per cent. on half of the pension fund&#151;namely 0.25 per cent.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o120"><a name="70417-0009.htm_para14"><a name="07041779000455">So we are talking about 0.25 per cent. of &#163;1,000 billion, but I can tell the House that, behind closed doors, fund managers can put up their fees just like clicking their fingers and we will know nothing about it.

Richard Lambert, the director of the Confederation of British Industry, was kind enough to be the original chair of the committee. The Treasury Committee&#146;s aim was to reach cross-party consensus about the pensions problem, and we made recommendations to the Chancellor about tax and benefits. We said that the present complex tax arrangements needed to be made more coherent to encourage people to save.</p>

<a name="70417-0009.htm_brev8"><a name="07041779000569"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;the private pension system, far from growing to fill the gap left by the State...is actually doing less.&#148;</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o128"><a name="70417-0009.htm_para22"><a name="07041779000463">Stakeholder pensions were introduced with an annual management charge of 1.3 per cent. They failed because the industry was not attracted by that, and Turner asked for a management fee of 0.3 per cent. If, during the lifetime of a pension the management fee is 1 per cent. more&#151;1.3 per cent. rather than 0.3 per cent., which is a low figure for the industry today&#151;the end result for a worker is that they have 20 per cent. less in their pension. That is one fifth less. So it is important for us to engage in the setting of annual management fees and ensure that the industry brings its costs down. The Secretary of State for Work and Pensions knows that I have been on his back and I will keep on his and other backs on this matter because until we get low fees and competitive charges we shall be doing a disservice to those who save their money on a weekly basis. That is the issue that we should focus on.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o129"><a name="70417-0009.htm_para23"><a name="07041779000464">I mentioned the issue of hypocrisy. The dividend tax credit was cut five times in 18 years by the previous Government. Norman Lamont in his 1993 Budget clearly said that it could have damaging economic effects and it distorted the market. He said:</p>

Members who have addressed the House this afternoon agreed with that Budget, but it seems that they have now turned turtle and they do not agree with the policy. This is where the charge of hypocrisy sticks. If it was okay during 18 years of Conservative rule to reduce dividend tax credits, why are Conservative Members bleating now&#151;particularly those who have a firm ideological viewpoint? The tax credit should be seen as a subsidy, and why should people get a subsidy when other people do not get it?</p>

The deep dip in contributions seen in the period 1988-91...almost certainly reflects the impact of this policy.&#148;</p>

We all accept that there is something of a pensions and savings crisis and we are all trying to produce long-term consensus on how to resolve it&#151;not for the first time. I was involved in trying to reach consensus with Barbara Castle when she produced proposals that would have practically wiped out private occupational pensions if she had gone ahead.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o138"><a name="70417-0009.htm_para32"><a name="07041779000474">The undoubted fact is that if people carry on contributing as little to their savings and their future retirement as they do at present we shall face great problems. We have to form a judgment about recent events, which will include coming to the conclusion that more should be done to encourage people to make their own savings and their own provision and that more should be done to encourage employers to help by trying to rebuild the system and reverse the decline of the occupational pensions industry. That will require continued tax relief&#151;perhaps additional tax relief when it is affordable and even forms of subsidy&#151;so it is important that we consider what the culture should be now. Never again should pensions be regarded as the easy source of revenue that they were in 1997 by the incoming Chancellor. If we can get that point across, the future consensus will be improved.</p>

The decision was arrived at in great secrecy in opposition and there was no mention of it in the election campaign. It was produced in the Chancellor&#146;s first Budget and he read it out in delphic terms; four sentences dismissed the heftiest part of a great increase in the burden of taxation in the 1997 Budget. We had been warned about the windfall tax&#151;another disgraceful tax&#151;but it did not raise enough for the Government, so out of the blue came those remarkable four sentences, ending with:</p>

looked up what I said at the time. Even then, we were talking about the fact that we had been considering but rejecting the same proposal and I said that there would be a profound effect on pension funds, pensioners and employers as a result of that dramatic and unexpected change, for which we were unprepared and which had never been mentioned in the general election eight weeks before.</p>

 Does my right hon. and learned Friend accept that there were some rumours that that might happen?

 There were rumours and I shall refer in a few moments to a book on the subject. There was considerable worry at the time about the matter leaking out before the election. The decision was taken in great secrecy by the group of four people to which the shadow Chancellor has already referred&#151;the three hon. Members and our old friend, Charlie Whelan&#151;in the Grosvenor House hotel and with the assistance of Arthur Andersen, the then well known consultancy and accountancy firm. That is how these proposals were devised and put together. It had nothing to do with Treasury advice and I have no doubt that this group discovered, as we had discovered, that the Treasury, as usual in these matters, had a range of opinions among officials, with some in favour and some against. It had all been tied up and decided before the Government came to office.</p>

 There are probably even more victims to be added to the list, but I believe that it is indeed internationally the same firm, but no doubt some very good people worked for that accountancy and consultancy firm. It was Enron rather than working for new Labour that brought it to grief, but the firm did indeed work for both and helped to produce this particular proposal.</p>

They looked at the argument, familiar to anyone at the time, that if companies were stopped from paying dividends as demanded by pension funds and were encouraged to retain profits, it would boost investment. That was repeated and has been repeated again over the last few days. It was a convenient argument to use whenever people were looking in that direction to raise revenue. However, as the hon. Member for Twickenham said, subsequent events proved that that was quite untrue. In any event, I do not accept it because the idea that if a company has produced a surplus, the best form of investment for it is to plough it back into the same company&#151;or that if it distributed that surplus to the markets, they could not find better ways of investing the money in other ventures and other businesses&#151;is a somewhat preposterous one.</p>

the surplus generated. In today&#146;s modern markets, which work very well, I believe that quite the reverse is true. All the pressures under the present Government are for share buy-backs and distribution of dividends because most people accept that that former argument was wrong and that the best way to proceed is to encourage the distribution of dividends so that the market can make use of them in new ways.</p>

 Surely what this measure was doing was precisely removing the market distortion of the subsidy so that the company could decide for business reasons what was the best proportion to invest back in the business and what was the best proportion to pay back in dividends. That should not be distorted by the tax subsidy.</p>

It is relevant to look further into the precise time that we are talking about and the state of the economy then. The three Members I have identified were sitting in that hotel suite at the same time&#151;precisely the same time&#151;that my right hon. Friend the Member for Charnwood (Mr. Dorrell) and myself were looking at the same proposition. We rejected the argument about distributing dividends and the argument that the pensions funds could carry this. It is possible to say that we came to a conclusion that, looking back, was preferable to the one that they reached. I do not believe that, in the end, in any event, that issue is what drove the three new Labour pioneers to the conclusion that they came to.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman is agreeing. Well, it is his own book: it is a good source. The Government had to find some tax that they had not told anybody about in order to fill the shortfall. They may also have suspected that there was a kind of structural deficit and they had to do something about it. He refers to that as well, I think. But the key thing was that the Government believed that they had to raise some money without raising any personal taxation. It had to be corporate taxation and this move was the easiest way because it would raise an astonishing &#163;5 billion per annum&#151;and nobody would understand it apart from a few anoraks in the House and a few people in the pensions and accountancy industry. It was the original, and most profitable, stealth tax. That is how it all emerged.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o149"><a name="70417-0010.htm_para9"><a name="07041779000493">A sadness is that the Government turned out not to need the money. It was the beginning of some extremely bad forecasting that they made in subsequent years. They were not able to anticipate where the dotcom bubble in America was going to take us. Nobody did; I did not when I made my remarks about recession. They began to run massive unsolicited and unexpected surpluses. It was years before they needed the money. Sadly, nowadays they are still spending about &#163;6 billion a year and no one can find an easy way of getting out of this continued drain on pension funds.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o150"><a name="70417-0010.htm_para10"><a name="07041779000494">They did what they did to raise the money and because it was stealth tax. It did terrible damage to the pensions industry, pensioners and the legitimate expectations of many of our constituents.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o151"><a name="70417-0010.htm_para11"><a name="07041779000495">I listened to the Chancellor defending himself and saying what a great decision it was and how he would make it again. He allowed fancy to run away with him. He was plucking things from the air to a quite extraordinary degree. The idea that I had used the argument that we were going to go into recession against him was nonsense. That came when the Governor of the Bank of England was raising interest rates and the Chancellor was raising taxation at precisely the same time, when we were already slowing down the economy. My right hon. Friend the Member for Horsham (Mr. Maude) and I were unlucky: all that happened was that the economy went flat. There were two successive quarters of stagnation. We never went into recession. But that was later.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o152"><a name="70417-0010.htm_para12"><a name="07041779000496">Corporation tax was used in mitigation. In my last Budget, I reduced the small companies rate of corporation tax&#151;quite the reverse of what has just been done by the Chancellor. My recollection is that the Government did not cut corporation tax until 1998&#151;and they did not actually cut it. They took the headline rate down by2 per cent., but they altered the method of payment to quarterly on advance estimates so that the cash flow into the Treasury was increased by what they did to corporation tax. It is bizarre to use that excuse. Until very recently, the Labour Government had been raising corporate taxation incessantly during all the time in which they had been in office. The Chancellor then went into even wilder fancies by saying that corporate profits had risen as a result of the decision. I cannot for the life of me understand how corporate profits rose.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o153"><a name="70417-0010.htm_para13"><a name="07041779000497">As has been pointed out, the inescapable fact is that the decision, on international financial reporting standards calculations, has cost at least &#163;100 billion over the years. The cost is now running at &#163;6 billion a year. Compared with the previous arrangements, 20 per cent. of the dividend income of pension funds is being sacrificedto the Treasury. Whereas nine out of 10 members of occupational pension schemes were in defined benefit schemes when we left office, only one in 10 is now in a defined benefit scheme. It is estimated that deficits in the pension industry are running at about &#163;100 billion, which is exactly the figure that has been extracted so far by the tax.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o154"><a name="70417-0010.htm_para14"><a name="07041779000498">The reaction to this is relevant. The way in which the Chancellor gets carried away by using different time scales to make his points, clutching at figures from the past and making wild assertions about what has happened casts serious doubts on his judgment and where we were going. Yesterday, the Secretary of State for Defence came to the House in almost as big a pickle. He had made a quite appalling error of judgment, but he admitted that he had made a mistake and actually apologised for it. Had he not admitted that he had made a mistake, he would have been roasted alive on the Floor of the House, so he made a sound political judgment. I am afraid that the Chancellor&#146;s instincts are totally different. The very fact that he is criticised makes him defend his decision more vigorously by using wild arguments to justify it. He seems oblivious to the fact that although the decision was not the only cause of the problem&#151;there was also longevity, the fall in stock market values and the mad regulation and valuation&#151;he has done great damage to the pensions industry and his judgment was seriously&#151;</p>

 I am pleased to follow the former Chancellor, the right hon. and learned Member for Rushcliffe (Mr. Clarke). He started his speech in a serious vein, but he seemed to degenerate into using the unfortunate tone of voice and personalised criticism that we have sadly come to associate with the shadow Chancellor. As I tried to say to the shadow Chancellor last time I commented on his remarks, I do not know why he wishes to demean himself in such a way. The more he personalises his attacks on the Chancellor and makes them as unpleasant as he does, the more his behaviour borders on a form of paranoia and suggests that he lacks self-confidence. If I may offer him some advice&#151;although he seems to have found much in my book, I doubt that he will take this from me across the Chamber&#151;he would do well to moderate the personal nature of his attacks<i> .

I am prepared to say that we did not find the usual mess left by Tory Governments. However, two significant aspects of the economic situation were of great concern, so we had to address them immediately.  <br>

The first was the public debt. I have the figures for the former Chancellor, given that he seems to have forgotten them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o156"><a name="70417-0010.htm_para16"><a name="07041779000502">When the right hon. and learned Gentlemantook office, we had a massive public sector deficit of &#163;42 billion. The reason why the deficit had been allowed to run that high in 1992 was quite clear: the Conservatives wanted to win the election. To some extent, they succeeded in winning the election on the back of an unsustainable public sector boom and investment in the public sector. The deficit rose to 5 per cent. of gross domestic product, which was an exceptional figure by anyone&#146;s standards. When the right hon. and learned Gentleman vacated No. 11, he left us with a structural deficit&#151;or a deficit at any rate; he never answered my questions about whether it was structural&#151;of &#163;22 billion. During his four years of stewardship of the Treasury, his forecast for the deficit was wrong every year because he overestimated by 100 per cent. the reduction that he actually achieved.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o157"><a name="70417-0010.htm_para17"><a name="07041779000503">That was the first matter that we had to tackle in one way or another, and through a combination of factors. The other matter&#151;and it relates to why we made the Bank of England independent, and why the first act of the incoming Labour Chancellor was to show that he had the resolve to face the issue of whether it was necessary to raise interest rates&#151;arose because the Conservative Chancellor, no doubt from sound party political electoral considerations, had refused Bank and Treasury advice to raise interest rates time after time, and month in, month out. Those were the twin matters that we had to address. The incoming Chancellor addressed one of them by taking the courageous political decision and brave economic decision to make the Bank independent. We all know that the present shadow Chancellor said that that move was a mistake, and he even voted against it, I think.</p>

 He indicates that he did not vote against it, and I am prepared to accept that, but he certainly was not very vocal in his support for the measure. As for the right hon. and learned Member for Rushcliffe, the former Chancellor, in the weeks after we took the decision, he said that it was a mistake. Those were the two fundamental decisions that we had to take. Part of the issue, and I see that we must confront it as honestly as I did then, was that we had to raise money, via the windfall tax, for our welfare to work programme, which was &#163;5 billion. We raised a bit more than that in the end. The programme was successful, and people were successfully employed. Another issue was a general closing of the gap, which we successfully achieved, perhaps even to a greater extent that we dreamed that we could. We then went into budget surplus, but we did not do that by dodging the difficult decisions, by finding some local bandwagon that we could jump on, or by flirting with a superficially attractive idea that makes a brief apparition on the political stage. We did it by facing up to the fundamentals and taking difficult decisions.</p>

 Was my hon. Friend as disappointed as I was to hear the right hon. and learned Member for Rushcliffe (Mr. Clarke), the last Conservative Chancellor, misrepresent the position in relation to advance corporation tax? The former Chancellor said that the changes were made to increase cash flow, and it is certainly true that there would be increased cash flow at the start, but would that not simply re-profile the amount of corporation tax that would fall due? It would not alter the total. To misrepresent matters in that way does not improve the case one iota.</p>

 My hon. Friend is correct, and I fear that the right hon. and learned Member for Rushcliffe, who did not have much interest in the detail of policy while he was in the Treasury, may not have understood that point. One thing that we did when we corrected the whole matter, when we abolished dividend tax credit, was to introduce a new instalment payment system for corporation tax. Of course, inevitably linked to that was the removal of advance corporation tax; in fact, there was a cash flow advantage to the Exchequer, of which the Confederation of British Industry was very aware. I will come back to that point in a moment.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman is absolutely incapable of distinguishing between a fundamental point and a personal point. He is at it again, trying to imply that there is something wrong about trying to work out policies in opposition. I commend my book to him, as it will teach him how to behave in opposition, which he has not learned yet, as well as preparing him for government. Every party that makes a serious attempt to become the Government of this country does serious work in opposition with serious players, which is one reason why the Opposition have been distinctly unsuccessful on three occasions in gaining the country&#146;s trust. People saw through all that they said on immigration at the last election, as they saw through what they tried to do on tax in previous elections.

<p><a name="stpa_o160"><a name="70417-0011.htm_para0"><a name="07041779000516">There were, as the right hon. and learned Member for Rushcliffe correctly said, a range of views in the Treasury and in the Inland Revenue, which were the two principal Departments giving advice. Initially, the Inland Revenue was dubious about the figures that we had worked out in opposition&#151;only the Treasury computer held all the information needed to achieve an up-to-date and accurate estimate&#151;because it had looked at the problem before, and the numbers were nowhere near as favourable to the overall proposition of the three interlinked changes as was later the case. We had to wait about two weeks until the Inland Revenue came back, thoroughly in agreement with the proposals that we had evolved. Indeed, the person who led for the Inland Revenue said that it was something that he had wanted to do for many years.</p>

 May I just finish this point, because it fits the whole and may be of some interest to the House? As the right hon. and learned Member for Rushcliffe said, the proposal had been considered before, but it was rejected, principally because of the fear of political repercussions. He could not face up to making tough decisions, just as he could not face up to increasing interest rates or to making the necessary cuts that have since brought the public accounts back into balance. That is why the Opposition failed to do it&#151;and it is that lack of political courage that dogs them to this day.

every relevant part of the documents relating to that time. I cannot see why there is any surprise about that. Everyone knew it then, and everyone knows it now. The figure was in the public domain. To my knowledge, nothing has been revealed, apart from the fact that the Opposition, with the help of some parts of the press, are trying to impose a construction that suggests that in some way the Chancellor personally rejected official advice from the Treasury. Nothing could be further from the truth. As I said a moment ago, and as the previous Chancellor said, a range of advice was available. Of course, officials gave us caveats and warned us of the dangers. They told us the same about the Bank of England, which is no doubt why the right hon. and learned Gentleman refused to make it independent, because he was fearful of what would happen if he did so. Just as we made the hard but correct decision on the Bank of England, so we took the hard but correct decision about the overall reform of corporation tax, which involved the abolition of tax credits. Any notion that the Treasury team or the Chancellor personally went against official advice is plain wrong. I hope that the House clearly understands that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o161"><a name="70417-0011.htm_para1"><a name="07041779000521">None of the excerpts that the Opposition have read out from the official papers delivers the formal burden of official advice that we received, which was that we should proceed with the overall reorganisation of the corporate tax system. The CBI itself&#151;and I spoke personally to Adair Turner&#151;was in favour of the overall reorganisation. In particular, the industry as a whole wanted to get shot of advance corporation tax. If ACT were abolished, tax credits had to go, and if that happened, there was every reason to provide a more balanced and even pattern&#151;a level playing field&#151;of corporate taxation that would not favour dividends, capital investment and retention, still less companies that wanted to reinvest funds that they could not profitably use in their own business. That would be left to the market and not to an invented and distorted tax mechanism that no one ever had in mind when ACT was introduced.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o162"><a name="70417-0011.htm_para2"><a name="07041779000522">I come back to the two central points on which I am pleased to base my personal contribution. This is a serious debate, and it should be about a serious problem that the country as a whole faces. I hope that, after this unwanted and unnecessary political intrusion instigated by the Opposition, we can return to the consensual approach adopted by the main parties in the House. The reasons why we made that decision were quite clear, and it was based on the burden of advice from the Inland Revenue and from the Treasury that we should proceed with the changes that we were making. It was necessary, as were the other decisions that we made about the independence of the Bank of England, about raising interest rates and about closing the gap in the disastrous public expenditure levels that we inherited from the Tories. I do not want to rehearse again the specious and fallacious arguments made by Opposition, which were comprehensively demolished by the Chancellor in his major contribution. I hope that the shadow Chancellor will take on board what I said earlier, because in such head-on confrontations, the message that reverberated around the House is that he has some way to go before he reaches the measure expected of a shadow Chancellor. As for us, we stand by those decisions: they were right then, and they are right now. We have problems&#151;let us face them responsibly.</p>

 It is a great pleasure to follow the hon. Member for Coventry, North-West (Mr. Robinson), whose amiable lack of self-regard enables him openly to admit that Labour deceived the British electorate at the last election. He sees nothing wrong in developing policies in secret, which it refused to admit. As an aside, I got wind of those policies before the election. I held a press conference during the election campaign alleging that it was the Labour party&#146;s intention to abolish advance corporation tax. Only the <i> Financial Times</i> took me at all seriously, publishing a comparatively modest article saying that that was allegedly being considered by the Labour party. No one else paid any regard to the matter, and even I scarcely believed that it really intended to do it. None the less, I shall put in some context the decision that subsequently followed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o163"><a name="70417-0011.htm_para3"><a name="07041791000002">When I became Secretary of State for Social Security, the first crisis with which I had to deal was the Maxwell pensions crisis. The former Labour Member for the Milton Keynes area had left his companies&#146; pension funds bereft of hundreds of millions of pounds, so tens of thousands of pensioners&#146; livelihoods and future were at risk. We had to deal with that&#151;we did not do so, but that is not the issue today. It meant, however, that I had enormous sympathy for my successors when they faced a Chancellor of the Exchequer who introduced a tax that took billions of pounds from the pension system, which affected every pensioner and future pensioner in the country. Indeed, on the night that he introduced that tax, I described it as the Robert Maxwell memorial tax, because no one before the Chancellor had thought that they could get away with removing money from pension funds without anyone noticing until it was too late. That is what our Chancellor did, but he has not got away with it indefinitely&#151;only for too long.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o164"><a name="70417-0011.htm_para4"><a name="07041791000003">I want to look very simply at the Chancellor&#146;s record on pensions and his reasons for introducing this change. He inherited a system which, in the words of the right hon. Member for Birkenhead (Mr. Field), was the &#147;envy of the world&#148;. He inherited an occupational pension scheme that was accepted as the jewel in the crown of pensions systems worldwide. As a result, we were enabled to build up funding, savings and investments for future pension liabilities in this country to a level that was not only more than that built up by any other country in Europe, but more than all the other countries in Europe put together had saved and invested to meet their future pension liabilities. We faced less of a potential burden of tax to fund our future pension liabilities than those countries, and we were generating a huge annual flow of savings, which were available for investment in this country or to acquire assets abroad to meet the burden of future pensions.</p>

Let us take each of those points in turn and see what has happened under the tenure of this Chancellor.</p>

 May I make a little more progress? I will happily give way when the hon. Gentleman has something about which to ask a question.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o166"><a name="70417-0011.htm_para6"><a name="07041791000007">Pensions were well funded in 1997. We know that because when the Chancellor introduced the tax, one reason that he gave was that they were over-funded&#151;he thought that they had too much money. Now, the deficits are measured in billions of pounds. I have asked the Library for the figures, and it puts the gross deficit shortfalls of pension funds at some &#163;76 billion, which is a turnaround from surplus to deficit that is commensurate with the net present value of the &#163;5 billion a year taken from pension funds and its impact on the value of those funds&#146; assets.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o167"><a name="70417-0011.htm_para7"><a name="07041791000008">The Chancellor had the cheek to suggest that my hon. Friend the shadow Chancellor needs a lesson about the value of assets, but it is he who needs the lesson. What is important is whether assets exceed liabilities, which was the case in 1997. Now, the liabilities of pension funds exceed the assets. That is the Chancellor&#146;s record, which he must answer for, and the lesson that he needs to be taught.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o168"><a name="70417-0011.htm_para8"><a name="07041791000009">We were told then, and we knew well, that occupational pension funds were secure. Robert Maxwell had delivered a blow to confidence, but that blow was enormous precisely because up to that point no significant public company had ever gone into bankruptcy while being unable to meet the liabilities of its pension funds. Such pension funds were sufficiently well founded that even if the company did not survive, the pension fund did, or if the funds were underfunded, they were met by the resources of companies. When I faced the Maxwell pension crisis, I asked officials, &#147;What normally happens in such cases?&#148; They said, &#147;This has never happened before&#148;, so secure were we. Now it happens all too often, and all too many companies have failed leaving deficits in their pension funds. Hence the amendments that Conservative Front Benchers will introduce tomorrow to the Pensions Bill, when Opposition and Government Members will have an opportunity to try to make good the deficits and help the pensioners who are now caught in an occupational pensions system that is no longer as secure as it was.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o169"><a name="70417-0011.htm_para9"><a name="07041791000010">The Chancellor has mentioned &#163;8 billion being made available, albeit over 60 years, which is a measure of the crisis that he has created.</p>

 On pension fund deficits, surely the right hon. Gentleman should refer, at least in part, to the fact that after a long boar market the FTSE 100 was at about 7,000 on 31 December 1999, and that it halved to 3,500 by March 2003. Surely that played a huge role in the decline of pension funds, at least for a period&#151;as we sit here today, it has, of course, almost climbed back to those levels. Why does he not refer to that? It is important, is it not?</p>

majority of them are closed to new members, and two thirds of final salary systems have closed on his watch. Lord Turner has forecast the virtual euthanasia of final pension occupational schemes. The crown jewel of the occupational pension system has been successively plundered and sold off to the fences.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o171"><a name="70417-0011.htm_para11"><a name="07041791000014">The Chancellor inherited a system that was fairly taxed and well incentivised. The system was fairly taxed in the sense that it was designed so that people did not pay twice. Having paid taxes on their incomes and made savings&#151;the companies in which they invest pay tax&#151;people did not pay a further round of tax, which is what the complex system of advance corporation tax credits was all about. The tax credit reflected the value of the tax&#151;when taxes went down, the tax credits went down. The bulk of the reductions reflected that, rather than being a cut in the credits without any corresponding cut in the tax for the most part.</p>

 My right hon. Friend has touched on an important point of principle. My right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Rushcliffe (Mr. Clarke) referred to the fact that that option was rejected when he was Chancellor, partly because the arguments about rebalancing investment flows were rejected and partly because the tax change implemented by the Chancellor introduced for the first time double taxation on pensioners&#151;taxation on income into the pension fund as well as taxation of the pension paid to the pensioner.</p>

 My right hon. Friend is absolutely right. Any fair system taxes money either when it goes in or when it comes out, but not when it goes in, when it is in there and when it comes out again, which is where we are heading under this Government.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o172"><a name="70417-0011.htm_para12"><a name="07041791000017">There is another change that no one has mentioned so far, which is the double whammy that this Chancellor landed on the pensions system, namely, the resort to extensive and almost universal means testing. That has meant not only that the pensions system bears more taxes, but that the incentive to save is reduced, particularly for those on middling and low incomes. That will have a serious, long-term deleterious effect on savings and provision for pensions in this country, not least because it means that most providers of pensions are now afraid that they will be acting unwisely if they advise someone who is not very rich to save and invest, which is surely a serious indictment of the situation that this Chancellor has created.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o173"><a name="70417-0011.htm_para13"><a name="07041791000018">The Chancellor justified what he did in his Budget speech and subsequent interviews in three ways. First, he said that the measure would increase investment. Figures from the Library show that when the measure was introduced business investment amounted to 10.4 per cent. of GDP&#151;it subsequently went down before recovering again to 10.4 per cent. of GDP. The measure has not raised the level of investment in this country&#151;I will not pretend that the decrease was due to the tax change&#151;and it has failed in the central thing that it was supposed to do.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o174"><a name="70417-0011.htm_para14"><a name="07041791000019">The Chancellor said that the measure would discourage dividend payouts. As we all know, dividend payouts follow a cycle, but in the nine years since the measure was introduced, the payout rather than falling has risen compared with the nine years before its introduction. The amount is only small, but the measure has had the opposite effect, if any, to that which the Chancellor proposed and forecast. He imagined that there would be  <br>

a complex system whereby even though the cash flow of companies would clearly be reduced by this tax measure&#151;there is no way of taking money from companies and pension funds that does not leave them with less&#151;they would none the less invest a higher proportion of a reduced cash flow, which would increase asset values in the long term sufficiently to offset the effect of the money that was taken out. That was an absurd, incredible and complex thesis which I am pleased to say that the Chancellor did not resurrect today, although it will be interesting to see whether his devoted colleague and potential successor will do so in the wind-ups.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o175"><a name="70417-0011.htm_para15"><a name="07041791000020">Finally, the Chancellor said that it could all be paid out of surpluses&#151;that these pension funds were awash with money that served no purpose, and that they could pay it out at a rate of &#163;5 billion a year with no harm done.

I welcome the fact that a combination of the Freedom of Information Act 2000 and the activities of <i> The Times</i> and of my right hon. and hon.

 I propose to stick with what I understand and, more importantly, with what my pensioner and employer constituents understand, namely, that it was a key factor of the Chancellor&#146;s policy in 1997, as was made clear by the hon. Member for Coventry, North-West (Mr. Robinson), to levy a significant additional tax revenue out of the pension funds. We can argue about the number; the figure that most of us will stick with is &#163;5 billion. The Paymaster General clearly thinks that it is more, because he has drawn the attention of the House to the fact that dividends have risen over the past 10 years, so &#163;5 billion might be an underestimate. The key fact is that that money was previously flowing into the pension schemes, and now it no longer does so. The key questions when additional tax is being levied are: who pays the tax and what is the consequence of levying it? I shall go on to discuss that question in a moment, but I shall give way to the Paymaster General first.</p>

 We do not need a freedom of information request, because we had the details in glorious technicolour from my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Rushcliffe (Mr. Clarke), who was Chancellor at the time. It was revealed that we had assessed the options for this measure as a tax-change proposal, and that we rejected it on three principal grounds. The first was a purely practical one, namely, that we feared the effect that it would have on pension funds. The other two were issues of principle, both of which are important to the debate.</p>

That was also an argument put forward by the hon. Member for Birmingham, Erdington, and it was implicitly accepted by the Economic Secretary&#151;I apologise to him for referring to him as the Paymaster General earlier. My right hon. and learned Friend, as Chancellor, made it clear at the time that he disagreed with that approach to policy on precisely the grounds that he set out to the House this afternoon, namely, that capital markets become progressively more efficient, and that,  <br>

if we want efficient allocation of capital in the economy&#151;as we should, as an issue of public policy&#151;we will achieve that aim better through capital markets rather than through trapping investment flows within individual companies.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o211"><a name="70417-0013.htm_para1"><a name="07041791000076">That brings me to the third reason why we rejected the option, which, in view of what has happened since, will be of some interest. We did not agree with the analysis, also put forward by the hon. Member for Birmingham, Erdington, that saw the dividend tax credit as a subsidy to pension funds. It is important to understand why we did not accept that logic. Until the present Chancellor did what he did in 1997, the taxation of pension funds in Britain had always been based on the principle that the revenues going into the funds went in tax free, with the result that we were then able to tax the pensions paid by the funds in the hands of the pensioners. That meant that the capital build-up during the life of the pension took place on a pre-tax basis.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o212"><a name="70417-0013.htm_para2"><a name="07041791000077">That policy had been pursued for many years, and that was what led us to reject the option that the present Chancellor subsequently adopted. He has created a situation in which the revenues that come into the pension funds via a dividend come in tax paid. For the first time in the history of occupational pensions in Britain, the portion of the financing of the pensions that comes from dividends is now subject to double taxation. It is taxed when the income comes into the pension fund, and again when it is paid out as pension in the hands of the pensioner. That is why I hold the Chancellor responsible for having contributed in a major way to the practical decline of occupational pension schemes over the past 10 years. And that was precisely the practical reason that led my right hon. and learned Friend&#151;ever a practical man&#151;to reject the abolition as a policy option.</p>

 I am grateful to the right hon. Gentleman for giving way again. I am not making an accusation here, because, given the conventions that exist, I have seen none of the pre-1997 papers. I also do not doubt his word that the Chancellor of the Exchequer at that time rejected the case for this abolition. The case had previously been made for a reduction by his predecessor, advised by the right hon. Member for Witney (Mr. Cameron). Did the papers prepared for and submitted to the then Chancellor&#151;the Dorrell review&#151;contain a proposal that the dividend tax credit should be abolished, which was rejected by the Chancellor? Or did the right hon. Gentleman himself reject the idea and the background papers? I only ask because those papers have not yet been made public.</p>

I know that his work at the time created a lot of interest, and it was called the Dorrell review, not the Clarke review.

 They will reveal that the options were examined and did not take the form of a final recommendation because we had had discussions that led to a conclusion.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o213"><a name="70417-0013.htm_para3"><a name="07041791000082">In the case of a final salary pension scheme, the bill for the Chancellor&#146;s policy is met by the employer. In the case of a defined contribution scheme, it is met by the individual&#146;s pension pot and, ultimately, out of the pension paid to the individual employee. It is therefore completely absurd for Ministers to claim, as they do, that the changes have helped employers, who have ended up paying the additional costs into their pension funds, or individual pensioners who are members of defined contribution schemes, who will end up receiving reduced pensions as a result of the increased burden on their pension fund. That is why it is correct to say that the primary effect of the changes has been to contribute, in a significant way, to the reduction in the availability of final salary schemes outside the public sector by roughly two thirds since this Government came to office.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o214"><a name="70417-0013.htm_para4"><a name="07041791000083">It is significant that in the Chancellor&#146;s responses to interventions all the statistics that he quoted in relation to the availability of final salary schemes ran out in 2000 or 2001. We are now in 2007 and anybody who has been engaged in private sector activity over the past decade must surely understand that private sector pension provision on a final salary basis has been in sharp retreat throughout that period and in particular in recent years. To an important extent, that is a result of the policies that the Government have pursued. It is also true that the primary effect of the changes has been to reduce pensions paid out by defined contribution schemes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o215"><a name="70417-0013.htm_para5"><a name="07041791000084">My final comments focus on the secondary effects of the changes. Increased tax burdens have resulted in reduced availability of final salary schemes and in less generous payments by defined contribution schemes. However, there have been two important secondary effects, and it is important that the Government not only accept responsibility for them, but are seen to do so in public debate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o216"><a name="70417-0013.htm_para6"><a name="07041791000085">The first secondary effect is that if additional costs to providing final salary schemes are imposed on employers, it has the effect of tipping some employers&#151;marginal employers&#151;into administration and receivership. It is those employers whose employees have been among the primary victims of the changes. Constituents of mine who were employed by the British United Shoe Machinery Company and who saw their savings evaporated, rightly hold the Chancellor not exclusively responsible&#151;the hon. Member for Twickenham (Dr. Cable) was right to say that there were other important contributors&#151;but responsible for public policy.

have been badly damaged by companies that have gone into administration, much more concerning for the social structure of this country. If we take a pension world that is moving more and more towards defined contributions schemes, and where those schemes are, as a result of this tax policy, becoming less generous in terms of the pensions that they pay out, and combine that with the tax credit policies that the Chancellor has also been pursuing, and therefore the increased reliance of pensioners on means-tested benefits, we can see that we have hugely undermined the incentives on people to provide for their old age. The end result of his policy has been reduced individual responsibility because, as my right hon. Friend the Member for Hitchin and Harpenden rightly said, pensions advisers are, entirely rationally, telling people who are on relatively modest incomes that against the background of the high level of means-tested benefits and relatively low levels of pay-out from defined contribution schemes, they do not have much interest in saving for their old age through a pension fund.</p>

The effect of that has been the renationalisation of pension provision and a sharp move back towards seeing the state&#151;the taxpayer&#151;as the primary provider of income in old age, rather than encouraging individual responsibility during our working lives.</p>

 It is important to remember the context of the debate. It is undeniably true, and certainly something that is constantly repeated by my constituents, that senior citizens are far better off than ever before. Support for them has been systematically increased by the Government. As we all know, the basic state pension has risen by more than the rate of inflation and a raft of new benefits has been introduced since 1997. Hon. Members will be aware of them. As well as measures on the basic state pension, there is the winter fuel payment of &#163;200 for households with someone over 60 and &#163;300 for households with someone over 80. Free prescriptions and free eyesight tests have been introduced for the over-60s, and the over-75s receive free television licences. As we know, the Pension Protection Fund has been introduced. It is an innovative scheme, the first of its kind in this country. We also have the financial assistance scheme and related measures announced in the Budget. There have been many other measures as well. All those important measures and others have created a favourable situation for elderly people in this country.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o220"><a name="70417-0013.htm_para10"><a name="07041791000090">Reference has been made to the dividend tax credit changes that were made in 1997. As has been pointed out time and again today, there was an emerging consensus that that was the way forward. In 1993, when Norman Lamont was Chancellor, he cut the credit from 25 per cent. to 20 per cent. He made numerous statements at the time, but I shall quote just one. In March 1993, he said that the dividend tax credit distorted the commercial decisions of British companies. I believe that that was true then, and remained true until the abolition of the credit.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o221"><a name="70417-0013.htm_para11"><a name="07041791000091">A range of economic commentators and professional economists also said that the whole system needed to be modernised, and that the tax credit was outdated and an impediment to investment. I shall quote just one of those commentators. In his widely read and acclaimed book &#147;The State We&#146;re In&#148;, Will Hutton said:</p>
<a name="70417-0013.htm_brev0"><a name="07041791000129"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;If the tax treatment of dividends...was changed...then the incentives in the system would be redirected towards tomorrow&#146;s profits rather than extracting as much as possible today&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o222"><a name="70417-0013.htm_para12"><a name="07041791000092">It was no surprise when, in 1997, the Chancellor of the Exchequer in a new Labour Government announced that the tax credit would be removed. Not only was the action generally anticipated and not only did it represent the summation of a developing consensus that transcended political lines, but it was widely expected in the stock markets. The day after the 1997 Budget share prices increased by 0.45 per cent., and that was not a one-off: the markets continued to respond favourably for some time afterwards.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o223"><a name="70417-0013.htm_para13"><a name="07041791000093">We should consider not just the position of senior citizens from 1997 until the present day, but the particular circumstances inherited by the Labour Government in 1997. They may be difficult for us to imagine now. At that time there was still high unemployment, along with relatively high inflation, high interest rates and a large budget deficit. The need to achieve stability and do everything possible to encourage investment was widely accepted in the financial community, and that, I believe, was the rationale behind this and other measures introduced in 1997 and thereafter. Those other measures are also important. It is impossible and wrong to see this measure, which has attracted so much attention in this and earlier debates, in isolation from others introduced at the same time and subsequently. For instance, the Government introduced measures that reduced corporation tax, thus also reducing the burden on companies significantly. That was warmly welcomed at the time, and rightly so.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o224"><a name="70417-0013.htm_para14"><a name="07041791000094">The difficulties that arose were not connected, directly or indirectly, with the difficulties that have been attributed to the change in the tax credit. As has been pointed out frequently today, there were other reasons for those difficulties. The fall in the stock market and the dotcom collapse were obviously of tremendous importance, and the reduction of about &#163;250 billion in the market value of occupational pension schemes between 1999 and 2002 was enormously significant. Moreover, as at least some Opposition Members have acknowledged, life expectancy has increased. The 12 years for which a 65-year-old man could expect to live in 1950 have now become 20 years, and it is only common sense to realise that such a profound change in demography will have a profound effect on occupational pensions.</p>

 I do not claim to be an expert, but I suggest that some of the responsibility lies with the actuaries.

 That is a valid point. While it is always possible to speak with the benefit of hindsight, it seems that the problems that arose at least partly as a result of increasing life expectancy were not identified by those who were supposed to have their fingers on the pulse, and they should look to themselves when these matters are discussed.</p>

he did not mention her by name. The press have described her as being very critical of the 1997 decision, but I was interested to note that historically her view has been somewhat different. In evidence to a Select Committee back in March 2004, she made some very pertinent comments which were quite different from those attributed to her recently. Let me quote from the verbatim<i> </i>reports of that evidence session of March 2004.

Not surprisingly, I got the brush-off with an evasive reply. The Prime Minister merely commented that a windfall tax would not damage pensioners and did not comment on advance corporation tax. He also took some sideswipes at my right hon. Friend the Member for Hitchin and Harpenden (Mr. Lilley) and the pension proposals and reforms that we had put forward before the 1997 election. That attack was disingenuous, because at least we had put our proposals forward for public consultation. They were misrepresented by the incoming Labour Government, but I strongly suspect&#151;as my right hon. Friend pointed out in his speech today&#151;that they subsequently regretted having written off those proposals, which meant that they could not grasp the pension problem for some years.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o233"><a name="70417-0014.htm_para5"><a name="07041793000013">Lord Simon of Highbury, then a Minister, also apparently made it clear that the changes would be damaging. He also said that the proposed tax change was a particular concern, given its impact on investment in the UK and pension provision. The Chancellor claimed that he was given the opposite advice today&#151;that the decision would help investment. Those issues have been addressed by colleagues in previous speeches, so I shall not go over them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o234"><a name="70417-0014.htm_para6"><a name="07041793000014">The Chancellor was aware of the implications, but he did not make them clear in his Budget speech. I am not sure that he fully understood what the implications were. Local authorities have been mentioned, and I checked with my local authority, Surrey county council, today. It said that at the 1998 valuation the deficit on the pension fund was &#163;243 million, but at the 2004 valuation&#151;the latest official valuation&#151;the deficit had grown to &#163;517 million, despite the council making additional contributions of &#163;200 million to reduce the deficit over the period. That prudently run county council has been hit, with the result that council tax payers are paying more. The impact of the measure in 1997 was not only felt by pensioners, but caused collateral damage. Did the Government admit that? Did the Chancellor come to the House and say &#147;Well, I think that this is a necessary measure because we need to raise more money. I have been advised by my Minister&#148;&#151;the hon. Member for Coventry, North-West&#151;&#147;that we have to raise &#163;5 billion and this is how we&#146;ll do it. It will of course affect pensioners, but in the long term we think that the pension industry will survive, and of course it will have a knock-on effect on council tax payers, but they must play their part.&#148; He did not say any of that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o235"><a name="70417-0014.htm_para7"><a name="07041793000015">The accusation against the Chancellor is not that he thought through some measures and happened to come up with some that were tax-raising. That is the job of the Chancellor. The accusation is that he did that in a clandestine, covert way and has never apologised to the people who have been affected. Apologies in the Chamber are always highly regarded and respected by colleagues. The House listens sympathetically if a Member comes to the Chamber and says, &#147;Well, I didn&#146;t understand the full implications of what I have been doing. There were  <br>

merits to my decision and I took good advice, but the effect has been worse than I expected.&#148; But even today, when the Chancellor&#146;s cover has been blown, we did not hear a word of apology. There was lots of talk about other measures that he had introduced to try to protect from flanking cover the problems that he had caused by that decision, some of which have been beneficial to pensioners, but that does not alleviate the damage to confidence in the pensions industry.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o236"><a name="70417-0014.htm_para8"><a name="07041793000016">We did not get an apology.

Heaven forfend that I should have to read the Chancellor&#146;s speech in <i> Hansard</i> tomorrow, but I think that that is true. That is interesting, because one of the arguments that he has used is that the stock market went up. It is rare that Chancellors claim credit for stock market movements, and he certainly would not wish to claim credit for the fall in the stock market, which logically he should. If he is behind all movements, the fall must also have had something to do with him.</p>

 The problem is serious and we need to have a proper discussion about the consensus that we want to build in respect of pensions in the future.

The issues are complex, and it is easy to claim that a smash-and-grab raid has been carried out and to say, &#147;The Chancellor stole your pension.&#148; That is the soundbite, but it is not an accurate or sensible reflection of what has happened.

in 1993: did his special adviser at the time support his statement that dividend tax credit distorted the commercial decisions of British companies? The shadow Chancellor refused to answer. He merely resorted to an easy jibe, claiming that I was asking a planted question.

Most of the money gained from cutting dividend tax relief was returned to companies through changes such as the cut of 2p in the pound in corporation tax. The aim was to remove the bias against investment, and to encourage companies to make decisions about future investment based on commercial rather than tax considerations.</p>

However, no reference has yet been made in the debate to the TUC, which represents many of those who have suffered as a result of what has happened to pension schemes. If the proposition behind the debate was correct, I do not believe that the TUC would say the following:</p>


<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070417/debtext/70417-0015.htm"/>


<a name="70417-0015.htm_brev0"><a name="07041793000058"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Neither employers nor opposition politicians should be allowed to get away with blaming Gordon Brown for cuts in occupational pension schemes. When the tax rules were changed, pension funds were generally in surplus. Many companies had got used to long contributions holidays, and with typical UK short-termism had no plans for restarting contributions. Many companies used pension surpluses to make people redundant through early retirement.</p>
</ul><a name="70417-0015.htm_brev1"><a name="07041793000059"><ul><p class="tabletext">But when reality returned and employers started facing bills for their pension schemes once again, the retreat from quality schemes began. Stock market pressures and longer life expectancies have caused far more difficulties than the tax change&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o253"><a name="70417-0015.htm_para0"><a name="07041793000046">Most serious commentators have highlighted three factors behind the development of the problems with pensions. First, employers took pension holidays when the going was good in the 1980s and 1990s, and they did not begin to contribute again when things started to go pear-shaped. Secondly, firms rushed to get involved in the dotcom bubble, which ended with the stock market fall of 2000. According to the Pensions Commission, in the 1980s and 1990s companies should have been investing, not cutting their contributions. As was said in earlier exchanges, they should have been looking at factors such as the increase in life expectancy and realised that more money, not less, needed to be put into pension schemes. I hope that such issues will be discussed in a more serious debate on pensions tomorrow when we consider the Pensions Bill.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o254"><a name="70417-0015.htm_para1"><a name="07041793000047">It would appear that actuaries suddenly woke up and realised the cost to pension funds of increasing life expectancy. They started getting worried and demanding that each year any potential liabilities should be brought forward. I am not an accountant or an actuary, but other contributors will probably come in and make more points about the impact of that in terms of decreasing confidence in pensions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o255"><a name="70417-0015.htm_para2"><a name="07041793000048">It is hypocritical of the Conservatives to accuse my right hon. Friend the Chancellor when they themselves were responsible in considerable part for creating the conditions in which contribution holidays were taken by companies. My right hon. Friend the Member for West Dunbartonshire (John McFall), the Chair of the Treasury Committee, quoted Adair Turner&#146;s report, which cited the changes introduced by Tory Chancellor Nigel Lawson in the Finance Act 1986, which forced companies to take contribution holidays. It said:</p>
<a name="70417-0015.htm_brev2"><a name="07041793000060"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;indeed not only did contributions fall but they were required to fall by deliberate government policy ... the Finance Act of 1986 ... required pension funds to identify whether ... they had a surplus of 5 per cent. or more, and to take action to remove the surplus within five years, or else lose some part of their tax exempt status.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o256"><a name="70417-0015.htm_para3"><a name="07041793000049">So the Conservative party cannot deny its responsibility for what was clearly an important factor.  <br>

the serious charge made by my hon. Friends on the Front Bench and others&#151;that one of the main causes of the disarray in pension funds has been the removal of about &#163;5,000 million a year of income by the cancellation of the tax credit and the advance corporation tax system that was in operation before this Government came to power.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o262"><a name="70417-0015.htm_para9"><a name="07041798000004">The Chancellor&#146;s main defence seemed to be that it was good for companies to have that money taken away, that it meant that the companies would be able to invest more in themselves and that this would create extra value. One of the most important trustee rules in most pension funds is that they cannot invest in the company concerned, because that would increase the risk. The whole idea of a pension fund is that it should be separate from the company itself. However, if we take the Chancellor&#146;s argument more generously, we could suppose that he was looking at the whole population of companies and he thought that, had there been this shift from distribution to investment, all companies would have done better. Of course, the truth is that that shift did not occur. We have heard good evidence already today that the payout ratio of profits going in dividends actually rose despite the change in the tax system.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o263"><a name="70417-0015.htm_para10"><a name="07041798000005">So the Chancellor is left arguing the rather ludicrous proposition that if you take a fifth of someone&#146;s income away they will be better for it. I asked the Chancellor of the Exchequer the terribly simple question&#151;he is an intelligent man&#151;whether, if I took a fifth of his income away, he would be worse off or better off .</p>

 He did answer. My hon. Friend is quite wrong. He answered from a sedentary position and he said no, he would not be worse off. I have a simple suggestion for the Labour Front Bench. If it is the case in Labour economics that you are not worse off if you take a fifth of your salary away, will they all take a fifth of their salary and give it to the pensioners who do not have enough pension as a result of the policies that the Labour Government have been following? They would find it useful, and obviously the Chancellor does not think that it is very useful to himself.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o264"><a name="70417-0015.htm_para11"><a name="07041798000008">The Chancellor said that it would not make him worse off because he knew what was coming next. The second part of my question was, if taking a fifth of his income away would make the Chancellor worse off, would not taking a fifth of pension funds&#146; dividend income away make them worse off? The Chancellor is left trying to argue that it does not make them worse off if the Government take that money away.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o265"><a name="70417-0015.htm_para12"><a name="07041798000009">Perhaps the Chancellor does not understand the full power of compound arithmetic. A pension fund is a long-term fund. It may have a life of 50 or 100 years; it depends how long the company goes on making those promises and how long the members and pensioners live before the fund has finished its task. Every year, all those pension funds are receiving &#163;5 billion less&#151;probably more than that now; the Chancellor will not tell us the accurate figures&#151;owing to the cancellation of the tax credit. It is not just that the pension funds are short of &#163;5 billion a year. They would invest that &#163;5 billion. Given that equities and property have been doing well in most of the years I have been involved with markets,  <br>

after, say, seven years the &#163;5 billion would be &#163;10 billion because the &#163;5 billion would have increased by 10 per cent. per annum. The funds would have &#163;10 billion more just from one year&#146;s dividend tax credit that has been forgone. Then the next year another &#163;5 billion has gone missing; in 10 years time the amount forgone would be perhaps worth treble. So a large amount of money has clearly been forgone by the pension funds.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o266"><a name="70417-0015.htm_para13"><a name="07041798000010">We then come to the Chancellor&#146;s second very clever argument. He says, &#147;Ah, yes, but between 1997 when the money began to be taken away and 2000, stock markets went up.&#148; Yes, that is quite true, Chancellor of the Exchequer. So he says, &#147;Therefore, no damage was done because what pension funds lost on the dividend tax credit they made up on the share gains.&#148; This is where stopping the clock at 2000 is an important part of the trick argument. From 2000 onwards, there was a sharp crash in the market.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o267"><a name="70417-0015.htm_para14"><a name="07041798000011">If the Chancellor were here he would say, &#147;Yes, but markets around the world fell so it was not just a British problem and it was not a result of my actions.&#148; I have looked at the extent of the market falls in Britain and around the world. The evidence is clear that the British stock market fell by considerably more than the New York, Frankfurt and Paris stock markets. All the major markets performed rather better than the UK market. We can make a strong case that the extra decline in the London market reflected the economic policy of Her Majesty&#146;s Government, especially the taxation policy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o268"><a name="70417-0015.htm_para15"><a name="07041798000012">I will make a concession. It was not just the removal of the tax credit; another important tax change had quite a big impact on share values and that was the decision to take &#163;22 billion out of the leading sector at the time&#151;the telecoms industry&#151;in the form of the auction tax so that companies could carry on trading. That had a huge impact on the share values of Vodafone and BT, which were the leading investments in most pension funds at the time. There was a double effect. The pensions tax&#151;the biggest item&#151;and the telephone tax completely smashed the equity valuations in typical UK pension funds.</p>

 Although I do not accept that there is any connection between what the Chancellor did and the so-called drop in the equity market, if the thesis of the right hon.

 I am afraid that the hon. Gentleman does not understand stock markets. On an earnings multiple valuation, the market has not actually risen at all in recent years; all that has happened is that earnings have gone up a bit and the stock market has kept pace with that rise. In real terms, the stock market is well below where it was at the market peak and it has not yet moved on to a higher valuation basis, as it had done before the full impact of the changes was discounted by the market.</p>

central markets around the world, so world markets dropped. The extra fall in the United Kingdom is clearly the result of tax changes in the UK, so the Chancellor&#146;s argument for getting out of jail tonight&#151;that because share prices rose for a couple of years all was well&#151;has to be looked at in light of the fact that what happened next was that share prices fell. Clearly, if &#163;5 billion is taken out of companies&#146; income, their shares will be worth much less.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o270"><a name="70417-0015.htm_para17"><a name="07041798000016">I did the sum for the Government shortly after the first Budget. In the Budget debate, I said from the Dispatch Box how damaging the proposals would be. I then made a back of the envelope calculation that they would cost &#163;100 billion. It was an easy sum to do, because in those days the markets valued companies on 20 times earnings. In effect, &#163;5 billion was being taken from company earnings, so multiplying that by 20 meant that there would be a &#163;100 billion capital hit. In practice, the excess drop in the London stock market was more than &#163;100 billion compared with other world stock markets, but that reflects the telecoms tax and other adverse factors that were then discounted by stock markets.</p>

 My hon. Friend makes another extremely good point. Other colleagues have also referred to it. On the Labour Government&#146;s watch, 1 million manufacturing jobs have gone and a large amount of industry has transhipped to more clement locations abroad, with better tax and regulatory structures and a more favourable environment for business. The hon. Member for Amber Valley (Judy Mallaber) lives in a dream world when she says, &#147;But we all know it&#146;s so wonderful&#148;. Tell that to the 5 million people on benefits who cannot get a job. Tell that to the million people who lost manufacturing jobs in recent years.

It is true that in the 1990s a number of companies either cut their contributions or ceased to make them, which was sometimes beneficial for employees, because some of the schemes had employee and employer contributions. However, Labour Members really must understand how pension funds operate in this country.

company how much money has to go into the scheme to ensure that pensions can be paid in the future. All the companies that cut, or removed, their contributions had signed actuarial certificates stating that they need not put in more money; indeed, they were often told that they could not put in more money.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o273"><a name="70417-0015.htm_para20"><a name="07041798000021">The rules are still the same. There are limits on how much anybody can put into a pension scheme, because it is a tax shelter. The rules are clear: a pension scheme cannot be overfunded beyond a certain amount, because it would be an unreasonable use of the tax relief, and that is right. The Conservative Government were right to impose a limit on the tax relief for funds and the Labour Government were right to continue with it. However, it is quite wrong to say that companies are to blame for a shortfall that emerged 10 years later; they had super-solvent funds at the time and the rules and regulations and tax requirements meant that they could not put more money into the schemes. Indeed, it would have been foolish of them to have done so.</p>

 It is wrong. The funds all took sensible advice when they were solvent, which was why they were allowed to stop making contributions. Had nothing else changed they would have carried on being able to meet their promises. At a certain point they would have resumed making contributions, depending on the balance between liabilities and assets in the valuations.</p>

 But that is precisely the Chancellor&#146;s defence. If conditions had remained the same as they were when he made his decision, we would not be having this debate.

 Of course conditions changed; the main change was the tax increases that did all the damage. Subsequently, actuaries decided that they wanted to make more provision for longevity, which needed to be paid for.</p>

The longevity problem created a potential extra deficit, which is being taken care of by the increased contributions. The symmetry is interesting because the cumulative aggregate deficits are about&#163;75 billion&#151;they were about &#163;100 billion but the stock market has performed better recently, which has helped&#151;which is similar to the figure that many actuaries say would be the discounted cost of forgoing the &#163;5 billion or more of income in the form of the tax credit that is being removed year after year.</p>

believe that the &#163;5 billion included charity funds, so perhaps in the early days the figure was not &#163;5 billion for pension funds overall, but I suspect that it is rather more now because the distribution rate has gone up, as have profits and dividends, so one would expect the credit to be worth more. I assume that is the reason why the Government will not give me the figures, because if the amount were lower they would want people to know. However, it would be good if they published the run of figures so that we can run proper actuarial figures again, based on the actual figures that the Government can work out from the state of the funds and the dividend incomes flowing into them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o276"><a name="70417-0016.htm_para1"><a name="07041798000028">Funds today have less equity dividend flowing into them proportionately than 10 years ago when this dreadful business started, because many funds have been forced by regulatory, actuarial and other pressures to switch quite a lot of money from equities into bonds, so the figures would need adjusting for that factor, too. When the crisis hit, UK pension funds, quite reasonably, had two thirds or more of their assets in equities. They were growing assets, which, taking the normal run of years, outperformed bonds, but because of the crisis pension funds have now been talked into a much higher bond ratio, at a time when bonds are expensive and yields are low, partly due to the bubble effect of the regulatory pension fund crisis.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o277"><a name="70417-0016.htm_para2"><a name="07041798000029">We could now be seeing the beginnings of another crisis in pension funds, because they can no longer make as much on investment gain to get out of trouble as they could 10 years ago before so many of them were switched into bonds. Why are they being switched into bonds? Because the actuarial profession is becoming very cautious and primarily, of course, because so many of the funds are now closed funds. There is a case for saying that we need to be more cautious with a closed fund than with a growing or open fund.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o278"><a name="70417-0016.htm_para3"><a name="07041798000030">It is a tragedy that many of our young people will now have no access to final salary schemes&#151;and it was an avoidable tragedy. It means that the remaining population of pension funds are being run in a much more defensive and negative way. That means, paradoxically, that they have a bigger problem with meeting future liabilities, because asset growth is less and the calculation of assets versus liabilities is even more unfavourable.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o279"><a name="70417-0016.htm_para4"><a name="07041798000031">In today&#146;s debate, we have heard estimates of the deficit ranging from &#163;75 billion to &#163;550 billion. That shows that we are dealing with an imprecise science and also tells us that there are different bases for working out the figures. The &#163;550 billion figure was based on the assumption that all the funds are now going to be wound up and annuities purchased through insurance companies based on long bonds. That shows what a difference there is between trusting a bond investment and the &#163;75 billion to &#163;100 billion deficit figure that is based on the assumption that healthy funds can continue and will continue to grow along with growing investments.</p>

They need more money and the main reason for that is that the Government took the money away.</p>

 I am pleased to contribute to tonight&#146;s debate, not least to put some facts and figures on the record that have been ignored so far.</p>

Friend the Member for Caerphilly (Mr. David) mentioned some of the positive effects that the Government have had on the lives of pensioners since coming to power in 1997, but he missed out a few that deserve a mention&#151;not least the fact that the basic state pension is now guaranteed to rise in line with prices or 2.5 per cent., whichever is the higher, as we move to increase that pension in line with earnings. Pension credit ensures that no pensioner need live on less than &#163;119 a week from 2007-08 and we have also introduced stakeholder pensions and the Pension Protection Fund, not to mention the financial assistance scheme.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o282"><a name="70417-0016.htm_para7"><a name="07041798000035">I apologise for referring to my notes, but there are some figures that I really want to get right. As the Chancellor noted in his opening speech, many of the measures that we have implemented were opposed by Conservative Members, who called today&#146;s debate. In 1997 when we came to power, it was necessary to address historic underinvestment and short-termism. The main rate of corporation tax was too high, pension funds had the incentive of encouraging companies to pay out large dividends, which inevitably had an impact on investment decisions. Dividend tax credits alongside corporation tax disadvantaged British-based international companies and an increasing amount of dividend tax credit&#151;about &#163;1.8 billion&#151;was being paid to shareholders other than pension funds.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o283"><a name="70417-0016.htm_para8"><a name="07041798000036">Our package of reforms included a reduction in the main corporation tax from 33 per cent. to 31 per cent., as well as the removal of the dividend tax credit, a reduction in the small companies&#146; rate of corporation tax and increased incentives for investment, including increased capital allowances. Those changes encouraged long-termism in the British economy. Abolishing payable tax credits allowed companies to base their investment decisions more on long-term commercial requirements and less on the need to pay high dividends.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o284"><a name="70417-0016.htm_para9"><a name="07041798000037">Our reforms encouraged higher levels of investment, helping to account for a rise in business investment. In fact, the figures show that foreign direct investment has risen threefold since 1997 and is now at its highest level since records began. In the quarter after the summer 1997 Budget, business investment grew by 1.75 per cent., then by 6.1 per cent., and then by 7.1 per cent. So between the 1997 and the 1998 Budget, business investment rose by 16 per cent. Since 1997, total business investment has risen by 60 per cent., compared with 34 per cent. in the previous decade. Whole economy investment has risen in every year since 1997&#151;a decade of rising investment. In the previous 18 years, investment growth was negative for a quarter of that period.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o285"><a name="70417-0016.htm_para10"><a name="07041798000038">The purpose of the changes was, of course, to make companies more profitable and to enable them, by being more profitable, to resume higher contributions to pension funds and to pay higher dividends. Companies were more profitable after tax, as rates of return rose from 13.5 per cent. in 1996 to 15.1 per cent. last year&#151;higher than ever before. Companies could afford to pay more in pension contributions, which were up 16 per cent. by 1999 and almost three times as much by 2006.</p>

 I do not share the hon. Lady&#146;s concerns because I believe that her analysis is incorrect. We cannot have it both ways. Either we analyse what happened in 1997 or compare it with how successful our economy is now.</p>

Dividends, employer contributions, employees contributions and total income all rose in 1997 and all were higher in 1999 than in 1996. It was disingenuous of the shadow Chancellor not to acknowledge that, or the fact that pensions were hit by a series of problems after 2000&#151;not least the stock market fall that year, which accounted for a reduction of &#163;250 billion in the market value of occupational pension scheme assets between 1999 and 2002.</p>

Friend the Member for Amber Valley (Judy Mallaber), should also be mentioned. Rising life expectancy obviously means that pensions are in payment for more years, thus increasing a fund&#146;s liabilities. Many firms made the decision during the 1980s and 90s, despite rising liabilities, to take contribution holidays&#151;they were encouraged to do so&#151;in the belief that a bullish equity market was a long-term trend. Many funds continued with those holidays after 1997. Indeed, as I mentioned earlier, the Pensions Commission concluded that employers should have increased contributions in the 1980s and 90s, but in fact reduced them.</p>

Time and again, when given the opportunity, they have declined to say they are going to reverse them. Given their record on pensions, even if they said they would, I am not sure whether anyone would believe them. After all, the Opposition have very little credibility on pensions. They presided over the pensions mis-selling scandal, which caused misery to millions, destroyed confidence and seriously damaged the pensions industry in the process.</p>

From 1979 to 1997, the incomes of the best-off pensioners rose by 80 per cent., whereas the incomes of the poorest fifth grew by only 30 per cent.

As a matter of ideology, based on their values, they cannot be trusted to do what is needed to deliver social justice and opportunity. They say they want to tackle poverty and do more for pensioners, but they condemn the increases in public spending needed to do that and call them financially irresponsible. Their so-called proceeds of growth rule commits them to cutting public spending every single year. Their leader himself said:</p>
<a name="70417-0016.htm_brev0"><a name="07041798000051"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;As that money comes in let&#146;s share that between additional public spending and reductions in taxes. That is a dramatic difference. It would be dramatically different after five years of a Conservative Government.&#148;</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o292"><a name="70417-0016.htm_para17"><a name="07041798000048">If that rule were in place now, spending would be&#163;21 billion lower than the Government plan, and lower still in the future. It is impossible to make those savings without hitting pensioners hard. For all the Opposition&#146;s supposed outrage on behalf our pensioners, there is no suggestion that they are going to restore the dividend tax credit&#151;let alone match our spending on pensions&#151;yet they have been allowed to get away with their own policy vacuum.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o293"><a name="70417-0016.htm_para18"><a name="07041798000049">The closure of occupational schemes was not caused by the decision to cut dividend tax credit. However, we all have constituents who have been affected. That is why I would like to welcome the measures announced by the Chancellor in last month&#146;s Budget and referred to earlier. The Chancellor announced that the Government will greatly increase the money available to the financial assistance schemes, to &#163;8 billion in cash terms. The increase will ensure that pensions of all eligible members of affected pension schemes are topped up to a level broadly equivalent to 80 per cent. of their core pension rights accrued in their scheme. The cap on maximum assistance was increased from &#163;12,000 to &#163;26,000. As a result, the number of people helped will be trebled. The Government are also committed to keeping the financial assistance scheme under regular review. I am pleased that more help is going to be provided for people who have lost their occupational pension scheme as part of their company&#146;s insolvency.</p>

to occupational pensions and, in particular, I want to talk about young people taking out occupational and also private pensions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o295"><a name="70417-0016.htm_para20"><a name="070417102000002">There is no doubt that the Turner report raised a number of issues about the pensions crisis. It talked about the fact that the sorts of advantages that pensioners currently have will not be enjoyed by people who are pensioners in 30 years&#146; time, and about the fact that the dependency ratio, which we have not really discussed today, is dramatically increasing. It is not just a question of longevity increasing. The reality is that the number of people who will be expected to fund the state pensions is declining in relation to the number of pensioners that there will be. We have some serious problems. Turner pointed out that even if we have what could be called a modest rise in public expenditure on pensions in proportion to GDP&#151;going from the current 6.1 per cent. to 6.9 per cent. in 2054&#151;that would imply a 27 per cent. fall in average pensions relative to average earnings. For us to match the current level of pensions in relation to earnings, we would need to raise the proportion of public spending on pensions to 13 per cent. of GDP.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o296"><a name="70417-0016.htm_para21"><a name="070417102000003">Turner&#146;s conclusion after all that was that that simply is not affordable, and therefore future pension provision has to involve people looking to their own private provision. That is why the changes that the Chancellor made in his first Budget were so damaging&#151;they fundamentally undermined people&#146;s confidence in being able to do that. I want to talk, in particular, about the impact that that will have on younger voters. Twenty-somethings living in Britain today will face a double whammy. Not only will the money that they pay into pensions be worth less because they will disproportionately suffer from the tax take&#151;it will affect the entiretyof their pension contributions, should they choose to make them&#151;but they will be a generation that has disproportionately to fund an elderly generation claiming state pensions, in a way that no generation has had to do in the past.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o297"><a name="70417-0016.htm_para22"><a name="070417102000004">There are some serious barriers when it comes to young people and their ability to afford the consequences of the pensions crisis that has been stored up. Unfortunately, the issue goes further than that. For example, earnings have risen in recent years, but the earnings of young people between the ages of 18 and 29 have risen at only a third of the rate of people in the age group above them&#151;30 to 39. In fact, 56 per cent. of those who graduated in 2002 are still dependent on their parents for some form of financial support. That is an amazing statistic.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o298"><a name="70417-0016.htm_para23"><a name="070417102000005">When it comes to those who will graduate in the coming years, we also know that the financial rate of return on degrees&#151;a degree has often been seen as a way of being financially independent and being able to provide for oneself in the short, medium and longer term&#151;has fallen. A study in 2005 by the university of Swansea said that, for some graduates, investing in a degree may have a negative rate of return. That is an important point. For a long time, the Government had a policy of getting 50 per cent. of all young people into university. Some people may have taken a decision on the basis that they thought that it would be financially appropriate, given the rate of return, but it has not been. Not only that, the other aspect is that we know that the average graduate a couple of years ago left with  <br>

debts of about &#163;14,000, but the average person entering university now will leave with debts of &#163;20,000. It is okay for the Government to come up with schemes such as personal accounts, which are there for young people to use to save, but my point is that aside from young people&#146;s lack of confidence in the pension system, they also simply will not have any disposable income to be able to invest in their long-term financial independence. These chickens are in danger of coming home to roost.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o299"><a name="70417-0016.htm_para24"><a name="070417102000006">Only last month, the Chancellor raised tax on low earners with no children. Again, those affected will disproportionately be young people. At the very time when we are hoping that this generation will be able not just to provide for themselves in a way that no young generation has had to in the past, but pay for more pensioners than any generation will have had to do in the past, they are having money taken off them by the Chancellor. That is happening not just when they invest in their pension pot&#151;they will have to put up with this tax grab for longer than any other generation&#151;but because they are having their income taxed more than it has been in the past.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o300"><a name="70417-0016.htm_para25"><a name="070417102000007">It is naive of the Government to think that putting in place new tools will necessarily mean that young people are in a position to use them. There is also the issue of whether many young people today believe that they are contributing to an adequate state pension through their national insurance and tax contributions. The National Consumer Council said:</p>
<a name="70417-0016.htm_brev1"><a name="070417102000101"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Younger consumers are not convinced that they are building up rights to an adequate state pension when they pay tax and National Insurance contributions.&#148;</p>

The key statistics show that, whatever the warm words we have heard from those on the Government Benches tonight, what matters is what people in the real world think and their response to the policies that the Labour Government have brought in.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o302"><a name="70417-0016.htm_para27"><a name="070417102000009">There are clear-cut statistics that show what is going on with younger people and their pension provision. Let us look at the &#147;Living in Britain&#148; general household survey, which was carried out by the Office for National Statistics. It shows that in 1995, 40 per cent. of all men aged between 18 and 24 in full-time employment had pensions. By 2003, the figure had fallen to just 27 per cent. We might have thought that given that more women were in the work force over that period, more would have been taking out pensions, but we would be wrong. In 1995, 46 per cent. of women aged between 18 and 24 in full-time employment were saving in an occupational or personal pension, but by 2003 the figure had fallen to 30 per cent.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o303"><a name="70417-0016.htm_para28"><a name="070417102000010">The situation was similar for the next age group up. In 1995, 91 per cent. of men aged between 25 and 34 in full-time employment had either an occupational or personal pension. However, the figure in 2003 was63 per cent., so the number of people in this country providing for themselves independently of the state has gone backwards. The situation was similar for women. Back in 1995, 83 per cent. of women aged between25 and 34 in full-time employment had an occupational or personal pension, but the figure had fallen to 66 per cent. by 2003. There are similar statistics for people aged between 35 and 44.</p>

people lack confidence in the state&#146;s ability to provide for them. We are left with an intractable situation with the result that young people are choosing not to save at all. They are hoping against hope that things will be okay by the time that they retire, although I am sure that many of them would not be able to explain why they necessarily think that that will happen.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o305"><a name="70417-0017.htm_para1"><a name="070417102000012">Many young people have seen what has happened to house prices. There have been many negative stories about occupational pensions and we have only to read the papers to find out about the Government&#146;s utter dismissal of the parliamentary ombudsman&#146;s report and their response to the mis-selling of pensions. People are thus being given the message that they should not trust the Government, especially not this one. When young people think about where they might want to put their money, the message that seems to be getting through to them is that rather than investing in pensions, it would be far better for them to invest in houses, given that that is the way in which their parents have made most money in recent years. All of us in the Chamber know that that is not necessarily a wise long-term investment strategy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o306"><a name="70417-0017.htm_para2"><a name="070417102000013">I am worried that a generation of young people in this country do not think that there is any reason why they should want to invest in a pension. That has been a problem for a long time, and we understand why: retirement seems to be long in the future for young people. However, the steps that the Government have taken have undermined people&#146;s confidence in investing in pensions, as is shown by the statistics in the ONS survey to which I referred.</p>

At the moment, people talk about a grey pound that keeps the economy going, but there is a real danger that people will talk in the future about a grey penny because our pensioners will not be well-off, so they will not be spending money and keeping the economy going, which has been the case up until now.</p>

We should not ignore the damage of the Chancellor&#146;s change to tax credits on dividends and the dismissal of the ombudsman&#146;s report. Young people latch on to that, as well as the lack of confidence and their parents&#146; experience of pensions. Eventually, the effects of what we are doing now will come home to roost. I am greatly worried that we have a Chancellor, who is likely to become Prime Minister, who is so dismissive of this.</p>

The contributions made by senior Conservative Members were revealing, unlike the sixth-form debating style of the shadow Chancellor. The right hon. and learned Member for Rushcliffe (Mr. Clarke), who has some unclean hands here, was long on rhetoric but short on facts. I suggest to the House that that encapsulates what he was like when he was in office. When my hon. Friend the Economic Secretary to the Treasury forensically probed the right hon. Member for Charnwood (Mr. Dorrell) about what the Dorrell review would have shown, if we had seen the papers, there was a strong suspicion in my mind that the review would have supported what my right hon. Friend the Chancellor went on to do and that the proposal was rejected by the former Chancellor, the right hon. and learned Member for Rushcliffe, on the basis of not argument, but politics. It seemed to me that there was some mileage in the accusation made by my hon. Friend the Member for Coventry, North-West (Mr. Robinson), in his cuddly way, that the right hon. and learned Member for Rushcliffe did not have the guts to take that political decision.

Member for Tatton (Mr. Osborne) had been saying, but that&#151;I pointed this out in an intervention&#151;if the right hon.

Friend the Member for West Dunbartonshire (John McFall), the Chair of the Treasury Committee, who called the debate hypocritical. I disagree with him on that; it is not just hypocritical, but cowardly. It is cowardly because there would be a possible justification for what Opposition Members say if it was their policy to reverse the decision, but it is not and it never has been. Theirs is synthetic anger because they will reverse the decision, and that is fatal to their argument. Their argument is hypocritical because, as has become clear in the debate, they do not come to the subject with clean hands&#151;what my right hon.

Friend the Chancellor made a strong case for us when he spoke in the debate. Putting aside party politics, I want to consider, in the cold light of day, what the City makes of the debate. Last week in the business section of <i> The Independent</i>, Jeremy Warner talked about the fact that the issue had been raised. <i> [Interruption.]</i> I know that Opposition Members do not want to listen to this, but they may find it just a little instructive. Mr. Warner found himself slightly embarrassed to have to return to the subject. He had, quite properly, been on Easter holiday. He came back and found that there had been a row about the issue, and he found that he was a bit out of the loop. He was genuinely surprised and mystified about why the matter was being discussed. He starts his piece by saying:</p>
<a name="70417-0017.htm_brev1"><a name="070417102000103"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Forgive me for returning to the subject of pension...deficits.&#148;</p>

In other words, there was genuinely nothing new that was being discussed. He, an economic commentator, makes a point that I have already made: the anger is synthetic.</p>

 As always, it is a great pleasure to follow the hon. Member for Wirral, West (Stephen Hesford), whose contribution was in the style of a winding-up speech. I certainly look forward to the day when he can deliver a winding-up speech from the Dispatch Box.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o330"><a name="70417-0017.htm_para26"><a name="070417102000050">It has been a curious debate, because there is an argument, which is wrong but respectable, for the abolition of tax credits. That argument is simply that the Government need to find revenue somewhere, and they can do so by abolishing tax credits. That was certainly touched on by the hon. Member for Coventry, North-West (Mr. Robinson) in his speech and made explicit in his book &#147;The Unconventional Minister&#148;, in which he argued that the Government needed the money. That is a valid argument, because any taxation has a downside effect. If one increases taxes on income, that acts as a disincentive, and if one introduces high rates of corporation tax that forces businesses overseas. That tax on pensions caused harm but, on balance, the Government took the view that it was worth introducing. That is a wrong but respectable argument. However, we have consistently heard Government Members, particularly the Chancellor, advocate a rather different approach, which sticks doggedly to the position taken in 1997 and stipulates that, first, the abolition of tax credits on pension funds will not damage pension funds and secondly, it will be good investment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o331"><a name="70417-0017.htm_para27"><a name="070417102000051">That extraordinary argument was made by the Chancellor in his 1997 Budget, and he and a number of his colleagues made it earlier today. First, the notion that taking &#163;5 billion a year out of pension funds does not damage those funds is ridiculous. Secondly, the belief that it is good for investment is not supported by the facts. With the benefit of hindsight, there is absolutely no evidence that it has encouraged investment. As we have heard, business investment as a proportion of gross domestic product has fallen to record low levels under the Government.

Friend the Member for Charnwood (Mr. Dorrell) made the very good argument that it is a curious idea that the best way to allocate resources is to keep funds within existing companies. The argument that the management of existing companies should not distribute profits in the form of dividends is absurd, because innovation often occurs in new companies. Freeing up funds from companies does not necessarily mean that those funds go to consumption and are lost from investment, because it can often be positive. When the economy has done well in recent years, it has often involved new businesses with, it must be said, private equity.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o334"><a name="70417-0018.htm_para2"><a name="070417102000054">At the time, the argument was made that high dividend payouts are not necessarily bad for a company in terms of long-term investment, because high dividends often increase a company&#146;s share value, and an increased share value improves a company&#146;s position to borrow. The argument does not stand together either in theory or as it has turned out in practice.</p>

 Had the hon. Gentleman been present in the House during the earlier part of the debate, he would know that we have gone through that. As he well knows, Conservative party policy will be very clear at the next general election. The fact remains that the 1997 decision was made on the basis that it would help investment, but the evidence that emerged in the following 10 years shows that it simply did not do so. The purpose was to raise revenue, which, as I have said, is the purpose of taxation, but that was not how it was presented. That is the charge that we have made against the Chancellor.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o335"><a name="70417-0018.htm_para3"><a name="070417102000057">What the Chancellor did in 1997 is something that he has done many times since&#151;he raised taxes, but he did not say, &#147;Look, I&#146;m raising revenue. These are the downsides, but I want the extra money to spend on public services.&#148; In that case, he said, &#147;It is all for the purpose of improving investment&#148;, which was palpably false. In the pre-Budget report, he claimed that he is helping the environment by doubling the rate of air passenger duty, when the truth is that that was for the purpose of raising revenue. It has been the style of the Chancellor throughout not to be open and transparent about his policies, but to try to conceal tax-raising policies by claiming that they are some kind of technicality.</p>

First, it does nothing for the credibility of politicians as a whole when we are not open and clear with the electorate. Secondly, as my hon. Friend the Member for Putney (Justine Greening) has said, had it been clear that greater demands were being made upon pension funds, and had people realised that would be expected of them in their personal contributions, then maybe people would have adjusted their behaviour, but they did not do so, which is partly the fault of the Chancellor for not making the situation clear.</p>

The Chancellor made great play of the fact that he has increased the amount from &#163;2 billion to &#163;8 billion but, as Treasury officials confirmed to the Treasury Committee, if one looks at it on a net present value basis, as every actuary would, the figure is much lower&#151;&#163;1.9 billion. There was no extra money. There are no extra sums for it in the Department for Work and Pensions budget; it comes out of the existing budget over a 60-year period.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o340"><a name="70417-0018.htm_para8"><a name="070417102000062">That is important because the financial assistance scheme is supposed, but is failing, to help many of our constituents who have been left without their occupational pensions.

As a member of the Treasury Committee, I was particularly frustrated by the fact that it was released on the Friday after Parliament had gone into recess, as that was the day after he had given evidence to the Committee.

He claims, as a Chancellor, to be caring and compassionate, but he has done very little for the 125,000 workers exposed to losing their occupational pension funds.

It also took &#163;270 million out of the then pension fund surplus and put it into its profit and loss account. In the decade after 1992, almost &#163;1.5 billion was taken from its pension fund and almost two thirds given back to shareholders in the form of higher profits and larger dividends. I can envisage people saying, &#147;Nothing wrong with that.&#148; However, last month, the company announced that it would close its final salary scheme to new entrants. It has failed to provide for liabilities in the long term.</p>

That has been mentioned in the debate, though not as often as I expected. The developed world is getting older and that poses daunting challenges. Declining birth rates means that the work force is not being replenished in western Europe, Japan and north America. The ratio of workers to pensioners is getting smaller and that will have a momentous impact on productivity rates and tax levels. That is happening throughout the developed work and I therefore find it odd that the Opposition have not mentioned it in the debate.</p>

That is far from being the case. A recent report by PricewaterhouseCoopers suggests that the state retirement age should be increased to around 70 in Germany and around 72 in Italy to allow state and occupational pensions to continue to be linked to earnings with unchanged contribution rates. PricewaterhouseCoopers also states that further delays will only make the required reforms more painful in the long term.</p>

I am trying to advance the case that there are more fundamental, long-term changes taking place.

We have heard how Lord Lawson, as Chancellor, decided to tax pension fund surpluses in the mid-1980s, providing a marked incentive for companies to reduce those surpluses through payment holidays or additional dividends. That demonstrated short-term gain at the expense of long-term consideration for the British economy and the health of pension funds. The Thatcher and Major Governments also encouraged a shift away from occupational pensions towards individual private pensions.</p>

From what I have heard today, however, I do not think that that will happen.</p>

 Is it not worth recalling that the adviser to Lord Lamont, the Chancellor who cut the dividend, was the right hon. Member for Witney (Mr. Cameron), who now leads the Conservative party? Is not it extraordinary that, when advising the then Government, he pursued one policy, yet when in opposition, he advocates another?</p>

 My hon. Friend makes a good point. This has been mentioned earlier in the debate as well. I was reading Lord Lamont&#146;s memoirs in the Library this morning, and I was struck by the fact that, when the right hon. Member for Witney (Mr. Cameron) was employed as a special adviser, Lord Lamont described him as an old Etonian with a taste for the good life. I wonder what that means.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o358"><a name="70417-0018.htm_para26"><a name="070417102000091">It is true that the Chancellor in his 1997 Budget abolished tax relief on dividends, but that was accompanied by a range of other policies designed to move us away from short-termism towards stability and encouraging long-term investment. Corporation tax was cut to its lowest ever rate at that time in the UK. The small companies tax rate was cut by 2 per cent., to 21 per cent. There was a doubling&#151;we have not heard about this today&#151;of capital allowances on plant and machinery for small and medium-sized firms so that if companies invested in 1997-98, they could set off against tax a half of their total investment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o359"><a name="70417-0018.htm_para27"><a name="070417102000092">In those decisions made in 1997, the Chancellor laid the foundation for sustained economic growth. That was the conclusion of the International Monetary Fund in the past few weeks in its article IV consultation with the UK, which stated:</p>
<a name="70417-0018.htm_brev4"><a name="070417102000117"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;The Executive Directors welcomed the economy&#146;s continued economic performance, which they attributed in part to policy frameworks that are responsive to the requirements for sustained strong growth, low inflation, a stable value for sterling and continuing growth of London as a global financial Centre with sound institutions.&#148;</p>

They have saved all their working lives and feel let down by changes and cuts to their planned provision. To tackle the plight of my constituents and others, a consensus is needed between the House, the Government, companies and individuals to ensure that those pensioners who have saved all their working lives in occupational schemes secure the benefits for which they planned. However, the comments and interventions by Conservative Members show that we are a long way from that consensus.</p>

around the world over the past 15 years. That has been mentioned time and time again. High returns in the 1980s prompted complacency and the feeling that the sun would shine for ever. That obviously was notthe case.</p>

The NASDAQ dropped to as low as 1,108.49, a 78.4 per cent. decline from its all-time high of March 2000, a result of the bursting of the dotcom bubble, and the Dow Jones lost 26 per cent. of its value between 1999 and 2002&#151;you can tell that I am a chartered accountant, Mr. Deputy Speaker. Given the openness of the UK economy and the central position of London in the world&#146;s finance markets, it is inevitable that this country would feel the brunt. Between 1999 and 2002, the FTSE 100 fell by 43 per cent., knocking some &#163;250 billion off the value of pension fund assets. Yet pension fund deficits have reduced markedly over the past few years, reflecting the stock market improvement in recent months and years. Last month, Deloitte, a firm that I used to work for, forecast that the total deficit for the final salary pension schemes of the UK top 100 companies is currently &#163;21 billion, with 25 per cent. of schemes now having a surplus.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o364"><a name="70417-0019.htm_para2"><a name="070417102000097">The first three months of 2007 have been a roller-coaster ride. In the last week of February, deficits rose by &#163;20 billion in one week as world stock markets fell dramatically. However, a combination of a recovery in the stock markets and a fall in the price of bonds have reduced deficits to a five-year low, showing the close correlation between stock market performance and the health of pension funds. If the Conservative party were determined to secure a consensus on this subject, that close correlation would be recognised.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o365"><a name="70417-0019.htm_para3"><a name="070417102000098">I began by saying that providing for retirement is one of the biggest problems facing this country. Difficulties and challenges are being prompted by an ageing population, an end to paternalism, social changes, lower stock market performance and annual returns, and a wish for companies to transfer the risk of retirement away from themselves towards employees and the Government. There was an opportunity for Opposition Members to pledge consensus and seek to find appropriate ways of securing stability and reassurance for pensioners in the face of those massive global changes, but they failed to do that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o366"><a name="70417-0019.htm_para4"><a name="070417102000099">The use of terms such as &#147;pension crisis&#148; and the wording of today&#146;s Opposition motion, however brief it is, further undermine confidence in a pensions system that is still trying to recover from the likes of Maxwell, mis-selling and Equitable Life. As was pointed out by the hon. Member for Putney (Justine Greening), who is no longer in the Chamber, that puts people off. People are reluctant to save for their retirement through pension contributions, believing that it is not worth doing. That will do nothing to help those with occupational pensions who find themselves unfairly caught up in major global forces.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o367"><a name="70417-0019.htm_para5"><a name="070417102000100">Today the Conservative party has ignored an opportunity to talk constructively about the long-term future of the country&#146;s economy and provision in retirement. Instead, it has focused on distorting history for their own narrow, short-term political advantage. No change there, then!</p>

I consider&#151;with respect to the hon. Member for Hartlepool, and to other Labour Members&#151;that two main charges have been levelled at the Chancellor and his handling of pensions so far. One concerns the impact of the pension tax raid on the long-term value of pensions; but I think the stronger concerns the fact it was done in an underhand way, with no openness or transparency. Today, 10 years on, we were treated to a speech from the Chancellor that again failed to be honest about the reality of what is going on. That, more than anything else&#151;the lack of openness, transparency and honesty&#151;is the reason for people&#146;s loss of confidence in the pensions system.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o379"><a name="70417-0019.htm_para17"><a name="070417105000015">The link with earnings was broken in 1980. The Chancellor claimed today that he had brought it back. That was another of his little slips with the truth&#151;he never quite gets it. He has not brought that link back; he has said that if it can be afforded it might be brought back in 2012. Ever since I have been involved in parliamentary politics, I have campaigned&#151;as, I am glad to be able to say, has my party&#151;to bring back that link, because it is important that we restore dignity to people in old age. We must minimise the number of people who are forced to rely on means-tested benefits. Because the means-tested benefit has been allowed to grow de facto with earnings and yet the basic state pension has risen merely in line with prices, the number of people who have been drawn into means-tested benefits has increased. The predictions for the period to 2050 are truly horrifying. That is why the House needs to look ahead on a consensual, cross-party basis and find a better way of dealing with our pensions system than we have had in the past, particularly in the past 10 years when this Chancellor has failed. One of the purposes of this debate is that, by bringing the Chancellor&#146;s record to account, we can help outline the reality of the position in which we find ourselves today, and when that is properly observed and understood we can move forward on a cross-party basis and find a solution to our pension problems.</p>

specialists that suggests that the pension tax would cause great damage to the country&#146;s economy and the poorest pensioners and then goes ahead with it in any case? Perhaps only someone with breathtaking arrogance would do that. What sort of person would announce such a change in such an underhand way and seek to cover his tracks so assiduously? I will leave the House to decide on the answer to that for fear of breaching parliamentary language.</p>

Unfortunately, the answer to that is: more underhand behaviour. Members noted that the Treasury papers came out on 30 March when Parliament was in recess and the Chancellor was in Afghanistan. That chain of events might not have been quite as extreme as another example of a good day to bury bad news, but that clumsy cover-up is symptomatic of the manipulative relationship that the prospective Prime Minister has with Parliament and with pensioners.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o382"><a name="70417-0019.htm_para20"><a name="070417105000018">Fairness and openness have been dismissed as qualities that we can expect from the Chancellor if he succeeds to higher office. He maintained today&#151;as he has done since 1997&#151;that the removal of tax credit from pensions has boosted investment and performance. The suggestion that taking money away from pension funds was somehow going to boost investment has been commented on by many Opposition Members. Many colleagues have referred to the figures, but it is worth giving the precise figures. When Labour came to power in 1997, business investment was 11 per cent. of GDP. Now, according to the 2006 figures from the Office for National Statistics, it is9.1 per cent. That shoots that particular fox.</p>

However, we have heard the most compelling evidence today from the former Chancellor, my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Rushcliffe (Mr. Clarke), and from the former Financial Secretary, my right hon. Friend the Member for Charnwood (Mr. Dorrell), that the Ministers in that Conservative Government considered the issues, listened to the representations from Treasury officials and others and concluded that it would damage pension funds and the economy, and that it would hurt those with least. The members of that Conservative Government decided not to abolish that 20 per cent, advance corporation tax or dividend tax relief&#151;whatever it is called. That shoots the Chancellor&#146;s other fox.</p>

Let us look at what has happened to occupational pensions on the Chancellor&#146;s watch, because that would seem the most obvious thing to do, rather than only obsessing about the tax grab. The truth is that more than 60,000 occupational pension schemes have wound up or begun the process of winding up since Labour took office in 1997. Labour Members have suggested&#151;in the peculiar Brownite way of picking dates that do not sound very natural&#151;that the schemes were all collapsing anyway, but five sixths of the final salary schemes that have closed have done so since  <br>

2000. The idea that they were collapsing under the last Conservative Government is entirely false: it has happened on the Chancellor&#146;s watch. The pension schemes have collapsed, they have closed to new members. As my hon. Friend the Member for Putney (Justine Greening) so powerfully set out earlier, we have seen the opportunity of a secure old age through their pensions, hope for the future and confidence in those who govern them removed from young people.</p>

 What is the hon. Gentleman&#146;s policy for reviving the fortunes of occupational pension schemes?</p>

 If the hon. Gentleman had spent more time in his place during the debate, he would not keep repeating points that have already been made. The policies of Her Majesty&#146;s Opposition will be made clear before the next election. So many schemes have closed. The destruction has happened, and that may mean that when the next Conservative Government comes in 2009 or 2010 we may have to find alternative ways of promoting saving and encouraging the young people who have lost so much confidence and can see no positive future. However, it is above my pay grade to say exactly what we will do.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o385"><a name="70417-0019.htm_para23"><a name="070417105000023">When we consider the record of this Chancellor and Government on occupational pensions, we see that12.7 million UK workers, or 45 per cent., have no pension provision&#151;a rise of 5 per cent. since 1997 or 2.1 million more people. More thoughtful Labour Members will find that a sobering thought. At a time when the economy has broadly done quite well&#151;if not as well as the Chancellor likes to make out&#151;and this country has grown richer and had a period of stability, thanks to the foundations laid by the last Conservative Government<i> &#151;[</i><i> Interruption.</i><i> ]</i> Ministers may scoff, but when they rest their heads on their pillows tonight, they cannot be proud of the fact that in that time&#151;which has not been an economic disaster&#151;2.1 million more people do not have occupational pensions. Far from growing, under this Chancellor private pension provision has suffered an underlying decline.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o386"><a name="70417-0019.htm_para24"><a name="070417105000024">The Opposition have made a strong case against the Chancellor. We have used the evidence provided by many specialists to lay out the figures, but they are not precise: I have repeatedly asked Ministers to give us their estimate of the impact on pension funds of the abolition of dividend tax relief, but it has not been forthcoming. I should be delighted if the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, when he winds up the debate, were to give us an honest assessment, but I expect that he will refuse to answer&#151;just as the Government refused to give the papers to <i> The Times</i><i> </i>until forced to do so.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o387"><a name="70417-0019.htm_para25"><a name="070417105000025">We have made the case that pension funds have suffered a great loss as a result of the tax change. Although stock market fluctuations and various other factors have had an effect, we believe that the Chancellor, when he took away &#163;100 billion or &#163;150 billion from the pension funds, inflicted a mortal blow&#151;to them, and to people&#146;s confidence in them.</p>

 It is always a great pleasure, and an increasingly frequent one, to follow my hon. Friend the Member for Beverley Holderness (Mr. Stuart). He spoke with his customary vigour, both in his main contribution and in his several robust interventions earlier.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o389"><a name="70417-0019.htm_para27"><a name="070417105000028">This is a very important debate, for various reasons but not least because it will have an impact on a great many people outside the House. The hon. Member for Hartlepool (Mr. Wright) made a very thoughtful and welcome speech, in which he set out some of the demographic matters that had not been mentioned before. It is a fact that 18.5 per cent. of this country&#146;s population are over the age of 65, yet many people, until approaching retirement, have no real understanding of the significance of pension arrangements. Moreover, a great many of the people who have retired have suffered the shock of discovering that their pension schemes have closed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o390"><a name="70417-0019.htm_para28"><a name="070417105000029">As we have heard, more and more people find themselves in pension difficulty as each year goes by. I am especially worried about that, because so many people choose to live out their retirement days in my constituency: 26 per cent. of my constituents are over 65, and the proportion is expected to rise to 30 per cent. by the end of the decade. One reason why I was especially interested to join the Work and Pensions Committee when I came to the House was that, during the last general election, a great many people raised their concerns with me about the pensions crisis developing under this Government. In my constituency, members of pensioner groups and the local Senior Citizens Forums regularly ask me what can be done to put right the damage inflicted on pensions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o391"><a name="70417-0019.htm_para29"><a name="070417105000030">Generally speaking, people have lost confidence in their retirement prospects, but that is not entirely due to the decision to abolish dividend tax credit. I do not intend to argue that that was the sole reason, as the problem has several contributory factors&#151;one of the most fundamental being that the savings ratio has halved over the past 10 years. This is an argument for which the Government take no responsibility, but it is a fact that savings have declined significantly partly because people do not believe that it is in their best interests to save for their retirement.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o392"><a name="70417-0019.htm_para30"><a name="070417105000031">Returns from pensions have been cut, as we heard just a moment ago, with the decline in the number of defined benefit schemes. Only a third are now open to new members compared with the number in 1997. The income from final salary schemes is falling across the country. Defined contribution schemes, for all their attractions to the funders, are not expected to provide the same level of income in retirement as the final salary schemes that they replace.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o393"><a name="70417-0019.htm_para31"><a name="070417105000032">Another major issue that is having a big impact on people&#146;s confidence in retirement has been the threat of means testing. There was a big discussion about that earlier, which I will not repeat. I recognise that a large part of the measures in the Pensions Bill is aimed at reining back the spread of means testing. I welcome that because otherwise, as Lord Turner&#146;s report demonstrated, 70 per cent. of the population would be on means-tested pension benefits.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o394"><a name="70417-0020.htm_para0"><a name="070417105000033">This debate is important in that it has secured the presence of the Chancellor. My hon. Friend the shadow Chancellor made some important points to tease out of the Chancellor a glimmer of acknowledgement that some share of the responsibility for the problems that have arisen in the occupational pensions sector in the past 10 years could be attributed to him and what he did in the 1997 Budget.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o395"><a name="70417-0020.htm_para1"><a name="070417105000034">The debate is relevant not only to the people in this Chamber and not just because the Chancellor has ambitions to succeed the Prime Minister. It is relevant to Labour Members, who have been able to see his reaction and whether he can say sorry, as he was asked to do by my hon. Friend the shadow Chancellor; whether he is able to show some element of contrition and responsibility for the action that he took. I regret to say that there was little evidence of that in his speech today.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o396"><a name="70417-0020.htm_para2"><a name="070417105000035">The debate is also relevant following such a long period of denial of the fact that the 1997 decision had any impact on occupational schemes. It is evident from so much external commentary and comments in the debate today that the decision had a significant impact, the scale of which is up for discussion.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o397"><a name="70417-0020.htm_para3"><a name="070417105000036">The Chancellor&#146;s contribution to the debate will have disappointed many not only on the Opposition Benches but on his own Benches, and most independent commentators. It will have been of considerable concern to my constituents and other people watching from outside the House. It was a disappointing speech from a potential Prime Minister. It was disappointing for the message that he had to give, first, that it was not a real problem, and, secondly, that if there was a problem, it was not of his making.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o398"><a name="70417-0020.htm_para4"><a name="070417105000037">The Chancellor&#146;s mantra has been that under his stewardship there has been no return to boom and bust. He has mentioned it in every single pre-Budget report and Budget statement since he has had the job. But under his watch in the past 10 years, a large number of defined benefit schemes have gone bust, and two thirds of them have closed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o399"><a name="70417-0020.htm_para5"><a name="070417105000038">Some have questioned why we are raising the matter only now, 10 years after the event. It is perfectly obvious why: we are raising it on the first available opportunity after the evidence was revealed following much teeth pulling from within the Treasury just before the Easter recess. The Opposition are often criticised for not raising the issue regularly in the House and through the media. However, there have been some helpful contributions today, not least from the hon. Member for Birmingham, Erdington (Mr. Simon), who magnificently went through a year-by-year catalogue of the occasions on which this issue was raised by distinguished Members of this House, especially on the Opposition Benches.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o400"><a name="70417-0020.htm_para6"><a name="070417105000039">The Chancellor has fought revealing the information doggedly for the past couple of years. He has issued a fog of denial which has enveloped not just himself but most Labour Members. Few seem to have recognised what happened in 1997. We have heard some astonishing tales of denial, with the exception of two contributions from Labour Members, one from the right hon. Member for Birkenhead (Mr. Field), who referred to the double body blow&#151;the first was an attempt to attack the shadow Chancellor but the second presumably related to the precise measure that the Chancellor introduced.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o401"><a name="70417-0020.htm_para7"><a name="070417105000040">The other contribution was from the hon. Member for Coventry, North-West (Mr. Robinson). His speech was revealing. He attempted to paint a caricature of my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Rushcliffe (Mr. Clarke) when he was Chancellor, but the hon. Gentleman&#146;s description could have been that of the present Chancellor. He talked about a Chancellor who was running up high debts, who had a poor forecasting record and indulged in pre-election spending booms. On the Conservative Benches, we recognise all those things as attributes of the present Chancellor. The hon. Gentleman&#146;s candid admission that the dividend tax credit was entirely a revenue-raising measure should percolate to other Labour Members.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o402"><a name="70417-0020.htm_para8"><a name="070417105000041">I want to highlight two misunderstandings that emerged through the fog on the Labour Benches&#151;I use the word &#147;fog&#148; to be charitable, but it may have been a deliberate attempt to spin Labour&#146;s side of the story. First, Labour Members tried to claim that before 1997 there were five Conservative cuts in dividend tax credit, which were analogous to the Chancellor&#146;s decision to abolish the credit. However, that claim does not recognise the fact that the first four cuts resulted from limiting the credit to the basic rate of income tax, which was successfully and successively cut by Conservative Chancellors during the 1980s and the early 1990s. That is not the same thing as abolition of the credit.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o403"><a name="70417-0020.htm_para9"><a name="070417105000042">Secondly, several Members criticised pension holidays as a major contributor to the pension crisis. The hon. Member for Amber Valley (Judy Mallaber), who is not in the Chamber, claimed that pension holidays were forced on companies by measures introduced in a Conservative Budget in the mid-1980s. To put Labour Members straight, the purpose of those measures was to stop companies sheltering profits in their already well-funded pension schemes. They were legitimate measures to ensure that profits came into the corporation tax net. As Opposition Members have said, notably my right hon. Friend the Member for Wokingham (Mr. Redwood), the whole structure of trusteeship in the pension fund industry, with independent trustees and reporting actuaries, militates against assets being taken out of funds&#151;other than in the Maxwell case, which was referred to earlier.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o404"><a name="70417-0020.htm_para10"><a name="070417105000043">Many Labour Members are confused about the impact of the dividend tax cut on pension schemes. I urge them to go back to their constituencies, as I am sure some will do for the local elections, and talk to their councillors about what has happened to council tax as a result of the need to restore some of the unfunded deficits in council pension schemes. They will get a much better answer if they ask how much the dividend tax credit contributed to the situation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o405"><a name="70417-0020.htm_para11"><a name="070417105000044">In conclusion, there is a degree of consensus on the need to sort out the current pension crisis and on what needs to be done to sort out state pensions and to restore the savings ratio and personal responsibility. However, consensus is best achieved when analysis of the causes of the problem is shared, so it is disappointing that throughout the debate there has been no hint of contrition from the Chancellor or his supporters about the causes of the problem or any recognition that it was of his making.</p>

Friend the shadow Chancellor set out the case and asked the Chancellor for a simple thing: he asked for an apology. But what did we get? We got an extraordinary rant from the Chancellor. Actually, it consisted of a speech with no interventions, followed by a series of interventions with no speech&#151;punctuated with all sorts of accusations and assertions. He accused the Tories of not having introduced the Pension Protection Fund before 1997, but there was no need for such a fund before 1997. He told us that auto-enrolment will mean that all employees will have a pension at work, showing that he clearly does not understand the challenges facing the personal accounts agenda.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o408"><a name="70417-0020.htm_para14"><a name="070417105000048">The Chancellor then told us that he is looking for long-term answers, but people in this country who believe that their pension is the longest-term issue for them will not understand that comment from a Chancellor who has shattered their confidence in their long-term savings. He told us that because of changes to corporation tax, employers could make higher contributions. That may or may not be the case, but the fact is that they did not make higher contributions. When confronted with the need to make good the deficits, they closed schemes instead, and there was no recognition at all from the Chancellor of the problems faced by the smaller companies, which often do not make profits and do not save corporation tax, that have been at the root cause of the problems faced by the 125,000 unfortunate people who have lost some or all of their pensions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o409"><a name="70417-0020.htm_para15"><a name="070417105000049">The Chancellor told the House that the problems of those pensioners were caused by their employers going bust, but he is quite wrong and obviously does not understand the position at all. Some of those employers have not gone bust and many others have gone bust without causing any problems to the pensions of their workers if their schemes were fully funded. The problem is the underfunding of the schemes, not the insolvency of the employers.</p>

(Mr. Clarke), who drew the House&#146;s attention to the extraordinary fact that the Chancellor, when in opposition, and my right hon. and learned Friend as Chancellor at the time, were considering precisely the same set of proposals and came to completely different conclusions. My right hon. and learned Friend was not prepared to take risks with the security in retirement of millions of ordinary people. He told us how just four sentences in the Chancellor&#146;s 1997 Budget concealed the largest tax-raising measure in it. Many of us will remember that Labour Members thought it was a tax cut. It took<i> The Times </i>of the next day to disabuse them of that.</p>

The Chancellor seems to think that that is the way to promote economic growth, but he should know that it leads to misallocation of capital resources. It should be the owners of capital who have the opportunity to decide where to invest it. Indeed, the Chancellor himself, in finally accepting the arguments for real estate investment trusts in the property sector, has acknowledged the truth of that point.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o413"><a name="70417-0020.htm_para19"><a name="070417105000053">My right hon. Friend the Member for Wokingham (Mr. Redwood) drew attention to the interesting fact that the FRS 17 has been almost exactly the same size as the estimated cost of the Chancellor&#146;s tax grab. He generously described both the Chancellor and the Economic Secretary as having mounted a clever defence of their policies. I am not sure whether that view persisted, however, when the Chancellor answered my right hon. Friend&#146;s intervention as to whether he would be worse or better off if 20 per cent. of his income were taken away by saying that he thought that he would not be any worse off if 20 per cent. of his income were lost.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o414"><a name="70417-0020.htm_para20"><a name="070417105000054">Then we heard from the hon. Member for Coventry, North-West (Mr. Robinson). We got a lecture on the skills necessary for opposition and a plea to be a bit kinder to the Chancellor. He made the extraordinary case that the mark of a serious Opposition is making policy in secret, locking it up during an election, concealing their tax raising plans, and then releasing them on an unsuspecting British public after that election is over. But at least we got from him a candid admission&#151;not in the debate tonight, but in his book, which was quoted&#151;that this was simply a revenue-raising measure. It was nothing to do with stimulating investment or promoting business. It was about hitting pensions&#151;a soft touch. He was honest; it is a pity that he could not have been so at the time.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o415"><a name="70417-0020.htm_para21"><a name="070417105000055">My right hon. Friend the Member for Hitchin and Harpenden (Mr. Lilley) made the key point that what matters is not simply the size of the pension funds, which the Chancellor quoted at the House, but the balance between their assets and liabilities. He drew attention to the real problem of trying to stimulate pensions saving in an environment of high levels of means-testing. That is a real difficulty for the personal accounts agenda, which the Chancellor appears not to recognise.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o416"><a name="70417-0020.htm_para22"><a name="070417105000056">Then we had a contribution from the hon.

the dramatic release by the Chancellor on 30 March of the hitherto secret documents.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o417"><a name="70417-0020.htm_para23"><a name="070417105000057">Until 1997, Britain had arguably the best pension provision in Europe and now it has arguably one of the worst. Part of the reason for that is the Chancellor&#146;s 1997 tax changes. Ministers deliberately concealed the impact of the annual tax raid, both before and after the event, and have consistently denied that wiping&#163;100 billion or so off the value of pension funds has had any negative effect on pension provision. The Paymaster General, who was then the Financial Secretary, said in July 1997:</p>
<a name="70417-0020.htm_brev1"><a name="070417105000076"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;our reforms will benefit pension funds.&#148;&#151;[<i> Official Report</i>,3 July 1997; Vol. 297, c. 508.]</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o418"><a name="70417-0020.htm_para24"><a name="070417105000058">The then Secretary of State for Trade and Industry told us that the reforms would be &#147;good for pensioners.&#148; The Chancellor himself reassured the country, saying:</p>
<a name="70417-0020.htm_brev2"><a name="070417105000077"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;We are not raiding pensions, that&#146;s just ridiculous&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o419"><a name="70417-0020.htm_para25"><a name="070417105000059">But a decade later, with the benefit of these documents, we know the extent of the Chancellor&#146;s reckless disregard of the warnings that he received and his shameful gambling with the future retirement security of millions of ordinary people. We know that only because of the freedom of information request made by <i> The Times</i>. The Chancellor told us that he welcomed the information coming into the public domain and he claimed credit for introducing the Freedom of Information Act 2000. So why for two years has he spent our money fighting the release of the papers that <i> The Times</i> requested, saying that their release would damage the process of government?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o420"><a name="70417-0020.htm_para26"><a name="070417105000060">Suddenly, when the damage to the Chancellor&#146;s own career progression seemed to be more at risk, the damage to the process of government faded into insignificance and out the papers came&#151;on a Friday afternoon, after Parliament had risen for the Easter recess, when the Chancellor was safely abroad engaged in statesman-like posturing in Afghanistan. The Economic Secretary, whose hands are far from clean in this matter, was left to defend the indefensible. Tonight, we are faced with the even more ludicrous spectacle of the Chancellor&#146;s position being defended by the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions. I would repeat his comments on the Chancellor&#146;s fitness for the highest office, except that you have previously ruled that they are too unparliamentary to be quoted in the Chamber, Mr. Speaker.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o421"><a name="70417-0020.htm_para27"><a name="070417105000061">The Chancellor knew from the outset that his position was untenable. That is why he resisted for two years releasing the papers and why he released them only when Parliament was in recess and when he had put 6,000 miles between himself and this place. Labour deceived the electorate in the 1997 election into believing that it was committed to no new taxes and the Government concealed the effect of the changes after they had implemented them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o422"><a name="70417-0020.htm_para28"><a name="070417105000062">When the whole story came out on 30 March, the Economic Secretary and the former Paymaster General engaged in a predictable series of ducking and weaving exercises in the Chancellor&#146;s absence. First, they said that this was all done on the advice of civil servants, but the documents released proved that that was not the case. They then said, &#147;Actually, the CBI told us to do it, so that&#146;s all right,&#148; until up popped Lord Turner to say that that was completely wrong. Despite a few mumblings off in private, I have not heard any Government Minister  <br>

say in public that Lord Turner was lying, so if that is what the Government want us to believe, perhaps someone will jump up and say so.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o423"><a name="70417-0020.htm_para29"><a name="070417105000063">The hon. Gentlemen then claimed that the whole package stimulated business investment, but business investment has fallen as a percentage of GDP<i> &#151;[</i><i> Interruption.</i><i> ]</i> Yes, it has. The Government then said, &#147;The Tories did it,&#148; but there was a world of difference between the adjustments that my noble Friend Lord Lamont made to dividend tax credit and the wholesale abolition that the Chancellor undertook. I remind the Chancellor that my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Rushcliffe had taken the decision that no further cuts in dividend tax credit were appropriate or possible.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o424"><a name="70417-0020.htm_para30"><a name="070417105000064">The facts are that the pension tax raid was the Chancellor&#146;s decision, that it was taken against the advice of his civil servants, the CBI and the Prime Minister, and that it was not an adjustment of rates, but a carefully planned and executed raid that totally abolished dividend tax relief for pension funds. Even after taking the corporation tax changes into account, the raid resulted in a net gain to the Treasury of &#163;3.5 billion. It did not deliver increased business investment, it did not boost productivity growth and it did not help any of the other fundamental drivers of prosperity in our economy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o425"><a name="70417-0020.htm_para31"><a name="070417105000065">I readily recognise that the Chancellor&#146;s tax grab was not the only factor affecting pensions, but it was the factor over which he had direct control. The end result is that Britain&#146;s gold standard pension system has been reduced to ruins. Some 60,000 schemes with 1 million members have wound up since 1997. Over the same decade on the Chancellor&#146;s watch, final salary schemes, except those in the public sector, have lurched into terminal decline&#151;less than 10 per cent. of the private sector work force now have access to them. More than &#163;100 billion has been wiped off the value of pension funds and more than &#163;7 billion of annual cash flow is now being sucked into the Chancellor&#146;s coffers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o426"><a name="70417-0020.htm_para32"><a name="070417105000066">For the 125,000 people whose pension schemes have failed with insufficient funds to pay them what they are due, the crisis is not a future problem, but something that is real and immediate. The Chancellor has turned his back on those people, which was why my hon. Friend the Member for Tatton (Mr. Osborne) today outlined the measures that we will propose with cross-party support in the House<i> &#151;[</i><i> Interruption.</i><i> ]</i> The measures are supported in all parts of the House, except the Government Front Bench. They represent a consensus around the moral and pragmatic case for delivering proper benefits to that group of victims.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o427"><a name="70417-0020.htm_para33"><a name="070417105000067">The truth is that the Chancellor thought that he could get away with it. He thought that as long as the dot.com bubble lasted, no one would notice &#163;100 billion or so. He gambled with the future retirement security of millions of ordinary, hard-working people. When the bubble burst and he lost, they were left to pick up the tab&#151;they will not forget that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o428"><a name="70417-0020.htm_para34"><a name="070417105000068">The debate is about the Chancellor, his judgment and his operating style. We have heard how he plotted his tax raid in secret, how he ignored the advice of everyone&#151;colleagues, civil servants and the Prime Minister&#151;how he dissembled about the effects of his 1997 announcement, and how he has tried to deny the consequences and suppress the evidence ever since.  <br>

Finally, we have heard how he tried to bury bad news when he could no longer keep it hidden in the Treasury.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o429"><a name="70417-0020.htm_para35"><a name="070417105000069">Tonight, the question and the motion on the Order Paper are about the Chancellor&#146;s handling of occupational pensions. However, he knows that the question on the lips of millions of pensioners and savers throughout Britain goes wider than that. The House has a choice: it can express its solidarity with the millions of people whose pensions have been affected, or it can turn its back on those people and vote for the Government&#146;s whitewash amendment, which actually praises the decision to scrap tax credits. We can reflect the huge concern across Britain about what has happened to our pensions, and about the Chancellor&#146;s role in that regard, or we can turn a deaf ear to the questions that are rightly being asked about the judgment and the style of the man who aspires to the highest office in the land.</p>

 First, I congratulate all my hon. Friends, who made excellent speeches in the debate. I will come to their speeches in a second. We heard two interesting things from the Opposition Front-Bench spokesmen today. <i> [Interruption.] </i>No, they were interesting. I was here for all of the debate, and I counted two interesting things. The first was that, according to the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge (Mr. Hammond), the Conservatives did not cut the dividend tax credit; they simply adjusted it. I think that we will keep a close eye on that type of rhetoric, and perhaps we will find that it applies more widely when we come to consider their record in Government.</p>

My right hon. Friend the Member for West Dunbartonshire referred to the hypocrisy and hullabaloo around the issue, and in particular to the way in which the shadow Chancellor presented his so-called argument. He made the important point that in the Chamber, personal abuse and personal attacks are not really a substitute for a sound argument. There was no substance whatever to the remarks that the hon.

to those made by Opposition Members. My hon. Friend the Member for Hartlepool made an excellent speech. I think that I am right in saying that he was the only accountant to speak today. <i> [Interruption.]</i> Well, there may have been other accountants, but my hon.

<p><a name="stpa_o433"><a name="70417-0021.htm_para3"><a name="0704183000007">The hon. Member for Twickenham (Dr. Cable), who spoke for the Liberal Democrats, suggested that the attacks made on the Chancellor by the Opposition were unfair, but said that he would vote with the Opposition anyway. That summarises in a nutshell the position that the Liberal Democrats usually end up taking. Of the speeches made by Conservative Members, I shall refer briefly to those made by the former Chancellor of the Exchequer, the right hon. and learned Member for Rushcliffe (Mr. Clarke), who I see is in the Chamber; the right hon. Member for Charnwood (Mr. Dorrell), who served with the former Chancellor in the Treasury; and the right hon. Member for Hitchin and Harpenden, who also has an interesting track record on the matters that we are discussing. He served in the Treasury at the time of cuts&#151;I am sorry, adjustments&#151;to the dividend tax credits. In addition&#151;and this is probably a unique achievement&#151;he was a Minister during the pensions mis-selling crisis. Not only that, he was the author of the disastrous reforms that the Conservative Government proposed to make to the basic state pension, which, we should remember, would have abolished personal tax relief for pensions. He asked me earlier to give way, and I am happy to do so now.</p>

He said that the dividend tax credit changes that my right hon. Friend the Chancellor introduced in 1997 broke the principle that pension contributions are exempt on investment and taxed on receipt. I remind him that my right hon. Friend&#146;s changes did not change any of the fundamental principles of the taxation of pensions. Contributions to pensions remain exempt from tax and, indeed, my right hon. Friend has introduced important simplifications to the tax regime for pensions. Investment returns in pension schemes remain exempt from taxation.</p>

 That is simply not right. Payments by companies of dividends come out of taxed income. Dividends received by pension funds are therefore taxed income. It was to avoid that double taxation of income received as dividends being taxed again when distributed as pensions that the original imputation system of corporation tax was established. It was precisely to avoid the double taxation that the Secretary of State says does not exist.</p>

 I am grateful, Mr. Speaker. The problem&#151;and it is a problem not just for the right hon. Member for Charnwood but for all the Opposition Members who spoke in the debate&#151;is that the logic of his speech is that he would reverse the changes to dividend tax credit. That is the one policy that we all waited to hear about today, but we did not hear it. It was conspicuous that in the speeches of Opposition Members&#151;<i> [</i><i> Interruption.</i><i> ] </i>There is no point in their trying to barrack me and make their speeches again, as they had an opportunity, which they completely fluffed. It is evident to everyone watching the debate that the Tories have no policy to address the problem that they have spent the past six and a half hours describing in detail to the House.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o435"><a name="70417-0021.htm_para5"><a name="0704183000017">Opposition Members have had plenty of time to make their position clear. We made those changes to the tax regime 10 years ago, and there have been two general elections in the intervening period. Just to remind them, we won those general elections because of the stewardship of my right hon. Friend the Chancellor and because of the way in which we have governed the country. After two general elections and 10 years of waiting, there is still no hint of a Tory policy and no commitment to reverse the changes about which they have complained. This has been one of the worst performances by the Opposition that I have witnessed in my time in this House.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o436"><a name="70417-0021.htm_para6"><a name="0704183000018">According to Conservative Members&#151;we heard this throughout their speeches&#151;this Government supposedly inherited one of the best pension environments in the world in 1997, which explicitly underpinned most of what the right hon. and learned Member for Rushcliffe said in his speech. The only problem with that argument is that the facts tell a different story. In 1997, nearly3 million pensioners were living in poverty. Many women were denied the opportunity to secure a full basic state pension in their own right, and carers were similarly mistreated by the system. It was no golden age of private pension schemes, either. The mis-selling of private pensions, which was overseen by the previous Government, many of whose members are still here today, was a national disgrace. Millions of workers had no access to occupational pensions. That was no utopia.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o437"><a name="70417-0021.htm_para7"><a name="0704183000019">We need to be clear about one more thing, too. As my right hon. Friend the Chancellor has said, the shift from defined benefit schemes towards defined contribution schemes is not a UK phenomenon brought about by changes to corporation tax. Far from it&#151;as the Chancellor and many Labour Members have made clear, the effects of demographic change have impacted on pension schemes and systems right across the globe.

 I do not understand the point that the Secretary of State has just made about the situation in 1997, when, of course, everything was not perfect in the occupational pensions world. Does he accept that it was precisely because the three new Labour leaders believed that pension funds were in an impregnable financial position that they thought that the pension funds could stand a &#163;5 billion a year loss without anybody having anything to worry about? There has been a move away from direct benefit pensions elsewhere, because other problems have occurred for pensions everywhere. In this country, the avalanche out of defined benefit schemes into other types of schemes, or none at all, grotesquely exceeds anything in any other jurisdiction.</p>

 I am sorry, but I cannot remember what the right hon. and learned Gentleman was saying at the beginning of his intervention. The changes were part of a series of reforms to corporation tax that were designed to address what many people, including the Conservative party when it was in Government, had identified as a distortion in the tax system. The Conservative Government made their five separate adjustments to dividend tax credits, but the point of my right hon. Friend&#146;s reforms was to make sure that we could then go further and cut corporation tax.

 I expect that you, Mr. Speaker, and I were fortunate when we were growing up some 50 years ago&#151;when we were both teenagers&#151;in that the need for financial education was limited. The only problem that my family had with finance was managing until the next payday. Credit cards, individual savings accounts, overdrafts, student loans, annual percentage rates or even mortgages were as remote as they were irrelevant. I am glad to see that the hon. Member for Dewsbury (Mr. Malik) is in his place, as he is from Burnley, where I grew up.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o447"><a name="70417-0022.htm_para6"><a name="0704188000549">Financial education, as taught by my father, consisted of the simple philosophy of Mr. Micawber:</p>
<a name="70417-0022.htm_brev4"><a name="0704188000602"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Annual income twenty pounds, annual expenditure nineteen nineteen and six, result happiness. Annual income twenty pounds, annual expenditure twenty pounds ought and six, result misery.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o448"><a name="70417-0022.htm_para7"><a name="0704188000550">Today&#146;s young people face a more complex financial picture. They live in a country where last year 107,000 people became insolvent, 5,300 people a day went to Citizens Advice for debt advice and our combined consumer debt reached &#163;1.3 trillion&#151;more than our GDP.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o449"><a name="70417-0022.htm_para8"><a name="0704188000551">It appears that as we have become more affluent we have abandoned not only the philosophy of Mr. Micawber, but our senses when it comes to finance. Right hon. and hon. Members will have dozens of examples of constituents who are in dire financial situations, often through an inability to budget or to understand financial products, and a failure to comprehend financial terminology. That is hardly surprising. An ifs School of Finance survey in 2004 revealed that 79 per cent. of people did not know what APR meant, 30 per cent. did not know what a standing order was,20 per cent. could not understand the concept of inflation, and 50 per cent. did not know what 50 per cent. was.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o450"><a name="70417-0022.htm_para9"><a name="0704188000552">Inevitably, that lack of financial knowledge is especially prevalent in the young. A Finance Society survey in January 2007 found that most youngsters thought that an ISA&#151;an individual savings account&#151;was an iPod accessory, and that winning the lottery was the best way to fund retirement.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o451"><a name="70417-0022.htm_para10"><a name="0704188000553">I am sure that no one in the House would dispute that people need to be better educated financially, or that that education should start in our schools and colleges.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman has mentioned credit cards, but is he aware that a survey found that young people thought that the credit card with the highest APR was the best one to have?</p>

 The hon. Gentleman makes my point exactly&#151;that young people&#146;s inability to understand simple terminology is a serious problem. To be fair, the Government&#146;s 2007 publication entitled &#147;Financial Capability: the Government&#146;s long-term approach&#148; said that all children and young people should</p>
<a name="70417-0022.htm_brev5"><a name="0704188000603"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;have access to a planned and coherent programme of personal finance education, so that they leave school with the skills and confidence to manage their money well&#148;.</p>

<notus-date day="17" month="4" year="2007" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><b>17 Apr 2007 : Column 274</b><br>
education is a key skill that should sit alongside literacy, numeracy and ICT as a stand-alone element in the national curriculum, it will remain a lottery, and the nation will continue to regard financial illiteracy asthe norm.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o453"><a name="70417-0022.htm_para12"><a name="0704188000557">Sadly, the Department for Education and Skills does not agree that a stand-alone element is needed. Indeed, on 17 February my hon. Friend the Member for Falmouth and Camborne (Julia Goldsworthy) asked the Minister for Schools whether he intended to bring forward proposals to introduce a compulsory study of financial literacy in the national curriculum. The Minister said that he had no such plans, and I want to ask him why. The Government have stated that they are already delivering personal financial education through personal, social and health education, enterprise education, citizenship education and, from 2010, GCSE functional mathematics. However, like many others interested in these matters, I remain unconvinced that those initiatives, either alone or combined, are sufficient to equip our young people with the skills needed to manage their finances. I shall explain why.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o454"><a name="70417-0022.htm_para13"><a name="0704188000558">First, Ofsted says that many secondary schools are failing to teach PSHE at all, and that only a handful of the ones that do include personal finance. Even then, the amount of time devoted to the subject is minute. The Government are considering adding an element of economic well being&#151;another &#147;E&#148;&#151;to the PSHE course, yet that will not improve matters. The new programme will be known as PSHEE but, like the existing programme, it will be non-statutory and non-examinable. In other words, it will simply be optional.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o455"><a name="70417-0022.htm_para14"><a name="0704188000559">What about enterprise education, which is supposed to ensure that all 14 to 16-year-olds have five days enterprise activity? I welcome wholeheartedly the commitment to work-related learning, but it is related only tenuously to personal finance skills. Again, the amount of time allocated specifically to personal finance education will be very limited and&#151;crucially&#151;will also be optional and non-examinable.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o456"><a name="70417-0022.htm_para15"><a name="0704188000560">So what about the citizenship programme? The Government claim that that includes financial education, but once more there is little evidence that schools are offering any form of financial education in the citizenship programme. I welcome the fact that financial capability appears in the suggested syllabus, but many schools do not teach it at all. The citizenship programme may be compulsory, but financial education is not a compulsory part of it, as it clearly needs to be. Even the examinable GCSE short course in citizenship contains no questions even vaguely related to personal finance.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o457"><a name="70417-0022.htm_para16"><a name="0704188000561">Earlier today, I double-checked this by reading the specimen exam papers from OCR and Edexcel, neither of which contains this year a single question relating to personal finance. That cannot be right. The Education and Skills Committee concluded last month in an excellent report on citizenship that it is poorly taught and &#147;patchy at best&#148;. With ever-increasing pressure to deliver greater concentration on elements of identity, diversity and belonging, I fear that citizenship will fail to provide a sound vehicle to deliver core financial skills.</p>

</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o459"><a name="70417-0023.htm_para1"><a name="0704188000563">That is not financial education. Regrettably, it would appear that this latest Government initiative offers little other than a tasty soundbite but no real substance. Indeed, if I could make one plea to the Minister tonight, it would be to move away from the idea that maths is a natural home for anything relating to personal finance. Financial capability is first and foremost about behaviours, not about numeracy.</p>

 Does the hon. Gentleman agree that one of the problems is that we do not have a cohort of teachers trained to teach personal finance as a specific subject?</p>

<p><a name="st_o454"><a name="0704188000565"><a name="70417-0023.htm_spnew1"><a name="0704188001147"><b>Mr. Willis:</b>
 I certainly do agree. I will come on to that point in just a second.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o460"><a name="70417-0023.htm_para2"><a name="0704188000566">Of course, in looking at all the Government&#146;s financial education policies in the round, I am concerned that there is little if any evaluation of financial education programmes in our schools. Unfortunately, time will not permit me to elaborate, but I wish to alert the Minister to concerns raised in the Government&#146;s own report &#147;Financial education: a review of existing provision in the UK&#148; published by the Department for Work and Pensions in 2005. The report stated:</p>
<a name="70417-0023.htm_brev1"><a name="0704188000605"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Our review found that little formal measurement of the quality of financial education teaching&#148;&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o461"><a name="70417-0023.htm_para3"><a name="0704188000567">a point that the hon. Gentleman made&#151;</p>
<a name="70417-0023.htm_brev2"><a name="0704188000606"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;is taking place through Ofsted or any other inspection mechanism. Formal measurement is likely to reduce further with the new Ofsted inspection regime starting in September 2005.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o462"><a name="70417-0023.htm_para4"><a name="0704188000568">That is quite a damning comment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o463"><a name="70417-0023.htm_para5"><a name="0704188000569">Sprinkling personal finance across the curriculum has done little to improve financial capability and there is little evidence to suggest otherwise, so it is time for a different approach. Academic evidence from Tennyson and Nguyen published in 2001 and from the university of Manchester in 2006 suggested that a specifically designated course in which students know that its total aims relate to areas of financial management is more effective than courses that cover a wide range of areas. </p>

<p><a name="stpa_o464"><a name="70417-0023.htm_para6"><a name="0704188000570">The Manchester university report provides powerful evidence of the effect that financial education can have on behaviour and young people&#146;s lives. It found that the majority of young people taking a stand-alone financial educational qualification had made positive changes in the way in which they managed their money. Many changed to a different bank account; many looked for additional, non-traditional products such as mini cash ISAs and were fully equipped to handle their money when they went off to college or university. Ninety-five per cent. of students said that they were better able to manage their finances as a result of taking a dedicated stand-alone personal course.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o465"><a name="70417-0023.htm_para7"><a name="0704188000571">A further benefit of stand-alone qualifications is that we know whether any learning has taken place and thus whether changes in financial behaviour have occurred as a result. I cannot emphasise enough to the Minister that it is essential that any actions to improve financial capability are measurable. The simplest, most cost-effective way of doing so, which is most informative in  <br>

terms of the data produced, is to offer a course that requires accreditation. I accept that schools will say that it is yet more to fit into a crowded curriculum, yet more than 100 schools are already doing the equivalent of a GCSE course sponsored by ifs School of Finance. If they can do it, we need to be able to do it in the schools where students will benefit the most.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o466"><a name="70417-0023.htm_para8"><a name="0704188000572">Almost every aspect of modern life in the UK involves some form of financial transaction, irrespective of our income, class, background or academic ability. Finance impinges on everything we do so it should be taught as a stand-alone component of the curriculum. I acknowledge that there are some excellent initiatives in financial education that deserve the highest praise. I fully accept that some schools are working within the Government&#146;s overall programme and delivering high quality. Initiatives such as the learning money matters programme funded by the Financial Services Authority, in which Personal Finance Education Group employees offer teachers support via e-mail, telephone and personal visits, are super.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o467"><a name="70417-0023.htm_para9"><a name="0704188000573">I welcome those small steps, but it is really the role of the DFES to equip teachers with the skills and confidence to teach the subject by introducing a personal finance element in teacher training programmes. At present, there is no such element in any of those programmes. Maintaining the current approach and pursuing the path set by the Government for the next 10 years will not deliver the objective we seek&#151;a financially literate society. I hope, however, that the Minister will at least reconsider functional maths in relation to personal finance. I hope that he will carefully consider the Select Committee report on citizenship in relation to financial education and that he will examine the possibility of incorporating an element of financial education in all teacher training programmes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o468"><a name="70417-0023.htm_para10"><a name="0704188000574">Finally, I make a simple plea to the Minister. Will he look again at the evidence that supports making financial education a compulsory part of the national curriculum? Will he talk to the FSA, the ifs School of Finance, the Institute of Chartered Accountants, the Finance and Leasing Association and the Council of Mortgage Lenders? Look at the evidence, Minister, and make new plans.</p>

 I congratulate the hon. Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough (Mr. Willis) on securing this debate and on bringing an important subject to the attention of the House. Clearly he and I, and my hon. Friend the Member for West Bromwich, West (Mr. Bailey), agree that schools and colleges have an important role to play in ensuring that young people go out into the workplace with the skills they need to plan and manage their finances.</p>

As the hon. Gentleman said in his opening remarks, social, economic and demographic changes over the next few years will make that increasingly important. Young people in school or college today are likely to make several major career changes over their working lives. They will need constantly to develop their skills to stay ahead, through lifelong learning and more opportunities for flexible working. Meanwhile, increasing life expectancy means that people will need to plan for longer retirement. All that is alongside issues  <br>

people already need to understand, such as student loans, mortgages and pensions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o470"><a name="70417-0023.htm_para12"><a name="0704188000577">Many adults already struggle with those skills. About 15 million adults lack the numeracy skills to make appropriate decisions about saving; they find it difficult to make comparisons and weigh up different choices. With that in mind, my colleagues at the Treasury recently published a long-term strategy to develop financial capability for all, to which the hon. Gentleman referred. By coincidence I met Treasury colleagues today to discuss taking the strategy forward, with enterprise education.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o471"><a name="70417-0023.htm_para13"><a name="0704188000578">Over the long term, we want to ensure that all children and young people can access a planned and coherent programme of personal finance education, so that they leave school with the skills and confidence to manage their money well. What does that mean in practice? What will schools and colleges need to have in place? What do the Government and their partners need to do to offer schools the right support and resources?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o472"><a name="70417-0023.htm_para14"><a name="0704188000579">First, there is already considerable scope for schools to address those issues. The hon. Gentleman referred to some good examples, although he expressed impatience that they are not universal. There is scope not only within personal, social and health education, but also in citizenship&#151;however flawed the hon. Gentleman may think it is&#151;maths, business studies and careers and enterprise education. Within PSHE, pupils develop their financial skills through age-appropriate activities. Younger children are introduced to ideas such as saving and planning, whereas older pupils study more complex concepts, such as influences on saving and how to budget.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o473"><a name="70417-0023.htm_para15"><a name="0704188000580">Within citizenship studies, older pupils must study broader financial issues such as how the economy functions. I accept that that is not directly personal finance, but it provides an important context in which to judge personal financial decisions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o474"><a name="70417-0023.htm_para16"><a name="0704188000581">The Government are spending &#163;60 million each year until 2011 to help schools embed enterprise across the curriculum, helping young people to develop creativity, innovation and risk-management skills. The focus on enterprise will, I hope, help pupils to develop financial literacy and business understanding. Clearly, they are not the same thing, but there is a good relationship between the two. If young people are developing enterprises in schools, as many are, they are learning about budgetary processes and financial management for those small business that they are developing. They can then, in time, apply some of those principles to their own finances.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o475"><a name="70417-0023.htm_para17"><a name="0704188000582">We think that we could do more to help young people develop their financial capability&#151;hence our proposed changes, outlined within the Treasury document. For example, we will introduce a new child trust fund payment for seven-year-olds from 2009. We think that that is an important opportunity for children to start to think about finance, so we will explore ways of making the most of that with appropriate resources in schools.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o476"><a name="70417-0023.htm_para18"><a name="0704188000583">The current review of the secondary curriculum provides an opportunity to consolidate financial capability within the curriculum for older pupils. The review is designed to reduce prescription and increase flexibility, offering the kind of personalised learning that we think is essential if we are to continue to drive up standards.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o477"><a name="70417-0023.htm_para19"><a name="0704188000584">The proposed new curriculum, which is out for consultation until the end of this month, revises the  <br>

PSHE curriculum, so pupils will study economic well-being as a discrete strand of work. Personal, social and health education will then become, as the hon. Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough said, PSHEE, standing for personal, social, health and economic education. That would include learning how to manage money, addressing concepts such as savings, investment and trade, and understanding financial terms relevant to pupils&#146; everyday lives.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o478"><a name="70417-0023.htm_para20"><a name="0704188000585">The development of functional maths is important: it will be an essential component of GCSE maths from 2010. I accept that it will not address behaviour, which should be addressed in another context, but no one will be able to pass GCSE maths without demonstrating that they are able to apply their theoretical knowledge of maths to real-life situations. For example, students may be asked to calculate interest repayments on a mortgage or think about the cost-effectiveness of various mobile phone tariffs. As those examples show, financial literacy is an important element of functional skills and students will need to demonstrate that they have a solid grasp of those issues as they study the fundamental subject of GCSE maths.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o479"><a name="70417-0023.htm_para21"><a name="0704188000586">Functional maths&#151;alongside literacy&#151;will also be part of the new diplomas. Those enthused by concepts of financial literacy who want to develop their skills further may want to pursue the new diploma in finance and business administration, which will be available in some areas from September 2009 and will be an entitlement for all pupils from 2013. The financial services sector skills council will be leading the development of this diploma, ensuring the content will effectively prepare young people for careers in the sector or for further study.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o480"><a name="70417-0023.htm_para22"><a name="0704188000587">Colleges in particular have a critical role to play in helping those adults whom I mentioned earlier who struggle to make sense of the financial world. As part of our overall skills for life strategy, the Basic Skills Agency has had &#163;3 million of funding to invest in a financial literacy project. It has developed materials and learning programmes for use in FE colleges. York college, for example, has used those resources to embed financial literacy within different vocational courses.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o481"><a name="70417-0023.htm_para23"><a name="0704188000588">It is also critical, as both hon. Members have mentioned, that teachers in schools and colleges have the support and training they need, so that they are confident in helping young people to develop their own skills and knowledge. There is a newly formed professional subject association for PSHE, which will support teachers to plan, deliver and evaluate better PSHE provision, including personal finance education.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o482"><a name="70417-0023.htm_para24"><a name="0704188000589">We are updating the curriculum guidance for personal finance education this year. The Qualifications and Curriculum Authority has also recently published guidance for PSHE, which covers financial education, and from September, the functional mathematics element of the new diplomas will become part of the curriculum for trainee teachers of the relevant age group. We will also be examining whether more support is needed for PSHE teachers&#151;perhaps, for example, by developing a new module in financial capability in their continuous professional development programme.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o483"><a name="70417-0023.htm_para25"><a name="0704188000590">I must also mention, as the hon. Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough did, the excellent support made available by the Personal Finance Education Group, an educational charity primarily funded by the Financial Services Authority, whose learning money matters  <br>

programme offers a one-stop-shop for schools to get advice on planning their provision for financial education. It aims to reach 4,000 secondary schools directly by 2010. Because of its significant expertise in this area, we have asked it to redevelop the guidance on teaching financial capability that I referred to before. Finally on this point, the new national centre for excellence in maths teaching will play an important role in supporting better teaching and sharing good practice in financial literacy in respect of functional maths.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o484"><a name="70417-0023.htm_para26"><a name="0704188000591">I have talked about the range of activities that we are undertaking in this area, but I should comment on the principal point that the hon. Gentleman made about compulsion. We do not believe that it is necessary or desirable to make financial capability a separate statutory area of the curriculum. In fact, we do not think that making all elements of the PSHE statutory for secondary school pupils is necessary, although all are required to cover sex, drugs and, not rock and roll, but careers education. In essence, we are trying to reduce the level of prescription from Whitehall and offer more flexibility on the ground for schools.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o485"><a name="70417-0023.htm_para27"><a name="0704188000592">Making the subject compulsory will not necessarily improve the way in which it is taught, and we think that that is the crucial factor that we need to focus on. We need to concentrate on improving delivery in the classroom. That means a focus on ensuring that teachers have the skills and confidence to teach those subjects effectively. We think that it is more important that we invest in the work force and ensure that the appropriate resources are available to them. Teachers themselves agree with that approach. An FSA survey of teachers showed that there is little support for personal finance to be made statutory and that what schools need is flexibility within the curriculum.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o486"><a name="70417-0023.htm_para28"><a name="0704188000593">Moreover, PSHE and citizenship already covers some elements of financial literacy, and that will be enhanced by the proposed changes in the secondary curriculum review, which, as I have said, will free up time. I hope that freeing up time, particularly in key stage 3, will mean that schools will opt to develop further their enterprise and financial education, alongside other things such as learning outside the classroom and some of the other skills for life that can make school more engaging during those critical first three years of secondary school&#151;where there is a secondary system, rather than a middle school system, in place. That will mean that pupils can continue to be engaged in those areas, but also in their academic learning, as they go on.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o487"><a name="70417-0023.htm_para29"><a name="0704188000594">For similar reasons, we do not believe that it is appropriate to make it compulsory for every pupil to have a qualification demonstrating their financial capability. The qualifications are available to the schools that wish to provide them. Some may choose to use the time that they will have in key stage 3 for that purpose. But it is more important that young people acquire the relevant skills.</p>

I will, of course, reflect on what he said. I hope that he is persuaded that the Government and I are determined that financial education must be part of our education system and that we are implementing changes to ensure that financial literacy is embedded at every stage. We might disagree about some of the practical measures to be taken, but the commitment is certainly there and we want to be judged on our success in delivering that commitment. I am confident that we are offering teachers the right support to teach those vital skills.</p>
