<p><a name="st_0"><a name="41103-01_spmin0"><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Wales  (Mr. Don Touhig): </b> 
 My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State and I have had no discussions with Assembly Ministers on the Freedom of Information Act in relation to the publication of data on individual health trusts, but I rather suspect that my hon. Friend has.
</p>








<p><a name="st_1"><a name="41103-01_spnew0"><b> Mr. Jones: </b> 
 My constituent, Kelly Harris, contracted MRSA in the Heath hospital two months ago. Unfortunately, she has since had a toe amputated. For the past couple of months she has been trying to obtain information about her medical records, which the hospital has been reluctant to disclose. She is also trying to obtain information about the number of MRSA cases in the hospital, which she would have the right to do were it an English hospital. Does the Minister agree that not disclosing such information risks people believing either that Welsh people are too ignorant to interpret the data or that someone has something to hide?
</p>








<p><a name="st_2"><a name="41103-01_spnew1"><b> Mr. Touhig: </b> 
 I express my sympathy for the ill health of my hon. Friend&#039;s constituent. The national public health service gathers and publishes data on health care-associated infections, including MRSA, in Wales. The information is not published in the same way as it is in England&#151;it is anonymised&#151;and it is for each individual trust to decide whether it wants to publish it. Given my hon. Friend&#039;s views, which other hon. Members will share, I will ensure that his comments are brought to the attention of my Assembly colleague, the Minister for Health and Social Services.

This year, it is estimated that 600 people will die from hospital-acquired infections in Wales. Even the Prime Minister has recognised that this is a problem.

</p>








<p><a name="st_5"><a name="41103-01_spnew4"><b> Mr. Wiggin: </b> 
 I am glad that the Minister will bring the issue to his colleague&#039;s attention. However, the Assembly could do a great deal more. In 1996, there were 152 cases of MRSA; by 2001, there were 342. Last year, the figure reached 481. We need more than just pretty words from the Minister.

<p><a name="st_6"><a name="41103-01_spnew5"><b> Mr. Touhig: </b> 
 I am sorry that the hon. Gentleman thinks that I am just uttering pretty words, because I do take the matter seriously. I remind him that when his party was in power no figures on MRSA were published whatsoever.

<p><a name="st_9"><a name="41103-01_spmin1"><b>The Secretary of State for Wales  (Mr. Peter Hain): </b> 
 I regularly meet the Assembly First Minister, and regeneration in Wales is one of the topics that we frequently discuss.

<p><a name="st_10"><a name="41103-01_spnew8"><b> David Taylor: </b> 
 When I recently drove to Holyhead via the A55 along the north Wales coast, I was hugely impressed by the scale of regeneration since my last visit a decade ago. The Labour Government and the Labour Assembly have much of which to be proud. However, will the Secretary of State acknowledge the role of the generous Barnett formula in all this? Should not national grant distribution be more needs-based so that my own region does not lose out; or does the English midlands need to be categorised as Powys, East before we get a fairer deal?
</p>








<p><a name="st_11"><a name="41103-01_spnew9"><b> Mr. Hain: </b> 
 That is an interesting proposition&#151;I look forward to adding Red Leicester to the list of fine Welsh cheeses. If my hon. Friend wants to apply to the Gorsedd of the Bards, I shall put in a good word for him.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41103-01_para2">
<a name="stpa_2">The Barnett formula is a population-based share that changes according to comparable spending in England, including in Leicestershire. It is therefore triggered by what goes on in England. Wales has a lot of catching up to do. We are making great progress, but gross domestic product per head remains 78.8 per cent. of the United Kingdom average. That is why the additional funding that the Labour Government are investing, compared with the miserable Tory record, is so important.
</p>








<p><a name="st_12"><a name="41103-01_spnew10"><b> Kevin Brennan: </b> 
 I am sure that the soon-to-be defunct Wales Tourist Board will be glad to make a film about North-West Leicestershire called &quot;Last Quango in Powys&quot;. Is not the fact that we shall have Barnett-plus in Wales for the next few years a warning to those who appear to believe that the answer to every problem in Wales is to throw the baby out with the Barnett formula?
</p>








<p><a name="st_13"><a name="41103-01_spnew11"><b> Mr. Hain: </b> 
 Yes&#151;I assume that my hon. Friend is talking about the nationalists, who have consistently attacked the Barnett formula. That is not surprising as they want Wales to be cut off from the rest of the United Kingdom. They ignore the fact that, uniquely, we have &#163;555 million over the next three years over and above the Barnett formula for objective 1 funding. Yesterday, Sue Essex, the Minister for Finance, Local Government and Public Services in the Assembly, announced that some &#163;13 million from the business rates incentive scheme would go towards reducing the impact of council tax rises, as part of an increase of &#163;60 million-odd in the coming years. That is proof that the Labour Government are genuinely delivering for Wales all the way.

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>3 Nov 2004 : Column 292</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>settlement? On all independent projections, that will mean a big increase in council tax as a result of the poor settlement for local government in the Budget, due to the inadequate formulation of the Barnett formula. Has the Secretary of State any plans to address that? If so, when can we expect a reformulation so that local government in Wales is not squeezed, although it has been so far?
</p>








<p><a name="st_15"><a name="41103-01_spnew13"><b> Mr. Hain: </b> 
 I should have thought that the hon. Gentleman would welcome the additional money that the Labour Government in the Welsh Assembly announced yesterday to ensure that council tax rises are kept to a minimum, as they were this year. What would happen if the Liberal Democrat policy of massive hikes in income tax to replace the council tax were introduced? That would mean hard-working people, from police officers to nurses and teachers, paying a huge additional burden of income tax. That is the mad Lib Dem policy.
</p>








<p><a name="st_16"><a name="41103-01_spnew14"><b> Mr. Nigel Evans  (Ribble Valley)</b> 
 (Con): Not only the additional money but how it is spent is important to Wales. Will the Secretary of State hold discussions with the First Minister to ensure that more Barnett formula money is spent on attracting manufacturing investment into Wales, because thousands of jobs have been lost since the Government came to power? Is he not ashamed that there are fewer manufacturing jobs in Wales now than in 1997?
</p>








<p><a name="st_17"><a name="41103-01_spnew15"><b> Mr. Hain: </b> 
 It is true that manufacturing has contracted in Wales as it has throughout the industrialised, modern world. It has happened elsewhere in Europe, in the United States and other places. The hon. Gentleman does not point out that employment in Wales is at record levels compared with a massive loss of manufacturing&#151;around 100,000&#151;and huge unemployment under Tory policies. Compared with that, we have a good record. We are doing more and more and the Welsh economy is strengthening week by week.

 (Lab): My right hon. Friend will recognise the scene that my hon. Friend the Member for North-West Leicestershire (David Taylor) described of travelling along the A55, and especially of the regeneration that has occurred in my constituency of Conwy since 1997. However, will my right hon. Friend take every opportunity to discuss with the First Minister and other agencies in Wales the effectiveness of flood defences, given the serious flooding in the past two weeks? Businesses and householders were badly affected, especially in the Bangor area.
</p>








<p><a name="st_19"><a name="41103-01_spnew17"><b> Mr. Hain: </b> 
 I am aware of the problems of flooding in the Bangor area and throughout Wales, including in my constituency. I shall ensure that my hon. Friend&#039;s concerns are brought to the attention of the First Minister and therefore the Welsh Assembly Government. However, as she acknowledged, there has been record investment and more and more jobs in her constituency and along the north Wales corridor, to which my hon. Friend the Member for North-West Leicestershire (David Taylor) also referred. That is because Wales is working under Labour, compared with a Tory record of mass unemployment, mass bankruptcies and business collapse.

 One of the most successful innovations associated with antisocial behaviour is the introduction of alley gating, which has been introduced in Caia Park in my constituency and is very popular with my constituents. Unfortunately, however, the provisions introduced by the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000 have not yet been implemented by the Assembly, which is preventing a more rapid introduction of alley gating in Caia Park. Will my hon. Friend have discussions with the National Assembly for Wales to establish what steps it intends to take to introduce this legislation in Wales as soon as possible?

It is also important that investment is going into education, so that young people can be made aware of the dangers of using drugs. They are an awful blight on our society, both in the hon.

We must be vigilant in all that we do. We are working closely with our colleagues in this regard, and they have a good record to date.

 My hon. Friend is right to refer to the effects of the antisocial behaviour orders. Indeed, 114 have been issued in Wales. I take his point about the community wardens, and in my own borough the new Labour-controlled council is introducing a scheme. What is important is that that supplements and supports the work being done by the police. It encourages the community to participate in combating antisocial behaviour problems. Often, wardens act as professional witnesses when the community or the public are afraid to come forward, perhaps as a result of witnessing antisocial behaviour. I commend the schemes and I hope that authorities across Wales look seriously at the work being done in Newport and the work we are now doing in Caerphilly.

 My right hon. Friend and I have regular discussions with ministerial colleagues on matters affecting Wales. In Wales, police strength at 31&nbsp;August 2004 was at 7,414, which is an increase of more than 12 per cent. since 1997.

 There has been significant improvement in police numbers, community support officers, the extension of community wardens in my constituency, the reopening of local police stations and so on, as well as a significant improvement in drug interdiction&#151;all of which has all been possible because of extra funding.

Funding for the police service in England and Wales has increased by more than 30 per cent., or &#163;2.3 billion, over the past four years.

Given that the North Wales police authority requires 7.4 per cent. to meet its commitments, will the Minister ensure that there will be

 I am aware of the statement made by my Assembly colleague the Minister for Finance, Local Government and Public Services yesterday. The settlement is very good and should be welcomed across Wales. It confirms the commitment of this Government and our partners in the Assembly to invest in public services. Clearly, the funding of the police service is important, and we can be proud of our record. Certainly, as we move towards the next settlement, the voice of Wales will be made clear by my right hon.

We are determined that the police service in Wales will have all the adequate resources that it needs.

The Iraqi Ministry of Health has put out figures for the six months up to October, which suggest just over 3,000 deaths, but that includes people who are either terrorists or insurgents and those who have been the victims of terrorist attack. We do everything we possibly can to limit civilian casualties, but when our troops and Iraqi forces come under fire, they have to return fire. The way to stop all civilian casualties in Iraq is for insurgents and terrorists to lay down their weapons, allow the elections to go ahead in January and allow Iraq to become a stable democracy.

</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="41103-04_para1">
<a name="stpa_1">Such a duty to promote equality was introduced for race discrimination in the Race Relations (Amendment) Act 2000. The Audit Commission has since described that as the key driver for change to combat the discrimination that still exists against our black and ethnic minority communities. Likewise, the draft Disability Discrimination Bill also contains a positive duty on the public sector to promote equality&#151;and rightly so. It is now time for the same advance to be made for women and men, and my Bill would accomplish that.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41103-04_para2">
<a name="stpa_2">The Sex Discrimination Act 1975 outlaws discrimination between women and men in the workplace and in the provision of goods and services. It was pioneering legislation 28 years ago when the incomparable Barbara Castle put it on the statute book. Her vision and determination put Britain at the forefront of the battle for equal opportunities and key advances were made. However, the Act does not prevent discrimination from happening in the first place, but it provides redress and compensation to those who experience it after the event, so only those who are determined enough to endure the stresses and strains of a legal process, the threat of losing their job or the likelihood of incurring high legal costs get the chance of receiving recompense. Cases can take many years to resolve with the result that women are still sacked for being pregnant and men are penalised at work for taking on caring responsibilities. In Britain today, much illegal discrimination is left unchallenged and unchecked.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41103-04_para3">
<a name="stpa_3">A positive duty to promote equality would address that problem by shifting the onus to end discrimination from the individuals who suffer it to the public bodies that provide vital services to all of us and employ many millions to deliver them. The duty to promote will close many of those practical loopholes in the law, and make the fight against unfairness and blighted life chances much more effective. Make no mistake, there is still much to do, as recent figures have confirmed that the pay gap between women and men is stubbornly persistent at 18 per cent. Pay in the public sector is generally better than in the private sector. For example, the gap stands at 13 per cent. in health care, but in banking and public relations it is a staggering 56 per cent., and is widening. The causes are well documented, and women&#039;s lack of access to bonuses, overtime and opportunities for promotion are significant factors. Child care and other caring responsibilities often leave women with little choice but to work part-time for pay and conditions that are inferior to those in the full-time labour market, which often leads to men having to work even longer hours to make up the family income. British men work the longest hours in Europe, which is clearly not good for family life.

<br>&nbsp;<br>income that is just over half that of their male counterparts. Once again, the situation is not improving. The Equal Opportunities Commission, which supports the Bill, recently conducted an inquiry into job segregation by gender, and looked at five sectors&#151;construction, engineering, plumbing, information technology and child care. Four of those sectors have a mainly male work force and major skills shortages, and one has a largely female work force and low pay. The commission discovered that the Government&#039;s modern apprenticeship scheme has reinforced rather than challenged that gender segregation. There has been no increase in the number of women coming into the four male-dominated sectors in the past ten years. For example, women make up only 1 per cent. of people working in construction, yet only 1 per cent. of modern apprentices in construction are women. Eight per cent. of people working in engineering are women, yet only 6 per cent. of modern apprenticeships in engineering are held by women. In child care, despite the prospective creation of 150,000 new jobs, men are almost completely absent from the sector and pay remains very low. A man who wishes to pursue a career in child care is still considered mildly eccentric or much worse. Overall, 95 per cent. of apprenticeships in engineering and construction are held by men, who earn &#163;115 a week. In social care, by contrast, 89 per cent. of apprenticeships are taken by women, who earn just &#163;60 a week.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41103-04_para5">
<a name="stpa_5">Once the positive duty to promote equality is enshrined in law it is inconceivable that the lack of progress in tacking job segregation would be allowed to continue, and the role of the modern apprenticeship scheme in reinforcing that segregation would end. Banishing gender job segregation would offer women more choices and higher earnings opportunities and would also address skill shortages and boost our economic efficiency. It would offer men more civilised choices about their work-life balance. The duty to promote can also be a lever to ensure that public services are redesigned to reflect the life experiences of women and men more effectively. For example, men are much less likely than women to visit their GPs in a timely fashion, and only go to the doctor when their illness is advanced. Primary health services need to be redesigned to encourage men to seek help earlier. Women, on the other hand, rely on public transport much more than men as they have less access to private cars. They also have different patterns of usage, and combine trips to the shops with journeys to take children to school or the childminder, as well as their own travel to work. That is a complex set of journeys, yet bus routes and ticketing are often designed for simple commuting from one place to another. I could provide many similar examples of the scope for improving the design and delivery of public services to meet the needs of women and men more effectively. That can only improve efficiency and value for money.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41103-04_para6">
<a name="stpa_6">There are those who will argue that the positive duty to promote will just be a bureaucratic nightmare that will have no effect on improving fairness and efficiency. These criticisms are usually made by people who do not wish our equality laws to be effective or modernised. In

<br>&nbsp;<br>reality, the introduction of a new requirement to promote equality in the public sector can be delivered as part of the core planning inside an organisation. It should lead to greater equity and a more effective use of existing resources. It need not introduce extra complexity or expense, or endless paper trails, but it should encourage strategic analysis that results in more user-focused provision. That will create public services that fit the shape of more people&#039;s lives and that offer people equal opportunities to benefit.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41103-04_para7">
<a name="stpa_7">I believe that, in due course, it is only right to extend these positive duties to prevent discrimination and promote equality to the private sector too. There is no reason why the efficiency and equity gains that they deliver should not benefit the whole economy and all our population. The Bill could be a small part of a third term Labour agenda to simplify, harmonise and extend equality protection to all. That would make our law simpler to understand and use for employers, employees and service providers alike. It would make protection from illegal discrimination a reality for all, and it would finish the work so ably begun by Barbara Castle by extending and opportunity further than ever before.

For example, I was struck by her comment early in her speech that much illegal discrimination goes unchallenged. I think that she was referring to the existing law and suggesting that it was perhaps not being used to the full. I immediately wondered whose fault it was that such discrimination went unchallenged. In my view, one of the main duties of a trade union, for example, should surely be to use every opportunity under existing law to represent its members, be they male, female or whatever, in the context of the very law that she praised so highly.

That danger cannot be over-stated.

<a name="stpa_11">We are familiar with the phenomenon by which a quango set up under previous well-meaning legislation uses the resources given to it further to justify its existence and to extend its remit, which is a natural thing for people in quangos to do and we see it all the time. However, simply because a well-funded quango says, &quot;We have discovered more things to do,&quot; or, even worse, &quot;Another new quango should be set up,&quot; does not mean that we should say, &quot;That&#039;s all right then.&quot; That is one of the weakest parts of the hon.

She said that far too few women avail themselves of apprenticeships in engineering and that too few men work in child care&#151;I do not know how one arrives at &quot;too few&quot; in that context. I do not know whether the hon. Lady expects an equal number of men and women to enter engineering apprenticeships and child care, or whether the number of women on engineering apprenticeships is not quite enough to satisfy her.

<a name="stpa_13">Leaving that matter to one side, how can one intervene in the structure and running of apprenticeships in order to change that balance? Such arguments always miss that point. It is easy to say, &quot;There are too few women in engineering apprenticeships.&quot; I am intrigued to know the mechanism by which the number of women in engineering apprenticeships, or indeed the number of men in child care, would be increased. It is not good enough to state the problem and then assume that the solution will be made available.

<a name="41103-04_para14">
<a name="stpa_14">Even more intriguingly, the hon. Lady went on to discuss lifestyle changes, which sound very trendy.

The phrase is easy to deploy and sounds attractive, if it is said fairly quickly, but when one starts to examine the implications and ramifications of a duty to promote, which would no doubt be policed by a quango, reaching out into the workplace and interfering yet further in relationships between managers and the managed, one sees scope for severe disruption of the employment process, of which the Government are rightly so proud.

<a name="stpa_19">We have three motions before us this afternoon, the first of which is on Members&#039; allowances, the second and third on parliamentary pensions. Explanatory memorandums on each have been placed in the Vote Office. All three are tabled in response to the report of the Review Body on Senior Salaries&#151;the SSRB&#039;s triennial review of pay and allowances, a copy of which was laid before the House on 21 October. The Government are grateful to the SSRB for undertaking the review with its customary thoroughness and 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>3 Nov 2004 : Column 316</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>expertise. I am sure that hon. Members on both sides of the House join me in thanking John Baker and his team for their hard work.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41103-05_para3">
<a name="stpa_20">Let me say a word or two about the status of the SSRB. It is an independent organisation. That the Government, as a matter of principle, put its recommendations to the House is established practice. We ask the SSRB to study specific matters and it makes a recommendation, and it is to our advantage that we take outside and independent advice. I know that the whole House shares that view.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41103-05_para4">
<a name="stpa_21">I emphasise that we are not debating Members&#039; pay this afternoon. The SSRB recommended no increase in Members&#039; or Ministers&#039; salaries beyond the normal annual uprating in line with inflation. Personally, I think that that is right. Members&#039; allowances have been the subject of some attention recently. It is understandable that some of the media and our constituents question whether the considerable sum spent on Members&#039; allowances is well spent, but contrary to the lurid headlines, the allowances do not go to line our own pockets: they are essential if we are to function as effective Members of Parliament both at Westminster and in our constituencies, and all claims are within agreed rules.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41103-05_para5">
<a name="stpa_22">The position today is very different from the one 20 or 30 years ago, when many Members lived in London, went to their constituency perhaps once a month for the odd surgery, and did not have a constituency office. Our constituents demand a different level of service and it is proper that the House has put in place the resources necessary to support that.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41103-05_para6">
<a name="stpa_23">There are five effective parts to the motion. I shall deal with the amendments that you have selected, Mr. Speaker&#151;(g), (h), (c) and (i)&#151;during my opening remarks, if that is convenient. Paragraph (2) is applicable to the staffing allowance. It would implement recommendation 5 of the SSRB&#039;s report so that, with effect from 1 April 2005, the staffing allowance will be increased to a base of &#163;72,000, rising to a maximum of &#163;80,460 according to the number of full-time equivalent employees funded from the staffing allowance and based in London. Those sums will be adjusted annually in line with the average earnings index. The purpose is to enable Members to employ three full-time equivalent staff at proper rates of pay and to take account of the increased cost of employing staff in London.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41103-05_para7">
<a name="stpa_24">I hope that the House will support the change. The SSRB based its recommendations on extensive analysis of pay rates in comparable jobs in London and outside. Although we must be careful with public money, we must pay our staff a decent rate for the job.

 In reference to paragraphs (2) and (6), what does the right hon. Gentleman think is the reasonable minimum number of secretaries that a Member of Parliament should be able to employ in the Palace of Westminster without penalties?
</p>








<p><a name="st_11"><a name="41103-05_spnew2"><b> Mr. Hain: </b> 
 That is a very complicated question and difficult to answer with a simple yes or no. The reason I hesitate to respond is that each Member allocates staff and determines the precise arrangements according to his or her own needs and choices, and I think that that is an important right shared by all of us.

<p><a name="st_12"><a name="41103-05_spnew3"><b> Miss Ann Widdecombe  (Maidstone and The Weald) (Con):</b> 
 I am grateful to the Leader of the House for giving way again so quickly. He did not answer the question asked by my hon. Friend the Member for West Worcestershire (Sir Michael Spicer), but will he answer mine? Does he agree that whether we base our staff in our constituency or at Westminster is a matter for each Member to determine and that the system should be neutral between the two decisions?
</p>








<p><a name="st_13"><a name="41103-05_spnew4"><b> Mr. Hain: </b> 
 I am not sure that I accept the right hon. Lady&#039;s point about neutrality, because Members who base all their staff at Westminster do not pay rents and get free heat, lighting, use of the telephone and photocopying, and so on, whereas those of us who have constituency offices&#151;the vast majority, including the right hon. Lady&#151;incur costs there. However, one of the reasons why the motion refers the SSRB recommendation to the Members Estimate Committee, as the SSRB anticipated it might be, is that we would get into a difficult position if there were, in effect, a massive disincentive to having staff employed within the Palace or on the parliamentary estate. We are parliamentarians as well as constituency MPs, and that is an important principle to maintain.
</p>








<p><a name="st_14"><a name="41103-05_spnew5"><b> Mr. Patrick McLoughlin  (West Derbyshire) (Con):</b> 
 Does the right hon. Gentleman agree, however, that in the light of the fact that the expenses and allowances paid to Members are now published, they should be equally and easily understood and able to be judged? Giving different allowances&#151;taking &#163;7,000 off a Member and making extra provision if a Member employs all his or her staff in London&#151;adds to the complexity of already complex rules. Should we not be creating a simpler, more straightforward system that is easy to understand and easily accounted for?
</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200304/cmhansrd/vo041103/debtext/41103-06.htm"/>







<p><a name="st_15"><a name="41103-06_spnew0"><b> Mr. Hain: </b> 
 I understand the hon. Gentleman&#039;s point. He has gone into the matter in considerable detail. There are enormous benefits in simplicity; on the other hand, the decision that the House took to establish two separate sources of allowance&#151;the staffing allowance and the incidental expenses allowance, which overwhelmingly is directed toward constituency offices, although it can be used for other purposes&#151;had the advantage of ensuring that our employees would not have to compete constantly against demands to buy a computer, or to pay a constituency office bill. We have an obligation to our employees to ensure that they have decent conditions.
</p>








<p><a name="st_16"><a name="41103-06_spnew1"><b> Mr. Oliver Heald  (North-East Hertfordshire) (Con):</b> 
 Does the Leader of the House share my concern that the proposal on the incidental expenses provision, which the SSRB no doubt made in good faith, is extremely complicated? If the Members Estimate Committee accepts the recommendation, there will, in effect, be four levels of IEP for new Members starting after the general election, and a transitional arrangement with four different levels of IEP applicable to existing Members. Is there not at least the possibility of coming up with a simpler method of dealing with the problem of providing a little extra help to Members who have their offices outside London?
</p>








<p><a name="st_17"><a name="41103-06_spnew2"><b> Mr. Hain: </b> 
 Yes, there is a simpler way&#151;it is described on the Order Paper. On the other hand&#151;the

<b>3 Nov 2004 : Column 318</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>hon.&nbsp;Gentleman and I share common concerns on this, and I shall come on to it in some detail later&#151;the enormous pressure on the parliamentary estate means that we have many different interests to reconcile. The SSRB tried to do that, but recognised that it would involve practical implications beyond its remit. We referred the proposal on the IEP to the Members Estimate Committee so that it could address precisely these issues. It is not the SSRB&#039;s fault, but the proposal that came to us had certain rigidities that could have had all sorts of anomalous effects. It is very important that proper consideration be given to that.


</p>








<p><a name="st_18"><a name="41103-06_spnew3"><b> Mr. Frank Dobson  (Holborn and St. Pancras) (Lab):</b> 
 The question of pressure on the parliamentary state is certainly outside the SSRB&#039;s terms of reference. According to paragraph 4.43 of its report,

<p><a name="st_19"><a name="41103-06_spnew4"><b> Mr. Hain: </b> 
 I appreciate my right hon. Friend&#039;s passion, but the House authorities provide an extremely valuable service for us all in the variety of different functions that they undertake. They have a responsibility to inform the SSRB about a variety of issues affecting the parliamentary estate, including the enormous pressure on it.

 Does my right hon.

I would have either to sack one of my members of staff or to close down my constituency office.
</p>








<p><a name="st_21"><a name="41103-06_spnew6"><b> Mr. Hain: </b> 
 That is why the motion refers the matter to the Members Estimate Committee, where several such issues will be discussed.

<a name="41103-06_para1">
<a name="stpa_26">The purpose of my bringing before the House a series of proposals on how allowances should be structured is to allow the House to decide on them. It is for the SSRB to recommend, but for the House to make the decisions.

<p><a name="st_22"><a name="41103-06_spnew7"><b> Mr. Barry Sheerman  (Huddersfield) (Lab/Co-op):</b> 
 What surprises many of us is not that the recommendations came about but that none of us were consulted. I should have thought that consultation of Members of Parliament on their office costs and where they want to locate their staff would have been undertaken before proposals were brought to the House. That would be done in even the most primitive organisation.
</p>








<p><a name="st_23"><a name="41103-06_spnew8"><b> Mr. Hain: </b> 
 My hon. Friend clearly has strong feelings, as have many Members on both sides of the House. I understand that. However, it is not true to say that Members were not consulted. Everybody knew that the SSRB inquiry was going on and anybody could have submitted evidence. At the back of the report there is a list of those who did so. The Speaker&#039;s Advisory Panel, 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>3 Nov 2004 : Column 319</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>which consists of Members of this House, was consulted. The proposal did not come out of thin air. It would not be right to criticise the SSRB, which has done a very professional job in the circumstances.
</p>








<p><a name="st_24"><a name="41103-06_spnew9"><b> David Winnick  (Walsall, North) (Lab):</b> 
 I employ one member of staff in the House of Commons. Does my right hon. Friend accept that it is disturbing that we are being told how we should go about our business in serving our constituents? It is not up to the body that has made this recommendation, the House authorities, or anyone but ourselves to decide whether we best serve our constituents by having staff here or in the constituency. I happen to have a constituency office. The proposals are simply unacceptable, and it is just as well that the Leader of the House should know that.
</p>








<p><a name="st_25"><a name="41103-06_spnew10"><b> Mr. Hain: </b> 
 As I said, that is precisely why the motion refers the matter to the Members Estimate Committee. I agree that it is for Members to decide how they allocate their different allowances and serve their constituencies. Equally, however, there are constraints. One of those is the amount of accommodation that is available on the parliamentary estate; another is that those of us with constituency offices incur considerable additional costs, which are not incurred by Members who have all their staff located here. We have all sorts of different interests to balance.
</p>








<p><a name="st_26"><a name="41103-06_spnew11"><b> Mr. Alex Salmond  (Banff and Buchan) (SNP):</b> 
 The IEP should not be used to put pressure on staff salaries, which is why they have been kept separate; nor should it be used to pay for overnight stays for Members of Parliament on parliamentary business, which properly come under the additional costs allowance. When the Committee considers these issues, will the Leader of the House bear in mind that the rules for the additional cost allowance were drawn up in 1971 before there was a Parliament in Scotland, a National Assembly in Wales or any other assemblies that might come into being? Costs incurred on overnight stays on parliamentary business involving those places should come under the additional costs allowance.
</p>








<p><a name="st_27"><a name="41103-06_spnew12"><b> Mr. Hain: </b> 
 I noted the hon. Gentleman&#039;s amendment, which was not selected. The difficulty is that the additional costs allowance is intended for a very specific purpose: to allow Members of Parliament to have both a constituency home and a London home in order that we can do our jobs effectively. If the ACA were to be redirected to other areas, that would raise issues about the basis on which it is established. The hon. Gentleman may claim under the incidental expenses provision.

<p>
<a name="41103-06_para2">
<a name="stpa_27">The hon. Gentleman refers to the Scottish Parliament. That does not affect me, for example, because I have no constituency interest in going there, although I visit the Welsh Assembly, which, as it happens to be between my constituency and London, does not cause a problem.

</p>

<p>
<a name="41103-06_para3">
<a name="stpa_28">If I may make a little progress, I shall deal with some of the points that hon. Members have made. Amendment (g), which was tabled by the hon. Member

<b>3 Nov 2004 : Column 320</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>for South-West Hertfordshire (Mr. Page) and others, would increase the staffing allowance to &#163;80,460&#151;the amount that the SSRB recommended&#151;for all Members, ending the system of differential allowances for London-based Members and those with their staff based in the constituency, while allowing Members to use up to 10 per cent. of the staffing allowance to fund their constituency office. Linked to that is amendment (h), which would remove from the motion the proposed reference of the SSRB&#039;s recommendation on the IEP to the Members Estimate Committee.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41103-06_para4">
<a name="stpa_29">I sympathise with the underlying point of amendment (g), which suggests that although Members with staff in London pay out more in salaries for their staff, Members with staff in their constituency may pay out more on office rental and other costs. That needs to be recognised in the funds that are provided.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41103-06_para5">
<a name="stpa_30">However, the amendment would not encourage any location of staff to constituency offices. Furthermore, the staffing allowance and incidental expenses provision are each available for specific purposes, as I explained, and there is a logic to ring-fencing them for those purposes. Allowing the staffing allowance to be put towards office costs would be a new departure and would undermine the principle that the staffing allowance should be ring-fenced and available only for the purpose of paying for work done.

 The Leader of the House has made much reference to ring-fencing to protect the salaries of staff. We are all sympathetic to that, but does he recognise that since the House introduced standard conditions of employment, with standard salary ranges, that argument has largely disappeared?

 I am not entirely sure that it has disappeared. It concerns the principle mentioned by my hon.

<p>
<a name="41103-07_para0">
<a name="stpa_31">Most significantly, amendment (g) would go well beyond the increase in staffing allowance recommended by the SSRB; I am advised that it would cost an extra &#163;2 million to &#163;3 million. I must therefore urge the House to reject it.

 The Members Estimate Committee reflects the wishes of the House and can receive representations through the Speaker&#039;s advisory panel and ordinary representations. The fact that everything is being conducted so openly allows hon. Members to make their points. I understand the point that the right hon. Lady made in amendment (d), which was backed by many hon. Members from all parties. It relates to my earlier point that I understand the accommodation pressures and the desire on the part of the House authorities for location away from the parliamentary estate to constituency offices. There is enormous pressure, especially through interns, on the parliamentary estate. However, we are parliamentarians&#151;I believe that that lies behind the right hon. Lady&#039;s amendment&#151;not glorified social workers. We are parliamentarians in addition to providing a first-class constituency advice and assistance service.

<p><a name="st_37"><a name="41103-07_spnew8"><b> Mr. Hain: </b> 
 As I have signalled in the clearest possible terms, I understand the hon. Gentleman&#039;s point. However, I must disagree emphatically with any suggestion that the SSRB has operated in an improper fashion. The SSRB is not telling him, me or any other Member what to do. It has provided a set of incentives&#151;whether the House and the Members Estimate Committee accept them or not&#151;to fulfil a set of criteria that it was invited to investigate. They include pressure on the parliamentary estate and the anomaly that hon. Members with staff who are based only on the estate get the whole IEP and do not bear the costs of a constituency office, as, for example, I do. It proposed a recommendation in good faith. We should respect that and I do not accept that it was ordering any of us to do anything. In the end, the House will make the decision.

 If the SSRB had not made the recommendations, an entirely different set of people would be in the Chamber, complaining bitterly that it was not advantageous for them to have offices in their constituencies. Many hon. Members do not have staff in the House. The proposal is not as draconian as it appears at first sight. The SSRB also recommended that hon. Members should have computers as well as a laptop for themselves. [<i>Interruption</i>.] If the work station is based here and shared by a member of staff, I presume that it would not count against the &#163;7,500 reduction in the IEP, which would allow hon. Members to have two members of staff here with only one work station. [<i>Interruption</i>.]

 I stress to hon. Members that my hon.

Hon. Members can vary the number of staff according to the availability of work stations. That sort of detail makes it important for the Members Estimate Committee to consider the matter in greater depth.

<p><a name="st_64"><a name="41103-09_spnew2"><b> Sir Nicholas Winterton: </b> 
 I am putting this marker down now while a number of Members are present. The Inland Revenue rate seems to fail entirely to take into account, as the right hon. Gentleman has said, the size of a constituency and the need for a Member to use his car in that large area to undertake constituency duties. There is no difference between an inner-city seat and a large urban seat, which surely is grotesquely unfair. It could be a disincentive to Members properly and fully undertaking constituency duties and, in some cases, travelling to London when there is not adequate public transport to enable them to do so.

 I know the points that the hon. Gentleman is making. I dare say his constituents and mine would want to make the same points if they travelled a lot on business, but may I make this point? Some Members feel that the Inland Revenue rates are too low to reflect the true costs of motoring. The Government do not accept that. The 40p rate, which was set in the Income Tax (Earnings and Pensions) Act 2003, covers the full costs of using a car for business travel for a wide range of types and size of car, including cars that are safe and comfortable for long business journeys. It is advantageous to drivers of small, environmentally friendly cars. It has been set at a level that will not subsidise all the standing costs of owning a larger, more fuel-hungry car, so that it does not encourage drivers of larger cars to drive unnecessary business miles. It is, however, still generous enough fully to cover the marginal running costs of such cars.

 The Leader of the House has just referred to what the Inland Revenue reckons that 40p covers, which is the marginal cost of using the vehicle, whereas our current motor mileage allowance purports to cover the capital cost of the vehicle as well, so we are considering two fundamentally different things. What is being proposed is a change of policy dressed up as a recalibration of some comparative figures. If we are to debate what is being proposed, we should do so with our eyes open, rather than confuse two completely different things.

 On the parking issue, previously there was deemed to be an element of profit in the motor mileage allowance. That was one reason for deciding that no allowance should be made when congestion charging was introduced. If we accept this proposal for parking, should not we also accept it for congestion charging if the profit element has gone from the motor mileage allowance?
</p>








<p><a name="st_71"><a name="41103-09_spnew9"><b> Mr. Hain: </b> 
 The Inland Revenue does not provide for congestion charging to be met in such a way. I should say to the hon. Member for Lewes that if the amendment tabled by the hon. Member for Macclesfield is carried, I will recommend that we support it, because built into the costs of the mileage rate of the House of Commons is provision to meet such costs. For example, if I travel across the Severn bridge I pay a toll. I do not think that that should be provided for by the House authorities, because the mileage rate is fairly generous. The same applies to parking.

 The Inland Revenue figure is for the calculation of tax liability; it is not said that a higher allowance should not be paid by an employer. Simply, if an allowance is given above that figure, it is taxable. That is already the case with Members&#039; existing allowance&#151;it is taxable above 40p. That is a matter for the Inland Revenue to decide, but the fact that this does not accurately reflect modern costs of running a motor car is well known throughout the nation. The AA says that, as do all the motor car magazines that publish the costs of running a motor car. The Inland Revenue point has nothing to do with the real cost of running a car, but it relates to a threshold for taxation.

<a name="stpa_53">Paragraph (6) deals with the incidental expenses provision. The SSRB&#039;s report recommends that the provision be increased to a maximum of &#163;27,500, and that the amount that may be claimed by Members should be abated by &#163;7,500 for each permanent workstation occupied by their staff on the parliamentary estate. As the SSRB acknowledges, this recommendation could involve a significant reorganisation of current office arrangements for many Members, or else a significant loss of income. The SSRB states that it would understand were the House to conclude that the recommendation should apply only to new Members and that certain transitional arrangements should operate for currently serving Members. The Government believe that it would be appropriate for the Members Estimate Committee to give further consideration to this matter, particularly in the light of the points raised during this debate and the strong views expressed.

The Members Estimate Committee will be able to consider the various factors in the round.

<a name="stpa_55">On parliamentary pensions, the SSRB has made two recommendations. I am grateful to the trustees and their chairman for their work on this matter.

<a name="stpa_56">The second motion before the House is to implement the SSRB recommendation that the contribution rate for those scheme members who have opted for their pension to build up at a rate of one fortieth of final salary for each year of service should increase from 9 per cent. to 10 per cent. It may be recalled that in 2002, the SSRB recommended that, in the first instance, the contribution rate of members who opted for the one-fortieth accrual rate should increase to 9 per cent. It recommended that the remaining cost of the benefit improvement should be taken into account in subsequent reviews of pay and allowances. That would mean that eventually the full cost of implementation would be borne by Members on an ongoing basis. The Government accepted that recommendation.

</p>

<p>
<a name="41103-10_para5">
<a name="stpa_57">The SSRB has now considered the options for recovering the remaining cost. It has concluded that it would be unfair to restrict future pay increases for all Members irrespective of whether they had opted for the one-fortieth accrual rate. It has instead recommended that the contribution rate for those who opted for the improved accrual rate should increase by 1 per cent. from 1 April 2004. It considers that an appropriate step towards recovering the full cost. The SSRB remains of the view that the full cost of the benefit improvement should in due course be borne by Members on an ongoing basis. It intends to take the outstanding amount into account in its next review of parliamentary pay and allowances.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41103-10_para6">
<a name="stpa_58">The Government are content with the SSRB&#039;s recommendation to phase the recovery of the additional cost and believe that it should be implemented. If the House agrees, I understand that the trustees would propose that the collection of arrears back to 1 April this year should be spread over the balance of the current tax year, so that Members are not saddled suddenly with a huge bill. The Government are happy with that approach.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41103-10_para7">
<a name="stpa_59">The SSRB has recommended that the trustees should decide what action to take on the recommendations outstanding from its 2001 report. The main outstanding recommendations relate to the extension of survivor benefits to unmarried partners and the introduction of pensions for life for surviving widows and widowers. The Government&#039;s policy is that such benefit improvements could be introduced only if Members are prepared to meet the additional costs. That is consistent with our line on other public service schemes. In 2001, the House expressed its view rightly that survivor benefits should apply to unmarried partners as well as spouses. I have therefore been in discussion with the trustees about how those important provisions can be introduced in a way that is fair to Members and to the taxpayer. The issue of civil partners is slightly different. It is expected that the scheme will be amended to provide benefits for surviving civil partners, and that any additional costs arising from that will be met by the Exchequer.

<a name="41103-10_para8">
<a name="stpa_60">The Government have noted the observation made by the SSRB in its report that phasing out the favourable early retirement terms in the scheme would be consistent with the Government&#039;s policy on public service pension age and might make possible benefit improvements as part of a package. The Government therefore feel that this represents a sensible way forward. The additional cost of providing pensions to partners and not just spouses can therefore be offset and remain cost-neutral by implementing the new retirement provisions.

There is a real problem if we are saying that because of the ageing society and the cost of providing pensions at the taxpayer&#039;s expense&#151;which applies in our case as well&#151;we should have fantastically more advantageous pension conditions than our constituents who work in the public sector.

<p><a name="st_90"><a name="41103-11_spnew2"><b> Sir John Butterfill: </b> 
 May I explain why &quot;phasing out&quot; is, in my view, an appropriate term? The changes will come into force gradually. As from this November, new Members will no longer be entitled to the early retirement provision. Existing Members will continue to be entitled to the provision until 2009 and possibly beyond, depending on the date of the general election. Some Members who are re-elected after the next general election will continue to be entitled to the existing arrangements, even possibly until the following general election, so it is a phasing process. The motion will enable the trustees to change the rules of the scheme to allow all this to be put in place.

We must be careful not to cause our own voters to think we are putting ourselves in an extremely privileged position.

I am sure that that will be widely welcomed, as it is in line with the decision already made by the House in principle.

<p>
<a name="41103-11_para6">
<a name="stpa_70">That means that anyone retiring at the next general election will not be affected. Nor will anyone retiring at the general election after that. Indeed, by 2009 nearly half of us&#151;48 per cent&#151;will be able to retire immediately and draw our pensions without any reduction. We will either be over 65 or will have served for more than 20 years, and will qualify for unreduced benefits under the rule of 80. A further 17 per cent of us&#151;including me, as it happens&#151;will either be able to retire then and draw our pensions on better than actuarially neutral terms, or have the potential to do so when we are older.

<p><a name="st_92"><a name="41103-11_spnew4"><b> Mr. Betts: </b> 
 First, will my right hon. Friend spell out more clearly the nature of the residual benefit that will remain after 2009? I do not entirely understand&#151;perhaps other Members do not either&#151;what will happen to those who retain some potential benefit under the existing scheme. Will it go completely after 2009, or will it continue in some form?

<a name="stpa_71">Secondly, does my right hon. Friend accept what was said by my hon. Friend the Member for Ellesmere Port and Neston (Mr. Miller)? There is a difference between Members of Parliament and those in other schemes. We cannot go on our 65th birthdays; we have to go on the date of the general election. If people cannot go with reduced pensions before they are 65, my right hon. Friend is effectively saying that the average retirement age of MPs is 67 or 68.

<p><a name="st_93"><a name="41103-11_spnew5"><b> Mr. Hain: </b> 
 These are complex matters. We already have generous pensions by most people&#039;s standards: the whole House will agree with that. It would be very dangerous if we did not put ourselves in line with the retirement provisions that now apply to other public sector workers, let alone those with much less favourable terms.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41103-11_para8">
<a name="stpa_72">Let me give some examples of how the arrangements would work. On 31 March 2009, a Member aged 54 who has served for 13.6 years will have given over 15 years&#039; service but will not meet the rule of 80. That Member will be able to draw pension before 65 on favourable terms, but not on an unreduced basis. Let us consider the position of a 1987 entrant who, as of 3 November 2004&#151;today&#151;is aged 55 and has 17.4 years&#039; service. As of March 2009, they will meet the rule of 80 and will be able to draw pension immediately on an unreduced basis, so the scheme will continue. As of March 2009, an older, 1992 entrant&#151;aged 59, for example&#151;with 12.6 years&#039; service will meet the rule of 80 and will be able to draw pension immediately on an unreduced basis. As of March 2009, a younger 1992 entrant, aged 43, with 12.5 years&#039; service, will have more than 15 years&#039; service but will not meet the rule of 80. They will, however, be able to draw pension before 65 on favourable terms, but not on an unreduced basis. So it is not the case that Members will suddenly fall over the edge and get no benefit at all; rather, it is a question of providing for these changes in a proper fashion.

The Government look forward to working with the trustees on its detailed implementation. I urge the House to vote for these motions, especially those relating to pensions.

<a name="stpa_74">In all parts of the House and in the country, it is recognised that Members need services such as staff, postage, transport, and personal and office accommodation, in order to do the job effectively on behalf of their constituents, many of whom come to them for help when they have been turned away elsewhere, or when they have been unsuccessful in their struggle against a particular bureaucracy. We speak often about connecting Parliament with the public, and it is imperative that parliamentarians maintain, and be seen to maintain, the highest standards of probity and adherence to the principles of public life. But it also should not be forgotten that we do a vital job, and that when our constituents most need help, they come to us.

<a name="stpa_75">The work and independence of the SSRB has been important in providing the public with an element of reassurance about our accountability. Members of Parliament were first paid in 1911, and our pay levels have always been controversial, primarily because we are one of the few groups with the power to set our own salaries. The mechanism for mitigating this is, and has been since 1970, the objective assessment of a body that is independent and outside Parliament: the SSRB.

The SSRB compares us to chief executives of councils and businesses. Such people employ private secretaries, and their costs are treated as something that a council or company would necessarily provide. Nobody ever talks about them receiving &quot;expenses&quot; or allowances in that regard; such things are treated as the tools of the job, not a perk. So I hope that on another day, we can discuss how these matters might be better presented in future.

Their guidance should be taken into account, but it should not be regarded as the final word on the subject. The principle that those who have an office outside Westminster incur extra costs in providing the services available to Members here seems correct, but establishing non-eligibility to the new payment by reference to how many workstations a Member has seems problematic. A simpler system that retains equality of treatment of Members, but which allows a Member to use part of his salaries budget towards office costs outside London, might well be the way forward. That would also avoid an increase in the incidental expenses provision, while giving an extra element of flexibility within the same envelope. The costs involved should be relatively neutral.

<p><a name="st_99"><a name="41103-12_spnew3"><b> Sir Nicholas Winterton: </b> 
 Does my hon. Friend not accept that the ability of a Member of Parliament to employ two people within the Palace of Westminster should be entirely acceptable? I have one and a half members of staff here and have done for many years; the half member of staff is shared with my wife. We have one suite of offices and two members of staff in the office between our two individual offices. There should be no disincentive to having&#151;quite legitimately&#151;one secretary and one assistant or researcher. Surely there should be no disincentive to having that level of staffing for a Member of Parliament?

<br>&nbsp;<br>of the House about the particular strains that inner London Members would face if there were to be an abatement of provision?

</p>








<p><a name="st_102"><a name="41103-12_spnew6"><b> Mr. Heald: </b> 
 That point is probably best considered in the context of a more detailed report that my hon.

That would be the best way forward for my hon. Friend and his important points.

 My hon. Friend will be aware that my amendment (d) has not been selected, despite gaining 51 Members in support within a couple of hours of being tabled. I am sad about that. My amendment simply said that in referring the matter back to the Members Estimate Committee, we should express the opinion as a House that it is reasonable to employ two members of staff at Westminster. My hon. Friend has just said that he agrees with that, so does he also agree not only that it is reasonable, but that it is the House&#039;s view that the Members Estimate Committee should take it into account?
</p>








<p><a name="st_104"><a name="41103-12_spnew8"><b> Mr. Heald: </b> 
 Yes, as I said, but I also believe in a neater approach rather than having so many different rates of IEP, which is the product of the system of abatements. I think that a proposal such as amendment (g) offers a simpler way of proceeding. My preference is to leave the decision with MPs and to have as simple a system as we can. I certainly believe that having four different rates of IEP and a transitional arrangement that creates another four rates of IEP for the next Parliament is not a satisfactory way forward. Having said that, the simple point that the SSRB was trying to reflect in its suggestions&#151;that there should be some extra help for people who have offices outside London&#151;is a good one. Indeed I, my hon. Friend the Member for West Derbyshire (Mr. McLoughlin) and the Leader of the House himself made that point in evidence to the SSRB. In translating SSRB support for the concept into a practical solution, there might have been room for a simpler proposal.

<p><a name="st_110"><a name="41103-13_spnew0"><b> Mrs. Campbell: </b> 
 I would like to refer to the hon. Gentleman&#039;s implied support for amendment (g). He will recall that, a few years ago, staff salary allowances and incidental expenses were not separate. We had an office cost allowance out of which everything was paid. There were reasons for changing from that system to a separate system of staff salaries. It was thought that many members of staff were not being properly paid and did not have proper terms and conditions. I believe that the changes introduced&#151;the Members advisory panel was instrumental in making the recommendations&#151;have had a major beneficial effect on staff pay and conditions in the House. Does the hon. Gentleman agree that amendment (g) takes us back to where we were before those changes were made?
</p>








<p><a name="st_111"><a name="41103-13_spnew1"><b> Mr. Heald: </b> 
 I hope to persuade the hon. Lady. I agree totally that we should have an IEP that provides for the physical costs of an office outside the House and certain other expenses, and that the salaries budget should be separate from it. She will recall that it is possible to use part of the IEP to subsidise staff salaries. That might apply to Members who have an operation in London where staff costs are more expensive.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41103-13_para0">
<a name="stpa_84">I believe that amendment (g) provides similar flexibility, applying to Members who might have lower staff costs outside London&#151;the salary scales reflect that&#151;but want to use part of it to subsidise the higher costs of providing an office outside London. It provides an element of equality between the two allowances and means that Members can have the same allowances, which is very important in the context of publishing the allowances. We should not have different rates of allowances if the public are going to see them published: they must be on an even basis. I hope that the hon. Lady will accept that making the change will not weaken the principle at all.
</p>








<p><a name="st_112"><a name="41103-13_spnew2"><b> Sir Michael Spicer: </b> 
 Further to what my hon. Friend is saying, is it not also the case that up to 25 per cent. of the staff budget can already be used for consultancy purposes and for buying services? The flexibility already exists.

<a name="stpa_86">A crucial element of greater openness has been the detail provided about how Members&#039; allowances are spent and the new publication of those details, which was handled very efficiently by the staff of the House. The old system lacked the necessary transparency and did not provide full information to the public. The publication of allowances has shown that MPs are generally providing a good service and that they need help to do so. I am sure that both sides of the House will join me in that view.

</p>








<p><a name="st_114"><a name="41103-13_spnew4"><b> Mr. Chris Smith  (Islington, South and Finsbury) (Lab):</b> 
 I want to concentrate on the SSRB&#039;s recommendation on incidental expenses, and especially on the question of abatement for those who have staff here in the House. I have no personal interest in this matter: I am standing down at the next election, so I will not benefit from or be disadvantaged by the proposals. However, I have a very strong interest in ensuring that my successor&#151;whoever he or she is&#151;and those of my colleagues who also represent London seats will not be severely disadvantaged by those proposals.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41103-13_para5">
<a name="stpa_89">I shall make five very brief points. First, the proposals in the SSRB report will severely affect those hon. Members with existing staff who have always been based in the parliamentary estate. That is despite, but in some ways because of, the recommendation for a transitional period. The staff to whom I refer have been employed on the basis that this is their place of work. If, even after a period of one Parliament, this place ceases to be their place of work, the SSRB recommendation would amount to a serious change in their terms and conditions of work and could well mean that they have to terminate their employment.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41103-13_para6">
<a name="stpa_90">Although having a transitional period is better than imposing such a change immediately, I am not sure that it is sensible for us to create what, in effect, is two tiers of membership of this House. Under the recommendations, some hon. Members would be able to have more staff here, and some would not. That does not strike me as terribly sensible.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41103-13_para7">
<a name="stpa_91">Secondly, the provisions in the SSRB report will be very difficult for those hon. Members who represent constituencies in London, but especially so for those 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>3 Nov 2004 : Column 341</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>with inner-London constituencies. As the hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster (Mr. Field) noted, establishing a constituency office in the City, Islington or Holborn costs much more than it does in many other parts of the country outside London. To assume that the same constituency office allowance will apply both in London and outside it takes no account of the differences in costs, prices, rent and so forth.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41103-13_para8">
<a name="stpa_92">Many hon. Members with inner-London constituencies face an especially heavy constituency case load. I have been in this House for twenty-one and a half years. In all that time I have not used any of the allowances available to me to employ any researchers because I have had to devote all my resources to employing people to work on my constituency case load. At present, the number of cases in connection with immigration and asylum is very large for hon. Members with inner-city constituencies&#151;and especially so for those in inner London&#151;but the allowance system does not recognise the additional costs that those hon. Members incur.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41103-13_para9">
<a name="stpa_93">Nothing in either the present or the proposed systems recognises the particular difficulties that face London Members. That is why I have always had my staff here in the parliamentary estate, and why I want to ensure that my successor has the same option, if he or she decides that that is in the best interests of constituents.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41103-13_para10">
<a name="stpa_94">Thirdly, the SSRB proposal hits permanent staff but not people such as interns or volunteers, who share workstations and do not have their own. If my right hon. Friend the Leader of the House and the review body are worried about pressure on the parliamentary estate because of the number of people using the facilities here, I would gently suggest that the report is aiming at the wrong target. The report hits permanent staff as I have described, but ignores the pressure that arises from non-permanent staff. That seems a rather partial approach to the problem.
</p>








<p><a name="st_115"><a name="41103-13_spnew5"><b> Ian Stewart  (Eccles) (Lab):</b> 
 My right hon. Friend mentioned the use of interns and volunteers, but does he accept that the use of such people has implications for the resources of the House? They all need to be trained to use the PDVN system, and they have other training needs that take up the House&#039;s resources.
</p>








<p><a name="st_116"><a name="41103-13_spnew6"><b> Mr. Smith: </b> 
 My hon. Friend is right, but I hasten to make it clear that I am not suggesting that it should not be possible to employ interns or volunteers. However, if we are taking a serious look at the pressure on the House&#039;s resources, we must accept that the problem is very complex. To assume that the SSRB recommendation is the only answer would be to ignore that complexity.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41103-13_para11">
<a name="stpa_95">My fourth point is simple and blunt. Although it does not apply to me, I suspect that it will apply to some of my colleagues, especially those representing seats in London. If implemented, the proposals will involve redundancies among existing staff. That is not something that should be considered lightly, and I am not sure that the SSRB has taken account of the costs involved.

<p>
<a name="41103-14_para0">
<a name="stpa_96">My fifth point is perhaps the most important. In seeking to remove one perceived discrimination between hon. Members, the SSRB is in danger of inserting another. Its report seeks to help those hon. Members with constituency offices outside the parliamentary estate, but in doing so it would cause serious harm and difficulty to those hon. Members&#151;and especially to those London Members&#151;with offices and staff on the parliamentary estate. I suggest that, instead of removing one discrimination and creating another, the solution is to help the one category of hon. Member without harming the other.

However, an equally important principle is that the body must have access to the fullest possible information about the work of parliamentarians. It has become increasingly apparent this afternoon that the SSRB has not been operating on the basis of intelligent analysis of the real work of parliamentarians.

 It is a fair point, but my basic point is that if we decide that we can provide a good service to the country as a whole&#151;we are not just constituency Members; we are members of the UK Parliament as well&#151;surely we should be given some flexibility.

We usually say that we do not want the House to implement retrospective legislation, and I hope that that situation will usually apply to us.

That has weakened the package&#151;perhaps disastrously. Although I would hope that an SSRB package would normally receive overwhelming cross-party support when debated on the Floor, on this occasion the SSRB has either been let down, or has let us down&#151;I am not prepared to judge which. Yes, it has an important role to play, but it is not right that it should advance principles about the way in which Parliament operates that are outwith its terms of reference.

 I am pleased to be called to speak in the debate. There are 659 Members of Parliament, so the Members&#039; service has 659 different shapes. I speak for myself on the basis of my experience. I can tell you at the outset, Mr. Deputy Speaker, that if I retain the confidence of the people of Eccles at the next general election and they return me to this place, I shall make an even bigger effort to assist the authorities with their future deliberations on the question of what I call the &quot;MPs&#039; parliamentary service&quot; by submitting oral evidence to the Senior Salaries Review Body. That service ranges from a Member&#039;s role in the core aims of the service to the way in which the service is delivered across locations. To be frank, I do not think that we do enough to raise public awareness about such matters 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>3 Nov 2004 : Column 349</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>and although I accept that each individual Member must decide the most appropriate shape of service for his or her constituency, there are overarching issues which the House can, and must, address. Nevertheless, I support the system through which the independent SSRB reviews such issues as Members&#039; pay and allowances.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41103-16_para0">
<a name="stpa_124">I thank the SSRB for its comprehensive report. I understand that some members of the body may be in the Public Gallery today, so I hope that the debate will further their understanding of the many varied factors behind the 659 different approaches employed by Members to deliver such a complex and important service. I also thank the body for agreeing to hear my oral evidence in support of the written evidence that I submitted. Although I am pleased that my request to the SSRB bore fruit, I am sad to report that on two occasions, the former Speaker&#039;s Panel on Members&#039; Allowances refused my request for a meeting and did not offer any solution to the problem with the staffing budget that I had highlighted. I thus have great hopes that the new Members Estimate Committee will be much more transparent, accessible and responsive to Members.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41103-16_para1">
<a name="stpa_125">I had a lively and stimulating session with the SSRB, which I thoroughly enjoyed. As I have given written and oral evidence to the 2001 and the 2004 review boards, I have come to realise that while my motive for attending the sessions was to ensure that the body understood my views, I also gained clarification on, and a better understanding of, the issues that arose from our joint exchanges.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41103-16_para2">
<a name="stpa_126">Like many hon. Members, I have an office in Westminster and one in my constituency. I employ 2.5 members of staff, who are individual members of the Transport and General Workers Union parliamentary branch, which is based in the House. I would like to increase that complement to three full-time equivalent workers. As you are aware, Mr. Deputy Speaker, I have deep roots in the trade union movement as a lifelong TGWU member. I take the view that if there is an identified formal job to be done, someone should be employed to do it and paid at the right rate for it. I should point out that although I am a proud trade union member, I have consistently put forward my views on the basis that I want to be a Member of Parliament who is also a good employer. That is imperative if I am to deliver the service that my constituents deserve.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41103-16_para3">
<a name="stpa_127">To deliver that service, we need not only good equipment, but caseworkers, researchers and, of course, the much maligned administrators. I welcome the increase in the staffing budget because I hope that it will go a significant way towards enabling us to employ the three full-time equivalent members of staff that the SSRB recommends at decent and appropriate salary levels. I welcome the SSRB recommendation that the extra pay intended for staff based in London be recognised in their pay ranges.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41103-16_para4">
<a name="stpa_128">I am sorry to say, however, that the problem with the staffing budget remains. In my submission to the SSRB, I argued for the abolition of the anomalous cap on staff salaries. I said that the numbers of staff allowed, after account was taken of the criteria outlined by the House and proper staff evaluation, would create a natural cap in the existing system, and I remain concerned. When the previous report was produced, the House&#039;s 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>3 Nov 2004 : Column 350</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>Department of Finance and Administration circulated to us, as employers, the recommended salary scales for each grade of staff. However, the increase in the staffing allowance that we have received each year since then has met only the cost of inflation. Although I have been able to give my staff a pay increase to cover rising costs, I have not been able to allow them to progress up the salary scales. If I were to do that as the SSRB and the Department of Finance and Administration intended, I would have to pay staff at less than the appropriate grade for their qualifications, experience and duties, or employ fewer than three members of staff, which I believe provides a lesser service than my constituents deserve.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41103-16_para5">
<a name="stpa_129">I doubt that many members of staff are on the top level for posts such as senior parliamentary assistant. The SSRB and the Department of Finance and Administration recommend a rate of &#163;34,300 for such staff based in London. I am certainly unable to pay that amount. I am sure that many of us have experienced and long serving staff, but we just cannot pay them the highest salaries, even when that is appropriate. We do not have the money to do so because the staffing budget has an artificial cap, which means that if an experienced member of staff meets the criteria laid down in the 2001 SSRB report for the highest grade and if the MP, after proper evaluation, agrees to pay that level of salary, he or she must depress the salary levels of the other two full-time equivalent members of staff or alternatively be forced, like me, to consider employing fewer than three members of staff. The system is perverse.

<a name="stpa_130">I hope that the SSRB recommendation to increase our staff budget from &#163;66,450 to &#163;72,000 for Members outside London will help us to make progress on the issue. However, the matter requires further investigation and is still to be resolved. I note that the SSRB recommends a review of job descriptions and pay ranges for caseworkers, which I would support. That should give us a firm basis on which to resolve the matter, and I am happy to assist the Members Estimate Committee or any other appropriate body in order to do so.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41103-16_para7">
<a name="stpa_131">It is well known that I take an interest in the provision of information technology equipment. The implementation of the SSRB recommendations in 2001 was undoubtedly a significant step forward. I am glad that the board is unequivocal in advocating that every MP should be provided with three work stations in addition to their own, which is an acknowledgement that we need three full-time equivalent members of staff. However, we must address the increasing use of pervasive technology such as modern mobile phones that can be used as mini-computers. As I have told Mr. Speaker, I am happy to carry out a pilot, and I shall contact him separately on the matter. We need a designated MP IT service unit. Every Government and parliamentary department has its own designated IT unit, and it is not acceptable in this day and age that MPs should have no such support or back-up.

<p>
<a name="41103-16_para8">
<a name="stpa_132">Turning to SSRB recommendations with which I do not agree, I appreciate that pressure on the parliamentary estate has led to proposals for hot-desking. As I have already said, there is great pressure on MPs to take on interns and other temporary staff, but hot-desking is not the answer. Caseworkers generally need access to hard-copy information, particularly in

<b>3 Nov 2004 : Column 351</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>immigration and asylum cases. They cannot work just anywhere, if for no other reason than to preserve confidentiality. I am on record as predicting that electronically received constituency casework will increase over the next five to 10 years, which means that MPs will have to employ more staff. However, although e-mail casework is increasing, my constituents are far from emailing me as a matter of routine. Constituents with problems still tend to use a small size of ruled writing paper&#151;so much so, in fact, that I think the pad is passed round the constituency. Our constituents expect confidentiality, which must not be compromised. Hot-desking will not solve the ever-increasing need for space for MPs&#039; services on the parliamentary estate. However, the House must be frank with the public and explain why we need certain resources to deliver a modern and effective service. The more accessible and effective Members&#039; services are, the greater the need for adequate and appropriate resources. We should not shirk that responsibility, and we should be frank with the public.

<a name="41103-16_para9">
<a name="stpa_133">As the initiator of the &quot;ADAPT&quot; learning project, which has subsequently developed into the parliamentary learning project, I was pleased that the SSRB highlighted the key role of training for staff and, indeed, Members. However, constituency staff are the Cinderellas of the field, so more must be done to allow them access to high-quality training and support. We need to develop the parliamentary learning project to deliver core training for Members&#039; services, including the use of the internet-based distance learning system originally envisaged in 1998.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41103-16_para10">
<a name="stpa_134">I shall conclude with a provision that affects our constituencies. I am concerned about the recommendation on the one hand to increase the incidental expenses provision to &#163;27,500 while on the&nbsp;other hand clawing back or slicing off some of that money from Members who employ one or more staff members in London. That detrimental change could lead to a massive deficit that might destabilise our services. My local authority has argued with the Government that a reduction in the overall population does not necessarily lead to a reduction in the cost of providing services. I believe that the same principle applies to Members&#039; services. Once a Member has an office in their constituency, fixed costs for rental and heating apply whether they have one or more members of staff. I also oppose any reduction in the facilities available in the House, as it is self-evident that that is not in my constituents&#039; interests. I hope that my recommendation will be remitted to the Members Estimate Committee so that it can find a more acceptable way forward. I shall therefore support the proposals on the provision of incidental expenses tabled by my right hon. Friend the Leader of the House.

<a name="stpa_135">I have not yet addressed the recommendations on Members&#039; pay. The SSRB reports that it received no submissions from MPs proposing that their pay be increased. I gave oral evidence to the SSRB and, on both occasions, I declined when I was asked if I wished to comment on Members&#039; pay.

In fact, I wonder why I am speaking to amendment (g) at all. Apart from the Leader of the House, who got himself into such a muddle trying to answer questions about these matters, everybody agrees that the amendment is a good thing. Perhaps I should sit down and leave it at that, but I have never known a Member of Parliament not use some words when the opportunity to do so is available. As my time is running out in this place and this is such an opportunity, I should like to say just a little bit more, but I promise that it will be only a little bit.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41103-17_para2">
<a name="stpa_138">The main purpose of amendment (g) is to restore to Members the right to restructure their offices however they think best in order for them to carry out their parliamentary and constituency duties. That is the raison d&#039;&#234;tre of the amendment. As has been mentioned, prior to 2001 all Members were treated equally with regard to allowances. Many aspects of those reforms were welcome, but in my view they started this very unhelpful trend towards ending the uniformity of allowances for Members and introducing an element of persuading Members, by the allowances that were available, to restructure their offices in a particular way that was not their way, but the allowances&#039; way. The &#163;7,000 would accelerate that trend.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41103-17_para3">
<a name="stpa_139">I welcome the greater transparency in laying down and publicising Members&#039; allowances, but I think that, in order to be believable&#151;this relates to the point that my hon. Friend the Member for West Derbyshire (Mr. McLoughlin) has just made&#151;those allowances must be made irrespective of where Members&#039; constituencies are and of whether and where they have decided to have a principal office. First, we had extra allowances for Members with London constituencies, and now Members who choose to base their staff in Westminster rather than in their constituency will, if the proposals are agreed to, have their allowances reduced. It is not a fair comparison. We have all had media interest in our various allowances, and we have had it to a greater degree over the past few weeks.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41103-17_para4">
<a name="stpa_140">More importantly, I strongly believe that Members should not be subject to financial pressures in deciding how best to structure their offices in order to do the best job for their constituents. They have to stand up in front of their constituents at the election, and I believe that they should not be subject to outside pressures telling them how they should have been running their affairs. As the House will know, the unique nature of each constituency means that there cannot be such a one-size-fits-all arrangement for Members&#039; offices. The Leader of the House accepted that view when he delicately accepted&#151;I was about to say dodged, but perhaps I shall withdraw that&#151;the points made by hon. Members on this matter.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41103-17_para5">
<a name="stpa_141">I shall not expand on that point, except to give just one example. On the day when the list of MPs&#039; expenses was published, the hon. Member for Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross (John Thurso)&#151;I did not

Instead, he chooses to travel to his constituents and receive logistical support from his Westminster-based staff. If that is the arrangement that he wants, it is the arrangement that he should have. There should be flexibility in the allowance system to enable him to do exactly that. I believe that the review body&#039;s proposals would unfairly penalise those with such arrangements.

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>3 Nov 2004 : Column 355</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>The principle was introduced because it was feared that many members of staff were not being employed under proper terms and conditions. The work done by the Speaker&#039;s advisory panel and now the Members&#039; advisory panel, which I chair, led to the introduction of a standard contract for all employed staff, standard pay scales and a staff salaries budget, which was ring-fenced, so that it is in no one&#039;s interest to pay their staff poverty wages.

 My hon. Friend makes a good point. I agree with her in principle, but as she heard my hon. Friend the Member for Eccles say, there is now no scope for giving proper increments to experienced staff year on year. As I read it, amendment (g) would allow us to do that very thing.
</p>








<p><a name="st_160"><a name="41103-18_spnew1"><b> Mrs. Campbell: </b> 
 We are always going to get to a point at which the maximum is reached. It is inherent in the capping procedure that once staff salaries total the maximum, it is not possible to pay increments in addition to inflationary allowances. That is one of the difficulties that we have to accept. Staff turnover is rapid, so one can start new staff at the bottom of the scale and pay increments to other staff, but we all face that difficulty.
</p>








<p><a name="st_161"><a name="41103-18_spnew2"><b> Mr. Tyler: </b> 
 Will the hon. Lady accept that if the motion is passed hon. Members will be encouraged to employ interns, partially qualified staff, untrained staff or part-time staff, which she apparently wants to do, rather than maintaining professional staff in the House?

<p><a name="st_162"><a name="41103-18_spnew3"><b> Mrs. Campbell: </b> 
 We must all make a judgment on that, but we all understand the importance of employing permanent staff. I would find it difficult to staff my office entirely, or even mainly, with interns and voluntary staff.
</p>








<p><a name="st_163"><a name="41103-18_spnew4"><b> Mr. Dobson: </b> 
 A substantial number of hon. Members supplement the existing money for salaries by taking money from the incidental expenses provision. They do so because they like to give increments to staff, some of whom have worked for them for more than 20 years, and because they like to reward their staff, if their staff undergo training. If they continue that practice and exercise their judgment that their staff should be in their parliamentary estate office, they will not be able to do the other things for which IEP provides, because they will have only &#163;5,000.

 I understand my right hon. Friend&#039;s point and do not pretend that the SSRB&#039;s recommendations are entirely satisfactory. I use the example to speak against amendment (g), which erodes the important principle that staff salaries should be ring-fenced. Together with the changes to staff pension arrangements, we have put staff employment on a proper and fair footing, and I do not want to see the erosion of that principle.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41103-18_para0">
<a name="stpa_145">It is, of course, possible to transfer money into salaries from IEP, but not the reverse, which amendment (g) would allow, and we should hold fast to that principle. I realise that amendment (g) was tabled for good reasons

<br>&nbsp;<br>and that it is simpler than the proposal advanced by the SSRB. However, it is better to increase IEP and allow hon. Members to transfer some of it to staff salaries, which they may do now, than to transfer money from staff salaries to IEP, so I cannot support the amendment afternoon.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41103-18_para1">
<a name="stpa_146">On the main proposal, I welcome the modest increase in the staff budget. Paragraph 4.9, table 4.3 in the SSRB report makes it clear that most hon. Members spend all of their staff salaries allowance. I personally welcome the extra, which will enable me to reward my staff a little more generously for what they do. I need to employ my full complement of three staff, all of whom work on constituency casework. I do not employ staff to conduct research here because the casework load is so heavy that I need three staff to do it&#151;I can also find plenty of work for the various interns and volunteers who pass through my office. My staff serve me well&#151;they perform an essential service and are much appreciated by my constituents. However, a new rule to increase IEP for those hon. Members with constituency offices and to reduce it for members of staff based at Westminster would present many of us with a conundrum.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41103-18_para2">
<a name="stpa_147">Earlier, I referred to the important question of how workstations would count under amendment (g) towards reducing the allowance. I would certainly base my workstation here in the House, which is where I do most of my work, but I do not use it when I sit in this Chamber, for example, and therefore consider it to be available to a member of staff. That addresses the point raised by the right hon. Member for Maidstone and The Weald (Miss Widdecombe) about two members of staff being the norm. One could have a staff workstation and a Member&#039;s workstation, in which case two members of staff could be employed for about the same IEP as they are currently.

 This is Monty Python stuff. The hon. Lady&#039;s answer is that we should get round the problem not by decreasing the burden on the parliamentary estate but by fiddling how we define &quot;workstation&quot;&#151;forget it.

<a name="stpa_148">Amendment (c) concerns mileage allowances, which I have always considered absurdly generous, possibly because I do not own a car and therefore have rarely had the opportunity to claim them. We should encourage hon. Members to use environmentally friendly means of travel, and the private car does not fall into that category. I appreciate that my constituency is small, that I can get around it by bicycle, on foot and by bus, and that many hon. Members cannot do that, but the current mileage allowance is far too high.

<a name="stpa_149">I use a taxi when it is raining, blowing or snowing, which makes a bicycle impractical. Ironically, the current mileage allowance pays about one third of the cost of a taxi. We have recently introduced the possibility of claiming the full amount from IEP, provided that receipts are produced, but because I always spend my IEP&#151;in most years, I exceed it by a quite a large amount&#151;I cannot use that solution. If IEP were to increase, it would allow me to use some of my allowance to pay for taxis, when they are necessary.

<a name="stpa_166">I want to speak for one minute on a small matter. It is frustrating that I have failed to get it progressed. Perhaps it is a symptom of our treatment of such issues that something so minor has not been progressed. The SSRB defines the additional costs allowance as it is described on the House of Commons website. It states that the purpose of the allowance is


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_24">&quot;To reimburse Members for costs incurred when staying overnight away from their main home whilst performing Parliamentary duties.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="41103-19_para13">
<a name="stpa_167">However, the additional costs allowance was brought into being by a motion in December 1971 and defined specifically as being for parliamentary duties in London or the constituency. At that time, there was no National Assembly for Wales or Scottish Parliament. For a small number in the north of Scotland and perhaps in rural Wales, it is often physically impossible to carry out parliamentary duties with Scottish or Welsh Ministers or, indeed, Westminster Ministers when they are visiting the relevant Parliament, without staying overnight, away from home.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41103-19_para14">
<a name="stpa_168">The Fees Office solution, which is bound by a previous resolution, is to tell Members to claim out of their IEP. However, it is clear from the SSRB report that IEP is not designed to pay for Members&#039; overnight 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>3 Nov 2004 : Column 361</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>expenses. The additional costs allowance should do that. I am not asking for an increase in the allowance, merely for the ability to claim from the correct allowance for meeting a Minister in the Scottish Parliament or the National Assembly for Wales instead of being told to claim from an allowance that was not designed for that purpose.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41103-19_para15">
<a name="stpa_169">This affects a very small number of Members, but I would have thought that it was a very simple matter to resolve. I had a meeting with the Leader of the House last year to attempt to progress it, and I find it highly frustrating that something so simple, so clear and so obvious cannot be done to bring the House up to date in regard to its expenses provision. I strongly suspect that, if the SSRB were more familiar with the nature of our allowances, it would have had no objection whatever to my proposal. I therefore hope that the Members Estimate Committee will, if the House decides to charge it with considering these matters, introduce this minor amendment. It would make life for a few Members much easier by bringing the allowances into line with what they were originally intended to do, and by bringing them into terms with reality.

<p><a name="st_180"><a name="41103-20_spmin0"><b>The Deputy Leader of the House of Commons  (Mr.&nbsp;Phil Woolas): </b> 
 I thank all the right hon. and hon. Members who have contributed to the debate, not only this afternoon but in the extensive work that they have done before. Members such as the hon. Member for Bournemouth, West (Sir John Butterfill) and my hon. Friend the Member for Cambridge (Mrs. Campbell) have put in a huge amount of time and effort on behalf of us all&#151;often without thanks, as we have seen this afternoon. I thank them and all the other Members who have taken part.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41103-20_para0">
<a name="stpa_170">I emphasise that, as this is a House matter, this will be a free vote for Back Benchers on this side and, I know, on the Opposition side&#151;<i>[Interruption.]</i> If hon. Members will be patient, I shall explain. My right hon. Friend the Leader of the House has a duty to put forward the recommendations of the independent report from the SSRB, which the House commissioned. He cannot cherry-pick, should not cherry-pick, and has not cherry-picked the recommendations. This is an independent report and it is presented to us to ensure that the integrity of the House is maintained.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41103-20_para1">
<a name="stpa_171">I want to go through some of the arguments in favour of the motion and against the amendments&#151;<i>[Interruption.]</i> If the hon. Member for Buckingham (Mr. Bercow) would stop chuntering, he might find that he has some sympathy with what I have to say&#151;<i>[Interruption.]</i> He is chuntering and chattering, as is normally the case. As I was saying, it is incumbent on us to put these recommendations before the House. As the Leader of the House acknowledged, there is some difficulty in regard to the recommendations on incidental expenses provisions. The SSRB report recognises that some of the matters that it has been asked to deal with&#151;it is the House that asked it to do so&#151;go beyond the remit of considering Members&#039; pay and allowances. Of course, there is an interaction 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>3 Nov 2004 : Column 362</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>between office accommodation, incidental expenses and staff allowances. It is also a fact&#151;a harsh one&#151;that the parliamentary estate is very crowded, and that has to be taken into account.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41103-20_para2">
<a name="stpa_172">The hon. Member for North Cornwall (Mr. Tyler) made the point that there was discrimination under the current system. His worry was that the proposed new system would introduce another kind of discrimination, and that two wrongs would not make a right. That is exactly why my right hon. Friend the Leader of the House has asked for a deviation from the SSRB recommendation in this one regard, by asking the Members Estimate Committee to consider this matter. He has done so because the matter is not exclusively about salaries and allowances.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41103-20_para3">
<a name="stpa_173">Amendment (g), which has the advantage of simplicity, has been supported by hon. Members on both sides. It contains a carrot, in that it would redress the discrimination against those Members who lose out by not having staff on the parliamentary estate, but it does not provide the stick, in terms of an incentive to bear down on the staff. I am not arguing that it should do that, or that it should not. I am pointing out that the choice has been put before the House. Hon. Members should bear in mind the fact&#151;as the House authorities, the Leader of the House and I have to&#151;that none of these things come without a cost. We do not know the exact cost of amendment (g), but we estimate it at between &#163;2 million and &#163;3 million. However, we must acknowledge in our deliberations the fact that we are in a unique situation in deciding our own pay and allowances. I am grateful for the indication that amendment (h) will not be pushed to the vote.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41103-20_para4">
<a name="stpa_174">On mileage, the hon. Member for Macclesfield (Sir Nicholas Winterton) has pointed out the shock impact of the proposal, in that Members who use cars will lose money. On the other hand, the House has to balance whether it wishes to accept the independence of the SSRB report and the fact that our mileage allowances are better than those for members of the public. If there are problems with the Inland Revenue rates, I suggest that hon. Members take that up with the Government and the Inland Revenue, not make special pleading for their own case.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41103-20_para5">
<a name="stpa_175">On pensions, which are perhaps the most important point, it is clear that the increase in the fund is provided by Members&#039; contributions. This is not feather-bedding by the Exchequer; Members&#039; salaries pay those contributions, which sets a good example. However, I believe that we have a moral, as well as a political and financial, obligation to accept these recommendations that the trustees all supported.

<a name="stpa_177">The motion takes note of the Procedure Committee&#039;s report on Sessional Orders and resolutions, published last November, and the Government&#039;s reply to it. It approves the proposals set out in paragraphs 9, 10 and 25 of the report for changes in the practice of the House at the beginning of the Session.

<a name="stpa_178">As the Committee&#039;s report explains, for nearly 200 years&#151;and longer in some cases&#151;the House has agreed to three orders and three resolutions at the beginning of each Session.

<a name="stpa_179">Since 1852, these matters have been taken just before the debate on the reply to the Queen&#039;s Speech. They are proposed from the Chair without notice, and have occasionally given rise to debate.

<a name="stpa_180">At the suggestion of Mr. Speaker, the Procedure Committee conducted a thorough inquiry to consider whether the Sessional Orders and resolutions should be abolished and updated, and came to the very clear conclusion that our traditional practice should change.

</p>

<p>
<a name="41103-22_para7">
<a name="stpa_183">Secondly, the Committee considered the Sessional Orders and resolutions on elections, witnesses and the Votes and Proceedings. It found that the resolution about bribery and the provision for Members to withdraw during any debate on any dispute on their return are obsolete and misleading, as responsibility for election offences and disputes now belongs to the courts, not to the House; that the provision about double returns&#151;two Members being returned for the same seat&#151;relates to an event that cannot now take place; that the order for the printing of the Votes and 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>3 Nov 2004 : Column 371</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>Proceedings&#151;the formal daily minutes of the House&#151;is unnecessary and that the provision that the Speaker should peruse them before they are printed is not normally carried out; and that the resolutions against tampering with witnesses and giving false evidence have some value as statements of intent, but add nothing to the House&#039;s powers to deal with contempts or, in the case of tampering with witnesses or the giving of false evidence on oath, the statutory powers. The Committee, therefore, recommends that the passing of the Sessional Orders and resolutions relating to elections, witnesses and the Votes and Proceedings be discontinued. The Government agree. The motion seeks the House&#039;s agreement to that change.
</p>








<p><a name="st_193"><a name="41103-22_spnew0"><b> Mr. Eric Forth  (Bromley and Chislehurst) (Con):</b> 
 I hope that at some stage the Leader of the House will tell us why he thinks that those splendid, if slightly archaic, traditions are in any way harmful. This is beginning to look like yet another of the ghastly modernisations that seem to be becoming commonplace, so rather than simply reading out the traditions as if to say that they are self-evidently a bad thing, will he tell us why he thinks it necessary to do away with them?
</p>








<p><a name="st_194"><a name="41103-22_spnew1"><b> Mr. Hain: </b> 
 The right hon. Gentleman has no doubt looked carefully at the Procedure Committee&#039;s report, so he will know that the Committee recommended the changes&#151;and I agree.

<p>
<a name="41103-22_para8">
<a name="stpa_184">The Committee found that the provision, in the elections order, about Members returned for more than one place is unlikely ever to be needed. It last happened in 1910, but the Committee recommended that the possibility be dealt with once and for all by the House deciding, when agreeing to its report, that all Members who are returned for two or more places in any part of the United Kingdom should choose for which of the places they will serve, within one week after it appears that there is no question about their election for that place. The motion contains that provision.

I remember the Foreign Affairs Committee report, which was stingingly critical of the Government, on that matter.

<a name="stpa_201">At business questions the week before last, I suggested that one way in which to tackle the matter would be to form a sub-committee of the Liaison Committee, which could call in the Leader of the House if a dispute occurred. The Leader of the House dismissed the idea out of hand, but I do not know why, because it seems modest enough. If he will not accept my idea, surely as Leader of the House, who is supposed to uphold the rights of Select Committees, strengthen our procedures and support scrutiny, he must introduce a proposal that will work.

Although we can admire its durability, his form of protest causes real problems for Parliament and for others. The problem is not aesthetic&#151;it is not just that the posters do not look nice or anything like that. The fact is that he has created something akin to a fence-like structure. That mars the appearance of the square, but the main problem is one of security: to allow a barrier of that sort directly opposite the gates of Parliament is unwise. The Speaker has raised that as a point of concern. Police are forced to check around the barrier on the square several times a day to see what is happening behind the posters and placards, and the fence obscures security sightlines. Today&#039;s reality is that we cannot ignore such security concerns, and I think that Mr. Speaker is right to have raised the issue.

 Nobody minds someone attending to make a protest carrying a banner&#151;that is part of our democratic process.

 The hon. Gentleman may have missed the sedentary intervention from the Front Bench that I heard, implying that what he described did not constitute hindering.

According to the Sessional Order, the provision would apply when Parliament was in session, but that could be late at night when there was not much going on in the building.

 I am always rather uncomfortable when we have a discussion that appears to be ad hominem, so I shall not follow precisely the line pursued by the hon. Member for Hayes and Harlington (John McDonnell), but I want to remind the House that, long before the particular individual whom we have been discussing was permanently installed, a pig named Winston was present. I do not recall any Opposition Member objecting to the presence of that pig, although it was just as untidy as the gentleman to whom we are referring.

<a name="41103-28_para0">
<a name="stpa_216">I want to return to the report and the motion. Recommendations 1, 2 and 3, which the Government accept, are very sensible. They should be endorsed by the House. Recommendation 4 relates to the new statement that is to be made giving details of the

<a name="stpa_217">That obviously is important, but as my hon. Friend the Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey (Simon Hughes) said, there surely must be a proposal as to what will be said in that statement. I do not know why we have waited so long, because the report was made to the House in November last year, and we could by now have seen a draft. I hope that we will see one before the general election.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41103-28_para2">
<a name="stpa_218">Clearly, however, the main matter for consideration this evening is recommendation 5. I want to read that again to the House:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_52">&quot;The Government should introduce appropriate legislation to prohibit long-term demonstrations&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="41103-28_para3">
<a name="stpa_219">That gives rise to all sorts of problems of definition. What is a long-term demonstration? If an individual comes and goes regularly but intermittently, is that a long-term demonstration? If we have a very large demonstration that raises the security issues referred to earlier, and it takes more than 24 hours, is that a long-term demonstration? What is the difference? I am suspicious of that recommendation, and to be fair, so are the Government, whose response states:

<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_53">&quot;The Government&#039;s first principle is that the right of free expression under Article 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights should be protected.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="41103-28_para4">
<a name="stpa_220">Furthermore, they do not ask us to endorse paragraph 22 and recommendation 5. There were concerns in the Committee about the recommendation, as was obvious from the evidence given to it, and as I know from Members present this evening. I therefore hope that we 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>3 Nov 2004 : Column 388</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>will make progress very slowly on that recommendation. It could be, as hon. Members have said, a slippery slope.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41103-28_para5">
<a name="stpa_221">There is something to be welcomed and celebrated about the fact that the main focus of demonstration has in recent months moved from opposite Downing street into Parliament square. I hope that that is recognition that Parliament still has a role in our political society, and that the body politic is not exclusively in Whitehall. It is extremely helpful that people now recognise that speaking to Members of Parliament, albeit occasionally through loudhailers, might have some practical impact. It is much better than simply shouting at No. 10 and assuming that that is the only place in which power lies.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41103-28_para6">
<a name="stpa_222">I understand the concerns of members of the public about trying to ensure that their voice is heard. These days, it is difficult. The hon. Member for North-East Hertfordshire (Mr. Heald) referred to himself as a member of the Hyde Park Tories&#151;I am not quite sure what that described&#151;but there is a case for a designated area in an appropriate part of London where people can speak their mind and have an audience that is attentive and perhaps even influential. Perhaps he would join me in suggesting that we move speakers&#039; corner from Hyde park to St. James&#039;s park&#151;[Hon. Members: &quot;Connaught square.&quot;] Hon. Members are suggesting other parts of London, but I am not quite sure why. Perhaps it is opposite the residence of a particular individual.

<p>
<a name="41103-28_para7">
<a name="stpa_223">There is an extremely important issue at stake. To some extent, the Government are attempting to push it sideways, with references to the Mayor of London&#039;s &quot;World Squares for All&quot; proposals for Parliament square. I cannot quite see the Mayor of London addressing the issue in the way that I would prefer, but he may have a different view from the Government&#039;s. What is extremely important is that the Government go on to say that there will be a &quot;consultation exercise&quot;, but they seek to limit the remit of that consultation exercise to &quot;developing police powers&quot;. That must be in the context of the rights of the individual in this country to represent his or her views. The Leader of the House has already said that there is existing legislation to deal with disruptive, dangerous or threatening activities that may concern us in our duties in the House.
</p>








<p><a name="st_300"><a name="41103-28_spnew8"><b> Mr. Bercow: </b> 
 I very much admire the hon. Gentleman, but may I put it to him that although the House should have self-respect it should not practise self-delusion? I put it to him that the reason why Mr. Haw continues to indulge in his rancid rants opposite the House of Commons is not that he wishes to pay tribute to Parliament but that he knows that he is able to get off scot-free. That is partly because of the rank naivety of the hon. Gentleman and others.
</p>








<p><a name="st_301"><a name="41103-28_spnew9"><b> Mr. Tyler: </b>

If, in the interests of tidiness, we are in any way to undermine the legitimate concerns of our constituents and the public at large&#151;if we are to extinguish long-standing rights&#151;let us do it with our eyes open, and not because we have suddenly joined the Keep Britain Tidy campaign. There is existing legislation to deal with the threats that we all understand are there. I found the flight of fantasy from the hon. Member for North-East Hertfordshire extraordinary. There are security issues, but they are not there now, and they are not involved in the proposed change to our Sessional Orders.

<a name="stpa_225">It is certainly important for us to look carefully at the issue of access, for a number of reasons&#151;access for Members, staff and constituents wishing to come here on legitimate business. The order, however, does not deal with that. I accept that the existing order has been there for some time, but as the hon. Member for Hayes and Harlington pointed out, if it has not proved satisfactory in the past why should we repeat it now? The current wording of the revised order is surely redundant. It says:

 I have listened to the hon. Gentleman with some impatience. It seems to me that he has not read the report in full, and has not taken note of the fact that we received representations and evidence from the Metropolitan Police Commissioner himself, the Serjeant at Arms, the Clerk of the House and others associated with the security and administration of the parliamentary estate. Does he give no weight to the evidence and views of those who have looked after this place for hundreds of years?
</p>








<p><a name="st_303"><a name="41103-29_spnew1"><b> Mr. Tyler: </b> 
 I am a great fan of the hon. Gentleman and of the traditions of the House, but I have read the evidence in the report, and it is far from clear that there is unanimity. I wish there were, because that would make it much easier for us. I also have great respect for the Metropolitan Police Commissioner, but let us face it: the police made some absurd mistakes on the day of the hunting demonstration. It was their fault that people came into this place disguised as building workers; it was no fault of officers of the House. I take with a pinch of salt the suggestion in the evidence that the commissioner is seeking new powers. Whenever the police seek new powers, I think it the right and responsibility of Members to establish why the existing powers are not sufficient.
</p>








<p><a name="st_304"><a name="41103-29_spnew2"><b> Mr. Heald: </b> 
 Much has been made of the permanent demonstration. The commissioner spoke of what happened four years ago when there was a demonstration, Parliament square was cut up and statues were damaged. He said that there should be

<br>&nbsp;<br>stronger powers to tackle such dangerous incidents. I do not think we should spend the entire debate speaking about Mr. Haw.
</p>








<p><a name="st_305"><a name="41103-29_spnew3"><b> Mr. Tyler: </b> 
 I entirely agree, which is why I want to return to recommendation 7. It is clear from the recommendation&#151;I understand that the Government accept this&#151;that the legislation they are now considering, in a wider sense, will require extensive consultation, for reasons that I think all hon. Members would appreciate. The new Sessional Order is essentially an interim measure, and a very insubstantial and probably rather ineffective one.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41103-29_para0">
<a name="stpa_227">What happens next? I am always slightly suspicious of secondary legislation, and the suggestion that everything will be straightforward&#151;that it is just a matter of detail, and that the wish of the House is being implemented. It is easy for us to agree to that. The Leader of the House said earlier that this would be a matter for secondary legislation. I hope that there will be the fullest possible consultation, and that we will have a full opportunity to examine the implications of that secondary legislation. All too often, such legislation goes through with insufficient scrutiny. That is a major criticism of our parliamentary procedure, and this particular issue surely requires very careful scrutiny indeed.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41103-29_para1">
<a name="stpa_228">Yes, we need to strike a balance. In considering access to this place, we have to ensure that Members, their staff and constituents, and the staff of the House are protected. That is critical, and we cannot afford to allow undue pressure to be applied that prevents us from doing our duty, but equally, in terms of freedom speech, one of our duties is to ensure that members of the public are not impeded if they want to exercise their right and duty to express their views in a democratic society. The balance between those two conflicting pressures is a very difficult one to strike, and it requires that all Members of the House&#151;not just somebody Upstairs in Committee&#151;consider them very carefully.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41103-29_para2">

<p><a name="st_306"><a name="41103-29_spnew4"><b> Mr. Tony McWalter  (Hemel Hempstead) (Lab/Co-op):</b> 
 I will not detain the House for long, but there are just a couple of observations that I would like to make. First, we should dissociate the question of access to the House from what is currently going on in Parliament square, inasmuch as we can. Unlike the hon. Member for North Cornwall (Mr. Tyler), I consider the Procedure Committee&#039;s proposal&#151;I am a member of that Committee&#151;to be effective. It orders that


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_55">&quot;no obstruction be permitted to hinder the passage of Members to and from this House&quot;,</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="41103-29_para3">
<a name="stpa_230">and subsequently refers to the duties that we carry on in the House. Such duties are the very reason why we are trying to ensure that Members are not so obstructed, so the proposal makes eminent sense.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41103-29_para4">
<a name="stpa_231">In my view, the police need this reminder. On both of the two occasions on which I was prevented from entering the House, the police were responsible. When George W. Bush was in the area&#151;I understand that he 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>3 Nov 2004 : Column 391</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>has been re-elected President of the United States&#151;I and other MPs were prevented from getting anywhere near the House of Commons for some considerable time. <i>[Interruption.]</i> I note that other Members did indeed experience such a problem. Whatever the commissioner understood about his responsibility to ensure that Members of Parliament could actually get here to perform their duties, that message somehow failed to percolate down to officers controlling the area. They treated Members of Parliament as if they were members of the public, who could be directed as and when they wished.
</p>








<p><a name="st_307"><a name="41103-29_spnew5"><b> Mr. Salmond: </b> 
 The hon. Gentleman is making a very interesting point. If the Government proceed with criminal legislation, who might be prosecuted if such circumstances are repeated? Would he like to venture an answer?
</p>








<p><a name="st_308"><a name="41103-29_spnew6"><b> Mr. McWalter: </b> 
 I am tempted to say that if members of the police force do not carry out their duties, they would be subject to the normal process of police discipline for failing to understand and act on their responsibilities. I rather doubt whether the laws that we get will push things any further than that, but Members will also know that historically, this Chamber has been ringed with policemen to prevent Members from entering. I know that we are talking about the 17th century, but that is how Cromwell succeeded in getting complete control of the parliamentary process.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41103-29_para5">
<a name="stpa_232">So there is an historical precedent to show that, if one wants to turn democracy into tyranny, the first thing to do is to ensure that Members of Parliament cannot sit on these Benches and discuss matters in the way that we are currently doing. The House needs to be very mindful of that pivotal right. It is a pivotal right not only for Members of Parliament, but for the 56 million people whom we represent when we come here. We are the custodians of their freedoms, and our freedom is a condition of that. So this is not a trivial matter, and we need to ensure that that right is properly protected.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41103-29_para6">
<a name="stpa_233">The second issue that I wish to raise relates to the suggestion that all MPs should wear an identity card for security purposes. I would like to make a couple of points about that. On the other occasion when I was stopped from entering the House, the officer on the door did not just ask whether I was an MP&#151;I said yes&#151;but also whether I had my identity card. I scrambled around in my pockets but was unable to find it. I was detained nearly beyond the end of a vote, but just about managed to get in at the very last minute.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41103-29_para7">
<a name="stpa_234">If it became a condition for entry to the Palace that one had to have a pass, it would pose many interesting issues. First, Members could forget their pass; it could be lost or stolen. In many ways, the requirement to use a pass could prove a significant obstacle to Members carrying out their duties. I heard one Member say last week, &quot;MPs want to be privileged, being the only people who do not have to wear a pass&quot;, but the answer to that is that as few obstacles as possible should be put in the way of MPs who come here to participate in debates. Any requirement to wear a pass could certainly compromise that freedom.

<a name="41103-29_para8">
<a name="stpa_235">Demonstrations in Parliament square are a separate issue. I have already provided my own example to show that Members are sometimes prevented from entering the Palace. Not having a clear understanding of the rights of people in Parliament square is another important component of the problem. We need to sort out whether people can have a permanent encampment and whether hundreds of thousands of people can be allowed there. We need to make clear exactly what rights people have. I insist that that be factored in, of course, with the rights of Members of Parliament to unhindered passage to this place in order to perform their duties in the House. That is the most important matter. It is vital to have facilities for demonstrations and perhaps we should look into their longevity, intermittence and similar issues. Crucially, the right of MPs to get into the House is a fundamental part of our democracy, so I hope that Members will accept the recommendations of the Procedure Committee.

What we are seeking to do is to use Parliament square in a far better fashion. I believe that Mr. Haw has been there for some considerable time&#151;at least three years.

They included the Metropolitan Police Commissioner, the Clerk of the&nbsp;House and the Serjeant at Arms. We also received the encouragement of Mr. Speaker, who is deeply concerned about the situation in Parliament square.

 Likewise, but the hon. Gentleman&#039;s admiration may be against his better judgment. However, does he realise that the Sessional Orders are the only thing that we have to caution witnesses and those people who would lean on witnesses? The orders afford some protection to those who might be leant on. The fact that they have not been drawn to anyone&#039;s attention is the real problem.
</p>








<p><a name="st_340"><a name="41103-31_spnew5"><b> Sir Nicholas Winterton: </b> 
 The hon. Gentleman has made his point to the House and I am sure that it will be noted by the Deputy Leader of the House and the Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department, the hon. Member for Don Valley (Caroline Flint). As we say at paragraph 10 of our report, the survival of the Sessional Orders for so long may reflect a desire by the House to begin the Session with a reminder of matters that it considers important. Certainly the issue to which the hon. Gentleman has just drawn attention is important.
</p>

<a name="stpa_248">As I hope I have made clear, we believe that the Sessional Orders are no longer appropriate for that purpose, but we have suggested that, instead, Mr. Speaker might make a statement about the duties and

<a name="stpa_249">We also recommend the continuation of the First Reading of the Outlawries Bill. That takes only a few seconds and serves to remind the House of an important principle.

</p>

<a name="41103-31_para2">
<a name="stpa_250">I return to the Sessional Order that has dominated the debate: that on access to the House. I tell the hon. Members for Hayes and Harlington and for Islington, North that the order, like the others, is nearly 300 years old, so it is much older than the Metropolitan police to whom it is now addressed. As hon. Members will note, it includes a provision to prevent disorder in Westminster Hall, but we think that that has become unnecessary because Westminster Hall is now within the parliamentary estate and the precincts of the House.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41103-31_para3">
<a name="stpa_251">At the beginning of the 19th century, the order also provided that there should be no annoyance by chairmen. Quite by chance, I have an interesting extract from the <i>Journal</i> of the House from the year of 1801, and I hope that hon. Members will not mind if I read it out. It says:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_57">&quot;<i>Ordered,</i> That the Constables in Waiting do take Care that there be no Gaming, or other Disorders, in <i>Westminster Hall</i>, or the Passages leading to the House, during the Sitting of Parliament; and that there be no Annoyance by Chairmen, Footmen, or otherwise, therein or thereabouts.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="41103-31_para4">
<a name="stpa_252">Of course, those chairmen were not Chairmen of Committees, but those who would be at either end of a sedan chair. I thus do not take the matter, which was drawn to my attention by the Clerk of the Procedure Committee, too personally, although having recently injured my Achilles&#039; tendon, I could do with the use of a number of chairmen and a sedan chair to get around the Palace of Westminster.

 May I come back to that, even if I perhaps do so after I have finished my speech, because I cannot give the hon. Gentleman a direct answer off the cuff? I know that he would not want me to give him false information, because he and I have an understanding that we are always direct with each other.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41103-31_para6">
<a name="stpa_254">Although the existing Order has a quaint aspect, it has a serious side, too. I am sure that most hon. Members agree that access to the House should be preserved at all times so that its work may go on uninterrupted. I suspect that hon. Members believe that the Order gives the Metropolitan police extra powers to ensure that that occurs, but unfortunately that is not the case. No Order of the House&#151;neither the current one nor any revised one&#151;can give the police extra powers, which to an extent addresses a concern raised earlier by the hon.

<b>3 Nov 2004 : Column 398</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>Member for Hayes and Harlington. Powers relating to London exist in the Metropolitan Police Act 1839, but they are largely unenforceable.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41103-31_para7">
<a name="stpa_255">Measures to prevent large numbers of people from approaching the House for specific purposes were repealed in 1986. I know that because on at least two occasions I took part in demonstrations in support of textile workers and those in this country&#039;s textile and clothing industries&#151;they still have my support. We were allowed to march from Hyde park, but the closest we could come to the Palace of Westminster was the Tate gallery, because we were governed by the legislation that existed prior to 1986. The law on demonstrations that block access to Parliament is in practice exactly the same as the one applying to demonstrations elsewhere in the country.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41103-31_para8">
<a name="stpa_256">I repeat and emphasise the point that we are not calling for a ban on demonstrations. As we say in paragraph 11 of the report:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_59">&quot;the right to demonstrate peacefully is highly prized and is a fundamental right, and we have no desire to prevent the public expressing their concerns to Members of Parliament in this way.&quot;</p>

 Further to the intervention by the hon. Member for Banff and Buchan (Mr. Salmond), the words to be inserted in the new Sessional Order do not exist in the old one, and greatly expand the advice that we are giving the Metropolitan Police Commissioner. The hon. Member for Macclesfield (Sir Nicholas Winterton) is arguing that he simply wants to regulate demonstrations, but he has not given us any information about how that is to be done. Will they be licensed, and will the licence have to be paid for? Is he going to set up a regulator called Ofdemo?
</p>








<p><a name="st_344"><a name="41103-31_spnew9"><b> Sir Nicholas Winterton: </b> 
 I fear that those questions should be put not to me but to the Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department, the hon. Member for Don Valley, and the Government. We have highlighted a problem that requires attention. However, I am grateful for much of what the Leader of the House said.

<p><a name="st_345"><a name="41103-31_spnew10"><b> Lembit &#214;pik: </b> 
 Does the hon. Gentleman not accept that with the best will in the world his proposals will almost certainly have the unintended consequence of restricting demonstrations? For example, he thought that Mr. Haw could be prevented from demonstrating in Parliament square, but there could be a continuous demonstration on a rotating basis. He cannot have it both ways&#151;he must accept either that there is a continuous demonstration by different people or that demonstration is limited.
</p>








<p><a name="st_346"><a name="41103-31_spnew11"><b> Sir Nicholas Winterton: </b> 
 Personally, I believe that there could be many demonstrations, but longstanding demonstrations by individuals should be regulated and come to an end. If other people want to come and demonstrate in their place, they can do so. However, more stringent regulations are needed because of the environmental and heritage importance of Parliament square.

 Following the quote that I read out a moment ago, I should highlight the fact that that is not the same as preventing access to Parliament. Demonstrations should not prevent hon. Members from reaching the House, as the hon. Member for Hemel Hempstead (Mr. McWalter), a member of the Procedure Committee, said. The police tell us that they need powers to ensure uninterrupted access. Although the order deals with access, we also considered the related matter of the nuisance caused by demonstrations in Parliament square&#151;both the unsightly nature of long-term demonstrations in a world heritage site and, perhaps more importantly, the noise from megaphones and amplifiers, which prevent people in nearby offices from doing their work properly. I have seen evidence that members of the public are grossly inconvenienced by the raucous noise emanating from those megaphones.

<p><a name="st_351"><a name="41103-32_spnew0"><b> Dr. Julian Lewis: </b> 
 My hon. Friend neatly anticipates my concern about noise. Can he confirm that, whatever demonstrations are allowed, whether they are individual, long-term, short-term or, indeed, rotating, it is important that they should not cause annoyance by bombarding people doing legitimate work with incessant sound? Does he also accept that while loudhailers are, as the hon. Member for Islington, North (Jeremy Corbyn) rightly pointed out, essential to communicate with people participating in a set-piece demonstration, it is an abuse to use them continually to interfere with people who are not part of the demonstration?
</p>








<p><a name="st_352"><a name="41103-32_spnew1"><b> Sir Nicholas Winterton: </b> 
 My hon. Friend anticipates what I am about to say. The Committee simply could not understand why the noise is allowed to go on, day after day, given all the recent legislation on noisy neighbours. Attempting to prevent long-term demonstrations may be controversial&#151;and hon. Members have expressed such a concern&#151;but we think that that should be done while allowing short-term demonstrations, provided that they do not impede access or produce unreasonable amounts of noise.
</p>








<p><a name="st_353"><a name="41103-32_spnew2"><b> Mr. Salmond: </b> 
 We are now coming to the nub of the issue. What I would like to know is where the phrase

 I hope that the hon.

In the 1840s, Parliament imprisoned an Irish Member for failing to sign up to a Committee on the basis that his not doing so destroyed the work of the Committee. He was imprisoned here for a week by Members of Parliament, but those days are gone, and we have to have a new agency dealing with these matters.

 Even if I am wrong&#151;I do not think so&#151;it is incumbent on those seeking a change to advance an alternative, which they have failed to do, to ensure that evidence given to Parliament is the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth and that people do not interfere with witnesses. We should not support any change until we know the alternative.

 I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman and admire his stance. The Deputy Leader of the House&#039;s response that the protection exists elsewhere is not sufficient, and surely that protection should be strengthened rather than weakened. There would be no harm in reasserting that protection at the beginning of every Session, because a civil servant coming before this House needs reassurance that their career will not be wrecked if they speak the truth.

 The right hon. Gentleman is absolutely right. The great problem is not that the Sessional Orders are irrelevant and out of date, but that there has been a lack of vigour and will on the part of Parliament to ensure that people coming before a Committee are clearly cautioned beforehand that they are expected to be candid with Parliament.
</p>








<p><a name="st_366"><a name="41103-33_spnew1"><b> Mr. McWalter: </b> 
 My hon. Friend&#039;s integrity, determination and courage are on the record, but surely he understands that to pretend that the House has the capacity to proceed with severity against those who infringe our Sessional Orders is a major mistake. We need to do what he wants us to do properly, not to pretend that some 1839 law has sorted everything out for us.
</p>








<p><a name="st_367"><a name="41103-33_spnew2"><b> Andrew Mackinlay: </b> 
 I disagree. The fact is that we have the power; what is needed is enforcement. Most legislatures have such powers and enforce them. On this occasion, I commend the Congress of the United States, which requires those giving evidence to take the oath. Parliament would be sensible to follow suit. We all know that taking the oath before entering the witness box cautions us about the gravity of the evidence that we are about to give. It would help if we did the same in Parliament&#151;it is provided for in Standing Orders.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41103-33_para0">
<a name="stpa_265">My point is that we do not caution anyone and it has become the custom or culture for someone appearing before a Select Committee to regard it as legitimate sport to give as little away as possible. Doing so is not seen as being irregular, nor does it attract any criticism of any substance when one is found out. Severe penalties ought to be enforced if a person perjures himself before a parliamentary Committee.

 In my view, there should have been sanctions for declining to respond to Parliament. About a year ago, I was criticised for saying,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_63">&quot;This is the high court of Parliament&quot;,</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="41103-33_para1">
<a name="stpa_266">but that is precisely what it is, and we should not forget that.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41103-33_para2">
<a name="stpa_267">It has been suggested that the Sessional Orders that the Speaker reads out at every state opening of Parliament are long. They are not. I am particularly interested in the one that states:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_64">&quot;if it shall appear that any person has been tampering with any witness, in respect of his evidence to be given to this House, or any Committee thereof, or directly or indirectly has endeavoured to deter or hinder any person from appearing or giving evidence, the same is declared to be a high crime and misdemeanour; and this House will proceed with the utmost severity against such offender.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="41103-33_para3">
<a name="stpa_268">We have to do that if we are to be taken seriously as a Parliament.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41103-33_para4">
<a name="stpa_269">Let me draw on personal experience of what I regard as attempts to interfere with Select Committees. When I was a member of a Select Committee in a past Parliament, the permanent secretary of a Government Department intimated to the Committee that the witness we wanted&#151;a junior civil servant, or junior to him at least&#151;was sick. I found it somewhat surprising to hear that on the Monday because I had seen the man in question on Saturday partying. After I had let that be known, that civil servant, to his eternal credit, stormed up to the permanent secretary and said, &quot;What is this you&#039;re saying about me? I insist that I appear.&quot; He did so and acquitted himself well, and two weeks later got substantial promotion.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41103-33_para5">
<a name="stpa_270">That is an example of deliberate interference by a senior civil servant to frustrate the attempts of a Select Committee to get a witness to appear. To complete the picture, let me tell the House that a senior Minister phoned me at midnight one Sunday to ask, &quot;What the hell were you doing?&quot;&#151;he used those words, or perhaps stronger ones. He concluded by saying, &quot;This conversation never took place.&quot; Well, it did, and the whole affair is recorded in my diary. The fact is that attempts have been made to interfere with Select Committees and we need to stamp on them to ensure that they are never repeated.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41103-33_para6">
<a name="stpa_271">These Sessional Orders are very important because they protect those people in the public or the private sector who recognise their public responsibilities and want to be candid to Parliament but are being leaned on by employers, managers or some other vested group. I should have liked the Committee to say that before a witness appears before a Select Committee, its Chairman should draw his or her attention, probably when they receive the invitation to appear, to the fact that they are obliged to be completely candid and to give full disclosure, and help him or her by saying that if anybody should interfere with that it will be taken very seriously by Parliament. We do not do that&#151;why not?

The Leader of the House mentioned his submission on the Osmotherly rules. We know that no Government&#151;not only Labour Governments, but Tory Governments hitherto&#151;like civil servants to appear before Select Committees, so they pray in aid the Osmotherly rules, which, to his credit, the Clerk of the House of Commons, in his memorandum to the Hutton inquiry, said are not agreed or subscribed to by Parliament.

</p>

<p>
<a name="41103-33_para8">
<a name="stpa_273">The hon. Gentleman may know that relatively recently the Select Committee on Constitutional Affairs reported to the Committee on Standards and Privileges a potential case of breach of privilege in which a witness who had given evidence felt that she had been disadvantaged by having been threatened with removal. When we investigated the matter, we found that there had indeed been contempt. The Government are reviewing the rules following our discovery that the civil service is not well informed about Select Committees, privilege and the risk of contempt. My hon. Friend the Member for Macclesfield (Sir Nicholas Winterton) and I, together with other members of the Liaison Committee, are providing input to clarify the rights and privileges of Select Committees and the risks that are run if there is any contempt or tampering with witnesses.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41103-33_para9">
<a name="stpa_274">My second point relates to the Sessional Orders. The Procedure Committee recommended the replacement of obsolete Sessional Orders and resolutions with a statement of the duties and responsibilities of Members, with the details being left to the discretion of the Speaker. In their response, the Government accepted that recommendation and suggested that the Committee on Standards and Privileges might wish to

My Committee was sympathetic to the idea of making a contribution, so with Mr. Speaker&#039;s approval we offered him some thoughts reflecting the substance of the Procedure Committee&#039;s vision, which, when he draws up the statement that he will make to the House at the start of the Session&#151;if the motion is agreed&#151;he may wish to bear in mind.

<a name="stpa_275">My third point concerns Parliament square, which is an issue that I have pursued in business questions and in Westminster Hall. I was pleased to hear what the Leader of the House said when he introduced the debate. However, we have waited two days short of a year for the Government to come up with that response, and we still do not know when the legislation that he mentioned will be introduced or enacted.

I have no objection to draft legislation and consulting the House, but I hope that there will be no further delay. The problem has existed for three years. The Procedure Committee has made inquiries and reported and the Government have consulted extensively within government for a year. I hope that there will be no undue delay in making progress.

The solution should also respect the rights of those who work in or visit the Palace not to have our security compromised by providing cover at the entrance to New Palace Yard.

 I agree with my right hon. Friend.

 My hon. Friend makes a valid point, which leads to my next comment. We are not considering deprivation of a long established right or a threat to freedom of expression. We are trying to close a loophole in the law to get back to where we believed we were three or four years ago. Brian Haw has discovered the loophole and, well advised by Messrs Bindmans, exploited it. If we were starting from scratch, would we introduce a law to ban such activity from every pavement in London but specifically allow it outside the entrance to the House of Commons? We would not, but the law currently provides for that and the House would be well advised to move to a more defensible position that removed the loophole.

<a name="stpa_283">This debate on Sessional Orders is very interesting and important. I gave evidence to the Committee on this matter, and I hope that the Ministers will think very carefully about what they are proposing here. We seem to be inviting the police to take certain actions concerning the presence of people in Parliament square, without being specific about the powers under which they would do so, on the basis that legislation on the issue will be proposed at some point in the future. That sets a dangerous precedent. If we accept it, the police will act in a certain way, having been given a kind of nod from Parliament as to how we now believe that Sessional Orders should operate, and, at some point in the indeterminate future, legislation that we shall have a chance to debate will appear. Unless something dramatic happens during the Minister&#039;s wind-up speech&#151;which would surprise me&#151;I shall vote against these proposals because I think that that is the right thing to do.

During the Select Committee hearing, there seemed to be quite a lot of confusion about the rights of access to Parliament. It is perfectly clear that MPs must have the right to get to Parliament, otherwise a tyrannical situation could arise in which they were prevented from getting here and would therefore be unable to vote, resulting in legislation being carried or not, as the case may be. It is essential that they have that democratic right, because they are here to represent the people. However, the suggestion that a demonstration in the centre of Parliament square somehow impedes Members getting to the House is unbelievably absurd. Nobody would walk down Whitehall, cross two roads to get to the centre of the square, then cross two more to get into the building. That is absurd; they simply would not do it.

That was removed by the Public Order Act 1986, which was passed by Parliament and which requires police permission to have a demonstration, unless the police allow an unusual demonstration to take place. The fact that someone says that Brian Haw has outlived his usefulness proves just how useful and important he is. He should be congratulated on that.

<a name="41103-35_para3">
<a name="stpa_288">I was thinking about long-term demonstrations that I have visited at different times and at various places in this country and around the world. The presence of one person making a point, taking sanctuary or making a public protest is very powerful. Sun Yat-sen occupied a place in London and became a figure of Chinese nationalism at the start of the 20th century, while the presence of Aboriginal land rights demonstrators outside the Australian Parliament has continued for years. There is a peace camp outside the White House, which has gone on for years. There was a demonstration for a long time&#151;1,000 days, indeed&#151;outside the United States embassy to bring US troops out of Vietnam. Those who organised it said, &quot;We will stay here until the troops go.&quot;

Then the charge was changed to acting in a way that was deliberately offensive to a foreign embassy based in London. As it was the apartheid regime&#039;s foreign embassy, I could do nothing but plead guilty with honour to that charge. The charge was thrown out, and the demonstration therefore won the right to be outside South Africa house and it stayed there until the apartheid regime was ended. So, there are plenty of examples.

 On exactly that point, is it not interesting that those who are in defence of Brian Haw consider his motivations for the demonstration, while those who oppose the likes of him simply consider the inconvenience caused to themselves by the demonstration?

 I did not get involved in the demonstration outside the Scottish Office, but it had an important effect, as demonstrations do.

Were they handed down, or were they gained because people were prepared to demonstrate and demand a freely elected Parliament? Did not the Chartists make a great contribution to the history of this country from which we draw many of our rights? We should be very careful about taking away the rights of others on fairly spurious grounds, as we are doing at present. It becomes the start of a slippery slope.

 The hon. Member for Thurrock (Andrew Mackinlay) made an extremely powerful case for the protection of witnesses. Witnesses are not well enough protected, and it would send the wrong signal to strike that out of the opening remarks of the Session. Instead the Government should consider ways of strengthening the position of witnesses, especially vulnerable witnesses such as civil servants, whose testimony is often crucial. Until that strengthening has occurred, I hope that we will keep in place the stern warning from Mr. Speaker at the beginning of the Session that witnesses will get, and deserve, the protection of the House. We then need to think about how we can do that.

There have been occasions of state visits that have led to delays and impediments to Members getting through, and policed demonstrations when Members have been delayed or detained and not able to get through. I am sure that the police would want to help us, and it would be good if the whole House united to say that Members in possession of their passes, or well-known Members whom the police can identify, should be let through as a matter of urgency and courtesy.

I suspect that if we asked all Members to jot down on a piece of paper how they would define &quot;duties and responsibilities&quot; we would see variations and nuances on a large scale, although we trust that there would be some family resemblance. It would, I think, prove contentious and difficult. It would be odd of us to sweep away existing words before knowing that we had a much better form of words in the spirit of modernisation that the Government and the Committee suggest.

I think that the issue will be resolved by Government proposals on legislation, and I do not think Members should be swayed by proposals on Sessional Orders tonight. There should be plenty of time for debate when legislation is before us. As the Government have made clear, this issue cannot be resolved without primary legislation.

Secondly, there is a fundamental right of access, as all who have spoken in this debate agree. Over and above that, there is no need for special rights, or for protection for Members against noise pollution entering their place of work. On the contrary, there should be additional rights to demonstrate around Parliament, not less.

He is worried about the intimidation of thousands of huntsmen and women by this one man&#039;s demonstration, which apparently occupies too much space in Parliament square. That such a distinguished and insightful Member can come before us with such nonsense suggests that he has been over-influenced by some of our more sensitive souls.

The council&#151;I think it was Westminster&#151;sent along an officer with a decibel meter, and whatever may or may not have happened in 1982, there were plenty of protests from the demonstrators to that environmental officer. He kept telling us, &quot;If you don&#039;t turn it down, we&#039;ll confiscate your equipment.&quot; In those days, it was possible to hold a major demonstration with a minor counter-demonstration and to have a certain balance of forces so that both sides could put their point across.

<br>&nbsp;<br>somewhere between then and now there has been a change in the law. There has been a change in the rules and it looks as though it must have been brought in under the last Conservative Government in the Environmental Protection Act 1990, because according to a letter sent to me by Westminster council,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_71">&quot;section 79(1)(ga) defines noise that is prejudicial to health or a nuisance and is emitted or caused by a vehicle, machinery or equipment in a street, as a statutory nuisance. However, section 79(6A) provides that section 79(1)(ga) does not apply to noise made by a political demonstration or a demonstration supporting or opposing a cause or a campaign.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="41103-38_para0">
<a name="stpa_324">The fact is, we have heard a lot of humbug talked about freedom of speech. We have freedom of speech in this Chamber; we each put forward our differing views. When we have had our say, we let the other person have his. We sit down, we shut up and we listen. We do not go on shouting in the face of the other person whether he wants to listen or not. We obey the rules. That is not happening in Parliament square.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41103-38_para1">
<a name="stpa_325">I have taken the trouble to go across and have extensive conversations with Brian Haw and I take much very much to heart the comments of the hon. Member for Banff and Buchan (Mr. Salmond), who tried to suggest that those of us who oppose the racket that Brian is making do so because we hate his message. I ask the hon. Gentleman and others to accept my sincerity when I say that I would take the same approach to anyone who demonstrated in the same way for a cause in which I passionately believed and who went on making a racket that was designed not to address the people who had come to hear the message but to penetrate the building of people who were trying to get on with their work, looking after the interests of their constituents.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41103-38_para2">
<a name="stpa_326">Perhaps some of those who speak so glibly about the noise have offices that are somewhat better insulated than mine, but I assure them that it is very difficult to do one&#039;s work when there is a constant racket and a barrage of noise the words of which cannot even be heard clearly. It is a row, and it is made not to get a message across or in the interests of free speech but to harass and annoy parliamentarians. That is the beginning and end of it. Nothing other than a change in the law will prevent this abuse from continuing.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41103-38_para3">
<a name="stpa_327">I am relatively agnostic on whether or Brian or anybody else ought to be able to demonstrate in Parliament square. I have spoken to him and I admire his commitment to his cause. I will make a point that no one else has made. I know that one of his motivations results from the fact that his father went into and liberated one of the Nazi concentration camps. With my family background, I have every reason to hold anyone motivated in that way in the highest regard.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41103-38_para4">
<a name="stpa_328">I do not think that Brian used to make all this noise in the earlier part of his campaign, and when he did not make the noise and just put his message across, I had very little, if anything, to say about what he was doing. However, I now think that he has taken freedom of speech into areas that become an abuse of free speech. There is no freedom to impinge on the freedom of other people. That is what he is doing.

There has been much discussion about the right to free speech and to demonstrate, but some of the contributions to the debate suggested that that right does not exist in this country. The right does exist in this country, and it does so to a much greater extent than in many other countries throughout the world, including Iraq under Saddam Hussein, whom Mr. Haw advocated that we should do nothing about. The matter is important, and as the right hon. Member for Wokingham (Mr. Redwood) said, we must examine the detail of the legislation when we introduce it.

He raised a point about the important question of passes. Police officers and staff of the House who ask to see people&#039;s passes do so because they are trying to protect us and our security. I am sometimes guilty of not wearing my pass, but I am glad to do so today. We must appreciate the situation and act responsibly.

<p>
<a name="41103-38_para13">
<a name="stpa_337">The Chairman of the Procedure Committee, the hon. Member for Macclesfield (Sir Nicholas Winterton), made an excellent speech. He has been accused of many things during the debate, such as preventing Parliament from scrutinising the Executive and doing away with traditions that should be part and parcel of Parliament in the future. He is the last person who could be accused of doing such things. He and his colleagues on the Procedure Committee have tried to make sensible suggestions about the way forward and have rightly taken heed of hon. Members&#039; concerns. In preparation for our debate, I read the report of the Westminster Hall debate&#151;I did not attend it&#151;in which many hon. Members participated, including the right hon. Member for North-West Hampshire (Sir George Young), to express people&#039;s worries about the way in which free speech can sometimes be abused. There must be a sense of order behind the way in which free speech may be expressed.

<a name="stpa_338">My hon. Friend the Member for Thurrock (Andrew Mackinlay) raised several points about witnesses. I am assured by my right hon. Friend the Leader of the House and my hon. Friend the Deputy Leader of the House that his worries about witnesses are covered by other statutes. As the right hon. Member for North-West Hampshire said, a debate is currently being held within the Liaison Committee on whether there is a clear way in which witnesses who are brought before Committees could be advised of their rights and responsibilities when giving evidence, which is a good idea.

We are saying that, given the times in which we live, we must consider hon. Members&#039; access to Parliament and the protection of not only Members of Parliament and those who work here but other people who meet and gather in the square. When we introduce the legislation, we will have a full chance to debate how we may achieve that and deal with the obvious problems that exist while maintaining people&#039;s right to protest. It is absurd to suggest that the actions that we intend to take will deny people the right to express their views.

People have the right to protest, and we could have a long debate about whether the protest outside has been particularly effective in changing policy&#151;I suggest that it has not. The right hon. Member for Bromley and Chislehurst (Mr. Forth), I am afraid, accused the hon. Member for Macclesfield of helping the Executive to storm their way through the House without due process or scrutiny.

<p><a name="st_426"><a name="41103-40_spnew0"><b> Mr. David Drew  (Stroud) (Lab/Co-op):</b> 
 I am delighted to have this opportunity to discuss Sharpness docks, and I am also delighted to see the Under-Secretary of State for Transport, my hon. Friend the Member for Staffordshire, Moorlands (Charlotte Atkins), on the Front Bench. I was slightly surprised when I learned that she was responding to this debate, but in the spirit of comradeship that we have in our party, and given that the subject is docks, I am sure that the Department for Transport is as relevant as the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, which is the managing Department.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41103-40_para0">
<a name="stpa_345">I apologise for the state of my voice&#151;I have not been to voice training recently, but I have got the lurgy, so if I suddenly splutter, it is because of that and not for some other reason. Sharpness docks are close to my heart because I used to visit them when I was a child. Some of us can remember the days when people used to go out on Sunday afternoon car trips, and I used to go and watch the ships in Sharpness docks, which might show what a sad life I led as a child. There used to be a lovely ship, the Vindicatrix, in Sharpness docks. It was a training ship, and people who trained on it&#151;the Vindi boys&#151;always have an annual reunion. It still sticks in the memory.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41103-40_para1">
<a name="stpa_346">It might surprise people to hear that my constituency contains docks, because most think that Stroud is somewhere inland near the Cotswolds, but we have long-established docks that are quite important. Sharpness docks is one of three inland waterway terminals still owned by British Waterways, and I contend that it is an important facility that is in need of some investment. The docks stand on the tidal upper reaches of the Severn estuary: the tidal range of up to 10 m is slightly less than at Avonmouth, 17 miles downstream. Ships carrying up to about 3,500 tonnes of cargo regularly pass through the port&#151;I am pleased that their number has increased over the past three years&#151;and it is possible to take some further up the Gloucester and Sharpness canal, which can take ships up to 900 deadweight tonnes, although the canal is mainly used by leisure craft now.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41103-40_para2">
<a name="stpa_347">The river up to Sharpness is one of compulsory pilotage. I am bringing this matter to the attention of the House because of a report undertaken by the pilots which voices concern about the state of the docks. The pilots bring in vessels over 100 deadweight tonnes; they are part of a consortium, the Gloucester Pilots Partnership, which is under contract to Gloucester Harbour Trustees, which is the competent harbour authority. The trustees also provide the navigation aids in the harbour, which extends from the Maisemore and Llanthony weirs at Gloucester to seaward of the Severn road bridges. They provide comprehensive navigation lights cover and an advanced pilot watch radar system to help to guide shipping through the bridges, especially the deep water channel&#151;known as &quot;the Shoots&quot;&#151;under the second Severn crossing.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41103-40_para3">
<a name="stpa_348">It is estimated that the docks date back to 1827, but it was only towards the end of the 19th century, in 1874, when the new docks opened and the Severn-Wye 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>3 Nov 2004 : Column 425</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>railway bridge was completed, that the thoroughfare became important for both water and rail transport. The potential use of coal in the forest of Dean&#151;one of the reasons for building the railway and opening up the port&#151;was never really realised. None the less, the facility has been important: connected to the Gloucester and Sharpness canal, it has always served its purpose.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41103-40_para4">
<a name="stpa_349">In 1997, the quayside operations of British Waterways were transferred on a 125-year lease to Sharpness Dock Ltd., or SDL, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Victoria group based in Plymouth. The dry dock facility is separately leased to Sharpness Shipyard and Dry Dock Ltd. I wish to express my respect for Mark Gatehouse of SDL, who has seen the docks through a difficult period to the pleasing point at which they appear to be on the up. That is proved by the recent trading position, which shows the tonnage passing through the docks rising from almost 470,000 in 1994&#150;95 to 1, 235,722 in 2002&#150;03. Although the tonnage fell slightly last year, we still think that the port is doing quite well.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41103-40_para5">
<a name="stpa_350">The reason for my present concern is a report that I received from Gloucester Harbour Trustees. I pay tribute to those who helped me understand its relevance and prepare this speech, including my old friend Bob Hall, who has been a harbour trustee for many years, Mike Johnson, who helped to edit his notes, and Gary Strickland of SDL. The report highlights the fact that parts of the docks are in a poor state of repair. I am sure that my hon. Friend the Minister will be able to obtain her own copy of the report, but if she cannot, I shall leave one with her. The report shows that the dry dock, and particularly the dolphins and the area where material is loaded and unloaded, is in need of repair.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41103-40_para6">
<a name="stpa_351">I have always believed that the dock has a good future as long as it is invested in. The problem is that there are nearly &#163;6 million of arrears in relation to investment, and I should like progress to be made on how British Waterways can be encouraged to take forward a strategy to bring the docks up to a decent state of repair.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41103-40_para7">
<a name="stpa_352">We must recognise that the report is worthy of action. By chance, before it was published&#151;although I had been given notice that it was in its incubation stage&#151;I had my own meeting with BW back in September, where I met several people, including Roy Parker, the freight marketing manager, Stewart Sim, the operations director, and Ian Jarvis, the general manager for the south-west. We had an interesting couple of hours&#039; discussion in which, having agreed that the docks have a future and that we are committed to assuring it, we explored some of the arguments. Bob Hall came along to that meeting. Although we left with a degree of optimism because of the commitment shown by the officials whom we met, that was not the same as being told where the money would come from.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41103-40_para8">
<a name="stpa_353">There are two sides to this. We need to consider not only putting together a funding package to deal with some of the problems in relation to the docks&#039; state of repair, but how to invest in freight use. No one pretends that it is possible to move dramatically from road to water, or from road to water and rail. However, it would be nice to think that the freight grants that are available to other forms of transport could be made available to inland waterways. That is germane not only to Sharpness but to all forms of inland waterway. Because they do not get access to the same level of grant, it is 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>3 Nov 2004 : Column 426</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>impossible to think about how to change things if and when the opportunity arises. I hope that that can happen at a more general level. It is no less than Sharpness deserves, and it would provide many opportunities to consider what could be achieved with the right level of capital investment and to how to use the revenue stream to move freight about in better and more sustainable ways.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41103-40_para9">
<a name="stpa_354">In concluding my remarks to give my hon. Friend plenty of time to respond, I shall deal briefly with other issues relating to the Sharpness area. We cannot isolate the docks from their hinterland. The people who live there would not think of doing that, and I have no intention of arguing for it. I believe that the docks have a strong future. They are a good facility which, with the right level of capital investment, and with more revenue support, can be turned around to deal with the sort of tonnages of which we believe that they are capable. However, that depends on other factors.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41103-40_para10">
<a name="stpa_355">The B4066 is the road to the docks. It is partly completed but it needs to be fully completed because of heavy vehicles driving through unsuitable areas. My constituents complain to me regularly about that. Again, we could do with a commitment to complete the road. I appreciate that that is subject to extant planning arrangements, but it would be useful to get a Government view about how progress can be made.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41103-40_para11">
<a name="stpa_356">I shall not go into the details about the rail head because they are long and complicated, but we have been talking about trying to get a rail head for the past 10 years. It would act as a catalyst, because there would be a quick way of moving freight to the midlands, with intra-country shipping travelling from the east coast to the west coast, or directly from Spain. Ships bringing phosphates for our agriculture are some of the major users of the port. I want the rail head to be properly evaluated to ascertain how much it will cost. We have not got anywhere yet because the rail freight grant was lost, but I believe that there are still ways of providing a rail head.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41103-40_para12">
<a name="stpa_357">On the negative side, there was the threat of an incinerator, which I strongly oppose. If hon. Members will excuse the pun, I believe that it is on the back burner now. However, the docks could be a potential source of an exciting development in waste. We have a firm, which used to be called Plasmega and has recently been taken over by Tarmac, that undertakes recycling. We want to encourage such industry on to the docks. It is an ideal centre for a waste recycling facility but it needs proper investment. We need to use the docks area appropriately.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41103-40_para13">
<a name="stpa_358">At a time when Sharpness docks has the potential for expansion, we are in the process of examining what we need to do with Berkeley technology centre a few miles around the corner. It has a genuine impact on my constituency, with the potential loss of 1,100 jobs. We are considering an exciting taskforce investigation into how we can use the facility to develop a high-tech park. I should like some link between the docks, where some of the blue-collar work could take place, and the work that could go on in the Berkeley technology centre.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41103-40_para14">
<a name="stpa_359">Other threats could derail matters. As I have said in this place on previous occasions, I have never been in favour of the Severn barrage. It could have a big impact on the docks. We do not seem to be making progress on 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>3 Nov 2004 : Column 427</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>that. Again, if such issues are being discussed in other places, they should be brought to the forefront of our deliberations about what we want to with the docks in future.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41103-40_para15">
<a name="stpa_360">The docks have a future. They are capable of sustaining a good tonnage. Their facilities need to be repaired and brought up to standard so that they can be used not only now but in future. We need to get the infrastructure issues right and ensure that employment measures on the docks are suitable for the 21st century. I hope that my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary, in liaison with the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, will give me some good news that we are serious about using inland waterways. That is not a pious dream but a way of securing a sustainable future.

<p><a name="st_427"><a name="41103-41_spmin0"><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Transport  (Charlotte Atkins): </b> 
 I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Stroud (Mr. Drew) on securing the debate on the future of Sharpness docks. I am delighted that his debate is the first to which I have had an opportunity to respond.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41103-41_para0">
<a name="stpa_361">The speech has highlighted the important role that smaller ports such as Sharpness can play in meeting the needs of business customers and in generating wealth locally and regionally. Although the heaviest traffic flows are concentrated in our biggest ports, providing vital facilities for container and bulk traffic such as oil and coal, there are more than 1,000 ports and terminals throughout the United Kingdom.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41103-41_para1">
<a name="stpa_362">The Government do not run the ports industry. Some ports are run by local authorities, and others operate as independent trusts or are wholly in the private sector; all are run as commercial propositions.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41103-41_para2">
<a name="stpa_363">Let me set out three key tenets of the Government&#039;s policy towards ports. We recognise that all ports have the potential to bring significant economic benefit to their hinterland, be it local or regional. We have ensured that the framework is in place to allow ports, large and small, to make the most of the opportunities that the market presents. The Government are firmly committed to encouraging more freight to be carried by water, where that offers the best value for money for our economy, environment and society.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41103-41_para3">
<a name="stpa_364">Sharpness is an excellent example of what makes our ports industry successful. Under the new operator&#039;s entrepreneurial approach, traffic has climbed 50 per cent. since 1996, and it has already established itself as the eighth largest port in the south-west region, whose coastline stretches from Gloucester to Poole. Sharpness Docks Ltd has successfully developed its niche business in dry cargo in and out of the west midlands on short sea shipping services.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41103-41_para4">
<a name="stpa_365">I fully understand my hon. Friend&#039;s keen interest in supporting the company&#039;s efforts to build on this success&#151;it would clearly benefit his constituents, the region, and the Government&#039;s policy aims. Sharpness is unusual, in that the owner of the site, and the statutory port authority, is British Waterways, a public corporation. As the port authority, British Waterways is required to ensure that the port is fit for purpose and can safely be used by ships and other vessels. However, the 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>3 Nov 2004 : Column 428</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>maintenance requirements laid down by the Transport Act 1968 apply only to commercial and cruising waterways, and British Waterways is not obliged to maintain Sharpness docks to specified standards, except for the length of the Gloucester and Sharpness canal where it passes through the docks.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41103-41_para5">
<a name="stpa_366">There are many demands on British Waterways&#039; budget, but the Government have been increasing the funding for the corporation. Between 1999 and 2002, British Waterways was allocated an additional &#163;24 million to eliminate its safety backlog over a seven-year period. A further &#163;18 million was provided between 2002 and 2004 to enable it to reduce the backlog even more quickly. In addition, DEFRA has in the past few years given British Waterways a further ring-fenced payment of &#163;30 million for infrastructure improvements to bring the network up to a sufficiently reliable standard to attract new business and opportunities to the waterways.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41103-41_para6">
<a name="stpa_367">The Government and British Waterways clearly recognise the need to invest in Sharpness to repair and upgrade the existing port infrastructure. Indeed, British Waterways has identified a requirement for &#163;4.1 million of remedial work that it would like to undertake over the next four to five years if available funds and priorities permit. This includes work on the tidal basin jetties and entrance locks. In fact, British Waterways is now considering the phasing of this work into its overall maintenance programme. If further proof were needed of British Waterways&#039; commitment to the future development of Sharpness, I would point to the &#163;500,000 already spent in refurbishing the middle lock gates in 2003&#150;04, and the further &#163;595,000 earmarked for the sea gates in 2006&#150;07.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41103-41_para7">
<a name="stpa_368">I assure my hon. Friend that British Waterways is committed to keeping the docks open, and, under its ongoing investment programme, it hopes to encourage a continuing increase in freight traffic through the port over the coming years. I am pleased to hear that BW is currently in discussion with Sharpness Docks Ltd to explore how the docks might be used for the movement of waste and recyclable material, and how the port might, once more, become the gateway for traffic on the Gloucester and Sharpness canal. In this context, it is good to see the return of significant quantities of aggregate traffic to the Severn further upstream, between Ripple, Ryan and Gloucester, supported by a &#163;1 million freight facility grant from my Department. This is the first major freight traffic to flow on the Severn for more than 10 years. It will remove 340,000 lorry journeys from Gloucestershire&#039;s roads over the next 10 years, and bodes well for the revitalisation of this major UK waterway.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41103-41_para8">
<a name="stpa_369">I also understand that Gloucestershire county council has taken a considerable interest in the future prosperity of Sharpness docks. The county is part of a European Union Atlantic Arc partnership studying the potential for increasing short-sea shipping. We look forward to the outcome of that study later this year.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41103-41_para9">
<a name="stpa_370">The county has also been leading on the re-establishment of the docks railway system through the freight quality partnership and is offering to match-fund this work. That will establish a connection to the metal recycling plant at Sharpness, which has rail-connected sites in the west midlands. Discussions are also in hand with the port operator regarding the potential for rail 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>3 Nov 2004 : Column 429</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>and with a distribution firm regarding the potential for a rail-connected warehouse. The dockside could include a general purpose rail/road facility.
</p>








<p><a name="st_428"><a name="41103-41_spnew0"><b> Mr. Drew: </b> 
 I congratulate my hon. Friend and hope that that will be followed up, because the company is Howard Tenens. I ask that the Department actively pursue it, as there has been some disagreement on the ground for all sorts of obvious reasons. This could be a real key to turning the docks into an even more successful employment, and dare I say development, opportunity.
</p>








<p><a name="st_429"><a name="41103-41_spnew1"><b> Charlotte Atkins: </b> 
 I am sure that the Department will look favourably at that, because it is very much in line with our objectives.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41103-41_para10">
<a name="stpa_371">The county council feels that the role of Sharpness as a port was overlooked in the past, as does my hon. Friend, but it clearly believes that Sharpness now offers an exciting opportunity for the county, with tremendous development potential. There is a good supply of employment land and relatively few planning constraints. The local plan has identified 19 hectares of development land, which could probably be easily increased.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41103-41_para11">
<a name="stpa_372">The potential of Sharpness was recognised in the county council&#039;s local transport plan with an explicit policy aimed at encouraging the development of water freight at Sharpness dock. Another county policy promotes the creation of rail freight terminals, with Sharpness as one of the possible sites.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41103-41_para12">
<a name="stpa_373">It is clear that Sharpness is in an excellent position to become a tri-modal freight facility for the region. There is a rail connection&#151;mothballed but largely in good order, having been well maintained for nuclear traffic to Berkeley power station&#151;and the Gloucester and Sharpness canal, connecting with the River Severn at Gloucester. It is only a few miles from the M5. I am pleased to report that the county council is making provision in its second local transport plan for funding to improve the road link from the M5 to Sharpness.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41103-41_para13">
<a name="stpa_374">I understand that the county council, through the freight quality partnership, is establishing a project team to drive forward the creation of a tri-modal freight facility at Sharpness. Starting with the dock railway network, the county council will work with Stroud district council, British Waterways, the rail industry, the port operator and other private sector and stakeholder interests at Sharpness to develop and implement the project. The county council sees this as an excellent opportunity to reduce the amount of freight moved by road and to promote the use of rail and water&#151;inland and short-sea&#151;for the transport of goods.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41103-41_para14">
<a name="stpa_375">The Department for Transport also recognises the role that Sharpness can play in meeting transport needs in the south-west region and further afield. Sharpness is 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>3 Nov 2004 : Column 430</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>already well positioned to develop further. It can be reached from the midlands by road without having to negotiate the congestion of the M4 and M5 in the Bristol area. It also has the potential to exploit good-quality rail and even canal access.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41103-41_para15">
<a name="stpa_376">The Government are keen to take freight traffic off congested roads and we support short-sea shipping as a safe, environmentally friendly and sustainable mode of transport. Freight should be carried by water wherever it offers the best value-for-money solution in terms of the economy, society and the environment. The Government will do what they can to help a port such as Sharpness make the most of that potential.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41103-41_para16">
<a name="stpa_377">However, I should make it clear that we believe that port operations and port developments should not rely on public subsidy. Port infrastructure can and should be commercially financed. Port subsidies not only have the potential to distort competition between ports but risk spreading the problems caused by excess capacity. Nevertheless, we undertake to judge each case on its merits, balancing the potential for adverse economic impact against the real social, economic and environmental benefits to be derived.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41103-41_para17">
<a name="stpa_378">Although we have no plans to give British Waterways increased grant aid to enable it to expand its freight activities, infrastructure investment might be supported by freight facility grants to help divert traffic from our roads on to water. Start-up and catalyst funding might also be available from the European Commission&#039;s Marco Polo programme, which is the grant regime supporting modal shift away from roads.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41103-41_para18">
<a name="stpa_379">British Waterways remains committed to keeping the port of Sharpness open and the prospects for further traffic growth are good, whether it be more traffic from the west midlands or more locally sourced waste and recyclables using the Gloucester and Sharpness canal. The Government as a whole are committed to taking traffic off the roads and to boosting short-sea shipping, all as part of a sustainable freight policy. That entails ensuring that the Government&#039;s ports policy continues to provide the right framework for the sustainable development of our ports, large and small.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41103-41_para19">
<a name="stpa_380">I am sure that my hon. Friend will be delighted to hear that the Department for Transport will work with the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs and British Waterways to ensure that Sharpness has every opportunity to succeed within the ports policy framework. But, most importantly, we look to port operators such as Sharpness Dock Ltd to make the most of the potential, for the benefit of the port&#039;s customers, of the local area and the wider region that it serves.
