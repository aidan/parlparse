It also outlines a growing humanitarian crisis in Gaza, with some 30 per cent. of the population currently without access to a regular water supply.

 I thank the Secretary of State for condemning the rocket attacks, but is it not a fact that the bulk of the responsibility lies on Hamas, which has allowed terrorist organisations to rain rockets down on Israel in an attempt to kill children there and, indeed, has undertaken terrorist activity against its own citizens in the military takeover of Gaza? Will the Secretary of State ensure that, however much aid is vitally needed by the citizens of Gaza, none of it gets to those terrorist organisations?</p>

 The crossings are at present closed, other than for very limited entrance for certain supplies. As the OCHA report, to which the hon.

It is therefore important that all sides recognise their responsibilities and facilitate the entrance to the Gaza strip of exactly the humanitarian supplies that would address that grave situation.</p>

 Does my right hon.

There are at present on average about eight hours of power cuts being suffered each day in the Gaza strip, which is why we are in regular contact with all sides and why we are encouraging through the Quartet the continued progress of the Annapolis peace process.

 I last met special representatives to the Quartet last January and I previously met them at the Paris pledging conference, which is the next major step after the Annapolis conference. There, Tony Blair made clear to me his pleasure in the scale of pledging that was put behind the peace process by the international community. However, there is only so much that the international community can do to support the Annapolis process, which is why we welcome the latest indications that there will be further political discussions within the region in the days to come.</p>

 Following on from what my right hon. Friend the Member for Warley (Mr. Spellar) said, may I tell the Secretary of State that although everyone recognises the sufferings of the ordinary citizens of Gaza, some responsibility must also be placed very firmly on Hamas for its rocket attacks on Israel? Will the Secretary of State therefore ensure that aid given to the citizens of Gaza actually reaches those ordinary citizens rather than the militaristic Hamas?

 I assure my hon. Friend that, once again, we have unequivocally condemned the rocket and sniper attacks on Israel. That has been the British Government&#146;s position for a long time. As for the related issue of whether we can be comfortable about the work being done, in this instance, by the ICRC and the United Nations, there are long-standing procedures to ensure that we provide the supplies that are immediately required to meet the humanitarian need, while not providing the political support that my hon.

 The Secretary of State and others are right to acknowledge that the people of Gaza are victims of both Hamas and the Israeli assaults, but will the Secretary of State also acknowledge that the Bethlehem development and investment conference will have limited scope to change things if Israel has no access to Gaza? The same applies to the west bank, where movement and access continue to be restricted although no rocket attacks are being launched in the area.</p>

 I find myself in complete agreement with the right hon. Gentleman. I travelled to the Palestinian territories in December and had an opportunity to observe the presentation from OCHA, which made clear the significance of the consequences of the blockages of movement and access that apply not just in Gaza but throughout the west bank. In our discussions both with the Palestinian authorities and with the Government of Israel, we have stressed repeatedly that if there is to be the economic progress that we should like as a result of the Bethlehem development and investment conference, there must be changes on movement and access.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman is correct. Education is vital in the fight against AIDS, but so, too, is health care. It deals with the symptoms; he is talking about the cause. I am pleased to let him know that we are investing &#163;100 million in Malawi over six years to deal with many of these issues and that antiretroviral treatments are now available to 130,000 people compared with a figure of just 3,000 in 2003.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman is, of course, right. A serious challenge for the developing world, and for Malawi in particular, is the fact that health workers leave those areas. I am pleased to say that between 2003 and 2007 their migration decreased by 71 per cent. The investment of &#163;100 million to which I referred in part deals with some of those challenges. The situation has been helped by the code of conduct that this country has put together on employing overseas health workers.  <br>

 My hon. Friend makes an important point, given that nearly 7,000 people are newly infected with HIV every day. Indeed, prevention is crucial to stopping and reversing the spread of HIV/AIDS.

Since the start of this year, another 80,000 people have been driven from their homes, aid workers have been killed, and access to humanitarian relief has dramatically reduced across Darfur. Even areas such as el-Fasher, which I visited 16 months ago, are sometimes inaccessible because of the Janjaweed militia. Seven months ago, the Prime Minister promised quick and decisive action, but will he confirm that on any objective measure, the situation on the ground has actually got worse?</p>

But I believe most of all that we must get people to the peace table. That is why it is important not only that the Government of Sudan come to the peace talks, but that the rebel groups join the peace talks, which they have not done before. We will continue to step up our efforts. The Foreign Office Minister, Lord Malloch-Brown, has been there recently. We have asked the Chinese to intervene in the situation, and of course I would like the Secretary-General of the United Nations to visit the region very soon.</p>

We will raise expenditure further, because it is absolutely vital that we have the investment against flooding and coastal erosion risk. We will spend &#163;800 million on that by 2011.</p>

 I do not accept the hon. Gentleman&#146;s interpretation of that report at all.

It also says that we were far better prepared than for any previous foot and mouth outbreak. It makes recommendations for the future, and we will look at all those recommendations. We are already investing and changing the management at Pirbright to avoid these things happening in the future. I hope that the hon.

 The core purpose of this Budget is stability, now and in the future. Its core values are fairness and opportunity, founded on stability and strength.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o7"><a name="80312-0004.htm_para0"><a name="08031240000157">In every country in 2008, every Government have one aim: to maintain stability through the world economic slowdown. Britain, with its central role in the world&#146;s financial system, is no exception. But with low inflation, record levels of employment, and unemployment at its lowest level for a generation, and with the action that we took last year to curb inflation, Britain is better placed than other economies to withstand the slowdown in the global economy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o8"><a name="80312-0004.htm_para1"><a name="08031240000158">This year&#146;s Budget is a responsible Budget that will secure stability in these times of global economic uncertainty. We will do everything in our power to maintain stability, keeping inflation and interest rates low and maintaining our record of growth. Whilst other countries have suffered recessions, the British economy has now been growing continuously for over a decade&#151;the longest period of sustained growth in our history. Because of the changes we made to entrench stability and increase the flexibility and resilience of our economy, I am able to report that the British economy will continue to grow throughout this year and beyond.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o9"><a name="80312-0004.htm_para2"><a name="08031240000159">Even in today&#146;s difficult and uncertain times, we are determined that we will not be diverted from our long-term aim: to equip our country for the challenges of the future, to confront climate change and to end child poverty in a generation. This Budget is about equipping Britain for the times ahead and making sure that everyone, no matter what their circumstances, can exploit their full potential. It is about building a fairer society, offering more opportunity&#151;a fair Britain in which everyone can succeed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o10"><a name="80312-0004.htm_para3"><a name="08031240000160">Throughout the world, economies have benefited from the globalisation of trade and investment, which has delivered strong world growth. Here in Britain, our openness, our global reach and our history of scientific invention and creative success make us uniquely placed to succeed in the global economy. But with the benefits of globalisation, we see, too, how problems in one part of the world can quickly spread to another. Turbulence in the global financial markets, which started in the American mortgage market, has affected all economies, from the United States to Asia, as well as Europe.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o25"><a name="80312-0004.htm_para18"><a name="08031240000175">We have seen recent increases in world food, fuel and energy prices. The reforms that we have made since 1997 mean we can be confident about the inflation outlook. There will be no return to the inflation rates of the early 1990s.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o26"><a name="80312-0004.htm_para19"><a name="08031240000176">As is happening in many countries because of commodity prices, inflation in the UK will rise in the short term as higher oil and food prices feed through into domestic inflation. But inflation is forecast to return to target in 2009 and remain on target thereafter. </p>

<p><a name="stpa_o27"><a name="80312-0004.htm_para20"><a name="08031240000177">The success of the Monetary Policy Committee and the resilience of the UK economy is clear. Energy prices have tripled since 2002, but over this period inflation has averaged just 2 per cent. and growth has averaged 23/4 per cent.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o28"><a name="80312-0004.htm_para21"><a name="08031240000178">To provide certainty and to build on this foundation of stability, I am today writing to the Governor of the Bank of England to re-affirm that the inflation target for the Monetary Policy Committee remains 2 per cent. on a CPI basis, which will entrench our commitment to low inflation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o29"><a name="80312-0004.htm_para22"><a name="08031240000179">The discipline we have shown on pay in the public sector will support the Bank of England in maintaining low and stable inflation. The reforms we made and this hard won stability mean that&#151;whereas in previous decades, the UK economy suffered more than other economies in the face of global economic downturns&#151;we enter this period of uncertainty better placed than any other major economy. For that reason, I will continue to reject proposals for a &#163;10 billion programme of unfunded tax and spending commitments, which would put that stability at risk.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o30"><a name="80312-0004.htm_para23"><a name="08031240000180">Our fiscal policy, like our monetary policy, is designed to support stability. It is founded on tough fiscal rules underpinned by the code for fiscal stability and forecast on the basis of cautious assumptions, which are audited by the independent National Audit Office. Our fiscal rules&#151;to keep debt low and stable and to borrow only for investment over the economic cycle&#151;deliver sound public finances in the medium term. They protect public investment and they allow fiscal policy to support monetary policy at the right time to support economic stability and growth.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o31"><a name="80312-0004.htm_para24"><a name="08031240000181">Over the past 10 years, at all times we have taken the necessary action to meet our fiscal rules. The disciplines we have imposed mean that borrowing is much lower than it was before 1997, and so too is debt. Between 1979 and 1997, borrowing was 3.4 per cent. of national income. Since 1997, it has averaged just 1.2 per cent. Debt, which at the start of the economic cycle in 1997 was 43.3 per cent., has now fallen to 36.6 per cent. of GDP. It is precisely our commitment to this discipline and stability that gives us the flexibility now to respond to the global economic challenges we face today.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o32"><a name="80312-0004.htm_para25"><a name="08031240000182">Given the fundamental strength of our public finances, it is right to allow fiscal policy to support monetary policy over the period ahead, helping to maintain stability in the face of global downturn. For environmental reasons, we will increase fuel duty by 1/2p per litre in real terms from 2010. Fuel duty is due to rise again in April, but because I want to support the economy now and help business and families, I will postpone that increase until October.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o33"><a name="80312-0004.htm_para26"><a name="08031240000183">I can tell the House that our Budget projection for the current budget balance in 2008 will come in as forecast. Our projection for net borrowing, at &#163;36 billion, is &#163;1.4 billion lower than I forecast at the time of the pre-Budget report. Debt this year is also forecast to be lower than the pre-Budget report, at 37.1 per cent. As a result of the decisions in this and recent Budgets that come into effect this year&#151;including a reduction in the main rate of income tax from 22p to 20p&#151;fiscal policy is able to provide real support for the economy this year. This is a responsible approach&#151;within the disciplines of our fiscal rules&#151;that will help entrench the resilience of the UK economy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o34"><a name="80312-0004.htm_para27"><a name="08031240000184">Borrowing next year, which peaked at 7.8 per cent. of national income by 1993&#151;that is equivalent to &#163;110 billion today&#151;next year will rise to &#163;43 billion, some 2.9 per cent of national income, less than at its peak and less than the average level of borrowing between 1979 and 1997. And because of the decisions taken in this Budget, it will fall to 2.5 per cent., then 2 per cent., then 1.6 per cent. and then 1.3 per cent. by 2012-13, supporting stability and resilience in the economy. That is &#163;38 billion and then &#163;32 billion, &#163;27 billion and &#163;23 billion by 2012-13.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o35"><a name="80312-0004.htm_para28"><a name="08031240000185">Even taking into account the turbulence in financial markets and the support we are providing to the economy now, the current balance this year is in line with my forecast at the pre-Budget report, at minus &#163;8.8 billion. Next year it will be minus &#163;10 billion, then minus &#163;4 billion, before returning to a surplus in 2010 of &#163;4 billion, then &#163;11 billion and then &#163;18 billion by 2012, forecast to meet the golden rule over the economic cycle. The Budget shows that we are meeting our first fiscal rule&#151;the golden rule&#151;with the current budget in surplus over the economic cycle.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o36"><a name="80312-0004.htm_para29"><a name="08031240000186">In the previous two cycles, the then Government failed to meet the golden rule. In the cycle between 1986 and 1997, they failed by a margin of &#163;240 billion, and in the cycle from 1977 to 1986 by &#163;140 billion. In the past, the then Government borrowed to fund the immediate pressures of the day, with no long-term return for the taxpayer. It is vital that today our fiscal discipline means that over the cycle we borrow only to invest. Vital investment&#151;in transport, schools and hospitals&#151;has been protected and increased. So whereas in 1996-97 public sector net investment was &#163;5.4 billion, over the forecast period it is set to rise further from &#163;33 billion next year to &#163;37 billion in 2010&#151;the highest in three decades.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o37"><a name="80312-0004.htm_para30"><a name="08031240000187">Borrowing for investment within the fiscal rules means that we will meet our second fiscal rule&#151;the sustainable investment rule&#151;in each year and over the cycle. This year, debt will be lower than in the US, lower than in the euro area and lower than in Japan. Debt levels are forecast to be 38.5, 39.4, 39.8, 39.7 and 39.3 per cent of GDP by 2012-13: every year lower than in 1997.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o38"><a name="80312-0004.htm_para31"><a name="08031240000188">In the 18 years between 1979 and 1997, investment increased by only 20 per cent. in cash terms and reached a low of just 0.3 per cent. as a share of national income. But I can tell the House that, by 2011, investment will have increased by 500 per cent. since 1997 and will have trebled as a share of national income. By 2011, we will have seen the longest sustained expansion of investment in public services since 1945. It is an achievement that we can be rightly proud of, and we remain committed to continued investment in these public services.</p>

Public spending grew by 3.6 per cent. a year in real terms between 1997 and 2007. Following the comprehensive spending review last October, public spending in the coming three years will grow by 2.2 per cent., building on past increases and underpinned by stretching value for money reforms.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o40"><a name="80312-0004.htm_para33"><a name="08031240000190">In 10 years, spending on health has almost doubled, and spending on education is up by 58 per cent. As a result, waiting lists are down, and school standards are up. Transport spending is now 90 per cent. higher, with more people using public transport than ever before.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o43"><a name="80312-0004.htm_para36"><a name="08031240000193">This has been an exceptional commitment to improving public services. By 2010-11, we will have seen the longest sustained expansion of investment in public services in recent history. In 1997, the annual cost of servicing our national debt was 9 per cent. of public spending. Today, it is 5 per cent., freeing up an extra &#163;23 billion each year to invest in public services&#151;around half the entire budget for schools. In the early 1990s, as much as three quarters of all new public spending went on debt and social security costs. The figure today is just a third of that, allowing us to target spending where it is needed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o44"><a name="80312-0004.htm_para37"><a name="08031240000194">We have turned welfare into work and borrowing into wealth creation, and it is essential that we continue to help everyone who can get into work to do so, so we will bring forward further proposals to reform housing benefit to ensure that work pays. From April 2010, all long-term recipients of incapacity benefit will attend work capability assessments, helping them into work. These reforms will continue to free up resources for investment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o45"><a name="80312-0004.htm_para38"><a name="08031240000195">It is right that, like any other organisation, the public sector is as efficient as possible and that it delivers value for money.

better public services after decades of underinvestment and neglect. We have driven up standards, developed a greater diversity of providers, tackled failing services, and ensured that the maximum benefit was gained from the investment that we put in.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o48"><a name="80312-0004.htm_para41"><a name="08031240000198">Ten years ago there were 600 schools in which less than a quarter of pupils gained at least five good GCSEs; today, there are fewer than 50. Compared with 1997, 10 per cent. fewer people die from cancer each year thanks to faster and better treatment and more specialist doctors. But the test for public services in the future is not whether they are better than before or simply good enough. It is whether they are as good as they can be. So if the focus of the past decade was on repairing the old, the focus of the next must be on developing genuinely world-class services.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o49"><a name="80312-0004.htm_para42"><a name="08031240000199">After a decade of hugely increased investment, we will continue our spending at a sustainable rate alongside our wider objectives for the economy and public services. This Budget therefore confirms the spending plans set out in last year&#146;s comprehensive spending review, and makes an assumption for continuing real growth in public spending after 2011 at a rate of 1.9 per cent. a year, which will allow departmental resources to continue to grow broadly at the same rate for the next three years.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o50"><a name="80312-0004.htm_para43"><a name="08031240000200">I now want to turn to the steps that I believe are necessary to equip this country for the future. There is no greater moral imperative than to make sure that every child has the highest aspiration and ambition and the best possible opportunity to go as far as they have the talent to go&#151;not some children, but every child in this country.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o51"><a name="80312-0004.htm_para44"><a name="08031240000201">If we are to build a fairer future for our children, we must eradicate child poverty in Britain. Between 1979 and 1997, the number of children living in poverty doubled. Since then, I can report that 600,000 fewer children live in relative poverty, and we have halved the number of children living in absolute poverty. We have set ourselves an ambitious target to eradicate child poverty by 2020 and to halve it by 2010, and today I want to do more to deliver that ambition.</p>

Central to that is helping more parents into work. We want to demonstrate our commitment to supporting parents through a contract in which the Government undertake to provide the support that families need to move into work, and the other side of this contract is that we look to families to make a commitment to improve their situations where they can.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o53"><a name="80312-0004.htm_para46"><a name="08031240000203">From October 2009, we will change the rules for housing and council tax benefit so that parents are better off in work than on benefit. As a result, a family with one child on the lowest income will gain up to &#163;17 a week. This measure alone will lift 150,000 more children out of poverty. And I can do more to help all children of hard-working families.</p>

I can tell the House that, from April 2009, I will increase child benefit for the first child to &#163;20 a week&#151;a year earlier than planned. I will increase by &#163;50 a year above inflation the child element of the child tax credit for families on low and middle income from April next year.

&#163;130 a year better off. To make further progress, we will spend a further &#163;125 million over the next three years targeting help on those who need it most and where the challenges are the hardest, developing new approaches that help families in the long term. Taken together, these measures mean that even at a time when we need to take difficult decisions we are investing a further &#163;765 million next year and then a further &#163;950 million the following year to take 250,000 more children out of poverty.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o55"><a name="80312-0005.htm_para1"><a name="08031240000205">Today I am publishing analysis on what further steps we intend to take to eradicate child poverty, and I believe that further action is also now needed to help vulnerable groups deal with rising energy prices. We want to see the 5 million customers on prepayment meters given a fairer deal and energy companies increase their support to vulnerable customers. We will work with the companies to take forward further action on a voluntary and on a statutory basis to underpin this as necessary and we will legislate when it is necessary to do so. Energy companies currently spend around &#163;50 million a year on social tariffs. I want to see this rising to at least &#163;150 million a year in the period ahead.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o56"><a name="80312-0005.htm_para2"><a name="08031240000206">We are committed to helping people who need the help most. We are also committed to encouraging more people to save. There are now over 17 million people with individual savings accounts and, from this April, we are increasing the annual individual savings account investment limit to &#163;7,200, while the amount that can be held in cash will rise to &#163;3,600. Parents have now opened over 2.4 million child trust fund accounts, saving more for their children&#146;s future.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o57"><a name="80312-0005.htm_para3"><a name="08031240000207">But we can go further. So I can also announce that the Government will launch the savings gateway nationally with the first accounts available from 2010. By contributing to these accounts, we will offer incentives to save to up to 8 million more people on low incomes. Ending child poverty, encouraging saving, raising ambition and providing greater opportunity&#151;that is the objective of this Budget.</p>

We will continue to promote open and competitive markets, by removing barriers to trade across the world through bilateral and multilateral trade negotiations, including the conclusion of the Doha development agenda.</p>

We already have the lowest corporation tax rate in the G7 and a competitive and simplified tax regime is essential, which is why we cut the main rate of corporation tax in 1997 and again in 1999. And from next month the main corporation tax rate falls again from 38 per cent. to 28 per cent.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o61"><a name="80312-0005.htm_para7"><a name="08031240000211">But today, I want to do more to support small and medium enterprises, now and in the longer term. Thirteen million people work in those enterprises and there are over 750,000 more small and medium firms than there were in 1997. The new capital gains tax regime will come in next month including the entrepreneurs relief that I announced in January. That will benefit over 80,000 businesses and investors in the next year alone: 90 per cent. of them will continue to pay capital gains tax at 10 per cent., one of the lowest rates in the world. This Budget continues a programme of tax simplification. I am today announcing further steps to help small companies simplify their tax calculations.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o62"><a name="80312-0005.htm_para8"><a name="08031240000212">Especially at this time, we need to do more to help small and medium enterprises to get access to the finance that they need. To help them in the current conditions, I can therefore announce that funds available through the small firms loan guarantee scheme will be increased by &#163;60 million for the coming year. I am from next month extending the scheme to all small and medium firms. I am also increasing the amount of investment on which tax relief is available under the enterprise investment scheme from &#163;400,000 to &#163;500,000 and the employee share limit for tax relief under the enterprise management incentive scheme will increase from &#163;100,000 to &#163;120,000. The Secretary of State for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform will consult with radical new proposals to impose a limit on the amount of regulation that can be imposed by Whitehall Departments. I will also provide a capital fund of initially &#163;12.5 million specifically to encourage more women entrepreneurs.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o63"><a name="80312-0005.htm_para9"><a name="08031240000213">There is also more I can do to ensure that small and medium firms win more business from the public sector, so we will take immediate steps to give firms better access to Government contracts and help them with their cash flow. I am asking Anne Glover, the chief executive of Amadeus Capital Partners, to look into what other barriers we can remove and the practicality of also setting a goal for small and medium enterprises to win 30 per cent. of all public sector business in the next five years. I believe that that could help promote enterprise in one of our most innovative and dynamic areas of the economy. I also believe that we can help support them grow their businesses, which will create new jobs and opportunities.</p>

They are an important and central contributor to our economy&#146;s growth and prosperity. They pay their taxes on their earnings here; they also pay tax on the money they bring into this country from abroad. But for those non-domiciled individuals or families who have chosen to make Britain their home, I believe that it is right and fair that they should, after seven years, pay a reasonable charge to maintain the right to be taxed differently from other UK residents. Beyond that, as I have said before, we will not seek to charge UK tax on offshore income or capital gains that are not brought into the UK. This new charge will be implemented from April. There will be no further changes to this regime for the rest of this Parliament or the next. <i> [Interruption.]</i></p>

On closer examination, it was clear that the sums that did not add up&#151;not for the first time, given the source from which that representation came&#151;and I rejected it. We will continue, though, to be vigilant against tax avoidance, and we are publishing today further measures to ensure fairness for all taxpayers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o66"><a name="80312-0005.htm_para12"><a name="08031240000216">If we are to compete in the future, it is essential to do even more to drive up standards in education and improve skills. Increased spending on education has benefited children right across the United Kingdom. We have cut the number of underperforming schools dramatically in the last decade and building on last year&#146;s spending review will raise standards even further to create greater opportunities for children.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o67"><a name="80312-0005.htm_para13"><a name="08031240000217">So the Secretary of State for Children, Schools and Families will be investing &#163;200 million to bring forward by a year to 2011 the Government&#146;s aim for no schools to have fewer than 30 per cent. of its pupils achieving five A* to C GCSEs, including English and maths. We will also extend the successful London Challenge model to enable the best head teachers to turn round low-performing schools, to create new trusts and federations around successful schools and, in areas of greatest need, to drive forward a faster expansion of our academies programme. As a result, by 2011, we will ensure that every school is an improving school meeting the standards that we have set.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o68"><a name="80312-0005.htm_para14"><a name="08031240000218">I can announce today that we will commit &#163;10 million over the next five years, which, alongside contributions from the Wellcome Trust and private sector, will create a &#163;30 million Enthuse Science fund. That will give every science teacher in secondary and further education access to high-quality professional development, helping to improve the science on offer in today&#146;s schools.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o69"><a name="80312-0005.htm_para15"><a name="08031240000219">To improve skills, the spending review last year increased the amount of money for adult training.

Today I can also announce an extra &#163;60 million over the next three years to provide new opportunities for people to gain the skills they need to enter the labour market, to remain in and progress through work. That includes additional apprenticeships with leading employers to help tackle skills gaps and shortages.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o70"><a name="80312-0005.htm_para16"><a name="08031240000220">By 2010, we will be spending over &#163;6 billion a year supporting British science and innovation.

international station. This week, terminal 5 opens at Heathrow. Today, I can announce new measures at Heathrow and other airports to ensure greater use of biometric technology to speed up the time that it takes passengers to get through immigration control. Government funding for Crossrail is now secure and that will support economic growth not just in London but in the whole of the United Kingdom by adding an estimated &#163;20 billion to national income. That will help London retain its position as the world&#146;s pre-eminent international financial centre.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o73"><a name="80312-0005.htm_para19"><a name="08031240000223">We are spending more on public transport, and we also need to spend more to reduce congestion and improve transport links. If we are to remain competitive over the next 20 to 30 years, we need to take more radical steps to reduce congestion on our roads. We do need more capacity on the roads, but we cannot build our way out of all the problems we face.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o74"><a name="80312-0005.htm_para20"><a name="08031240000224">Last week, the Secretary of State for Transport announced further measures to ease congestion. In addition, she has made available funding to develop local schemes to tackle congestion in the short term. In the longer term, though, road pricing could reduce congestion in the future, as well as helping to meet our wider environmental obligations, so I am setting aside new funding to develop national road pricing, inviting tenders to test road-pricing technology, with the results expected next year.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o75"><a name="80312-0005.htm_para21"><a name="08031240000225">Just as we need good transport links, we also need to make sure that we have more housing to meet the rising demand for homes as well as to support our growing economy. Since 1997, as a result of historically low mortgage rates, we have seen 1.5 million more home owners. Already, we have helped 95,000 families into new homes through shared ownership and shared equity schemes. We will now spend &#163;8 billion more on new, affordable and social housing over the next three years. That will enable the Housing Corporation to develop 70,000 new affordable homes each year over the next three years.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o76"><a name="80312-0005.htm_para22"><a name="08031240000226">But I want to go further. From this April, key workers, such as teachers and nurses, and first-time buyers will be able to borrow money from new shared equity schemes. Up until now, those were available only to people who could afford three quarters of the price of their new home. I am now extending the scheme to help those able to afford half the price of their new home. I can also announce that, from today, stamp duty on shared ownership homes will not be required until buyers own 80 per cent. of the equity in their home.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o77"><a name="80312-0005.htm_para23"><a name="08031240000227">It is precisely at this time that we need to do more to promote longer-term stability for home owners and mortgage holders. Already, the reforms we have introduced have created much greater stability with consistently low mortgage rates for home owners. However, the uncertainty in the financial markets is having an impact on mortgage lenders here in the UK, so I want to take measures that will keep mortgage rates low and stable.</p>

low-cost funding so that mortgage rates can come down as soon as possible. We want to bring together investors and lenders with the Treasury, the Bank and the Financial Services Authority to find market-led solutions to strengthen these funding markets further.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o79"><a name="80312-0005.htm_para25"><a name="08031240000229">I also want more people to have the choice of a long-term fixed mortgage. These protect borrowers from risks and allow them the flexibility to move and to get a new mortgage if rates go down. Today, however, most people in the UK have short-term fixed-rate mortgages for two or three years, leaving them exposed to interest rate rises when their mortgage deal ends. That is not the case in other countries&#151;Denmark, for example&#151;where the majority of home owners take out long-term fixed-rate mortgages. I want to see more flexible and affordable long-term fixed-rate mortgages for 10, 20 or 25 years.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o80"><a name="80312-0005.htm_para26"><a name="08031240000230">I am today publishing the findings of a review of housing finance in the UK. The conclusions show that long-term fixed-rate mortgages can reduce some of the risks of taking out a mortgage, especially for first-time buyers and lower-income families, and this will help more people get on to and stay on the housing ladder. So I want to seek views on how we can deliver&#151;drawing on international experience&#151;the right framework for the UK to achieve long-term fixed-rate mortgages, and I will report back in the pre-Budget report.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o81"><a name="80312-0005.htm_para27"><a name="08031240000231">The best way to improve long-term affordability and stability is to build more houses, which is why we are committed to building more homes by 2020. So I can announce that in addition to the 40,000 already under construction, we have, through the review of public sector land, identified sites for 70,000 more houses.</p>

Britain has been at the forefront of international action. We are one of the few countries to meet our Kyoto target. We are working with other countries following agreement in Bali last year to agree tougher global goals after 2012, and the UK will use our &#163;800 million environment fund to work with the United States, Japan and other countries, as well as the World Bank, to fund clean technologies in developing countries and adaptation to climate change.</p>

Government, every Department in Government, every single public sector body, every business, every one of us needs to play our part. To ensure that carbon reduction is a central part of our economic objectives, I can tell the House that the first carbon budgets to 2022 will be announced alongside the Budget next year.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o85"><a name="80312-0005.htm_para31"><a name="08031240000235">Long-term growth must be sustainable. There are huge opportunities there too for businesses, and there could be over a million jobs in our environmental industries within the next two decades. Meeting these long-term challenges will require us to make substantial reductions in emissions across the economy, in energy supply, in transport and in our business and our homes. But I believe there are three key steps that we can take now.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o86"><a name="80312-0005.htm_para32"><a name="08031240000236">First, working within Europe we have helped to build the emissions trading scheme to curb the amount of carbon produced by generators and large industrial users. The scheme imposes a cap on the amount of carbon that companies can generate. Companies get allocations for credits to help them to adapt. But if we want to encourage investment in low-carbon technology, in energy renewables and in nuclear, for example, and if we want to make the industry more carbon-efficient, we need to go further. So in the next phase, instead of auctioning of just 7 per cent., I want to see auctioning of 100 per cent. of these allowances for electricity generators. Last year&#146;s energy White Paper committed us to increasing the supply of renewable energy, and the Energy Bill now going through Parliament will allow us to triple renewable energy by 2015. We will consult on how to meet our share of the European Union target in the summer.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o87"><a name="80312-0005.htm_para33"><a name="08031240000237">Secondly, we need to do more to reduce the amount of carbon generated at home and at work. Given the damage that single-use carrier bags inflict on the environment, we want to be able to take action now, so we will introduce legislation to impose a charge on them if we have not seen sufficient progress on a voluntary basis. Legislation will come in in 2009, and on the basis of other countries&#146; experience it could lead to a 90 per cent. reduction, with around 12 billion fewer plastic bags in circulation. The money raised should go to environmental charities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o88"><a name="80312-0005.htm_para34"><a name="08031240000238">Next month we will launch the most ambitious household emissions reduction programme. Energy companies are obliged through the carbon emissions reduction target to give their customers better deals for energy efficiency and therefore cut bills. This means cavity wall insulation for nearly 3 million homes, loft insulation and more energy-efficient appliances. I can announce funding of &#163;26 million next year for a Green Homes service to help people cut their carbon emissions and their fuel bills. We will also extend the use of smart meters to medium and large companies over the next five years to provide them with greater incentives to reduce the amount of energy that they consume.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o90"><a name="80312-0006.htm_para0"><a name="08031240000240">I believe that the third key area in which we need to take action now is transport, which accounts for nearly a third of our carbon emissions. We recognise the contribution of aviation to the UK economy, which is why we support expansion at Stansted and Heathrow, but I have always been clear that aviation must meet its environmental costs, and that is why we want it to be in the European Union emissions trading scheme. Because emissions from aircraft are forecast to continue to grow, I am also announcing that revenue from the duty will be increased by 10 per cent. in the second year of operation. But Britain&#146;s 30 million cars, vans and lorries together account for 22 per cent. of total carbon emissions. Over the last 20 years new cars have become 50 per cent. more efficient, and new technology will bring further improvement.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o91"><a name="80312-0006.htm_para1"><a name="08031240000241">Today I am publishing Professor Julia King&#146;s review of low-carbon cars, in which she examined new technologies which could help to cut carbon emissions further. Professor King found that simply by switching to the cleanest cars on offer, motorists could save 25 per cent. of their fuel costs. She also found that manufacturers needed to be encouraged to bring new technology to the market. I am asking the European Commission today to set a tighter target which reduces the cap on emissions from 130 g per km to 100 g per km by 2020.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o92"><a name="80312-0006.htm_para2"><a name="08031240000242">But I believe that the road tax system should do more to support the use of more carbon-efficiency, and therefore less costly cars. It will continue to reduce the average carbon dioxide levels in new cars. First, I propose a major reform of vehicle excise duty from 2009 to encourage manufacturers to produce cleaner cars with the introduction of new bands. There will be an incentive to encourage drivers to choose the least polluting car.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o93"><a name="80312-0006.htm_para3"><a name="08031240000243">As a second stage for new cars, from 2010 there will be a new first-year rate based on carbon dioxide emissions from the car. Cars that emit less than the proposed 130 g European standard will pay no car tax at all in the first year, but a higher first-year rate will be introduced for the most polluting cars. Cutting taxes for those who cut carbon emissions; but it is right that if people choose to buy a more polluting car, they should pay more in the first year to reflect the environmental cost. These changes will provide a real incentive for both manufacturers and motorists.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o94"><a name="80312-0006.htm_para4"><a name="08031240000244">We must encourage sustainable biofuels, and therefore the biofuel duty differential will be replaced by the renewable transport fuel obligation. I am also reforming capital allowances for business cars to increase the incentive to move to lower-emitting cars.</p>

To help people stop smoking, we are continuing the 5 per cent. reduced rate of VAT on smoking cessation products beyond 30 June this year.</p>

bottle of wine will cost about &#163;4. So from midnight on Sunday, alcohol duty will increase by 6 per cent. above the rate of inflation. Beer will rise by 4p a pint, cider by 3p a litre, wine by 14p a bottle and spirits by 55p a bottle, and those duties will increase by 2 per cent. above the rate of inflation in each of the next four years.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o97"><a name="80312-0006.htm_para7"><a name="08031240000247">It is only because I have taken these decisions on alcohol and on closing tax loopholes that I am able to provide additional support for families and lift more children out of poverty. It is also why I am able to make two further announcements, while still meeting our fiscal rules. As the House will know, the basic rate of income tax will fall by 2p in April. Because charities have a vital role to play, we will therefore implement a transitional rate of 22 per cent. to allow them to continue to claim gift aid at the current rate, delivering &#163;300 million-worth of relief. It will provide charities with certainty for the next three years.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o98"><a name="80312-0006.htm_para8"><a name="08031240000248">I also said that one of the key features of this Budget is fairness and I want to do more to help older people, especially this year. We are spending &#163;11 billion more in real terms per year on pensions, with over half this extra money going to pensioners on the lowest incomes. From April, as a result of the changes we made last year, a further 600,000 pensioners will be taken out of paying income tax. The pension credit now guarantees a minimum income of &#163;124 a week from April.</p>

 It is not difficult to see what is wrong with the Budget. It is not just that it was, on the whole, a dire list of reviews and re-announcements delivered with all the excitement of someone reading out a telephone directory, although that did not help. But people watching this Budget for the last hour will conclude that the Chancellor and the Prime Minister live in an entirely different world from everybody else. Every time people refinance their mortgage, it is costing them more. Every time they fill up their car, they are paying more. Every time they shop, food bills are higher. Yet every time they get a tax bill, they are paying more. There was no recognition of that in the Budget. The cost of living is going up and Labour is making it worse. Everybody has now learned the cost of living under Labour.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o105"><a name="80312-0006.htm_para15"><a name="08031240000262">Everybody listening to the Budget will have noticed something else. This Government and the Prime Minister took all of the credit when the global economy was growing, but now there are difficulties, they will not take any of the blame. Here are some of the things that they would not tell us in the Budget. The Chancellor boasted about trade, but he did not tell us that the current account deficit is set to rise to a record &#163;72 billion. That was on page 165 of the Red Book. He told us about investment, but he did not tell us that the rate of growth of business investment is slumping by two thirds. That is on page 163 of the Red Book. He talked about debt as a share of GDP and boasted about his rules, but if we include Northern Rock, debt as a share of GDP is 43.8 per cent., busting his fiscal rule.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o106"><a name="80312-0006.htm_para16"><a name="08031240000263">The Chancellor made one central claim at the heart of his Budget: he told us that Britain is well prepared for economic slowdown.

 &#147;So what?&#148; says the Secretary of State for Children, Schools and Families. I know he wants to be Chancellor so badly it hurts. I have to tell him that another Budget like the one we have just heard and he will not have to wait very long.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o107"><a name="80312-0006.htm_para17"><a name="08031240000266">We have the highest Budget deficit in western Europe. Today, the Chancellor told us that borrowing would be up by &#163;20 billion over the next four years. Those are truly dreadful figures; there is a &#163;7 billion increase in the next year alone. We have the highest interest rates in the G7, which means that on top of high taxes, home owners and businesses have a higher interest rate burden, too. Today, for the second time in his very short period as Chancellor, he downgraded his growth forecast once again&#151;not that he could bring himself to use that word.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o108"><a name="80312-0006.htm_para18"><a name="08031240000267">High debt, high interest rates, high taxes and now lower growth&#151;those are the facts that this Budget cannot hide. They tell the story of just how badly prepared we are for the downturn. We all know why; because in the years of plenty, Labour Governments put nothing aside. They did not fix the roof when the sun was shining. What better metaphor could there be today, when it has started to blow off at No. 11 Downing street?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o109"><a name="80312-0006.htm_para19"><a name="08031240000268">What we needed in the Budget was real leadership and a serious plan to get this country out of the mess that they have made. We need a Government who help people when times are tough; instead, we have a Government who kick them when they are down. The key test of competence for any Government is not how they perform when things are going well, but how well prepared they are to cope when things get tough. The key question at these times is how much room for manoeuvre one has given oneself. The answer with the Government is, &#147;No room for manoeuvre at all.&#148;</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o110"><a name="80312-0006.htm_para20"><a name="08031240000269">In America, they are cutting taxes by 1 per cent of national income. In Sweden, there is a 2 per cent budget surplus to help them out. <i> [</i><i> Interruption.</i><i> ]</i> I am not surprised that hon. Members do not want to hear the consequences of the waste and incompetence of the last decade with their Prime Minister. In other countries, they are debating what to do with their surpluses. In this country, there is no debate because there is no surplus. In Britain, we have nothing&#151;no room for manoeuvre on the deficit, no room for manoeuvre on interest rates and no room for manoeuvre on taxes. I want to take each of those in turn.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o111"><a name="80312-0006.htm_para21"><a name="08031240000270">On debt, the Government said that they would borrow &#163;47 billion over the last five years. In fact, they have borrowed &#163;165 billion&#151;over &#163;100 billion more debt than planned. Today, it is worse again. They have told us that the current Budget deficit is up another &#163;23 billion over four years. That is the extent of the Government&#146;s economic incompetence.</p>

Let me read a list of major countries with deficits higher than Britain: Hungary, Pakistan and Egypt. That is the league of debt to which we have been relegated today. For years the Prime Minister and the Chancellor liked to tell us about their fiscal rules and how they would stop us getting into this kind of mess. The Chancellor tried today, and I do not know how he did it with a straight face. The truth is that they have forgotten the most important rule of all:  <br>

<p><a name="stpa_o113"><a name="80312-0006.htm_para23"><a name="08031240000272">We are ill-prepared on fiscal policy; let us look at monetary policy. Again there is virtually no room for manoeuvre. The Chancellor boasted about low inflation, but let us listen to what the Governor of the Bank of England expects. He predicts</p>
<a name="80312-0006.htm_brev10"><a name="08031240000655"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;inflation rising sharply alongside a marked slowing in growth&#148;,</p>

That is why the Bank of England has the highest interest rates in the G7. But the situation is in fact worse than that. Let us look at the real figures for inflation. Food inflation: 7 per cent. Housing costs: up 8 per cent. Petrol and oil: up 19 per cent. That is the real inflation paid by families in Britain.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o115"><a name="80312-0006.htm_para25"><a name="08031240000274">If anybody still needs proof of how little room for manoeuvre the Chancellor has, they should just take a look at what is happening to taxes. While our competitors are cutting taxes on enterprise, the Chancellor confirmed today that he is putting such taxes up. Capital gains tax: up by &#163;700 million when we are heading for a downturn. Taxes on family businesses: up by &#163;200 million&#151;that is the new income-shifting rules for family businesses that he did not even mention in his speech. Corporation tax on small businesses: up &#163;800 million as we head for a downturn. This is a crazy way to respond to a slowdown&#151;hitting the very people who create the wealth, the jobs and the investment that this country so badly needs.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o116"><a name="80312-0006.htm_para26"><a name="08031240000275">However, the true extent of the Chancellor&#146;s dreadful predicament is the fact that the Budget&#151;<i> [Interruption.] </i>I am going to mention something that last year was the centrepiece of the tax-con Budget, but which this year does not get even a single mention. He is abolishing the 10p starting rate of tax. That is the tax con that Labour Members all cheered so loudly last year, and soon they will find out what it means. Low-paid NHS workers will have to pay more tax. Part-time teaching assistants will have to pay more tax. <i> [Interruption.] </i>Is the Prime Minister shaking his head? Well, that is the Budget that he introduced. Our soldiers fighting in the heat and dust of Afghanistan will pay more tax. That is the consequence of the tax con. <i> [Interruption.] </i>Labour Members say, &#147;Shame&#148;; well, they should be ashamed for taxing our soldiers more. The fact is that 5.3 million of the lowest paid will be worse off, and what have the Government got to say to them? They say, &#147;If you fill in a form, some of you can get some of the money back.&#148; Taking away people&#146;s money, reducing self-reliance and increasing people&#146;s dependence on the state: that tells us everything we need to know about this Prime Minister and this Chancellor.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o117"><a name="80312-0006.htm_para27"><a name="08031240000276">Let me explain what we would do differently. We would ensure that higher green taxes were paid into a family fund and were used to cut taxes on all Britain&#146;s hard-pressed families. We would help business by sweeping away the allowances and reliefs and cutting the headline rate of corporation tax. We would target tax on binge drinkers, not on every responsible drinker in this country who wants a glass of wine or a pint of beer at the end of a hard day&#146;s work.</p>

lessons of the waste and extravagance of the last decade. He should have set out how to share the proceeds of growth so we could get borrowing and tax rates down. That would help not only Britain&#146;s families, but Britain&#146;s businesses, too.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o119"><a name="80312-0006.htm_para29"><a name="08031240000278">Business knows just how bad this situation is. The CBI says it is now like a &#147;banana republic&#148;. <i> [Interruption.] </i>Those are its words; that is the effect of the prawn cocktail offensive of all those years ago. The British Chambers of Commerce says the Government have &#147;lost the plot&#148;. Nine in 10 small businesses have lost confidence in the Government. Business has fallen out of love with Labour. The very least businesses expected was competent leadership in uncertain times, but all they have got is dithering.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o120"><a name="80312-0006.htm_para30"><a name="08031240000279">Five months ago, the Chancellor stood at the Dispatch Box and proposed changes to capital gains tax; all the Labour Members cheered, and the policy fell apart. Five months ago, he announced his plans on non-doms; they all cheered, and the policy fell apart. Month after month, the Government said they did not want to nationalise Northern Rock, and they did. They cancelled the general election, which, unbelievably, they had planned to fight on the issue of competence, and they promptly lost half the country&#146;s personal data in the post.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o121"><a name="80312-0006.htm_para31"><a name="08031240000280">Who is to blame for this? It is tempting to blame the Chancellor; after all, he has had the most disastrous start of any Chancellor in modern history. But I do not think that would be fair. Let us be in no doubt as to the real source of this Government&#146;s problems. Ask any question about this Budget, and the answer comes back to one man: the Prime Minister. Why is the Chancellor hitting the low-paid with higher tax? Because his predecessor put it in his Budget last year. Why is the Chancellor left with the biggest Budget deficit in western Europe? Because the Prime Minister spent all the money in the last 11 Budgets. Why is the Chancellor imposing &#163;1 billion in extra taxes on capital gains and family businesses? Because the Prime Minister got himself in a panic trying to copy our proposals on inheritance tax. This country should not be in any doubt about the source of the difficulties that Britain is now in: the Chancellor was put in a hole by the Prime Minister and they both kept digging.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o122"><a name="80312-0006.htm_para32"><a name="08031240000281">What is the situation now? We have the highest taxes in history, the highest deficit in western Europe, the highest interest rates in the G7&#151;<i> [Interruption.] </i>I thank the Secretary of State for Children, Schools and Families for his comment; I know he is Minister for children, but he does not have to behave like one. We have all of that, and the Government are asking us to trust them to get the country out of this mess. They just do not get it. The City may be having a credit crunch, but this Government have a credibility crunch. The Treasury has run out of money, and they have left Britain running on empty.</p>

 I am told that during the Government&#146;s previous 10 Budgets Prime Minster Blair did not know what the proposals would be until Chancellor Brown rose to his feet in the Chamber. This time, the situation is exactly the other way round: the Chancellor is the Prime Minister&#146;s creature, struggling to clear up a mess left by his boss under instruction from No. 10. What we have seen today is an act of political ventriloquism. I would like to compliment the Prime Minister: I watched him very closely, and his lips barely moved all the while that the Chancellor was speaking.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o124"><a name="80312-0007.htm_para0"><a name="08031240000284">This Budget has inevitably brought a lot of bad news. It has also massively over-egged and exaggerated any good news. Why, for instance, did the Chancellor not admit in his statement that the winter fuel allowance increases are a one-off? How can he bring himself to play with the hopes and expectations of some of the oldest and most vulnerable people in our society? Is this just another pre-election bribe? Are we now to expect an election in 2009?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o125"><a name="80312-0007.htm_para1"><a name="08031240000285">There are tough times ahead, of course, and the world economy remains uncertain, so this was an opportunity to give whatever help possible to the millions of hard-pressed families who are feeling the pinch&#151;whose money simply does not stretch as far as it once did&#151;but the Chancellor has not delivered such a Budget. This is a meagre, tinkering Budget, which gives precious little help to the poor but maintains special treatment for the rich. It is a Budget designed to fill a black hole, masquerading as good for the environment. It is a Budget that will not make Britain fairer. It is a Budget that is a green cop-out.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o126"><a name="80312-0007.htm_para2"><a name="08031240000286">The Chancellor bravely suggests that the problems afflicting our economy were all caused elsewhere. He has to do that; he cannot tell the truth. He cannot blame his boss; a monkey never blames the organ grinder. It is deeply disingenuous to claim, as he did, that a housing market crash in the United States is the main reason for our economic woes. The reality is that a swelling tide of personal, private debt secured against high house prices that are now declining is creating the conditions for a perfect economic storm. High oil and food prices make it difficult for the Bank of England to cut interest rates, and with Britain now up to &#163;2 trillion in debt, the Chancellor has backed himself into a corner with no room for manoeuvre. The sustainable debt rule is in tatters, even without Northern Rock and private finance initiative projects being put on to the national accounts, and the &#147;golden rule&#148; has become the &#147;gamblers rule&#148;. Deep in the red, the Government keep betting more and more of our money in the hope that someday, somehow, they will find themselves back in the black. As we have heard today, that prospect is moving ever further into the distance.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o127"><a name="80312-0007.htm_para3"><a name="08031240000287">We heard much today about the Chancellor&#146;s wish to cut child poverty, but the meagre, piecemeal reforms that he is introducing to the chaotic tax credit system  <br>

will not get the Government anywhere near meeting their 2010 child poverty target. By my reckoning, only about a third of what is needed is being provided; the ridiculously complex set of proposals that we have heard about today will be difficult for the most hard-pressed families to understand. Using the Government&#146;s own calculations, the Chancellor would have to find an additional &#163;3.5 billion to stand even a faint chance of achieving their goal, and they are nowhere near doing that. The reality is that this Government&#146;s approach to child poverty has failed. If we are to abolish child poverty for good, we must increase not only income but opportunity. We must target more investment to help the poorest children in our schools and offer them genuine opportunity for life. Crucially, we must deal with the link between poor housing and persistent poverty.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o128"><a name="80312-0007.htm_para4"><a name="08031240000288">This Budget was widely trailed by the Treasury as the greenest ever, but at the first sign of political difficulty the Government have run away, by postponing the petrol duty increase until October. The fact is that the real cost of motoring has fallen consistently over the past two decades while the real cost of public transport has risen by a third. We of course welcome the Government&#146;s increasing vehicle excise duty on the most polluting cars. Like many of the Treasury&#146;s best proposals&#151;nationalising Northern Rock, reforming aviation tax and increasing stamp duty thresholds&#151;that started life as a Liberal Democrat policy. We have got used to the fact that a while after we have a good idea, the Treasury, too, finally gets round to realising it is the best way forward.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o129"><a name="80312-0007.htm_para5"><a name="08031240000289">Green taxes should be revenue-neutral. They should not be treated as a wheeze to squeeze ever more money out of the British people, but should instead be designed to encourage green behaviour and cut the taxes of the most needy. By my reckoning, the figures that we have heard today will mean that the Government will be taking approximately &#163;1.7 billion in new green taxes, but less than &#163;1 billion of that will be spent on the poor. Much of the revenue from those green taxes, plus other duties, will clearly go straight back into the black hole that the Prime Minister and the Chancellor have created in the UK&#146;s finances. By 2010, an additional &#163;1.9 billion will go straight to filling that black hole. This is not a Budget for the environment; it is a Budget driven by fiscal incompetence and political desperation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o130"><a name="80312-0007.htm_para6"><a name="08031240000290">Is it not the case that the only people who will welcome this Budget are those at the top of the income scale, not those at the bottom? The Government&#146;s policy on non-doms is laughable. Their new poll tax, which the Conservatives unsurprisingly support, will be wildly punitive for ordinary foreign workers, but it will be no more than a flea-bite for foreign billionaires, who have come to regard the United Kingdom as nothing more than a tax haven.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o131"><a name="80312-0007.htm_para7"><a name="08031240000291">The Government&#146;s approach to capital gains tax policy continues to be mired in chaos. It is frankly amazing that the Chancellor has contrived to create a tax change that has caused howls of anguish from businesses and cries of derision from commentators but still allows hedge fund managers to pay lower rates of tax than their cleaners. Surely it would make more sense to return to the capital gains tax system of Nigel Lawson&#151;not a man with whom I readily agree&#151;and tax capital like income. Until the two taxes are united,  <br>

we will continue to see mass tax avoidance by the wealthy, presenting their income as capital for a 23 per cent. tax break. Surely this is also the time to take a much wider look at tax avoidance by big business. It is scandalous that companies such as Tesco avoid paying millions in stamp duty by placing British properties in foreign special purpose vehicles, which are based in offshore tax havens.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o132"><a name="80312-0007.htm_para8"><a name="08031240000292">Finally, the Chancellor&#146;s announcement on fuel poverty is, once again, too little, too late. Why has he not had the guts to claw back the huge excess profits made by energy companies thanks to the emissions permits that the Government have given them for free? Some 4.5 million people still live in fuel poverty, but the Government&#146;s 2010 fuel poverty target appears to have been conveniently shelved by Ministers. Limiting his measures to prepayment meters and only a modest increase in money for social tariffs does not go nearly far enough. Surely this is the time to compel all energy companies to introduce real, fair, social tariffs for all vulnerable people, not just those on prepayment meters.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o133"><a name="80312-0007.htm_para9"><a name="08031240000293">This Budget gives no real help to families struggling with higher food bills, higher energy bills and higher debt repayments. What will this Budget do to help junior nurses, teaching assistants and soldiers serving in Afghanistan? The answer is nothing. What we have got instead is a sequel to last year&#146;s Budget, when the Chancellor&#146;s predecessor scandalously raised taxes exclusively on people earning less than &#163;18,500 per year who do not get tax credits. What will the Chancellor say to those most vulnerable people when their income goes down in three weeks&#146; time?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o134"><a name="80312-0007.htm_para10"><a name="08031240000294">After 11 years in government, Labour has today completed its fiscal fusion with the Tory Party. Both parties believe in the same kind of Budget: the kind of Budget that kowtows to vested interests, but fleeces the average family; the kind of Budget that keeps tax loopholes for the super rich, but closes in mercilessly on single mothers who have been overpaid tax credits; and the kind of Budget that uses green taxes as an excuse to take more money from the kitty of low earners. This is not a green Budget. This is not a people&#146;s Budget. This is a tinkering, con-trick Budget that protects the rich and abandons the poor.</p>

 I welcome the opportunity to speak in the Budget debate. Given the economic instability and turbulence in the markets, I am delighted that the Chancellor referred to the targets on child poverty&#151;a primary target of the 1997 Government&#151;the initiatives on environmental taxation, the savings gateway and the measures for elderly citizens. He did so against a background of economic turbulence and the globalised world in which we live. Indeed, only yesterday the Federal Reserve put $235 billion into the market by providing Treasury securities to the bond market for it to accept as ordinary triple-A-rated mortgages for collateral. That was done to encourage banks to lend to one another.</p>

Committee has examined Northern Rock over the past six months, producing a report on &#147;The run on the Rock&#148;. Just as importantly, it produced a report a few weeks ago on &#147;Financial Stability and Transparency&#148;, pointing the way forward for the Government and the international community. We said that markets need a clear message about the risks that they are taking. We could see that in the Northern Rock fiasco, its board in particular did not appreciate the risks that it was taking. We are thus asking the Financial Services Authority and the Bank of England to ensure every year that their warnings are heeded, and that they come out with two or three main issues for boards to study. The boards should then report back to the FSA and the Bank of England that they have understood those messages.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o136"><a name="80312-0007.htm_para12"><a name="08031240000297">I can only describe what we have seen in the markets as a bout of collective madness. How much write-down is taking place at the moment? On the Committee&#146;s visit to the United States in December, I was told that we could be talking about $600 billion, but a senior economist at the UBS bank is talking about $1 trillion, and others are coming out with figures of $2 trillion, $3 trillion or $4 trillion. We do not know where we stand at the moment, but there is no doubt that things will get worse. We must remember the globalised background against which events in the United Kingdom are taking place.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o137"><a name="80312-0007.htm_para13"><a name="08031240000298">The reason for that situation is that the low inflation and low interest rate environment of the past decade has encouraged a search for yield, which has resulted in complex and opaque products. The designers of those products often do not understand what they are producing. We had the chairman of an investment bank before the Treasury Committee, and when I asked him what a CDO-squared was, he said that he was not there to explain that. If the designers did not understand them, certainly investors did not.</p>

The agencies are paid by the issuers, which is unacceptable. The Basle II international agreement must be examined, because we need to correct the perverse incentive for companies to meet the capital adequacy requirements by reducing their liquidity. That has to stop. There are both national and international elements to the current situation.</p>

<p><a name="st_o118"><a name="08031240000303"><a name="80312-0007.htm_spnew5"><a name="08031240000818"><b>John McFall:</b>
 The hon. Gentleman is a very good member of the Treasury Committee, so he knows that we have been studying the matter in depth for six months and made reports to the House. I can only quote a wise old central banker from the City who said to me, &#147;John, there have been no casualties in this. Nobody has lost any money, and the system has been stabilised.&#148; The public&#146;s response shows that they share that sentiment. I am not surprised that the Chancellor did not mention Northern Rock, because it has been the focus for six months, and arrangements have been put in place.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o139"><a name="80312-0007.htm_para15"><a name="08031240000304">I wish to cover a number of matters. The first is economic prospects and forecasts. The second is fiscal policy and fiscal sustainability, and the third is child poverty. I was one of the 72 Members who wrote a letter to a national newspaper last week urging the Chancellor to ensure that the child poverty targets were re-established. The fourth is environmental taxation, the fifth is the savings gateway and the last is rogue trading and insider dealing.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o140"><a name="80312-0007.htm_para16"><a name="08031240000305">When considering the economic prospects and forecasts, I am mindful of the globalised, turbulent background. At the time of last year&#146;s pre-Budget report, the Treasury&#146;s forecast was for economic growth of between 2 per cent. and 2.5 per cent. in 2008, and between 2.5 per cent. and 3 per cent. in 2009. That forecast was prepared when the wider economic situation was far from clear. When the Committee reported on the pre-Budget report last November, we cautioned that there remained a risk that the credit crunch would have a greater economic effect than expected. That has been confirmed today by the downgrading of those economic forecasts. We also observed that the Treasury&#146;s optimism that the economy would revert to trend in 2009 was not adequately explained. When the Chancellor and others come before the Committee, we will wish to test whether the new forecasts are realistic.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o141"><a name="80312-0007.htm_para17"><a name="08031240000306">I expect the Committee to focus particularly on three areas of risk. First, the Government have been looking for a growth in exports as part of the rebalancing of the economy. The International Monetary Fund is now forecasting US and eurozone growth of well below 2 per cent. for 2008, with world economic growth as a whole at its slowest rate since 2003. If exports are to grow significantly against that backdrop, exports to growing markets, including China, India and the oil-rich countries, will need to increase.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o142"><a name="80312-0007.htm_para18"><a name="08031240000307">In some of those markets, the UK has not performed as impressively as some of our European competitors. On a visit to India 18 months ago, the Committee was made aware that the links between the UK and India could be developed. We were convinced that the UK&#146;s exports to India could complement what is happening there rather than challenge it. Developments could take place in high technology, and particularly clean coal technology. I would also like to see further developments between the UK and China in that area.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o143"><a name="80312-0007.htm_para19"><a name="08031240000308">Secondly, the Committee will consider the fact that the UK&#146;s growth in recent years has been fuelled by the prosperity of the financial sector. On an international basis, that sector is the main cause of the current slow-down in the world economy. It is bearing some of the costs of its past exuberance. I believe that the British financial sector remains competitive and innovative, but  <br>

it is still to be seen whether its relative contribution to the economy will diminish during the current period of consolidation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o144"><a name="80312-0007.htm_para20"><a name="08031240000309">Thirdly, we will consider the dependence of the British economy on wealth and confidence linked to rising house prices, which is well known. In recent years, Treasury forecasters have prided themselves on defying the doom-mongers who have repeatedly forecast a sharp downward adjustment in house prices. There is a risk that house prices will prove less resilient than the Government expect in the face of the credit crunch. I expect that the Committee will explore that matter, and particularly the Chancellor&#146;s initiatives in the mortgage market, with our witnesses next week.</p>

<p><a name="st_o119"><a name="08031240000310"><a name="80312-0007.htm_spnew6"><a name="08031240000819"><b>Lembit &#214;pik (Montgomeryshire) (LD):</b>
 I am pleased to hear that the Committee will examine that. While doing so, will it examine the related matter of arm&#146;s length management organisations? Is the right hon. Gentleman willing to consider the funding arrangements for ALMOs, which look after a large amount of social housing stock? They are concerned about the limitations on how they can borrow money. Would it be reasonable for the Committee to have a little look at ALMOs when they examine the housing market in general?</p>

 I suggest that the hon. Gentleman do a bit of homework between now and next week and send me a letter, and we will consider the matter in the Committee.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o145"><a name="80312-0007.htm_para21"><a name="08031240000312">I turn to fiscal policy and fiscal sustainability. In several reports during the current Parliament, the Committee has argued that the fiscal rules need to be more forward-looking and less dependent on the dating of the economic cycle. Although the fiscal rules have served the Government and the public finances well in the past decade, the Government and others might have focused too much attention on arithmetical arguments about whether the rules have been met, and insufficient attention on underlying issues of fiscal sustainability.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o146"><a name="80312-0007.htm_para22"><a name="08031240000313">On the golden rule, the most pertinent question to ask ourselves is not about public borrowing over a notional economic cycle but about the current state of the public finances and the prospects for the near future. With regard to public sector debt, it is clear that performance against the sustainable investment rule will be affected by both the public sector control of Northern Rock and the eventual implementation of international financial reporting standards, which will mean almost all private finance initiative projects appearing on the public sector balance sheet. I expect the Committee to consider in detail the impact of that, and how it is reported. In doing so, we must bear in mind the underlying purpose of the fiscal rules: to set parameters for fiscal sustainability. It remains to be seen whether either accounting changes or the public control of Northern Rock represent a threat to that sustainability.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o147"><a name="80312-0007.htm_para23"><a name="08031240000314">On child poverty, I am delighted to note the Chancellor&#146;s initiatives, but we must remember that there are still 2.8 million young people in poverty. One big issue that the Treasury Committee has tackled in recent years is financial inclusion. We have produced four reports on it since November 2006, which have stated the need for people to be included in the banking services and financial network. Those who are excluded from that network are largely socially excluded as well.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o150"><a name="80312-0008.htm_para0"><a name="08031240000323">On environmental taxation, when the Treasury Committee reported on climate change and the Stern review last month, we expressed disappointment that the Government&#146;s commitment to the 1997 statement of intent on environmental taxation had not been maintained. The Treasury has used a different definition of environmental tax from the one used by the Office for National Statistics; the Treasury definition, which excludes energy taxes and taxes on transport, is, in my opinion, too narrow. I do not believe that tax measures are the only, or even the best, way to tackle climate change at national level, but the Treasury cannot continue to hide behind definitions to defend its caution in moving to a position where environmental taxes more accurately reflect the environmental damage associated with certain activities. In that context, I welcome moves to replace air passenger duty with a per-plane duty, as well as the other measures announced.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o151"><a name="80312-0008.htm_para1"><a name="08031240000324">The Chancellor mentioned the savings gateway, on which the Treasury Committee has focused in the past. Indeed, last October we published a report that emphasised the importance of secure short-term savings to the financial well-being of the least well-off. We examined the success of savings gateway pilot projects, where private contributions are matched by Exchequer support. In our report, we stated that the national savings gateway</p>
<a name="80312-0008.htm_brev0"><a name="08031240000656"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;could achieve some of the Government&#146;s aims of promoting saving among low-income groups&#148;</p>

<a name="80312-0008.htm_brev1"><a name="08031240000657"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;genuinely new savers and new saving&#148;.</p>
</ul>

</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o155"><a name="80312-0008.htm_para5"><a name="08031240000328">Such a scheme can certainly have a positive effect on participants&#146; attitudes to saving. Professor Elaine Kempson, who undertook the survey of the first savings gateway pilot project, made the point that matching strongly encouraged people on low incomes to save. I suggest that the Chancellor and others consider going further. The Institute for Public Policy Research has provided estimates of the first-year cost of a national savings gateway scheme. The IPPR assumes eligibility criteria based on those for working tax credit and qualifying benefits for those out of work, and individual contributions averaging &#163;16 per month. On that basis, it estimates that the first-year costs of a scheme taken up by 50 per cent. of the eligible population, with Government matching of 50p for every pound invested, and pound-for- pound matching for the first two months, would be &#163;249 million. In contrast, the Government estimates that individual savings account and personal equity plan savings are supported by &#163;2.1 billion in tax relief each year, and employee tax reliefs for pension contributions have been valued at &#163;5.3 billion. Expenditure of &#163;249 million pales into insignificance next to the support given to ISAs and tax relief on pensions. I welcome the Government&#146;s initiative, but I urge them to go further to encourage more low-income people into the financial network.</p>

repeat here of the Soci&#233;t&#233; G&#233;n&#233;rale incident, or of the Barings scandal involving Nick Leeson in the 1990s. Rogue trading remains a big problem, and I want the Government to support the FSA in its efforts, but I also want them to support the FSA on insider dealing. There is no doubt that insider dealing goes on regularly; I am told that by City executives. However, very little is done to bring people to court or to get to the bottom of such incidents.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o157"><a name="80312-0008.htm_para7"><a name="08031240000330">An important foundation of the City&#146;s reputation is the quality of its markets and the authorities&#146; determination to investigate and prosecute insider dealing. In that context, I endorse the FSA&#146;s view that it should be given powers to confer statutory immunity from prosecution or otherwise encourage people to come forward to give evidence against the criminals who commit insider dealing. The FSA has civil and criminal powers to tackle such market abuse, but sometimes there are real challenges in securing the evidence necessary to prove that the offence has been committed. It is in the nature of the offence that there is seldom a smoking gun. Legislative change to enable the FSA to confer immunity would send a clear message to those who contemplate insider dealing: they should know that the FSA has the fullest range of tools to bring them to justice.</p>

 I welcome my right hon. Friend&#146;s comments, because when I considered that matter 18 months or two years ago, I found that the track record of the Serious Fraud Office and the Financial Services Authority on insider dealing was absolutely shocking&#151;not a handful of cases had they prosecuted. What is needed is not only legislative change, but for those bodies to use the powers that they already have. They should also examine how such powers are used in the United States of America, where the authorities have a very different and far more successful way of proceeding on such charges.</p>

 Exactly. When we compare what happens in the US with what has happened in the City, we see that the UK is a soft touch in that respect. Our record is abysmal. I want the Government to consider that, paying regard to what has been going on in the United States, and the FSA&#146;s desire to ensure that the City&#146;s reputation is cleaner, and is kept clean. They should also give the FSA the powers that other bodies have.</p>

 I know where my hon. Friend is coming from, but the FSA and others have a legitimate point. As I say, people should be aware that others who know about their criminality may turn against them, because we are making no progress at all on the issue. Something needs to be done, and the Government need to consider the issue urgently. I encourage them to ensure that the powers available to other prosecutors are extended to the FSA, and to make progress with the work of considering in which cases a plea-bargaining, or plea-discussion, framework would be of benefit to all prosecutors, including the FSA.</p>

We do not need any fancy initiatives; we need to hunker down to get through the next 12 months. I am delighted, in an economic sense, that the Government are doing that while paying due regard to social obligations such as the need to tackle child poverty and the problems that people are experiencing with fuel. I welcome the Government&#146;s initiatives, and I look forward to the Chancellor and his colleagues appearing before the Treasury Committee in the next seven days or so.</p>

 My impression of the Budget is overwhelmingly one of boredom. It was illuminating to look around the Chamber and see the number of people who were nodding off. It was predicted that it would be a boring Budget, and it most certainly was. It will probably be remembered as the carrier bag Budget, rather than as any other kind of Budget. If that is to be the Chancellor&#146;s main claim to fame, I suspect that he will not be in his job for very long.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o159"><a name="80312-0008.htm_para9"><a name="08031240000339">It was striking that in the midst of the anodyne messages that the Chancellor poured out in order to send us all to sleep there was little reference to Northern Rock and the issues that it has created for the British economy, and little reference to the problem that the world economy faces. I sincerely hope that we are not facing the sort of economic downturn that I remember from 1974, when the stock market fell to some 120 points, which seems unbelievable in this day and age. It may seem odd for a Conservative to quote JK Galbraith, but a close analysis of his book on the great crash of 1929 shows the similarities between the situation that the world economy is facing, and the factors that contributed so greatly to the world crash in &#146;29. That crash was based on pyramid selling of investment trusts, and we now face the prospect of pyramid selling of derivatives in an attempt to defy risk, but of course when one attempts to defy risk, it is spread more widely.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o160"><a name="80312-0008.htm_para10"><a name="08031240000340">When risk finally comes into the equation&#151;as it inevitably does, because nothing is risk free&#151;the potential for collapse is much more calamitous. We are on the cusp of witnessing such a collapse as the various derivatives that have been developed in the past few years unwind through the system. My understanding is that banks across the world have lost 10 per cent. of their capital base. It is an indication of the severity of the problem that the central banks have fed so much money into the system, just a few months after they last did so. The expectation is that for some weeks, or perhaps months, there may be some loosening in the international credit  <br>

market, but as the underlying problems are severe, and as unwinding has not yet been completed, we are seeing the same situation being created for a third time in a year. If we prop up a market that is in denial about risk, those concerned will not learn their lesson, and the same pattern of behaviour will be repeated. However, if they are allowed to confront their actions and take responsibility for them, we will see the sort of scenario that we saw in 1929. I should say that I did not see what happened in 1929; I read about it. However, I did witness the crunch in 1974, and that was fingertip.</p>

 I thank the hon. Lady very much for the history lesson about 1929 and Galbraith&#146;s treatise on the subject. Would she say that there will be a market correction in the near future, or will we have to adopt far more Galbraithian responses to the current crisis?</p>

 Regarding 1929, I am reminded of the remarks of Judge Pecora, who undertook the commission of inquiry.

 I think that I have already said that that is the potential problem that we face. As a Scot, I have to say that the investment trust vehicle that caused so much of the &#146;29 problem was of course invented in Scotland, but there it was managed by, dare I say it, dour Scots. It was transported to the States and was then leveraged; that was the problem. That is precisely what has happened with the risks that have been leveraged into various derivatives. I have real concerns that if the central banks keep pumping money into the market, we will not unwind the derivatives, and this generation of financiers will not learn the lesson of risk.</p>

Year after year, the Prime Minister, when he was Chancellor, would say, &#147;I have abolished boom and bust.&#148; We are potentially about to have another bust. We are certainly on a downturn. That causes me more concern than anything else. It is my overriding concern about the Budget, because no preparations are being made to deal with the worst-case scenario.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o162"><a name="80312-0008.htm_para12"><a name="08031240000346">The Treasury is in denial. It has to be in denial; it has no money. Where the &#163;10 billion from the Bank of England has come from, I can only guess. Is it printing money? If so, we have inflation. Is it borrowing it from the Arab states, which are raising so much money as a result of petrol prices? If so, the money has to be paid back. At some point, the latitude that we allow ourselves with regard to money will catch up with us. I have serious concerns about the fact that no preparations are being made in the Treasury to deal with the situation; the Budget tinkers round the edges.</p>

The Chancellor announced last year that all widows would benefit from changes in inheritance tax. There is one very small group that is possibly the hardest hit&#151;those whose husbands died before 1972. The people in that group are now very elderly; one such constituent is 106 and her husband died 40 years ago. The inheritance tax changes do not apply to that group of widows. I am sure that that is an oversight&#151;at least, I would like to think so. I would hate to think that that group of very elderly widows was deliberately missed out. The money involved cannot be enormous. I hope that by the end of the Budget debate, perhaps tucked away somewhere in the Finance Bill, there will be a proposal from which every person who is liable for inheritance tax could benefit.</p>

My question, to which I did not receive an answer, was about the extent to which we should be concerned about our trade deficit. Our balance of trade in goods and services has been negative for many years. We are net exporters of services; the balance of trade in services reached &#163;36 billion in 2007. However, the increase in the negative balance of trade in goods has been even faster; it reached &#163;87 billion last year.</p>

In the past five years, that deficit has increased from more than &#163;30 billion in 2002 to more than &#163;50 billion last year. I see the Exchequer Secretary on the Treasury Bench; I hope that at some point a Treasury Minister will say a few words about the significance of the trade balance in the modern world.

<p><a name="stpa_o182"><a name="80312-0009.htm_para8"><a name="08031240000378">However, I particularly want to focus on the environment, to which a number of hon. Members, including my right hon. Friend the Member for West Dunbartonshire (John McFall), have referred. I am thinking in particular of the need to put in place measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Some years ago, the Government made a start on using the tax system to make our behaviour on these islands more environmentally friendly. The climate change levy was introduced in 2001 and the aggregates levy was introduced in 2002. Vehicle excise duty was restructured to reflect, for the first time, the environmental damage done by different makes of car. Alongside other environmental actions by the Government, those changes made for a promising start. Office for National Statistics figures show that the proportion of tax revenues raised from environmental taxes saw a modest rise&#151;from 9.4 per cent. in 1997 to 9.7 per cent. in 1999.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o183"><a name="80312-0009.htm_para9"><a name="08031240000379">However, as the Environmental Audit Committee brought out in its recent report, that was followed by a series of cuts and freezes in key environmental taxes. As a consequence, green taxes as a proportion of all tax revenue fell below 1997 levels&#151;to 7.3 per cent. in 2006.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o184"><a name="80312-0009.htm_para10"><a name="08031240000380">The Government should take credit for our being on track to meet the Kyoto targets, but we must also look at current trends and where they will take us. The Exchequer Secretary will be aware that the trajectory of UK greenhouse gas emissions is not as it should be. Our emissions have been on a plateau, with only the faintest trace of a decline between 2002 and 2006, the latest year for which figures are available. If the UK is going to do its bit to prevent catastrophic climate change, we will have to take far stronger action than we are taking now. The taxation system has an important part to play. I welcome some of the things that the Chancellor announced in that context, but I suspect that we will have to go further still.</p>

 Does the right hon. Gentleman agree that any &#147;green taxes&#148; should be revenue-neutral?

 I hear what the hon. Gentleman says. If the tax is put on, it will have an effect, whatever happens. However, the hon. Gentleman&#146;s point is valid.

proposes that air passenger duty become a charge per flight rather than a charge per passenger. In its recent report, the Environmental Audit Committee concluded that that will incentivise airlines to fill their flights. The Committee believes that short haul charges must reflect relatively high emissions and the fact that alternative means of travel are available. The Committee also recommends that the Government consider the introduction of an extra band to cover very long haul flights. I welcome my right hon. Friend&#146;s acknowledgement that he will not only maintain his policy on this tax but expect to secure a very substantial rise in air passenger duty in subsequent years.</p>

Friend the Member for West Dunbartonshire and others. Electricity generation is the UK&#146;s largest single producer of carbon dioxide emissions. Traditionally, our coal-powered stations have been the highest emitters of carbon dioxide, and the move away from coal to gas in electricity generation played a large part in our being on track to meet our Kyoto target. However, coal is still the source of about a third of our electricity, and the House will be aware that new coal plant is planned.</p>

With the 2005 pre-Budget report, the Government launched a consultation and a competition for a full-scale demonstration plant, and with the 2007 pre-Budget report came details of the competition and the news that it would apply only to a post-combustion coal plant. That competition is welcome.</p>

The response to the potential of CCS should be on a larger scale and of greater urgency. In this context, I should mention last year&#146;s regrettable decision by BP to abandon its planned CCS project at Peterhead.</p>

That support could be financial, through mechanisms such as feed-in tariffs. It could also come in a regulatory form. The regulations could apply to plants that had been in operation for some years and that, it is to be hoped, should be able to retro-fit if the technology becomes available. In addition, we need to ensure that the new power stations are built with CCS in place, if the technology is sufficiently advanced, or, if it is not, that they are built ready for CCS to be fitted as soon as that technology becomes available.</p>

However, my postbag is still heavy with correspondence from people who have problems with tax credits. Those people will still face an uphill struggle to ensure that they get that money, and when they review it against the rising costs of the basics in their living standards, they may well find that it is a case of giving with one hand and taking with the other. Those who are lucky enough to see themselves on a rising trend of income will immediately discover that fiscal drag is an issue that has not been addressed in this Budget. Many lower-paid workers will come into the tax bracket before they should, while those who are a little further up the income scale will find themselves paying the higher rate of tax when they might have hoped for some salvation from that. Fiscal drag is again being used by the Treasury to maintain income going into its coffers. The elderly, whom the right hon.

 The right hon. Gentleman referred to the fact that the picture is not so good, and to fiscal drag on tax bands. However, on page 113 of the Red Book there is an increase in the personal allowance for those under 65 of about 4 per cent. The starting point for the higher rate of tax has also gone up by about 4 per cent. That does not sound like fiscal drag to me.</p>

<p><a name="st_o162"><a name="08031240000405"><a name="80312-0009.htm_spnew15"><a name="08031240000862"><b>Mr. Jack:</b>
 It may not, but I suggest that the hon. Gentleman, who I know takes a keen interest in these matters, looks again. He will find that the allowance for under-65s has gone up by a total of 210 allowable pounds, which represents about &#163;45, which is roughly speaking a reduction in tax of &#163;1 a week. Set against the cost of living increase that I mentioned earlier, people will not find that a particularly pleasant situation. I hope that the hon. Gentleman has not confused the amount of tax paid with the number of people paying tax, which is what the concept of fiscal drag is meant to address.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o197"><a name="80312-0009.htm_para23"><a name="08031240000406">While on the state of public finances, the other thing that intrigues me is that if we consider the next financial year, the Red Book last year had a projected borrowing level of &#163;30 billion, but one year later, that figure has now risen to &#163;43 billion&#151;an increase of &#163;13 billion. If we consider receipts, we find that they are forecast to rise by &#163;22 billion on last year&#146;s Budget. We therefore have rising receipts, bearing out what my right hon. Friend the Member for Witney (Mr. Cameron) said from the Dispatch Box: a rising trend in the payment of taxation and a rising trend in the level of Government borrowing. That illustrates keenly the difficult situation that the Treasury finds itself in, hence the overall gloomy tone of the Chancellor&#146;s remarks. He does not have any fiscal room for manoeuvre.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o198"><a name="80312-0009.htm_para24"><a name="08031240000407">I turn to three specific areas, the first of which is monetary policy. I am still concerned about the structure of the British economy. In my remarks on the Budget speech last year, I conjectured as to why, of all the western economies, the UK needed higher interest rates to achieve a similar performance with regard to inflation&#151;a target of 2 per cent. I query whether we need a national debate, if I may put it that way, on monetary policy. The drivers for inflation are matters that affect people&#146;s consumption at the moment&#151;the cost of food, fuel and energy. Most people have a choice: they can spend on the basics, but their discretionary spending diminishes. We have witnessed that already in the reduction in retail expenditure.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o199"><a name="80312-0009.htm_para25"><a name="08031240000408">We have a zero-sum game, where money is going round, but is being spent on basics, rather than being part of discretionary spend. In recent times, the response of our monetary policy in trying to keep global inflation down has been to raise interest rates, or marginally to lower them with a potential depressive effect on the economy&#146;s ability to sustain employment and investment. I mention that because, to me, the most difficult element of the inflationary equation is whether people seek to address inflationary pressures through inflationary pay demands. In the public sector, the Government have already put a cap of 2 per cent. on what they are prepared to have as the norm. I suspect that the figure is between 2.5 per cent. and 4 per cent. in the private sector. I have not heard much from the Monetary Policy Committee or the Treasury about whether there needs to be a revised view of what constitutes inflation in the 21st century.</p>

 I find myself in the paradoxical and unusual position of agreeing with the right hon. Gentleman. Does he agree that if the Bank of England had the double-header rubric, like the Fed, to keep inflation down and to maximise employment, it would make for better and more flexible policy?</p>

<p><a name="st_o164"><a name="08031240000410"><a name="80312-0010.htm_spnew1"><a name="08031240000864"><b>Mr. Jack:</b>
 It is a pleasure to agree with the hon. Gentleman. I seem to recall that section 11 of the Bank of England Act 1998 defines clearly what the Bank&#146;s Monetary Policy Committee is all about; it is achieving the target that the Chancellor set. It is interesting that the previous Chancellor reset the inflation target from 2.5 per cent. to 2 per cent., just as we ran into the first serious series of commodity price rises that we had experienced for a long period of time. It is interesting to speculate as to whether we conspired to have a more difficult monetary situation simply by decreasing the target for inflation by a half of 1 per cent.</p>

<p><a name="st_o165"><a name="08031240000411"><a name="80312-0010.htm_spnew2"><a name="08031240000865"><b>Mr. Purchase:</b>
 I have a slightly different point from that of my hon. Friend the Member for Great Grimsby (Mr. Mitchell) on monetary policy and the use of interest rates to calm inflation. Is it not the case that the measures announced by the Chancellor on longer-term mortgages will assist monetary policy by taking some pressure off the Bank of England when it sets interest rates, while recognising that a different market will come about with the longer-term interest rates announced today?</p>

<p><a name="st_o166"><a name="08031240000412"><a name="80312-0010.htm_spnew3"><a name="08031240000866"><b>Mr. Jack:</b>
 The hon. Gentleman raises an interesting point, but longer-term mortgages relate to the stabilisation of people&#146;s personal finances, not the heart of the inflationary issue. Current inflation is being driven not by wage demands, although they may come, but by commodity prices and the world economic situation. With respect to the hon. Gentleman&#146;s point, long-term mortgages are a response but not a solution to those overall inflationary factors. I say to the Treasury that the time is right to have a discussion and analysis of the current nature of inflation because our response is still geared to previous inflationary cycles in the economy.</p>

 I am interested to hear my right hon. Friend&#146;s remarks. Conversely, is it not the case that during the last couple of months, the Bank of England has decided to reduce interest rates at a time when it was clear that there were significant inflationary pressures? Does that not show a little more flexibility in its response than he suggests?</p>

 Sadly, the hon. Member for Great Grimsby (Mr. Mitchell) is no longer in his place, but my hon. Friend&#146;s point goes back to the fact that we look to the Monetary Policy Committee to drive not only the fight against inflation, but the level of activity in the economy. Inevitably, the two are linked, but commentators ascribe to the Monetary Policy Committee the ability to influence all kinds of economic factors by virtue of its attempt to focus on the achievement of the inflation target. Although I acknowledge my hon. Friend&#146;s point, he does not go to the heart of what is driving our present inflationary situation. I would welcome a debate on whether we have the right mechanism. Broadening the scope of the Monetary Policy Committee may be right&#151;I do not want to come  <br>

to a conclusion on that matter without considering it carefully&#151;but the time is right for a reappraisal of what drives UK monetary policy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o200"><a name="80312-0010.htm_para0"><a name="08031240000415">The second area that I want to consider is that of sub-prime lending. Such lending grew in the United States in a situation where there was a lot of cheap money and people were looking for opportunities to deploy it. They suddenly alighted on the opportunity to allow mortgages to many people who probably should not have had one. The net result was that the American economy turned down and people defaulted on their mortgages&#151;we saw what happened next. I carried out a little exercise to examine the corporate social responsibility reports of some of the banks in America that have suffered the most, in order to see what they said about their responsibility to wider society. Why did I do that? One of the clear trends in provision for, for example, old age, investment and paying mortgages is the weight that we now have to place on private sector investment vehicles. People&#146;s security and future well-being depend on the integrity of the products that the financial system now delivers. Events in the sub-prime market have shaken people&#146;s faith in those financial vehicles&#146; ability to deliver long-term future funding.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o201"><a name="80312-0010.htm_para1"><a name="08031240000416">It is therefore interesting to read some of the American banks&#146; corporate social responsibility reports. Citibank, which lost $18.1 billion, states in its corporate social responsibility report on its website:</p>
<a name="80312-0010.htm_brev0"><a name="08031240000660"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;From affordable housing to sustainable economic development to financial education, our network of employees and resources provides many meaningful opportunities to serve our communities to really make a difference.&#148;</p>

It has contributed to shaking the foundation of western capitalism. We are now considering the instability of the banking system. Central banks are pumping in hundreds of billions of dollars to stabilise the system when so much depends on its stability.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o203"><a name="80312-0010.htm_para3"><a name="08031240000418">Merrill Lynch, which lost $14.1 billion, wrote under the heading &#147;Integrity&#148; on its website:</p>
<a name="80312-0010.htm_brev1"><a name="08031240000661"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;No one&#146;s personal bottom line is more important than the reputation of our company.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o204"><a name="80312-0010.htm_para4"><a name="08031240000419">What, in the psyche of those banks, got them into a position whereby they put at risk not only their products but the statement of their public position and intent? I know from what the Chancellor said that a great deal is happening in international banking&#151;through the World Bank, the IMF and so on&#151;but if there is one issue with which it must deal, it is the integrity of those banks&#146; actions. They should be forced to re-examine their commercial policies, which put at risk the very security of the millions of people whom we represent.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o205"><a name="80312-0010.htm_para5"><a name="08031240000420">A recent edition of <i> The Economist </i>conducted some analysis of how good some of the experts are who run the funds that have been so badly affected by sub-prime lending. It concluded that the costs of the so-called professional management of our money were high and the returns were not much better than they would be if people simply followed the general indices of stocks and shares. It pointed out that, in Sweden, which privatised much of its future pension provision, many people invested in a fund that had grown by 534 per cent. in the five years preceding the change in Swedish policy, only to lose 70 per cent. of its value in the next three years. People were so frightened by that that inertia set in and they did not know what to do.</p>

 The Government had to take action on Northern Rock because many innocent individuals were caught up in something that was not of their making.

 I agree because no investment can be risk-free. However, on the cost of investment, the Government tried the stakeholder pension&#151;their only venture into that territory. Perhaps if the Financial Services Authority, the Bank of England, the Government and bankers came together to re-examine the matter, a fundamental rethink might occur of the cost of investing, the risk:reward ratio and the corporate social responsibility provisions to which many of the institutions subscribe, but which have been threatened by sub-prime.</p>

I find it intriguing that the former Chancellor said, when he first came to power, that the taper tax system had to be introduced because it would help capital accumulation in the economy. The current Chancellor has not explained why moving to a flat rate of capital gains tax is now better. I suppose that the only thing that is better is the &#163;700 million in the Treasury&#146;s coffers. However, a little more plain speaking would be nice to explain what has changed in the fundamental operation of capital gains tax.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o210"><a name="80312-0010.htm_para10"><a name="08031240000429">It is disappointing that the Chancellor has not tried to simplify inheritance tax. I suggested in my Budget speech last year that we could have a low single marginal rate of inheritance tax if we did away with the panoply of allowances, many of which are accessible  <br>

only if one can afford the professional fees for the advice about how to use them. Again, that suggestion was ignored, and we retain an incredibly complicated, old-fashioned tax, which needs modification.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o211"><a name="80312-0010.htm_para11"><a name="08031240000430">I stress to Treasury Ministers, especially the Financial Secretary, who is in her place, that I hope that, as the tax law rewrite project, with which I have been associated since its inception, nears the end of its major change to the clarity of tax law, the Treasury will not shy away from reacting to the enormous amount of work on improving the operation of the tax system. That is different from rewriting the law in a legible and understandable way. If the Treasury is to take with it the support of the accounting profession and others in the financial community to make Britain&#146;s tax laws work properly, the Financial Secretary needs to expand and change the tax law rewrite committee&#146;s remit to consider more carefully modifying and improving the efficiency of the tax system.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o212"><a name="80312-0010.htm_para12"><a name="08031240000431">With respect to the Chancellor, changing the way in which small and medium-sized enterprises access the tax system and report their financial transactions is not the same as making the whole system work better and simplifying it. The word &#147;simple&#148; is often used but it is difficult to achieve. However, many lessons have been learned through the rewrite exercise and they need to be examined.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o213"><a name="80312-0010.htm_para13"><a name="08031240000432">Let me consider green taxes. The Select Committee on Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, which I chair, suggested trying to encourage local investment in decentralised energy systems. We suggested to the Chancellor the introduction of a green ISA&#151;a unique instrument for investing in green technology or local, decentralised low-carbon schemes. Sadly, that did not figure in the Chancellor&#146;s speech this year. However, there are some remarkable examples in Germany of small communities with local networks of investors, which have now got combined heat and power schemes, which would be the envy of many communities in this country.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o214"><a name="80312-0010.htm_para14"><a name="08031240000433">Sadly, there was no mention of a buy-in tariff to encourage more decentralised electricity generation or help to deal with emissions from the heat sector. We all talk about electricity and transport, but heat accounts for one third of emissions in this country, yet is the one area where revolution and change are under-encouraged.</p>

However, does he agree that the Government ought to be doing more to support small and medium-sized businesses in particular, by holding more exhibitions and trade missions abroad and by giving those businesses more assistance to participate in them?</p>

 The hon. Gentleman shares my views on such matters. Of course I agree with that, but it is worth reflecting on the fact that although we have some seriously good manufacturers&#151;world champions in many respects&#151;we have an enormous tale of underperforming small and medium-sized businesses, which tend to cause a drag on the entire system. The measures announced today to encourage small and medium-sized businesses are helpful&#151;probably not sufficient, but the direction is helpful.

In that sense, I readily concede that the Government whom I support have been taking measures to help small companies.</p>

We now have perhaps the most favourable exchange rates for manufacturing that we have seen in a considerable time. We have seen a fall in the pound against the euro of 12 or 13 per cent. since last summer, which is extremely helpful to our exporters. We have also seen a growth in the strength of the pound against the dollar, which is helpful in so far as many of the raw materials that we import come from outside the euro area, from the dollar areas. We then sell our manufactured goods into the euro area. That provides an ideal opportunity for the Government to redouble their efforts to give more encouragement to exporters to take advantage of these circumstances, which could last for another 12 months or just until tomorrow&#151;who knows? We just do not know, but we must recognise that we have that advantage.</p>

We share a common interest in the success of the auto industry, not least because, although manufacturing employment in the west midlands has fallen from about 92,000 people 10 years ago to about 71,000 now, our region still massively outdoes any other region in auto industry employment. Our auto industry&#146;s exports in 2006 were almost double what they were in 2005, but imports of autos have risen even faster. We now have a trade imbalance of &#163;6 billion- plus, compared with only &#163;3 billion in 1995.</p>

A proper review of the needs of UKTI must take place without delay, so that it can fund the trade missions that make such a difference, especially to small and medium-sized companies.

I fear that in a period of economic difficulty focused on the financial services sector we will have greater difficulties than some countries that rely less on that sector than we do.

and I was Economic Secretary before that&#151;that when we drew up Budgets, officials would sometimes say, &#147;You&#146;ve got to include that measure. It might be boring, but it&#146;s important. It raises revenue.&#148; Invariably, we would say yes. There was a presumption that anything important or significant had to be included and explained and the cost made apparent. The tendency in recent years has been to do exactly the reverse and say that anything important, anything that will be painful or anything that imposes burdens of taxation on people will be hidden in the small print of some press release and barely mentioned in the speech.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o235"><a name="80312-0011.htm_para13"><a name="08031240000470">We had the extraordinary experience of the Chancellor giving a Budget speech shortly after taking &#163;100 billion of additional liabilities on to our balance sheet without mentioning that he had nationalised a dodgy bank or that he had included the extra loans on the nation&#146;s balance sheet. I find that disgraceful. It is not treating the House or the nation fairly. I understood that the Office for National Statistics had said that that would be on the balance sheet. The figures should be included in the nation&#146;s assets. The fact that the provision does not come in until the first day of the new financial year is not an excuse for not including it in today&#146;s Budget.</p>

It is a one-year increase. Will it disappear next year? If it will, that is fair enough, because no money has been set aside for it. However, if the Chancellor is giving the impression that it will be extended this year, no money has been set aside and there is some dodgy financing going on there, too.</p>

The Chancellor did not mention it, let alone point out its impact on those people&#146;s standard of living. He also failed to remind us, of course, that it was introduced in an attempt to create the impression that he was cutting the basic rate of income tax by using the money in his last Budget to announce a 10 per cent. basic rate cut while eliminating the 10 per cent. rate so that most people actually end up paying more.</p>

I think that that was just a slip of the tongue; I make no complaint about it, as we all make such mistakes and I am guilty of them from time to time. What the Chancellor did not mention, however, was that the corporation tax rate for small companies is going up as of the beginning of this financial year. That matters to millions of small companies, which are, above all, the job and wealth creators of the future&#151;and hopefully the big companies of the future.

It appeared to me that the Chancellor was backing off in his proposals and reverting more to those made by my hon. Friend the Member for Tatton (Mr. Osborne), the shadow Chancellor, to pay a flat &#163;25,000. Of course, the Chancellor charges more&#151;unsurprisingly, as Labour always charges more&#151;but once the non-doms have paid, no further inquiries are made about their foreign revenues.</p>

The idea that this is just a brouhaha is not the case; people are physically upping sticks and moving, and we are losing not just the &#163;25,000 or &#163;30,000 that they might pay, but the hundreds of thousands in tax revenues that they are paying on their incomes in this country, generated in this country, and, of course, the prospect of moneys being returned from abroad to this country&#151;not to mention the contribution they make to arts and charities.</p>

The Chancellor then went much further by saying that in addition to paying the flat fee, investigations would be made into foreign trusts and related financial matters. As I was saying, the non-doms were not prepared to tolerate that, hence the outflow from this country.</p>

I very much hope that he has and that he has adopted the shadow Chancellor&#146;s more sensible proposal, as a result of which some of those who have moved to Zurich may think again. The press release says that the Chancellor is not going to charge for people&#146;s children. It has always struck me as an extraordinary idea that one should have to pay &#163;30,000 a child, although &#163;35,000 is still going to be payable for a wife.

That is the safe thing to do, because one cannot be found out, but one can claim to have forecast what has just happened.</p>

One of the advantages of having reached my stage in life but having, before arriving in the House, had a career in the real world is that I observed what happened in the 1960s and 1970s, and I have a sense of d&#233;j  vu. Then as now, America was fighting an unpopular war. Then as now, it was financing its unpopular war without raising taxes. Then as now, that produced a huge deficit in the American Budget. Then as now, that Budget deficit produced a corresponding deficit in the balance of payments and a big outflow of dollars across the world, which was absorbed in the foreign exchange reserves&#151;then those of Germany and Japan, now those of China and other countries.</p>

We seemed to have the best of all possible worlds, much as we have had for the last decade or more in the western world. But, then as now, the outflow of dollars began to drive up commodity and oil prices. We are in roughly that position at the moment. We know what happened next then: for a while the rising commodity prices seemed to be absorbed by, for instance, the squeezing of margins of companies and a burst of productivity increases, but after a while  <br>

When Governments tried to slow that inflation by putting on the brakes, they were landed with stagnation with no reduction in inflation. Stagflation was the phenomenon of the future.</p>

But they have been adding burdens to businesses and companies, regulating and collectivising, which means that we will be a bit less flexible than we might have been and a bit less well placed to deal with the possible dangers of coming years.</p>

It has been suggested that the crunch has been caused by a lemming-like move by banks and other financial institutions to invest in high-risk and imprudent investments. However, banks and financial institutions&#151;some of them, at least&#151;have always been prone to being imprudent. Some have always made bad investments, but those bad investments do not normally provoke a credit crunch. So what is different this time? It is a moot point whether imprudent investments, which have undoubtedly been made, have caused the crunch or whether the crunch revealed the imprudence. I drew an analogy in a recent debate: when the tide goes out, we see who was swimming naked, but the fact that some people forgot to wear their bathing trunks did not cause the tide to go out. Likewise, when the tide of credit ebbs, we discover who was making imprudent investments, but those imprudent investments might not have been what caused the credit crunch.</p>

I suggest the answer is that interest rates have compelled or encouraged them to do so. We have been through a period of low interest rates in real terms. That is to do with the supply of savings relative to the available investment opportunities. The supply of savings comes above all from China, but it transfers itself across the world economy, and in order to bring about a balance between borrowing and lending and saving and investing, interest rates had to be held lower. That meant that people had to invest a large sum of money in lower yielding assets because there were not enough higher yielding assets&#151;in less secure assets because there were not enough highly secure assets. They did so because that was all that was open to them&#151;not because they suddenly became  <br>

If they had not done so, we would not have had a balance between supply and demand in savings and investment, and we would then have been in the classic situation of a Keynesian credit slump.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o255"><a name="80312-0012.htm_para7"><a name="08031240000501">Suddenly, the banks are now holding off from investing. Instead of everyone praising them, saying, &#147;Oh, good, they are being prudent; how wonderful,&#148; the central banks of the world are saying, &#147;For God&#146;s sake, resume lending. We will flood the banking markets of the world with money&#151;cheap, easy, readily available, often secured against rather dodgy assets&#151;because we want you to start lending again.&#148;</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o256"><a name="80312-0012.htm_para8"><a name="08031240000502">The problem has been aggravated by the fact that the banks thought they had security by lending against collateral. They took as collateral solid bricks and mortar: property. The banks and financial institutions of the world&#151;including Northern Rock&#151;invest in mortgages secured against physical assets. The trouble is that the value of physical assets is a financial issue, not a matter of physical bricks and mortar. For a while it all seemed wonderful. They took property as collateral. That encouraged more investment in property. That drove up the price of property. That seemed to validate their decision to take property as collateral. It was all hunky-dory until there was a feeling that the money created by that lending was flowing into other markets and inflation was beginning to rise. The central banks across the world began to raise interest rates again to choke off the prospect of inflation. Their doing so initially choked off inflation in the housing market in America&#151;it is beginning to do the same in the UK. Suddenly, the collateral was worth a lot less; there have been sharp falls in property prices in America. The property bubble burst, and that had a synchronised effect. It was not the random effect whereby someone dealing with different businesses in different markets will find that some experience problems while others do well. Because the banking system as a whole was relying on property as its collateral, the banking system as a whole found itself in difficulty.</p>

They are dealing with a difficult problem and there is no guarantee that they will succeed&#151;I think Keynes described it as like pushing on a string&#151;but I hope that with enough cheap money they will. The difficulty lies in whether they can restart things without going to the other extreme and triggering greater inflation next time round.</p>

 Conservative Members have spoken about the burden of taxation&#151;that is how they regard it&#151;but I regard taxation as the price that society pays for civilisation. Taxation is the Government&#146;s key instrument for delivering social justice. Taxation is not only certain in life, but necessary. It is needed to bring about the equality upon which any cohesive society must be based. On that view, equality does not undermine liberty&#151;it undergirds it. I therefore look to the Budget to use fiscal policy to redistribute wealth and create social cohesion. The Chancellor&#146;s proposals to take a further 250,000 children out of poverty do that, and I welcome them. I also welcome the rise in the winter fuel allowances for the elderly for the same reason.</p>

When that liquidity dried up, it was no longer possible to bring in more debt at the bottom of the pyramid, and the turning point in the market was reached. But liquidity is not an answer on its own. It is capable only of masking a bad business model for a time, not of curing it. The sub-prime market was a bad business model, for the reasons that hon. Members have outlined.

<p><a name="stpa_o262"><a name="80312-0012.htm_para14"><a name="08031240000512">UK utility regulators have trusted in credit ratings. Their use of ratings was always a misuse, but now it flies in the face of increasing evidence that they can be dangerously wrong. Northern Rock, of course, is a prime example of that. Regulators have allowed increasing debt at a time when the impact of global warming is causing severe financial shocks to utility companies. The regulators&#146; reliance on credit ratings now looks dangerous and out of date. The UK&#146;s economic regulators have a legal duty to secure licence holders&#146; ability to finance their activities. That duty has been viewed as a need to check, inter alia, that companies are not over-leveraged, which regulators have achieved by requiring a combination of investment-grade credit ratings and a secure ring fence around the regulated legal entities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o263"><a name="80312-0012.htm_para15"><a name="08031240000513">Two major problems with that approach have emerged: the first is with the credibility of credit ratings and the second is with the stability that the ring fence can create. Rating agencies have made a series of systematic errors in many of the world&#146;s major industry groupings. The list of those affected in this decade alone is staggering: in power and energy, it included the independent power producer sector from 2001 to 2004; in telecoms and media, it has included major telecoms companies such as WorldCom. It has also included financial institutions such as Northern Rock, and of course property, with the US sub-prime sector.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o264"><a name="80312-0012.htm_para16"><a name="08031240000514">It is also at least arguable that the regulators are abusing credit ratings. The rating agency Fitch Ratings defines a BBB rating as indicating that</p>
<a name="80312-0012.htm_brev1"><a name="08031240000665"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;there are currently expectations of low credit risk.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o265"><a name="80312-0012.htm_para17"><a name="08031240000515">Note the use of the word &#147;currently&#148;. The rating agencies clearly use a probabilistic approach and state that ratings are not immutable, whereas the leveraged financing structures allowed by regulators may stand for 25 years. The credit rating downgrade of some monoline insurers who guarantee junior debt in many securitisations highlights the degree of systematic change possible, even in a relatively short time frame.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o266"><a name="80312-0012.htm_para18"><a name="08031240000516">There has been a strong and coherent argument supporting leveraged financing structures in utilities: high leverage focuses management attention on delivering tight budgets and reduces the cost of capital, thereby allowing lower tariffs. The corollary to that is that it may also reduce flexibility, and we need to heed that warning. Decision making by utilities dealing with the crisis should not involve seeking permission from creditors to spend money. Given typical restrictions in leveraged finance agreements, circumstances in which that is exactly what would be required are perfectly plausible.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o267"><a name="80312-0012.htm_para19"><a name="08031240000517">Last summer saw widespread and devastating floods across many parts of the UK affecting all types of infrastructure, including utilities. Fortunately, the utilities affected, such as Severn Trent Water and Central Networks in the midlands and CE Electric in the north-east, are owned by well capitalised holding companies. Severn Trent Water alone reported costs of between &#163;25 million and &#163;35 million to respond to the floods. It is increasingly important that utility companies are able to withstand a financial shock. Global warming is causing freak weather, and the financial flexibility required by utilities has to be increased if they are to be able to respond immediately and effectively to the type of incidents that we have seen in this country.</p>

A cash lock-up can be imposed, but if a company has no cash at the time it will still not have immediate access to funds, and special administration is not straightforward. An administrator&#146;s duties in some areas conflict with those of a regulator: an administrator is appointed by a court and has a duty to a company&#146;s creditors, whereas regulators have duties regarding customers, such as the economic delivery of services and, of course, the security of supply.</p>

The increasingly prevalent model of leveraged finance&#151;both Norweb and Southern Water were subjects of leveraged acquisition at the end of last year&#151;covers a range of water, electricity and gas companies. There is now sufficient evidence that credit ratings are not a suitable method for regulators to discharge their duty to ensure that companies can finance their licensed activities to justify a move to a more bespoke approach. High debt levels have helped to keep tariffs low, but low tariffs are not more important than keeping the lights on and the water flowing. I hope that we will apply the lessons learned from the events in the sub-prime market and our experience of Northern Rock to a wider range of service sectors in this country. If we do not, similar problems could arise in future.</p>

At the time, I ran a company of general average adjusters in the City, and I well remember the concern that that suggestion caused in the shipping world and the financial services sector. I took a delegation to meet my good friend Paul Boateng, now our high commissioner in South Africa but at that time our shadow Minister with responsibility for banking and finance, to point out that the potential loss to the economy was greater than the potential gain. I am glad to say that he and the shadow Chancellor drew back from the suggestion.</p>

The point of taxing non-doms must be that more revenue will be gained than will be lost from the off-putting effect of the revenue-raising measure. It has not been shown that that will happen as a result of the moves made in the pre-Budget review. I am extremely pleased that the Chancellor appears to have backed off from a number of suggestions that would have been quite wrong and improper, and that would have violated the maximin principle. They would have actually caused a net loss to the Treasury overall.</p>

All those in the City working for big American or overseas banks face a contraction, too. There is already a flight&#151;an exodus&#151;and it is due not to anything that the Chancellor proposed in the pre-Budget report, or anything that he is proposing now, but to that contraction in the market, which is the result of what has been going on in the sub-prime and other sectors in the United States.</p>

Because of that, the fiscal neutrality such as that urged by the hon. Member for Ribble Valley (Mr. Evans) is not always a salient point and is not necessarily just. If additional revenues are raised from rich polluters, they can be redistributed to poorer citizens who have been forced to change their behaviour.

It is more a compromise between inflationary pressures and the need to raise additional revenue. We should consider more innovative environmental fiscal policies. The UK Government should take a lead in stimulating markets for environmental services that are not the subject of mandatory regulation. We should use the tax system to create financial incentives for businesses to invest in projects and purchase environmental service credits and offsets for environmental services, such as maintaining biodiversity, which are currently wholly voluntary. Subject to an annual limit, businesses subject to UK corporation tax could be granted a credit against tax for such investments or offsets, and the tax credits would be freely transferable between such taxpayers. Such an approach can provide a bridge between wholly voluntary CSR&#151;corporate social responsibility&#151;investments and the developed market for environmental services.</p>

The other two Rio conventions recognised that, and the loss of biodiversity and freshwater resources has accelerated steeply since those conventions were promulgated.

The growth of the carbon market after mandatory requirements were imposed after years of very limited voluntary effort by business demonstrates the necessity and effectiveness of genuine financial incentives in underpinning market mechanisms.

I would have thought that, if there was an abuse in one sector to the tune of &#163;500 million over three years, the Chancellor might have mentioned it in the Budget statement. One would have thought that something of that magnitude was worthy of note. Or is it simply another way of getting cash out of the North sea after a previous promise not to touch the fiscal regime relating to it? Likewise, the Chancellor could have made a difference with proper investment in research and development, which is historically low, at about 1.8 per cent. in the UK and less than 1 per cent. in Scotland, compared with about 2.5 per cent. for our competitors.</p>

I refer hon. Members who are interested to paragraph B.71 on page 163, where they will find that that is exactly the approach that the Government are taking.

It therefore seems quite extraordinary that the Government are putting 55p on a bottle of whisky, but only 3p on a litre of strong cider. Where was the attack on alcopops, which are designed to appeal to an immature palate? Where was the proper and fair taxation of cider, which is massively undertaxed, even up to 7.5 per cent.?</p>

The price of alcohol in some Scandinavian countries, such as Sweden and Finland, is way in excess of the price in this country, but those countries have significant problems with alcoholism.

 I agree entirely. Much of this involves cultural and educational issues. However, the evidence that I have seen from the UK Government and the Scottish Government suggests that price sensitivity is important in encouraging young people not to drink. Young people might have less money than grown-ups who like to have a glass of whisky. Pricing and price sensitivity are important for tackling these issues, but I believe that the Budget has tackled them in the wrong way.

However, the UK Government announced today that child benefit for the first child would rise to &#163;20 in two years. That might have had a slightly different gloss if they had announced a 70p rise for the first child and a 45p rise for subsequent children.

However, given the fact that the real rate of inflation for pensioners will outstrip the increase in their basic pension, I wonder how quickly the extra &#163;1 a week will be eaten into, and just how many extra minutes the electric fire will be on before people realise that that bit of generosity is worth very little indeed.</p>

Secondly, if Scotland&#146;s funding was to be cut to the English average, it would provide England with &#163;150 more per head but would cut a quarter of Scotland&#146;s expenditure. If Labour policy is now to sack a quarter of the doctors, a quarter of the teachers and a quarter of the nurses and to cut back a quarter of all expenditure, I will be delighted to make that argument on the doorsteps.

The last time I was in Scotland, in October last year, I bought a Christmas tree in Jedburgh. On the bottom of the tree it said &#147;Made in China&#148;. There is the essence of the trade deficit.

I am sure that many of the points he made will read very well in <i> Hansard</i>, and will be taken up by people in various Departments, who will examine them and see what they can make of them. He made some interesting points about the non-doms and the Pandora&#146;s box that might be opened. Back in 1974, tax changes in the United States gave rise to the Eurobond market in London, and I think that one should be careful when making what may appear to be small adjustments that will in fact have major consequences. That was one of the points that my hon. Friend made.</p>

He talked about Northern Rock, which is a fixation with the Conservatives. As my right hon.

 And the business has been kept intact for the future. As for what the hon.

Friend the Member for Brent, North was the fact that he spoke for at least half an hour. He produced an erudite exposition of how life was in the 1960s and 1970s. He seemed to think that there was a relationship between the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and the war in Vietnam. I must say that I do not see that, and I thought his exposition on the so-called sub-prime mortgage and its contagious effect was somewhat erroneous as well.</p>

He might have given credit to Warren Buffett for that simile; it was not original. He also spoke of the gold reserves that the Chancellor sold some years ago, making much of the loss of value without taking account of the value of the investments that we made with the money from the sale. Were he to look at the return on the investments we made, he would see that the sale at that time was opportune.</p>

Friend the Member for Wolverhampton, North-East (Mr. Purchase) made a fine and important speech on manufacturing. In our country there is an overemphasis on the housing market and less emphasis on our manufacturing industry. My hon. Friend will remember that when we were in opposition we asked for a Cabinet Minister for Trade and we wanted the emphasis to be on the industrial side of our economy. The Government have gone to some lengths to do that, but we have seen the service sector increase as a percentage of our economy to the detriment of manufacturing. Therefore, when there is some dysfunction in the financial markets, it spreads out into the whole of the country. If we were still creating goods and selling them abroad, it would bring fine value to our economy.</p>

I was not here at the time, but that reminded me of the Budgets of Benjamin Disraeli, who would have two little carafes in front of him with clear liquid in them. No one knew whether it was gin in one and water in the other, but as the debate proceeded, they found out pretty quickly. Gladstone spoke for three hours in his Budgets, whereas today the Chancellor spoke for only an hour. Winston Churchill, who was Chancellor for five years, used to have a carafe in front of him filled with part whisky, part water. Perhaps those earlier Budgets were less boring.</p>

If she reads the fine report of the Treasury Committee on all aspects of the credit crisis, she will find some fine definitions of risk. She said that we were on the cusp of a deep financial crisis, and referred to the financial difficulties of 1974. Those financial difficulties came about because of the decisions made by Anthony Barber on 17 December 1973. He destabilised our economy to such a point that the Prime Minister Ted Heath called an election for February, which he lost. He left the difficulties that he had created to a Labour Government to deal with.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman&#146;s memory and mine clearly are at odds. My memory of what happened in 1974 is closer to the analysis made by my right hon. Friend the Member for Hitchin and Harpenden (Mr. Lilley). At that time I was trying to do some building works in a flat in Edinburgh, when the whole plaster allocation for Edinburgh was four tonnes for a year. At the same time, the whole of the wood supply for Scotland for a year went up in flames on a wharf in Glasgow. I would suggest to the hon. Gentleman that the 1974 collapse had considerably more to do with the shortage of commodities than with a Budget the previous year. The problem was far too deep.</p>

<p><a name="st_o236"><a name="08031240000615"><a name="80312-0015.htm_spnew5"><a name="08031240000936"><b>Mr. Deputy Speaker:</b>
 Order. In view of the dwindling amount of time, it might be better to come back up to date.</p>

 All I could understand from what the hon. Lady said was that apparently the roof fell in at that time.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o332"><a name="80312-0015.htm_para9"><a name="08031240000617">The right hon. Member for Fylde made some interesting points about inflation, and the high interest rates in this country. My answer is that if he wants lower interest rates we should join the euro; the interest rate for the eurozone is much lower. He talked about the cost of commodities in what is a global marketplace. That is one of the reasons why we are experiencing price inflation. The Leader of the Opposition said that it was running at 7 per cent. The price of wheat has gone up, and there is a shortage of wheat in the world.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o333"><a name="80312-0015.htm_para10"><a name="08031240000618">We are living in a world marketplace&#151;a global economy&#151;so that is affecting our country, and creating price inflation here. Commodity prices are going up. The prices of gas and oil are increasing. That is having an impact on inflation. That is why it is to the Chancellor&#146;s credit that he put low inflation, growth and stability at the centre of today&#146;s Budget. Instructing the Bank of England to keep inflation at 2 per cent.&#151;not 2.5 per cent.&#151;shows that the Government have a firm determination to keep inflation down, to keep our growth rate steady if possible, and to maintain stability in our economy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o334"><a name="80312-0015.htm_para11"><a name="08031240000619">Interestingly, the right hon. Member for Fylde also mentioned Merrill Lynch. Because of the nature of the global marketplace, Merrill Lynch is being sued by Adelaide city council over bonds it sold to the council which included some sub-prime mortgage elements. He also mentioned BCCI&#151;the Bank of Credit and Commerce International&#151;but I will not go down the historical road, as you have told me not to, Mr. Deputy Speaker. However, the fact is that all the current perturbations in the financial markets are being dealt with by a pool of banks, which did not exist back then. </p>

<p><a name="stpa_o335"><a name="80312-0015.htm_para12"><a name="08031240000620">I accept that we have strayed somewhat from the subject of the Budget over the past three hours, and I intend now to return to some of its specific points. The former Chancellor&#151;now the Prime Minister&#151;has been criticised for his last Budget. All I remember about it is that he said that we would remove the 10 per cent. rate of income tax, which we will now do; instead of specifically targeting support on pensioners, families and low-income workers, we will move to a simpler two-rate system. Pensioners have been mentioned&#151;for example, by the hon. Member for Dundee, East. We are raising the personal allowances for pensioners by  <br>

&#163;1,180, taking the allowance for anyone over 65 to about &#163;9,810 by 2011, and with a further increase to &#163;10,000 for anyone over 75. That seems to me a reasonable record for the former Chancellor to have had as he moved on to become Prime Minister.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o336"><a name="80312-0015.htm_para13"><a name="08031240000621">Early in the debate, much was said about our child poverty programme&#151;for example, by my right hon. Friends the Members for West Dunbartonshire (John McFall) and for Oxford, East (Mr. Smith) and by the hon. Member for Dundee, East. The Budget will increase child benefit to &#163;20 a week from April 2009. We will disregard child benefit in calculating income for housing and council tax benefit purposes from October 2009, and we will increase the child element of the child tax credit by &#163;50 a year above indexation from April 2009. That is not a bad beginning for an attack on child poverty.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o337"><a name="80312-0015.htm_para14"><a name="08031240000622">The essence of the Budget is stability, growth and low inflation. I am glad that the hon. Member for Beckenham is present, because she talked about the current crisis. The financial turbulence is linked with rising commodity prices. She also mentioned the financial move of the pool of &#163;10 billion being made available through the Bank of England and the $200 billion coming from the United States, and she wondered whether it was printed money. It is not printed money; it is a circulation of money. That is a difficult concept to explain, but it is not about money being printed.</p>

That stability is the cushion on which the rest of our economy will grow. Our growth rates will fall to about 1.25 per cent. but we will not fall into a recession. We will not talk ourselves into a recession, either. We will support the Budget with its emphasis on stability, low inflation and growth, and we will steer our way through the difficulties in the financial markets. That is why I congratulate the Chancellor on his Budget. I wish him well&#151;as will the rest of the House, if it has any sense.</p>

clearly the steady increase in the net transfers of money from the British taxpayer to EC institutions. Such transfers will have risen from &#163;4.7 billion in 2006-07 to &#163;6.7 billion in 2010-11. The increases are even higher if one takes as one&#146;s figures the net contributions to the EC budget, which are given in a footnote to that table. All hon. Members have seen us give yet more powers to the European Union&#151;or seek to do so&#151;through the Lisbon treaty, so it is important that we are aware of the consequences for our constituents, some of which are shown in the Red Book.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o340"><a name="80312-0015.htm_para17"><a name="08031240000628">This is the first day of these debates, and I am sure that my right hon. and hon. Friends will have an opportunity to examine the real substance of the Budget in much more detail. The Chancellor&#146;s statement gave almost nothing away. The Budgets of the previous Chancellor, who is now Prime Minister, were always a kind of snowstorm&#151;figures and statistics were showered over the Chamber leaving us all snow-blind and none the wiser. This Chancellor took a completely different approach, making his remarks for 53 minutes or so without providing any detail. It leaves us trawling through the books and statistics to find some indication of the facts and of the implications of economic policy</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o341"><a name="80312-0015.htm_para18"><a name="08031240000629">Let us examine what the Government are doing in taxation; the current receipts are set out in table C6 of the Red Book. It appears that some pretty significant increases in taxation are being made: income tax gross of tax credits will increase over two years from &#163;147.8 billion in 2006-07 to some &#163;160.2 billion in 2008-09&#151;an 8 per cent. rise or thereabouts; VAT receipts will increase by &#163;6.4 billion; capital gains tax receipts will increase by &#163;1.2 billion; business rates will increase by &#163;2.7 billion; and council tax receipts will increase by &#163;2.7 billion.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o342"><a name="80312-0015.htm_para19"><a name="08031240000630">Total current receipts will rise over that two-year period from just under &#163;520 billion to &#163;575 billion, an increase of about 10 per cent. One could say that receipts will increase by roughly 5 per cent. each year. If one accepts the Government&#146;s projections of growth at about 2 per cent., and if we accept that inflation will be about 2 per cent., that leaves us with an increase of about 1 per cent. each year attributable to fiscal drag and the general increase in the tax burden. As people have more time to study these things they will perhaps arrive at a clearer and more detailed picture, but those basic facts about the Budget were simply avoided by the Chancellor. For that reason, we were given no real indication of the overall effect of the Budget.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o343"><a name="80312-0015.htm_para20"><a name="08031240000631">I want to touch briefly on one or two specific items in the Budget. I had a brief exchange earlier with the hon. Member for Brent, North (Barry Gardiner) about the air movement tax. As with other taxes, we have to ask ourselves what the purpose of it is and what benefit it is intended to achieve. The principal purpose is obviously to raise revenue, but in this instance the stated objective is also to achieve an environmental benefit. The basic logic is that there will be greater benefit if we incentivise airlines to fly their aircraft full, by charging for aircraft movement rather than individual passengers. However, I am concerned that there appears to be no recognition of the degree to which different types of aircraft generate different amounts of pollution. If we are honest about wanting to incentivise better environmental performance, we should try to reflect that consideration.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o344"><a name="80312-0015.htm_para21"><a name="08031240000632">Before the air movement tax is introduced, we also need to know what the Government propose to do to mitigate the potential effect on the air freight industry, about which I had an exchange at the latest Treasury questions with the Exchequer Secretary, who is in her place. She accepted the need to look into that and see what can be done. Air freight is a mobile and competitive industry, and there will be no environmental benefit at all if we simply divert air freight from UK airports to those in the near continent, from where it is transhipped by road to the UK.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o345"><a name="80312-0015.htm_para22"><a name="08031240000633">We must also consider carefully the impact of the new tax on the establishment of new routes from regional airports. Obviously, I am particularly concerned about routes from Manchester airport. The tax on aircraft movements could disincentivise the establishment of new routes, particularly long-haul routes, which would damage the regional economy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o346"><a name="80312-0015.htm_para23"><a name="08031240000634">The hon. Member for Dundee, East (Stewart Hosie), mentioned road fuel duty. It is welcome that the increase has been deferred, but the purpose of the Government&#146;s policy is still not clear. There is a massive disparity between road fuel duty rates in the UK and in some other countries. The hon. Member for East Antrim (Sammy Wilson) mentioned concerns in Ulster about the position across the border, with the Republic of Ireland charging about half the rate of fuel duty that we charge in the UK, which creates significant problems.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o347"><a name="80312-0015.htm_para24"><a name="08031240000635">There are also serious problems for road hauliers in England. We see many foreign hauliers on our motorways, operating from all sorts of places around the EU, including Lithuania, where I think the duty is 16.5p a litre, compared with 50.9p in the UK. Again, we must ask what is being achieved by that huge disparity. Are we simply diverting investment and trade to our competitors in other EU countries, or are we achieving anything environmentally or for the UK? We must consider that carefully.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o348"><a name="80312-0015.htm_para25"><a name="08031240000636">There are to be changes to capital gains tax. Much as I welcome the principle of simplifying the tax, the Chancellor has mishandled the matter woefully in recent months. We need to see details of how the reliefs in the new tax regime will operate. It is unfortunate that the Financial Secretary is not in her place, because I wanted to establish whether I have achieved a minor victory on behalf of a constituent who sold his IT business before the pre-Budget report in exchange for a small shareholding of 1.5 per cent. in a much bigger company, but is locked in and prevented from disposing of it until after the start of the new tax year. I am sure that many people are in comparable positions, so it would be interesting to hear more about the transitional provisions that are referred to in paragraph 6 on page 118 of the Budget notes.

have at the moment is genuine stability. We are faced with the global difficulties caused by the credit crunch, which have led to significant drops in business confidence across the country. Against that backdrop, the Chancellor wants us to accept not only that the problem is of course a global one, not caused by British Government policy, but that the appropriate response is to carry on more or less as we have been, with relatively little change and only a modest shift in the balance of tax and expenditure. As my right hon. Friend the Leader of the Opposition said, that is because the Chancellor&#146;s room for manoeuvre is absurdly limited. Spending, taxes and borrowing have been driven up to levels that are simply unsustainable.</p>

Friend the Member for Ribble Valley (Mr. Evans) for that, if for nothing else. However, we have to ask what levers of policy are available. The Bank of England is now responsible for monetary policy, of course, but, as people well know, it is held in a vice: the Bank is trying to balance the need to provide some degree of stimulus for the economy against growing concerns about inflationary pressures.</p>

The United States has responded with a massive fiscal stimulus to its economy. That may not be appropriate here, but what is really telling is that the Government do not have the freedom even to contemplate such an approach. If it is appropriate to create a little slack in the economy by reducing the fiscal burden, such measures are not found in the Budget, which seems to reflect a degree of tightening, and would require fairly dramatic shifts of policy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o353"><a name="80312-0016.htm_para3"><a name="08031240000641">A degree of consensus is gathering on what the Government are now doing to restrain public expenditure growth quite firmly. They are trying over a period of years to regain the control and flexibility that they have abandoned. That objective is shared not only by the Conservatives, but increasingly by outside observers, including business organisations such as the Institute of Directors, which has been pressing for a more sustainable long-term approach in which public expenditure growth is much reduced. That is probably the responsible thing to do now. It is a pity that, as far as we can tell from the Budget announced today, we are instead to see an increase in taxation, and there is little prospect of significant change to that approach in the coming years.</p>

 Perhaps the right hon. Member for Witney misled the House unintentionally in this respect: he said that my right hon. Friend the Chancellor was the worst Chancellor in recent memory.

They say that in the past 10 years the Government have not fixed the roof while the sun shone&#151;that is the phrase that they used. That is just a misconception about what has been going on. I will give one example showing why they are wrong about that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o356"><a name="80312-0016.htm_para6"><a name="08031244000006">I remember when the third generation mobile phone licences were up for auction. The previous Chancellor raised about &#163;30 billion from the sale. What did he do with most of that money? He paid off debt and reduced the public debt. That seems the perfect definition of fixing the roof while the sun shines, so the right hon. Member for Witney was absolutely wrong on that point. That action is one of the reasons why more public finances now go to the front line, rather than being spent on paying debt, which is what used to happen. Under the Conservative Administration, the public finances paid off failure.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman would be guilty of inadvertently misleading the House, too, if he did not point out that general Government net borrowing is now forecast to be 3.2 per cent. of gross domestic product for the year 2008-09, which exceeds the 3 per cent. Maastricht limit for the very first time. It is in that context that my right hon. Friend the Member for Witney (Mr. Cameron) made the case that while the sun was shining the roof was not fixed. We will all see the consequences of that in the years to come.</p>

 I do not accept the hon. Gentleman&#146;s figure; I understand it to be 2.9 per cent. However, let us not quibble about the figures; let us take a look at where we are with debt. The debt position is low and stable. It is settling down below the 40 per cent. target rate, which is in line with the sustainable investment rule. It seems that we have a strong case on the debt position, contrary to what the right hon. Member for Witney said. Under the Conservative Administration, between 1992 and 1997, while the right hon.

the most stable, robust economy in living memory. That will determine whether we can weather the storms. It must be accepted by the House that we have a robust economy going forward. Yes, the growth forecast has had to be reduced, for reasons that are well known to the House, but the economy will certainly not go into recession, unlike the USA economy, which appears to be moving in that direction.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o358"><a name="80312-0016.htm_para8"><a name="08031244000010">What else did the Prime Minister, when he was Chancellor, lock into the economy that has been continued in today&#146;s Budget? The context for the Budget is a globalised economy. No one has a crystal ball, and the sub-prime problems from the United States could not have been foreseen, but over the past 10 years the Prime Minister tried to build an economy that could withstand the globalisation of manufacturing, financial services and so on, so that when there is a shift in global economic power from traditional areas such as Europe to India and China, our economy can compete on a level playing field.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o359"><a name="80312-0016.htm_para9"><a name="08031244000011">Another aspect that my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister locked into our economy was the absence of economic patriotism. We should not be little Englanders about the economy. My right hon. Friend the Chancellor made it clear today that there should always be an open market and free trade. I welcome that. Without an open market and free trade in the globalised economy, we would have the sort of spat that President Sarkozy has in France. He wants to introduce reforms into the job market and other aspects of the economy, but there is a debate in France about whether there should be economic patriotism and it causes him problems.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o360"><a name="80312-0016.htm_para10"><a name="08031244000012">All of us in the House have watched the Democrat primaries in the USA with interest. The two main contenders have got themselves into a mess by talking about the North American Free Trade Agreement between Canada, Mexico and the USA, and whether they can lessen or get rid of it and repatriate jobs to rust belt areas such as Ohio. One of the parties was allegedly saying one thing to one Government and another to the public. My right hon. Friend the Chancellor has made it absolutely clear&#151;and is right to do so&#151;that we will not have such discussions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o361"><a name="80312-0016.htm_para11"><a name="08031244000013">My right hon. Friend has also locked into our economy investment in industries that take us into the future. The science base has been supported by a number of Budgets over the years, and the Sainsbury review has been set up to examine and report on it. Capital investment in infrastructure has been one of the areas for which my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister set targets, which my right hon. Friend the Chancellor has continued today.

<p><a name="stpa_o362"><a name="80312-0016.htm_para12"><a name="08031244000018">I have mentioned investment in infrastructure, but I also want to mention investment in the creative industries&#151;supporting those industries, which will be an engine of economic advance. I should like to be slightly parochial about the issue for a second. There has been a cultural success in my area. Liverpool is the European capital of culture this year, and we can see the transformative effect of that in my sub-region in Merseyside. My right hon. Friend the Prime Minister has sought to make that writ large across the country.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o363"><a name="80312-0016.htm_para13"><a name="08031244000019">Education services are another issue in respect of the economy. A small example of that is attracting overseas students to our higher education base; that is a significant form of foreign investment in this country. My right hon. Friend has always said that we should invest in talent; that is locked into our approach to the economy and has been made clearer in today&#146;s Budget. Our target is to get 50 per cent. of the 18 to 30 age cohort into higher education, although there are divisions on that in the House, which saddens me. We need to equip our young people with a high degree of skill to compete in the global economy. At a different level, the Leitch review has discussed apprenticeships. The Government have made it clear that we are looking to bring in 250,000 more apprenticeships in the coming months and years.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o364"><a name="80312-0016.htm_para14"><a name="08031244000020">Investment in the environmental field and international development has been touched on today. I should like briefly to say something about the latter issue. Increasingly, India is an economic powerhouse. For many years, thanks to the Department for International Development, it has been our biggest partner in respect of overseas aid, and that is one of the reasons why for many years, the Indian economy&#151;particularly in rural areas&#151;has had access to water, roads and education. In a reciprocal way, we have applied a &#147;good neighbour&#148; principle. When the urban Indian economy comes forward, we will be in a good position to set up trade with what will be a tiger economy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o365"><a name="80312-0016.htm_para15"><a name="08031244000021">Finally, although we have a good and sound economy going forward, how can children and families look forward to the future in uncertain times? First, there is job growth&#151;there are 2 million more people in jobs than there were in 1997. There is record employment; more people are now in employment than ever before. That is another reason why we are in a good position to withstand the buffeting. All that contrasts with the &#163;10 billion in cuts suggested by the Conservative party. If we are talking about bringing stability into the situation, we should realise that those cuts would destabilise the economy and put those children and families at risk.</p>

 That allegation of &#163;10 billion in cuts is every bit as fatuous as that made by the hon. Member for Dundee, East (Stewart Hosie).

 The hon. Member for Brent, North (Barry Gardiner) drew me to my feet with his full and erudite exposition of the Ramsar convention. I should state to the House, for good order, my proprietary interest in the bog mentioned. <i> [</i><i> Interruption.</i><i> ]</i> I own it, yes. He also said that I was shameless in raising a constituency interest. I have no shame whatsoever in doing so, and I intend to raise four matters that have an impact on my constituents, as well as a brief point about the Budget as a whole.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o366"><a name="80312-0016.htm_para16"><a name="08031244000025">The Chancellor of the Exchequer came to his current job with a reputation as a safe pair of hands; time will tell whether they are safe enough to accept the hospital pass that he has received from his predecessor. The critical test of the Budget will relate to financial stability and whether our economy will survive. The right hon. Member for Hitchin and Harpenden (Mr. Lilley) made some interesting points, many of which I agree with. For the second time this week, he told us about the tide and the bathing trunks. I could tell him from personal experience that if the bathing trunks are loose enough and the tide is strong enough, the tide can take the bathing trunks. He said that the way in which the banks have sought to package and sell unsecured debt is not a factor in the problems that we now face. I disagree&#151;I think that their use of extreme financial technology has been a major factor in those problems.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o367"><a name="80312-0016.htm_para17"><a name="08031244000026">One of the key tools that will see us through is the independence of the Bank of England. I welcome the fact that, for the first time in its history, the Bank is independent at a time when the economy is being tested. Particularly in the light of the studies of lessons learned from the Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank, there is room to look again at whether the Bank should have the sole objective of curtailing inflation, as currently, or a mixed objective combining inflation and employment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o368"><a name="80312-0016.htm_para18"><a name="08031244000027">The first of my four points of particular concern to my constituents relates to transport. I was glad that the Chancellor, with his particular knowledge of transport issues, brought that up in his Budget statement. I have no particular problem with the concept of using vehicle excise duty to encourage people into vehicles that are less polluting; in fact, I rather support it. Indeed, my colleagues and I tabled an amendment to that effect this time last year. However, I still have grave concerns about the cost of fuel to people who live in remote and rural areas. The hon. Member for Beckenham (Mrs. Lait) mentioned a fuel price in her area of 106p or thereabouts. I can take her to a petrol station in my part of the world where it is 126p and rising. That big premium is the main problem. The hon. Member for Brent, North made several points about the principles behind taxation, including the concept of fairness. In seeking to change behaviour, one of the key points about fairness is that there is somewhere for that behavioural change to go. If someone in the far north of Scotland has a car, that is the only way that they will get around. There is never going to be a bus service in the middle of Sutherland. We need a system that is fair. The long-term answer, which the Chancellor brought up in his statement, is road pricing. We should look to make progress on that  <br>

policy, and I hope that he will. However, we need an interim measure to deal with that premium that exists in remote rural areas.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o369"><a name="80312-0016.htm_para19"><a name="08031244000028">My second point is one that was brought home to me forcefully by one of my constituents who is a pensioner. Typically, many pensioners have a modest occupational pension to supplement their state pension, and they own a house and a car, but they have a pretty fixed income. They have suffered from inflation in council tax, the price of fuel and other areas, but particularly fuel. My constituent said that when the winter fuel allowance began, it paid for an entire winter&#146;s supply of fuel for his house. Prior to today&#146;s announcement, it accounted for exactly half; his bills have precisely doubled in that time.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o370"><a name="80312-0016.htm_para20"><a name="08031244000029">I welcome the &#163;50 and &#163;100 increases to the payments; I note that they are one-off payments, and I hope that that policy will be revisited. But that will not go more than a quarter of the way to redress the balance of the impact on bills since the winter fuel payment was first brought in. We must consider further the issue of fuel poverty, to which a number of hon. Members have referred. The final point that my constituent made to me was that on top of everything, his 10p rate of tax has doubled. He is paying more tax, he has higher bills and he has nowhere to go. We must take account of people who have such problems.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o371"><a name="80312-0016.htm_para21"><a name="08031244000030">My third point is on renewable energy. I am an ardent and well-known supporter of all forms of energy that have a low-carbon life-cycle and can help to reduce our carbon emissions. One example is the renewable energy that can be supplied from the Pentland firth&#151;scientists who have studied it tell me that it could supply 31 GW. The core barrier is the transmission regime. If the Chancellor would really like to help, then on top of the renewables obligation certificates that are available, perhaps something could be done to make the grid more accessible for renewable energy produced in outlying areas. Having produced renewable energy, it would be helpful if we could get it to market.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o372"><a name="80312-0016.htm_para22"><a name="08031244000031">My fourth point&#151;I cannot let the Budget go by without commenting on it&#151;concerns, of course, whisky. Here I must declare an interest. Most of my interests are in the register, but one that is not is that I am about to become grand master of the Keepers of the Quaich, which is an organisation designed to celebrate and promote whisky. I have no problem with putting tax on alcohol as a method of raising money, and given the cracks in the Budget, I see why the Chancellor would need to raise money from that source, just as he raises it from vehicles, cigarettes or elsewhere. I have difficulty, however, with the concept of linking the need to raise money with social consequences.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o373"><a name="80312-0016.htm_para23"><a name="08031244000032">The social consequences of binge drinking are an extremely complex area. Some good organisations, such as Alcohol in Moderation, are working in this area, and I counsel all parties to be careful about pretending that a modest tax hike will have any great social benefit. Other methods could be used, and should be studied.</p>

<p><a name="st_o253"><a name="08031244000033"><a name="80312-0016.htm_spnew12"><a name="08031244000135"><b>Mrs. Lait:</b>
 While the hon. Gentleman is on the subject of the difficulties of increasing taxation, I wonder whether, given his interest in the whisky industry, he has been able to do a back-of-an-envelope calculation on what the impact will be on the smuggling of whisky, spirits and alcohol. That might undercut what the Chancellor is trying to achieve through the duty increase.</p>

 The Budget takes place in difficult circumstances, given what has gone on in the world. I shall not repeat what has been said and, unusually for me, but because of time constraints and many preceding lengthy speeches, I will take no interventions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o376"><a name="80312-0017.htm_para0"><a name="08031244000038">We all know about the turbulence in the world economy, affecting banking, fuel, especially the price of oil, the price of food&#151;for example, the price of wheat has increased by 118 per cent. in the past year&#151;and commodity prices, which have increased hugely, driven especially by demand from countries such as China and India. That is the difficult background to the Budget. The Chancellor has done a good job, in a steady-as-she-goes Budget, in trying to act positively in the face of the challenges of globalisation and economic turbulence in the world.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o377"><a name="80312-0017.htm_para1"><a name="08031244000039">The Budget was also announced against the backdrop of the Government&#146;s other policies to cope with the challenges of globalisation, such as the Leitch review of skills and the Sainsbury review of science to enable us to foster innovation here. The Government have also taken positive steps to protect intellectual property rights in this country, in the European Union under the treaty of Lisbon, and internationally. They have also increased spending on the NHS in recent years. A company such as General Motors is nearly bankrupt through the health payments that it has to make to its retired workers as well as its current work force because the USA does not have a national health system. Spending taxpayers&#146; money on the NHS is, therefore, good for the economy. It is an investment, which helps business. Similarly, the Government have invested in education to increase skills.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o379"><a name="80312-0017.htm_para3"><a name="08031244000041">On a parochial matter, before I move on to some sniping, the headquarters of Marston&#146;s brewery, one of the major brewers in the country, is based in my constituency. The site of the third largest pub chain in the UK, run by Marston&#146;s, is also there. I am therefore disappointed about the differentials on alcohol duties in the Budget. I am especially disappointed that not only has beer duty increased by 4p a pint, but the duty on a litre of still cider has increased by only 3p. Still cider, bought cheaply from off-licences, causes problems with drunkenness in my constituency and, I suspect, many others. It is unfortunate that the Budget has increased the price of beer through excise duties much more than that of cider, which poses a greater problem.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o380"><a name="80312-0017.htm_para4"><a name="08031244000042">Let me consider the speech of the Liberal Democrat leader, the right hon. Member for Sheffield, Hallam (Mr. Clegg). What a vacuous response to the Budget. He presented almost no policies. He proposed a green tax con, which we have discussed previously in the House when considering green taxes that are revenue-neutral. The problem with green taxes is changing behaviour. If the behaviour changes, one cannot have a revenue-neutral tax unless one increases other taxes or ratchets up the green taxes. Neither of those options is desirable.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o381"><a name="80312-0017.htm_para5"><a name="08031244000043">The right hon. Member for Sheffield, Hallam also tried to steal the amendment that I, not the Liberal Democrats, was the first in the House to bring forward, to increase massively the vehicle excise duty on the most polluting cars. In case the 4x4 fraternity get on to me, I have repeatedly said in the House that nine of the top 10 most polluting vehicles sold in the United Kingdom are not 4x4s, but cars such as Bentleys, Maseratis and Lamborghinis. The first-time duty of &#163;950 on the most polluting vehicles in the Budget is a step forward, but I wish that the Chancellor had gone much further, by doubling that rate and imposing an annual rate, which would change behaviour, because the second-hand value of those vehicles would plummet. That is where we will hit the market.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o382"><a name="80312-0017.htm_para6"><a name="08031244000044">The right hon. Gentleman seemed to have no understanding of non-dom taxation, which caused great hilarity in the House, and talked about poor non-doms. I am in favour of helping poor non-doms, through the Gangmasters (Licensing) Act 2004 and so on, but that is not the group that we mean when we talk about the taxation of non-domiciles. We are talking about the rich, not the poor non-doms, who will not make so much money that they will have to pay the &#163;30,000 levy or whatever it is. The right hon. Gentleman completely misunderstood that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o383"><a name="80312-0017.htm_para7"><a name="08031244000045">Things got worse with the Conservatives. It is like &#147;Groundhog Day&#148; with them. I have sat through seven Budget debates and the Conservative party is like a clock that has stopped: every 24 hours it is right twice. I concede the possibility that the Conservatives might be right this year, with the doom and gloom that we hear from them every year. However, they have not been right for the past 11 years, and the betting is that they will not be right this year. If the Conservatives are right, it will only be because the 12 hours have come round and, with their doom and gloom, the clock is briefly showing the right time again.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o384"><a name="80312-0017.htm_para8"><a name="08031244000046">As for the Conservative party&#146;s spending policies as an alternative to the Budget, the hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster (Mr. Field) asked about the &#163;10.5 billion spending spree. I can give him some figures on that: cutting the corporation tax rate to 27 per cent. will cost &#163;1.75 billion; the transferable marriage tax allowance will cost &#163;3.2 billion; the increase in the working tax credit will cost &#163;3 billion; the increase in the inheritance tax threshold to &#163;1 million will cost &#163;2 billion; and raising the stamp duty threshold for first-time buyers will cost &#163;400 million.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o385"><a name="80312-0017.htm_para9"><a name="08031244000047">On top of that, we have heard all kinds of wonderful commitments: more funding for the armed forces; more anti-MRSA funding; additional drugs for thousands of stroke patients; high-speed rail pilot schemes; billions of pounds more for the NHS, according to the shadow NHS spokesman, the hon. Member for South Cambridgeshire (Mr. Lansley); the national school leaver&#146;s programme that is so beloved of the right hon. Member for Witney (Mr. Cameron); his demand for a larger Army; and extensions to light rail. All those are worthy, but what did he say about raising taxes in his speech on the Budget? He talked about raising taxes on binge drinking.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o386"><a name="80312-0017.htm_para10"><a name="08031244000048">Raising taxes on binge drinking might be worth while, but if it works, it will be like green taxes&#151;it will be revenue-neutral, because people will drink less. That was the right hon. Gentleman&#146;s only tax-raising measure to pay for the long shopping list that I have read out, which will cost considerably more than &#163;10 billion. Binge drinking taxes alone is not a good way to go. On sharing the proceeds of growth, the right hon. Gentleman talked about cutting capital gains tax, taxes on family businesses and corporation taxes, saving loads of post offices and every maternity hospital in the country, and more spending commitments. That is an even bigger black hole when all he is doing is putting up binge drinking taxes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o387"><a name="80312-0017.htm_para11"><a name="08031244000049">So what is the right hon. Gentleman going to do? He is going to borrow loads of money. What is the form for that? The form is the previous Conservative Government, who doubled the national debt. They did not want to put up taxes, but they had to get the money from somewhere, because they did not have the guts to cut the programmes&#151;thank goodness for the working class in the United Kingdom&#151;so they borrowed the money and left us to take over, with a big financial hangover. Despite what the Conservatives say, the Government have paid off quite a lot of that debt. National debt is now far lower as a proportion of GDP than when we took over in 1997. The Conservatives are going nowhere.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o388"><a name="80312-0017.htm_para12"><a name="08031244000050">The other idea that the right hon. Gentleman put forward was that green taxes should go into a family fund. Again, that is the kind of revenue-neutral nonsense that we heard from the Liberal Democrats. The proposal will not work, because although it is very desirable if people or companies change their behaviour and stop acting in such a polluting way, the tax take will drop. If we had green taxes going into a family fund, as the right hon. Gentleman suggested, that would do nothing and be just another tax rise.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o389"><a name="80312-0017.htm_para13"><a name="08031244000051">Both Opposition parties have put forward vacuous policies, if policies at all, and wild, unfunded spending commitments. It will not do. At least the Chancellor has put forward a considered package in difficult economic times, which I think will work.</p>

 I should like to declare an interest, in that I am the owner of a small retail convenience store in Swansea, and something that I say in the 10 minutes to which I shall restrict myself might relate to that. In the spirit of the greenness that we all talk about these days, I am also thinking about doing a carbon offset on this speech. I shall read it tomorrow, and I shall offset anything that I feel has not added to the day&#151;if the Chancellor will do the same. If he did that we would be quids in, because his was possibly one of the most boring Budget speeches that I have heard in my 16 years as a Member of Parliament. I was waiting for the big idea, and I still am. I know that we are not allowed refreshments in the Chamber, but there is an exception, in that the Chancellor is traditionally allowed a sip of whisky while he makes his Budget speech. If the right hon. Gentleman is still Chancellor at the time of the next Budget, perhaps everyone in the Chamber might be allowed a double espresso to keep them awake. His speech sounded to me much as the shipping forecast would sound to a lettuce picker in Mexico; it was that dire.</p>

The 2 per cent. rate is mentioned time and again, and the Chancellor referred to it today. It is not an inflation rate that I recognise. That is not simply because of petrol prices or agricultural prices going through the roof. It is also to do with council tax, and the Government have even imposed an increase in prescription charges that is greater than 2 per cent. Everyone knows that the real inflation rate is much higher than 2 per cent. Stating that it is not might allow the Chancellor to ensure that public sector salary increases&#151;and pension increases&#151;are kept low, but we all know that it is much higher.</p>

Tax freedom day is the day of the year on which we finally start earning money for ourselves, and it is now 1 June. Only after that date can we start to earn money for ourselves. We have to work for the Government from 1 January to 1 June. That period has increased by a whole week over the past four years. We now have to work a whole week longer for the Government instead of earning money for ourselves. Given the sensibilities and constraints within which a future Conservative Government will have to operate&#151;we shall obviously have to clear up the mess left by this Government&#151;I hope that when we can, we shall roll back tax freedom day so that people can earn more money for themselves and spend it on whatever they think is in the best interests of themselves and their families.</p>

Member for Wolverhampton, South-West (Rob Marris) mentioned brewing, and I shall do the same, as I am the vice-chairman of the all-party parliamentary group on beer. Some rubbish has been talked today. The hon. Member for Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross (John Thurso) was absolutely right to say that the increases are being dressed up as measures to tackle binge drinking. When we see where they are targeted, we realise that they will not help to tackle binge drinking at all. There was no mention in the Budget of strong cider or of alcopops. The 4p increase on beer will not do anything to dissuade binge drinkers. I suspect that most of the problem is not caused by beer in any event. Other alcohols are at the root of the problem.</p>

I am sure that we will all know of pubs in our constituencies&#151;rural or urban&#151;that have closed with no chance of reopening. Pubs are part of the social fabric of our society, particularly in villages where there is only one pub. In one village in my constituency, the pub is closed and we are waiting to see whether it will reopen. There are real problems, and the increase announced today will only accelerate the pub closures in this country. That will mean not only job losses but damage to the fabric of society. Pubs are a place where people meet and talk&#151;they are a great British tradition, for goodness&#146; sake&#151;and we do not want to lose them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o398"><a name="80312-0017.htm_para22"><a name="08031244000063">Pubs are, of course, places where people drink communally. Part of the problem with binge drinking is that people can go into supermarkets, pick up cans of strong lager or whatever else and drink not in a licensed and supervised area but in the streets, at home or in other places. If the Government want to tackle the problem of binge drinking, they must do it in a far more targeted way than they have. This measure is everything to do with revenue raising, but it has been dressed up as an attack on binge drinking. The Government are wide of the mark, and will have to think again.</p>

He is a tremendous guy who is doing an awful lot to expose how taxpayers&#146; money is wasted.

That would mean that people knew know exactly how much they were paying in stealth taxes. If people knew the level to which they pay taxes, they would think long and hard about how much money is raised from them and their families, and would take more care about how that money was spent.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o401"><a name="80312-0017.htm_para25"><a name="08031244000068">I have one more plea for a future Budget, which is about youngsters who go to school and have a badged uniform. Such uniforms are exempt from VAT only for sizes up to the age of 13. We know that another problem in this country is obesity and that some youngsters tend to be larger than others. Perhaps the Government could consider the problem of VAT charged to those who are large for their age, particularly as they have raised the school leaving age to 18. The VAT for those who go to institutions with badged uniforms should at least be reduced to 5 per cent. That would cost only &#163;4 million. The Government love to make big announcements that do not cost much money; this is perfect for them, and would help many families throughout the UK afford to buy badged uniforms for the schools that their children go to without being ripped off by VAT.</p>

 &#147;Congratulations, Mr. Chancellor, I am pleased to tell you that you have passed your test and can now throw away the L-plates.&#148; It was a test taken in very difficult conditions, with storm clouds overhead, inconsiderate drivers ahead and traffic lights changing against the Chancellor all the way. To put it another way, this was a Budget drawn up in the very difficult international circumstances, following the collapse of the housing market in America, of a global credit crunch. We have recently heard that America is now probably in recession, so around the world people are downgrading their estimates for growth in their own countries, hoping that the old saying &#147;When America sneezes, the rest of the world catches a cold&#148; is no longer true.

I was pleased to hear at the beginning of his Budget speech that the values guiding his choice of priorities were fairness and opportunity. Those are my values and, I believe, the values of the Labour party. When I made my own Budget representations before today, with those values in mind, I kept my requests to two: would the Chancellor help pensioners in poverty, and children in poverty? I am pleased to see that those priorities emerged today.</p>

I hear what people say about the fact that it was announced as a one-off payment, but if people want to join a campaign to get it incorporated into the winter fuel allowance for future years, I would be glad to be at the head of such a campaign, and to seek further increases in the future. This is a Labour Government, and although it is relatively late to do it, they are going to restore the link between increases in pensions and earnings. Again, if people want to join a campaign for that decision to be taken sooner rather than later, I would be pleased to head it.</p>

I am pleased that the Chancellor listened to us, however, and took a decision that will lead to still more children being drawn out of poverty. Back in 1997, we inherited a position where more than 3 million children were in poverty, but through the steps taken so far we have drawn 600,000 of them out of poverty&#151;and the steps announced today will reduce the number still further.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o405"><a name="80312-0017.htm_para29"><a name="08031244000073">The Chancellor was right to focus on helping parents who are in work. Recent research has shown that more than half the children still living in poverty have at least one parent who is in work. It is right to concentrate on raising the national minimum wage, which will happen again in October; it is right to raise the tax credit for children, as the Chancellor announced today; and it will be right next year to raise child benefit by much more than the rate of inflation. I was also pleased to hear that next year, for the first time ever, child benefit will be disregarded in certain circumstances when parents go back to work and claim housing benefit and council tax benefit. All the right decisions have been made there.</p>

I think that <i> The Guardian </i>said yesterday that this was set to be the greenest Labour Budget yet. I have to say that I think not. Nevertheless, I believe that the Chancellor was right to postpone this year&#146;s increase in fuel duty. If one of the reasons for putting that duty up is to try to change motorists&#146; behaviour, encouraging them to use their vehicles less, I would have thought that massive increases in the world price of oil are doing exactly the same job for us. While the price is so high, I think the Chancellor is right to wait.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o407"><a name="80312-0017.htm_para31"><a name="08031244000075">The Chancellor briefly mentioned the climate change levy, which is going up only in line with inflation this year. The levy has, however, been a staggering success over the 10 years of the Labour Government. By 2010, something like 20 million tonnes of carbon dioxide will have been taken out of the atmosphere because of that levy, and about a third of it through voluntary agreements with intensive energy users. That is a great success. Following on from last year&#146;s announcement about having zero-carbon domestic properties by 2016, I hope that today&#146;s additional target for building zero- carbon non-domestic properties will make a real difference to future house and property building.</p>

 Essentially, this was a paralysis Budget. There was virtually nothing in the Chancellor&#146;s speech that had not already been announced several times over. It is clear that the Government are hoping that the ever-darkening economic clouds will pass soon, but that might be wishful thinking.</p>

consultation to allow greater debate, with any recommendations to be implemented in April 2009 rather than in five weeks&#146; time. The unintended consequences of the Sarbanes-Oxley legislation on New York&#146;s dominance of the financial sector demonstrate just how rapidly any city&#146;s competitive advantage can be lost through knee-jerk political interference.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o415"><a name="80312-0018.htm_para7"><a name="08031244000084">Nevertheless, I feel that having seen off the Treasury&#146;s set of politically rather than economically motivated proposals, we should return to the wider debate about the desirability of allowing internationally mobile, high-net-worth individuals to avoid making any contribution to domestic tax. Lest we forget, it was the Conservative party&#146;s suggestion on non-doms&#151;designed to fund our policy on inheritance tax&#151;that raised the standard for this entire debate last October. The shadow Treasury plan at that juncture was simple and balanced: non-doms would be charged a flat rate of &#163;25,000, and in return would be entitled to the certainty of not being required to declare their income either on or off shore.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o416"><a name="80312-0018.htm_para8"><a name="08031244000085">Five months on, the prospect of less clement economic weather, especially in the financial services sphere, has led many commentators to question the wisdom of imposing any tariff on non-doms. We should not forget that the great majority of those in the workplace who are non-domiciled are relatively modestly remunerated&#151;a point raised against a background of some hilarity by the hon. Member for Wolverhampton, South-West (Rob Marris). However, a flat rate charge for those people amounts to a substantial imposition on their overall earnings, but it is rarely of course from this quarter that any vocal complaint has been forthcoming.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o417"><a name="80312-0018.htm_para9"><a name="08031244000086">By contrast, in my role as the Member of Parliament for the Square Mile, I have been feverishly lobbied by leading financial services players, doing their best to convince me that anything beyond the status quo would result in a non-dom exodus of the job-creating super-rich from London to the cosmopolitan delights of Geneva or Frankfurt. I simply do not buy that. For a start, the attraction to high-net-worth non-doms and their families of living in London is probably worth paying an annual tariff of rather more than &#163;25,000.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o418"><a name="80312-0018.htm_para10"><a name="08031244000087">It also seems to me a rather slippery slope that the cheerleaders for the non-dom community would have us go down. Once the argument is accepted that a sector and its participants are so important to this nation that they should be exempt from paying a share towards the communal income taxation pot, where do we stop? At this point it is worth stressing that even high-net-worth non-doms contribute extensively via council tax, VAT, other sales taxes and employment taxes on their array of staff. They make a substantial contribution to the Treasury and their status exempts them primarily from taxation on their overseas earnings.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o419"><a name="80312-0018.htm_para11"><a name="08031244000088">Strangely enough, the illogicality of the entire political class on this matter has gone largely without comment. If the levying of low&#151;to the point of zero&#151;taxes is so essential to job creation in the City, why is the case for lower, more internationally competitive tax rates for all not being made much more forcefully? The case for reducing taxation should apply across the economy, not just to a gilded few, whose special pleading can sound like disguised blackmail.</p>

Meanwhile no one disputes that we cannot, and should not, kill the financial services goose that lays such a golden egg for the UK as a whole. However, even as someone who represents the City of London, I think there is a worrying over-dependence on the sector for the nation's economic well-being that makes some action over non-doms desirable.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o421"><a name="80312-0018.htm_para13"><a name="08031244000090">As an inner-London MP, I have watched the influx of overseas money that has distorted house prices and the cost of middle-class living to the severe detriment of many indigenous Londoners. It is this group who feel that they are more than paying their way in collective taxation, yet at the same time are witnessing a marked diminution in the quality of their life. This unease is not a throwback to the politics of envy. Far from it; here is an aspirational, meritocratic group whose resentment is being stoked up by a perception of unfairness.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o422"><a name="80312-0018.htm_para14"><a name="08031244000091">The debate on non-doms follows hot on the heels of that on the preferential tax rates enjoyed by those working in private equity. It is essentially a middle-class revolt over the unequal rewards to labour in the globalised economy. To their surprise, many highly educated professionals working outside the gilded corridors of the financial services sphere see themselves losing out as the world becomes more integrated and interdependent. The perception that the benefits of globalisation are not being spread either equitably or fairly is fast taking hold among an articulate group in our society who in the past instinctively would have regarded themselves as winners in the lottery of life.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o423"><a name="80312-0018.htm_para15"><a name="08031244000092">The financial services sector is increasingly regarded by a sceptical and bemused general public&#151;I do not necessarily agree with the sentiments, but they are the reality of what is happening&#151;as a one-way bet to untold riches. Only last month, we learned that despite the effects of the credit crunch, overall City bonuses this year will top &#163;7 billion. This is leading to enormous resentment not least from the middle classes, where the material expectations, particularly in London and the south-east, are becoming increasingly bleak. Indeed, the biggest concern I hear from middle-aged constituents is how, short of relying upon inheritance, their children can hope to match, let alone surpass, the standard of living they have taken for granted for decades gone by.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o424"><a name="80312-0018.htm_para16"><a name="08031244000093">The prospect of non-doms being seen publicly to &#147;pay their way&#148; will help assuage many of these concerns without careering towards fully fledged protectionism, which would be totally undesirable. The City might be wise to seek some accommodation with the Government on this issue. But the concern of young workers and their ability to match their parents' standard of living also touches on another serious concern of mine, which I have raised in the past, not least at the last Budget. The dividing lines of 20th-century society&#151;at least in the post-war era&#151;were largely defined by class, but I believe that the first half of this century stands to be shaped by the battle between generations. The debt trail of this Government means that the young people of today, as well as those yet to be born, will foot the bill  <br>

for both the Government&#146;s private finance initiative-funded investments and the unfunded cost of pensions for older people. PFI might well have led to the construction of tremendous new hospitals in many constituencies throughout the country, but that will have to be paid for in the future; it is a case of jam today, and future generations of taxpayers will foot the bill. I worry that those future generations will have to lower their expectations significantly when the time comes for them to retire and benefit in the same way as previous generations from public pensions.</p>

It is contained in the category of &#147;ongoing borrowing requirements&#148;. The hon. Member for Wolverhampton, South-West (Rob Marris) referred to &#147;Groundhog Day&#148;. We entered the House on the same day seven years ago, and public borrowing is another issue to which the term &#147;groundhog day&#148; could be applied. Every Budget I have seen has referred to borrowing going back into the black in about four years&#151;and that is the case today, too. There has always been the idea that we are just a few years away from nirvana when everything will have corrected itself. The trouble is, however, that we have an ever larger borrowing requirement going forward.</p>

There are twice as many voters over 55 as there are under 35, and those voters are twice as likely to vote as younger voters. It is therefore perhaps unrealistic to expect anyone in the political arena to state certain bald facts on this matter. The reason many people well into pensionable age claim they receive so little from the state is that they have failed to pay anything like enough into the system to warrant their receiving what they now believe they are entitled to. Furthermore, the appetite in recent years has been for greater investment in public services, rather than tax cuts.</p>

The Government have in truth been using the mechanism of the private finance initiative&#151;now the public-private partnership&#151;as a form of disguised borrowing with repayment postponed for up to 30 years, removing from the public balance sheet some of the capital costs of Government projects. Admittedly, some &#163;30 billion of the capital value of PFI projects has been included on the current balance sheet, but that leaves more than &#163;120 billion of public sector debt currently unaccounted for. That calculation takes no account, of course, of Northern Rock, much of which is likely to remain under state control well into the next decade.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o428"><a name="80312-0018.htm_para20"><a name="08031244000096">I fear that this off-balance-sheet financing delays some of the tough decisions that need to be made about the future of public spending, and impedes the debate we must now have about how to manage public services not only in the years ahead, but for decades to come. One of the more depressing prospects in the years ahead is that my 40-something generation will be considered to have lived in the very best of times. We are all consuming what we believe we are entitled to, without much regard to the costs, and we run the risk of serious social unrest in the decades ahead as the evidence of this appalling generational pyramid sales scam becomes evident.

 My right hon. Friend the Chancellor should be congratulated on a solid, sensible, workmanlike and utterly unexciting Budget, which was exactly what we wanted from him.

They started telling us that we should have built a roof, but they did not tell us exactly what kind of roof. The speech made from the Conservative Front Bench was frankly vacuous, rendered better only by the contrast with the speech made by the leader of the Liberal Democrats, which it was even worse.</p>

&#163;11.8 billion of corporate tax is not paid to the Treasury because of avoidance schemes. As a result, the burden of taxation presses more heavily on the rest of society, in particular on the personal taxpayers and the lower range of taxpayers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o434"><a name="80312-0018.htm_para26"><a name="08031244000103">Tax is now pressing too far down the scale in this country. It is ridiculous that people on the minimum wage are paying income tax&#151;that is clearly wrong. We should make it one of our concerns to relieve the multitude who labour, as they used to be called&#151;it is the multitude who struggle now&#151;because income tax is pressing too heavily on them. That tax is coupled with the burden of increased food, fuel and utility prices and increased council tax, and those people need some relief from those burdens. We should either raise the limit at which tax comes in or double the personal allowances to give everybody some relief and some money to spend to boost demand.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o435"><a name="80312-0018.htm_para27"><a name="08031244000104">We could pay for that next year by increasing the taxation on wealth&#151;on earnings of more than &#163;100,000&#151;to 50 per cent. We could splash out more money by doubling the winter fuel allowance. We need to put money into people&#146;s pockets to spend and thus boost demand, and we need to direct that money to the less well-off. Above all, we need a cut in interest rates. We have the highest interest rates in the world. Why? It is because we put finance in control of them. When we put the Bank of England in control, it meant that the interests of finance&#151;having dear money and a high and stable exchange rate&#151;became dominant in our national policy. It would have been far more sensible to have had not just a single rubric for the Bank of England, to keep inflation to 2 per cent, but a second rubric, like the US Fed, to maximise employment too. The result is that I must praise what I call Bushnomics&#151;what they are doing in the United States, as opposed to what we are doing here. They have suffered from similar problems: the dollar is overvalued, although it is coming down, and they have a balance of payments deficit, as we do. Ours is slightly smaller, but it is now approaching 5 per cent. of GDP.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o436"><a name="80312-0018.htm_para28"><a name="08031244000105">In that situation, the markets will bring both the dollar and the pound down. The Americans are welcoming that with benign neglect and letting the dollar fall, as they did in the 1980s and again in the 1990s, with beneficial effects on the exporting sector of the American economy. We should do the same, but the Bank of England will feel obliged to keep interest rates high&#151;it is already saying that&#151;to stop any slide in the pound. The pound has been the main instrument for defeating inflation, by making imports cheap and compelling manufacturing to discipline itself and cut costs to stay competitive, so the result of the high pound policy is that we have lost more than 1 million jobs in manufacturing. We live by manufacturing, but it is now a much smaller part of the economy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o437"><a name="80312-0018.htm_para29"><a name="08031244000106">We may contrast that with the situation in Germany, where there have been far fewer labour-shedding cuts than here. German industry has reinvested, re-equipped and absorbed the skilled labour force from the east, and would have put itself in a very powerful position were it not shackled by the overvaluation of the euro. We need a powerful industrial base, and the Americans will get one as the dollar comes down because they have a much more powerful economy. Unfortunately, we have put all our eggs in the basket of finance.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o444"><a name="80312-0019.htm_para3"><a name="08031255000010">In that statement, the reduction in the basic rate of income tax from 22p to 20p and the abolition of the 10p rate, which come into effect next month, were announced. The news caused deep anxiety, and within days I and several colleagues met my right hon. Friend the then Chancellor, now the Prime Minister, to make him aware of our concerns. I have also discussed the matter with the present Chancellor a couple of times. Although 700,000 pensioners will be removed from the tax bracket next month, many people in areas such as the one that I represent, which regrettably has a low-wage economy, will not see a positive impact. In areas with a low-wage economy, we find households that struggle to get by. It is those low-income households, women pensioners under 65 and people who may have retired because of ill health who, unfortunately, will be paying extra tax after 1 April. The only reassurance I have is that any extra tax that we generate will go into public services, which, I believe, need continuing investment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o445"><a name="80312-0019.htm_para4"><a name="08031255000011">I am delighted that the Chancellor chose to defer the introduction of a 2p increase in road fuel duty, especially with crude oil prices so volatile. I wrote to my right hon. Friend and discussed the matter with him, and I would like to think that he listened to me, but I suspect that he was listening to other representations as well. The decision will come as a great relief to households in my constituency, but we face a real challenge. Some people, we hear, are talking about the price of a barrel of oil reaching $200 in coming years. It has taken a long and painful time to reach $100 a barrel, but the fact that some people have in recent weeks been speaking freely of $200 a barrel is extremely difficult to swallow. As a nation, and perhaps globally, we have to think about how to face that challenge. Can we get people out of their cars?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o446"><a name="80312-0019.htm_para5"><a name="08031255000012">When crude oil prices are so volatile, the price differentials that have been mentioned in the Chamber this afternoon and on previous occasions are exploited. We see wide-ranging price differentials. The hon. Member for Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross (John Thurso) mentioned the figure of &#163;1.26 a litre. Parts of Scotland have extremes, but differentials have crept in even in areas where there are not extremes, and we desperately need to look into that.</p>

provider of public transport in my area, complaining about the increase in bus fares. I am disappointed that no Scottish National party Members are here, but I want to read to the House what was said to me. The letter says:</p>
<a name="80312-0019.htm_brev0"><a name="08031255000080"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;I feel that it is important to highlight the fact that this year in particular bus operators in Scotland are subject to higher operating costs than our counterparts in England. This is a direct result of the current Scottish Governments decision not to award the increased level of Bus Service Operators Grant...we may find ourselves in the position that we may have to increase fares by a further amount later in the year.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o448"><a name="80312-0019.htm_para7"><a name="08031255000014">That is only one of a number of issues that have arisen of late. I know that colleagues paint the rosy picture that Scotland is a land flowing with milk and honey. It is an admirable country to live in, but there are some underhand practices taking place in Scotland under the current Administration in Holyrood.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o449"><a name="80312-0019.htm_para8"><a name="08031255000015">It has been raised, both on the Floor of the House and in Westminster Hall debates, that &#163;34 million was allocated, as a direct result of the Barnett formula, to supporting disabled children and their families. That was a direct result of the pre-Budget statement made towards the end of last year. We cannot account for that money, and it is my belief and the belief of many of my colleagues that the money has gone towards filling a major black hole in the SNP Scottish Executive budget, which has led to the freezing of council tax. It is an admirable concept to freeze council tax, but should it be done at the expense of disabled children? Should it be done, potentially, at the expense of those in rural areas who desperately need public transport?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o450"><a name="80312-0019.htm_para9"><a name="08031255000016">The increase in alcohol duty has been mentioned. I intervened on the hon. Member for Dundee, East (Stewart Hosie) to make the point that his party was in a dilemma, as the SNP Cabinet Secretary for Finance and Sustainable Growth had pleaded with the Chancellor not to increase duty on whisky, whereas the Cabinet Secretary for Justice in Scotland had said that there should be significant increases in the price of alcohol to combat antisocial behaviour and binge drinking.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o451"><a name="80312-0019.htm_para10"><a name="08031255000017">The hon. Member for Ribble Valley (Mr. Evans) has left the Chamber, but I have heard it said more than once in the Chamber this afternoon that by increasing duty the Chancellor was tackling the issue of binge drinking and heavy drinking. The Chancellor&#146;s comments on the increase in duty came to some 135 words, but not once was binge drinking or heavy drinking mentioned. In fact, he summed up by saying: &#147;It is only because I have taken these decisions on alcohol and on closing tax loopholes that I am able to provide additional support for families and lift more children out of poverty.&#148; That, and no other reason, is why there is an increase in the duty on alcohol.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o452"><a name="80312-0019.htm_para11"><a name="08031255000018">As I suggested earlier, my view is that alcohol and its price is only one aspect of what we as a nation need to do to tackle the unsavoury behaviour that we see on many of our streets, in towns, cities and even villages, and on some housing estates.

honest: if there is an increase in the price of alcohol, young people will manage to get their hands on additional money to buy it. We should never forget that sometimes they are not going out to buy it or getting others to buy it; they are taking it from home.</p>

 I am grateful for the opportunity to initiate the debate, and I am revelling in the fact that I have three minutes extra, so I do not have to watch the clock. The Minister, whom I am pleased to see in his place, knows that on occasions, even though I sit on the Opposition Benches, I am trying to be helpful to the Government. This is one of those occasions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o470"><a name="80312-0019.htm_para29"><a name="08031255000039">Everybody admits that some accident and emergency departments are struggling under enormous loads. Ambulances stacking outside have been drawn to our attention in several press reports, national and local, in the past few weeks. I want to try to find out why too many people are coming. Then we can tackle the issue and think of possible cures, as I believe that the problem is not intractable.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o471"><a name="80312-0019.htm_para30"><a name="08031255000040">I start with one example of completely inappropriate use of an accident and emergency department. I know of a lady over the age of 90, living alone, with end stage cancer. She could not cope, so she called her general practitioner. To his credit, he came. Some people have trouble getting their general practitioners to come out. However, he took the easy way out and did not solve the problem. Because she was going to see her specialist the next day, he took no decision and told her to see the specialist.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o472"><a name="80312-0019.htm_para31"><a name="08031255000041">The lady saw her oncologist, and to her great sadness and disappointment, he said, &#147;I&#146;m very sorry. It is impossible to admit you,&#148; so she went home. She was desperate. The only thing she could do was call 999. She was taken to another hospital. She was not well enough to give a full history or details. As well as blocking up the accident and emergency department, she had further investigations and a scan, which she had already had. Sadly and inevitably, she died a few days later. Such situations are absolutely unacceptable, and there are&#151;or should be&#151;ways of avoiding them. The name that I am using may be slightly out of date, but there are multi-agency response, or MARS, teams, which include nurses, therapists and social workers. They are specially designed to be called by a general practitioner or anybody concerned about elderly patients or patients with long-term illnesses in particular.</p>

 MARS teams can be called out to solve the problems of the elderly and those with long-term illnesses, including cancer, so that they can avoid going to A and E departments and being admitted unnecessarily to hospital.

more difficult by the purchaser-provider split, which drove a wedge between GPs and their hospital colleagues. Last night, I was at a meeting of the Royal College of Physicians with several MPs; it has just started a new initiative for the future of care closer to home which it calls &#147;Teams without Walls&#148;. I shall quote one or two extracts from the college&#146;s paper:</p>
<a name="80312-0019.htm_brev1"><a name="08031255000081"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;General practitioners and consultants have traditionally worked together for the benefit of their patients. However in recent years this relationship has been more difficult with an organisational split between primary and secondary care. Now things are changing; new life is being given to the notion that they should work closely together once more.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o476"><a name="80312-0019.htm_para35"><a name="08031255000046">The college has brought together GPs, paediatricians and physicians to plan for those combined services. The paper goes on:</p>
<a name="80312-0019.htm_brev2"><a name="08031255000082"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;We coined the phrase &#145;Teams without Walls&#146;. New teams not bounded by institutions to provide high quality sensitive and accessible care across the primary secondary interface.</p>
</ul><a name="80312-0019.htm_brev3"><a name="08031255000083"><ul><p class="tabletext">There is good evidence to support this approach for long term conditions and the elderly in particular...This is not just about consultants providing sessions in the community, it is about new teams, with specialist nurses, therapists and pharmacists&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o477"><a name="80312-0019.htm_para36"><a name="08031255000047">It is all about working together to keep people away from A and E departments and hospitals when they do not need to go to them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o478"><a name="80312-0019.htm_para37"><a name="08031255000048">A second way to reduce the load on A and E departments is through the effective use of emergency care networks. The network between the really major trauma centre and the ordinary district general hospital A and E department is well worked out. Ambulance workers, doctors and hospitals know that if someone has major burns, head injuries or chest injuries, they do not go to any run-of-the-mill A and E department, but to the local major trauma centre.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o479"><a name="80312-0019.htm_para38"><a name="08031255000049">However, not so well worked out and understood are the much more local networks&#151;on a county-wide basis, for example. A county may have one or two routine and ordinary accident and emergency departments and a number of minor injuries units or urgent care centres. The networks have to work effectively in those centres so that people know that for certain conditions they can go to a minor injury unit and for others they can go to an urgent care centre. Knowing that will keep them out of and away from A and E departments.</p>

There is some good news from my constituency. A report to the acute trust board on 28 February said:</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o482"><a name="80312-0020.htm_para0"><a name="08031255000052">In the same paper, the trust recognises the importance of rotating staff between the A and E department, the urgent care centre and the minor injuries unit. That is absolutely vital in any network so that staff work in all the different departments and know each other. That means that the lesser unit will not be held in lower esteem because it will have the same staff. Moreover, if a patient going to the lesser unit needs to transfer to the major unit, the history taking and investigations are done only once in the lesser unit, sparing the scanning  <br>

department and the X-ray department in the larger unit. That is absolutely contrary to my experience of years ago. I trained about half a mile from here at the old Westminster hospital, which sadly no longer exists. In those days, we used to get a lot of patients coming from out of London. We did not trust the work that had been done in perfectly reputable hospitals outside London, so we repeated all the investigations, which was entirely wrong. That would not happen in really close working networks with shared staff.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o483"><a name="80312-0020.htm_para1"><a name="08031255000053">The report to the trust board about the pilot in my area goes on to say that the trial has demonstrated only modest clinical demand. That is not surprising, because for various reasons the doctor has been put there from 9 to 5 on Mondays to Fridays only. That is when people do not much need the service, because with most sorts of moderate to mild emergencies they can go to their GP. It is vital that it is extended to seven days a week, perhaps from 9 am to 9 pm, to cover the out-of-hours periods that are most important to people. I am pressing for that and pointing out that a doctor on site in the minor injuries unit would ease the problems for the out-of-hours service, because if a doctor were there all the time, the few GPs on call might have to cope only with visits.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o484"><a name="80312-0020.htm_para2"><a name="08031255000054">That brings me to my third suggestion. It is very difficult to get people to the right place. No amount of telling will be recalled by patients or families in an emergency situation, who will just dial 999&#151;that may well be appropriate; if it is life-saving, it obviously is&#151;or take themselves to the nearest hospital regardless of what it is able to provide. I strongly believe that what is needed is a single phone number dedicated to patients and services within each network area of emergency care. The Minister will remember that in a Westminster Hall debate of mine some time ago, to which he responded, I listed the confusing variety of places and phone numbers that patients have the option of calling when they do not know what to do. They can phone NHS Direct or the out-of-hours service, or they can go to a minor injuries unit, a walk-in centre or an A and E department&#151;the list is immense.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o485"><a name="80312-0020.htm_para3"><a name="08031255000055">I advocated, and still advocate, a single number to a triage system such as NHS pathways, which would advise and direct to the appropriate local service for that particular area and that particular patient. Trials of NHS pathways have been under way, and I hope that the Minister will be able to tell the House something about them, as they were due to report last autumn. A single number for specific direction to the appropriate unit would be ideal and would prevent people from going unnecessarily to the A and E department.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o486"><a name="80312-0020.htm_para4"><a name="08031255000056">My fourth suggestion is really a query. Delayed discharges keep beds occupied for the wrong reasons and make admissions to an A and E department more difficult. The Health Committee did a report on this matter during the 2001-02 Session. We went through the reasons and the cures, and the Government said in their response:</p>
<a name="80312-0020.htm_brev0"><a name="08031255000086"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;by March 2002, the delayed discharge rate for patients over 75 had fallen further to 9.4 per cent. We believe that the further reductions in delayed transfers of care that we have seen over the period from October 2001 to March 2002 are sustainable and that the target in the NHS Plan to end widespread delayed discharges by 2004 will be achieved.&#148;</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o488"><a name="80312-0020.htm_para6"><a name="08031255000058">My fifth point, which was drawn to my attention by staff working in A and E departments, is the potential conflict between the 18-week target for elective admissions and the four-hour target for admission from A and E departments. One wonders whether some hospitals favour the 18-week target and use beds for elective patients, rather than attempt to maintain a reasonable bed occupancy rate so that there is slack for emergency admissions through A and E departments. Hospitals running with occupancy rates above 90 per cent. are likely to be in trouble. We come back to my main point that solving the problem involves limiting the number of people who turn up at A and E to those who really need to do so.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o489"><a name="80312-0020.htm_para7"><a name="08031255000059">Finally, I shall outline an extremely unacceptable use of an A and E department, which was just reported to me by a patient&#146;s family. It is so crazy and unbelievable that I have not waited for the trust&#146;s response to the family&#146;s complaint or my letter. An elderly lady was transferred from an acute ward to a less acute ward in the same hospital&#151;probably quite appropriately. In that ward, sadly, she deteriorated, and a doctor&#146;s opinion was sought. Her son-in-law&#151;my constituent&#151;wrote to tell me that because no doctor was available in the unit to deal with her condition, she was transferred by ambulance to the A and E department of the same hospital, where she spent much of the night on a trolley before being transferred to a bed in an acute ward the next morning.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o490"><a name="80312-0020.htm_para8"><a name="08031255000060">That is not just inappropriate use of A and E, but scandalous, inadequate care. No doctor was available to go to her, so in her frail state, at the age of 89, she had to go to A and E. That is totally unacceptable, and points to a basic failure of organisation and a failure to provide adequate numbers of medical staff on call. I hope that it is a unique example, but misuse of A and E departments is rife. I hope that I have given the Minister food for thought, and action, to improve the situation.</p>

 I congratulate the hon. Member for Wyre Forest (Dr. Taylor) on securing this debate, and I welcome the fact that he has taken up the two cases that he raised. I would like to be kept informed of the progress that he or his constituents make in pursuing those complaints; he said that he had made one about the second case he outlined, but it was not quite clear whether he had about the first. Even so, I would be interested to hear from him, because it sounds as if they are cases that have not been handled well, to say the least.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o491"><a name="80312-0020.htm_para9"><a name="08031255000062">Before I move on to some of the hon. Gentleman&#146;s key points, I would like to reflect on the huge national transformation we have seen in recent years in accident and emergency departments. In 2003, almost a quarter of patients waited for more than four hours in accident and emergency departments in England. In 2006-07, more than 98 per cent. of patients in England were seen, diagnosed and treated within four hours of their arrival. There has been a revolution in patient care. We should  <br>

no longer allow patients to spend many hours&#151;or even days, as some used to do&#151;in A and E. That transformation has been achieved thanks to the hard work and professionalism of thousands of front-line NHS staff&#151;not only doctors, but nurses and the full range of NHS staff.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o492"><a name="80312-0020.htm_para10"><a name="08031255000063">In addition, our drive to eliminate long waits in  A and E has made the whole health and social care system work together in new and better ways, resulting in faster access to treatment for patients. When patients are surveyed, they tell us that A and E is better than ever. In the latest independent Healthcare Commission survey, which was published in 2005, eight patients  out of 10 said that they had had a good experience in  A and E departments.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o493"><a name="80312-0020.htm_para11"><a name="08031255000064">However, as the hon. Gentleman rightly highlighted, A and E departments are busy. In 2006-07 there were some 18.9 million attendances at all types of A and E, and 3 million emergency admissions via major A and E departments. They are one of the few NHS services that have their doors open 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, dealing with a multitude of different conditions and issues. However, against that backdrop, A and E services continue to provide responsive, high-quality and timely care to patients. That is partly thanks to the increase in medical staff working in A and E. The last NHS work force census on 30 September 2006 shows that there were 4,714 medical staff working in A and E, including consultants&#151;an increase of 61.8 per cent. since 1997. Health service spending by commissioners on A and E has increased by 125 per cent. since 1997, from almost &#163;750 million in 1997-98 to nearly &#163;1.7 billion in 2006-07.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o494"><a name="80312-0020.htm_para12"><a name="08031255000065">We recognise that there will be fluctuations in demand for A and E services. However, the NHS routinely plans for such changes and it is for services locally to decide what arrangements to put in place to deal with any changes in attendances to ensure that patients can regularly access high-quality, timely care. It is also worth noting that the rate of growth in attendances at A and E is now slowing. The annual growth rate in 2006-07 was less than 1 per cent.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o495"><a name="80312-0020.htm_para13"><a name="08031255000066">However, as the hon. Gentleman said, one of the key considerations is to view A and E activity in the context of other aspects of NHS patient contact and other services that deal with urgent and emergency needs. As he pointed out, people have several options if they need to access care: they can call an ambulance, or visit  A and E, a minor injuries unit or a walk-in centre. They can also make a same-day appointment with their GP, or call NHS Direct or their local out-of-hours primary care service. Community services such as pharmacists, community mental health teams and community social services can also play a role.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o496"><a name="80312-0020.htm_para14"><a name="08031255000067">Those other services provide a lot of care. For example, although there were more than 18 million attendances at all types of A and E services during 2006-07, and more than 13 million were at type 1&#151;major&#151;A and E departments, there are nearly 900,000 general practice consultations a day, equating to around 290 million GP practice-based appointments a year. Many of those services provide crucial care to patients to help them manage their condition without having to resort to urgent or emergency care later. Indeed, as the hon. Gentleman said, some people have a range of complex  <br>


<meta name="Date" content="12 Mar 2008">

<notus-date day="12" month="3" year="2008" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><b>12 Mar 2008 : Column 388</b><br>
health and social care needs, and simple problems can cause their condition to deteriorate rapidly, putting them at risk of needing to attend A and E, and possible emergency hospital admission.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o497"><a name="80312-0020.htm_para15"><a name="08031255000068">Case management, which I believe is a modern way to describe the sort of multi-agency response teams that the hon. Gentleman mentioned, can provide improved preventive and tailored packages of care to people at risk of unnecessary attendance at A and E or admission to hospital. That is a fundamental element of the Government&#146;s overall strategy for improving care and outcomes for people, especially those with long-term conditions, along with the target to reduce emergency bed days by 5 per cent. by 2008, through better primary care and community settings.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o498"><a name="80312-0020.htm_para16"><a name="08031255000069">Case management, led by a community matron or a case manager, should provide intensive, ongoing, personalised care with a focus on prevention and integrated working between health and social care professionals. The community matron or case manager should take the lead in co-ordinating services, which are provided as far as possible in the community setting, supporting people to live in their own homes and communities. For the service to be most effective, the community matron must integrate with other parts of the health and social care system by working alongside GPs and others in the primary health care team, as well as the local acute trust, mental health care providers and social services.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o499"><a name="80312-0020.htm_para17"><a name="08031255000070">NHS and social care organisations have already made a major impact, by reducing emergency bed days in 2006-07 by 10.1 per cent. over the baseline year of 2003-04, meaning that the reduction target has been significantly exceeded. Continued efforts and reform are crucial to maintain those improvements in care in all parts of the country and to sustain bed day reductions in future.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o500"><a name="80312-0020.htm_para18"><a name="08031255000071">One of the Government&#146;s commitments is that by this year we expect all PCTs and local authorities to establish joint health and social care networks and teams to support those with long-term conditions who have the most complex needs. We will issue guidance later this spring to embed integrated working and standardise it across the country. Integrated team working will benefit a range of individuals, not just those with long-term conditions, and there are a range of other services and teams across the NHS and social care that provide valuable support.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o501"><a name="80312-0020.htm_para19"><a name="08031255000072">I recently visited a good model of that kind of care, at the Calne health centre in Wiltshire&#151;a rural county, like the hon. Gentleman&#146;s&#151;where I met the neighbourhood nursing team. It was providing an excellent service, so patients did not have to make long unnecessary journeys to hospital, and emergency admissions were not delayed. Instead, patients received excellent care from those teams of nurses in their own homes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o502"><a name="80312-0020.htm_para20"><a name="08031255000073">We need to ensure that all parts of the urgent and emergency care system provide the most timely and appropriate care for patients, and that there is integrated provision that makes sense to patients. As the hon. Gentleman said, we also need to ensure that wherever patients access care, they get a robust and consistent assessment of the urgency of their need. As the hon. Gentleman reminded us, he has shown interest in the work under way to pilot a potential assessment  <br>

tool, NHS pathways. We hope to have the outcome of that evaluation in the first half of this year&#151;not, to correct him, last autumn.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o503"><a name="80312-0020.htm_para21"><a name="08031255000074">Although much has been done, the NHS Next Stage review will ensure that things are driven even further forward. As hon. Members will know, last year the Prime Minister invited Lord Darzi to conduct a review of the next stages in the development of the NHS. At the local level, each strategic health authority has set up working groups of local clinicians and other NHS staff to develop their vision of world-class services in their area. That will include a vision for acute services and for a number of other pathways that can have an impact on A and E, such as long-term conditions. Those visions will be developed with clinicians, based on their own experience and combined with the best clinical evidence available.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o504"><a name="80312-0020.htm_para22"><a name="08031255000075">It is also clear that local health commissioners and providers need to continue working together to ensure that patients can navigate their way through the system of urgent and emergency care services. It is important for people both to have straightforward information, clearly communicated, about what to do in an urgent or emergency situation, and to be aware of the options available.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o505"><a name="80312-0020.htm_para23"><a name="08031255000076">In connection with that, we want to simplify access to urgent care services. We are, as the hon. Gentleman requested, exploring the possibility of introducing a three-digit number to sit alongside the emergency services  <br>


<meta name="Date" content="12 Mar 2008">

number, 999. That number would need to be memorable for the public. Users would need to be confident that they would get a rapid and safe assessment of their needs and an appropriate response to meet them. As stated in my noble Friend Lord Darzi&#146;s interim report, the Department has been pressing ahead with preliminary feasibility discussions with Ofcom, the telecoms regulator. A number of technical issues concerning the provision of a three-digit number still need to be addressed. Ofcom will also need to consult formally on any proposals to introduce such a number, but we are making good progress in our discussions with Ofcom, and I feel confident that that can be achieved.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o506"><a name="80312-0020.htm_para24"><a name="08031255000077">In conclusion, I am sure that the hon. Gentleman will join me in congratulating the staff who work in A and E departments up and down the country to ensure that patients are seen and treated in a timely way, on their hard work and continued dedication, and in welcoming the huge contribution that a range of other services and staff make in supporting people to live at home and be cared for in the community. I very much regret the examples that he raised this evening, and I would be grateful if he could keep me informed on the progress of his complaints. I share with him a wish to see an integrated and seamless service that does not let people down, and which patients want. That is the service that we are determined to provide for them.</p>
