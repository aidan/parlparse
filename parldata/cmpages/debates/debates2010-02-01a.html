 In keeping with the 100th anniversary of the labour exchange, which is today, we are continuing to modernise communications with Jobcentre Plus to make it easier for millions of people to get in touch about their benefit or seeking work. We have been concerned for some time that people calling on mobile phones were being charged a lot for calls to claim benefits which would be free from landlines, so we have recently negotiated a deal with the major mobile phone companies that their customers should also not be charged for calling 0800 numbers, and we are looking at what further steps we can take.</p>

 I am grateful to my right hon. Friend for that response, and particularly for her reference to the anniversary of labour exchanges. My constituents and my local citizens advice bureau have complained to me about the use of 0845 numbers in jobcentres. Claimants seem to wait a very long time before their query is dealt with. Although jobcentres offer to call claimants back, by that time they have spent a considerable amount of money dealing with that telephone inquiry. Can the Government move away from 0845 numbers altogether?</p>

 My hon. Friend raises an important point. I have asked for all the phone lines to be reviewed now that we have made important progress. I think he would agree that the first step was to get the deal with mobile phone companies so that people were not being charged for the important calls setting up their benefit claims, which can be the longest calls that people make. The 0845 numbers have traditionally been used for shorter calls, and as my hon. Friend rightly says, Jobcentre Plus will call back any customer who is concerned about the cost of calls, but I have asked the Department to look at what further we can do to support all our customers. He will appreciate that cost always has to be taken into account, but we want to make it as easy as possible for people to get the help that they need, particularly to get back into employment.</p>

 I congratulate the staff of jobcentres on their centenary year and thank them for their very hard work. At a time when the Government have been closing a jobcentre a week and some 35,000 people are being fed by food banks, it is vital that people can get through to the social fund easily. So why is it that the most vulnerable people often have less than 2 per cent. of their calls answered-a far worse rate than at the Child Support Agency, for example-and what are the Government going to do about it?</p>

Despite the recession, it refuses to back the additional investment and the additional staff that we have put into jobcentres to help people get back into work. He makes an important point about the social fund. We have been increasing the support to make sure that it is much easier for people to get through when they need crisis loans. It is important that people should get access to the help that they need. That is why the position on telephone calls has improved significantly.</p>

 My hon. Friend makes an important point. We provide additional training to make sure that staff are aware of all the kinds of help that people might need if they have disabilities. Also, where appropriate, we make home visits and personal visits, and offer appointments as well as accepting claims by phone. We want people to have the widest range of access to Jobcentre Plus, in a way that meets their personal needs and circumstances.</p>

 On the final point, there is an appeals process. Most of the decisions made by the Department are upheld-more than 60 per cent. The employment and support allowance and the work capability assessment are part of the reform programme that we have instigated over a number of years. As the hon. Lady will remember, between the 1980s and the 1990s the numbers on incapacity benefit doubled. People were out of work and put on sickness benefit. We have arrested that rise since 2003 and we have seen the numbers fall.</p>

 I am grateful to my hon. Friend for his question, because some people-most notably the Opposition-try to pretend that we have historically high figures compared with our international competitors. However, in October 2009 the youth unemployment rate-for 15 to 24-year-olds-for example, was 19.8 per cent. in the United Kingdom, 21.1 per cent. in the European Union, 26.6 per cent. in Italy, 42.8 per cent. in Spain and 25.2 per cent. in France. A range of different international competitors have not been able to respond as effectively as we have, and that is a tribute to the many workers throughout the country who have helped businesses to survive by being willing to work shorter hours and take pay cuts.

We are also pleased to see that, despite the recession, the inactivity rate is moving in the right direction, which is unprecedented. In previous recessions, as we heard, inactivity soared; in this recession it has remained broadly constant. In 1985 in Wales, the inactivity rate was 28.2 per cent.; in 1993, it was 26.1 per cent., and it is now 24.2 per cent.</p>

 I know that the hon. Gentleman is a fair Member of the House, and I hope that he acknowledges that the tripling of cold weather payments this year has helped enormously. We have made more than 10 million payments, costing £271 million, to the most vulnerable, as well as to pensioners. In his own constituency, there have been four triggers of cold weather payments, which means that people in the group that he is obviously concerned about-I share his concern-have already had an extra £100 in four cold weather payments to help them through this exceptionally cold winter. We will consider doing more. However, I merely say that when we came into government, £60 million was spent on helping pensioners with their fuel bills, whereas we are now spending £2.7 billion on winter fuel payments alone.

 While welcoming the tripling of the cold weather payments, which has made a huge difference-I am sure that this weekend there will be another trigger in my constituency because we have had another 3 or 4 inches of snow-the problem for pensioners is that they do not know that they are going to get the payment because they do not know that it has been triggered. As a result of the scare stories that they are seeing in the media, they are not heating their houses sufficiently because they do not know that they are going to get the money. What would my hon.

 Most pensioners' savings income comprises a relatively small proportion of their overall income: 70 per cent. of pensioners receive less than £10 a week or no income from investments. However, I hope that my hon. Friend will welcome the fact that, for those who have such income, my right hon. Friend the Chancellor increased the capital disregard in pension credit and pensioner-related housing and council tax benefit from £6,000 to £10,000 last November.

We have set out in that policy when people will be able to get, for example, better access to work, which the review suggested and we accepted. We have specialist staff in our jobcentres and we expect to see people with mental health conditions, which could mean a range of conditions. We have developed specialist help. The access to work scheme is helping people-£15 million was spent when the Opposition were in government, but that has risen to £137 million. We have done that in partnership with Mind, which has welcomed the arrangements, and a range of disability organisations in that sector has helped us.

 I know that my hon.

He will know that overall youth unemployment fell by 16,000 in the most recent figures and the claimant count fell by 7,000. It is worth noting that youth unemployment in the 1990s rose for a year and a half after the recession finished, and that in the '80s, it rose for four years after the recession finished. We are determined not to let that happen this time.</p>

The Government announced the young person's guarantee in April last year, but it will not be fully up and running until April this year. With one in five young people unable to find a job, why has it taken the Government two years since the start of the recession to give extra help to the young unemployed?</p>

that was 871,000 and in the mid-1980s it was more than 1 million. So the figure is half that of the mid-1980s, as a result of the additional investment that we have put in to help young people through the recession.</p>

 Youth unemployment on the International Labour Organisation count has gone up by more than 300,000 since Labour came into power in 1997. The young person's guarantee is virtually identical to the new deal for young people, which for many was a revolving door on to benefits. Indeed, the right hon. Member for Birkenhead (Mr. Field) described the performance of the new deal for young people as derisory. Last year, fewer than one in four young people on the new deal found a job. Unlike our work programme, the young person's guarantee is not aimed at getting young people into sustainable work. Is not the only conclusion that Ministers are only interested in saving their own jobs, not in giving real help to young people?</p>

 Again, the right hon. Lady talks nonsense. The ILO figures include people who are in full-time education but may also be looking for a part-time job, perhaps bar work. If we exclude the number in full-time education-which has rightly increased as a result of the action that this Government have taken-the figures today are 658,000 unemployed, compared with 832,000 in 1993 and again more than 1 million in 1985.</p>

The future jobs fund is providing a range of quality career opportunities for young people to get on the first step of the ladder. It is tragic that she wants to oppose that. She says that she wants her own work programme instead, but she could not fund it, because her party would cut £5 billion that we are putting in to support the unemployed.</p>

 I am happy to offer an answer. The total pension deficit liability in the public sector is, off the top of my head, close to £600-odd billion, but this has to be seen in context. The pension liabilities are calculated over the next 80 years. In that context, it has to be borne in mind that the average size of a public sector pension is £4,000 to £5,000.</p>

 It is obvious that the Government do not have a clue. They cannot even find a Department to answer the question, so let me provide the answer. Outside agencies estimate that the public sector deficit liability is about £1 trillion, which is £1,000 billion. In the pre-Budget report, the Government were going to get that down by only £1 billion, which is one tenth of 1 per cent. Is it not obvious that in this area of policy and many others we need a change of Government to get the answers?</p>

 The right hon. Gentleman persists in scaremongering about the provision of public sector pensions for millions of low-paid public sector workers. As I have said, the average pension payment is £5,000 a year. Those liabilities are perfectly sustainable and comprise between 1.5 and 2 per cent. of GDP. If the right hon. Gentleman is telling the House that the Opposition do not think that that is sustainable, what he is saying to the electorate in the forthcoming election is that they will take away the public sector pension provision of millions of public sector workers who are out there working hard to keep our public services going in difficult times-and that, Mr. Speaker, is an absolute disgrace.</p>

An example was a doctor who had been retired for almost 10 years taking away the benefits from a young man who had had serious Asperger's syndrome recorded on his medical records for almost 20 years.

 We complete more than 30,000 assessments every month. With the new regime, we will see fewer people on employment and support allowance than on incapacity benefit. We are clear that that is the right way forward. I understand that hon. Members have constituency concerns, however, which is why I have arranged a seminar in which we can set out in detail how these assessments are meant to be performed. When there is a complaint or a concern about a particular individual, that individual is looked into and properly checked. If my hon.

 We always listen most carefully to the views of the hon. Gentleman, because, as chair of the all-party group on the trafficking of women and children, he knows a lot about this issue. I should like to bring him up to date. In 2009, a joint communiqué was issued by the Refugee Council and Jobcentre Plus. The operational framework is now being reviewed, and there will be further meetings in February and March. In addition, I think that the hon.

 The proportion of children in relative poverty in the UK for the period 2007-08 was 23 per cent. For the period 2005-06 to 2007-08 the figure for London as a whole was also 23 per cent. The figures for inner London and outer London were 27 per cent. and 20 per cent. respectively.</p>

 I thought that I had just explained that the figure was closer to one in four, but I agree with the hon. Gentleman's basic point that this is a major problem in London. A major reason for it is that parental employment is 8 per cent. lower than it is in the rest of the country. The London child poverty delivery group, which I chaired in the summer, is driving forward programmes on three key things: increasing the supply of part-time vacancies, increasing the take-up of tax credits and increasing the use of formal child care.</p>

 Of course my hon. Friend is absolutely right. Families in which either a child or an adult is disabled are more likely to suffer. In order to deal with that, we have an extra element in the child tax credit system so that people can pay for child care for disabled children, which is often more expensive.</p>

 My hon. Friend makes an extremely important point. We know that some people who undertake the work capability assessment and are found to be able to work may still have a health condition that makes things difficult for them in some form or another, or that may affect their attitude to work. It is important that they get appropriate help and support. That is exactly why we are looking again at the pathways programme-at how it works and to whom it applies-and at what kind of support people should have, regardless of what kind of benefit they are on.</p>

 Mr Speaker, with your permission I will make a statement on the Afghanistan conference that took place on 28 January and the Yemen meeting the previous day.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o5"><a name="100201-0004.htm_para0"><a name="10020113000168">It is a grim but important feature of all discussion on Afghanistan that we remember the loss of life-coalition and Afghan-in the last eight years. As I saw for myself again two weeks ago in Kandahar, Lashkar Gah and Kabul, British troops are showing fortitude beyond measure, and their families support beyond compare, both of which deserve the recognition of the whole nation. The stakes are high not only for those serving in Afghanistan but for all the Afghan people, for the south Asian region, for the credibility of the NATO alliance, and, ultimately, for our national security.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o6"><a name="100201-0004.htm_para1"><a name="10020113000169">As I explained when I spoke in this House on 14 January, 2010 will be a decisive year for Afghanistan. With a new Government, a refreshed counter-insurgency strategy, and a commitment to increase international troop numbers by some 60,000, the Afghans and their allies now have the chance to reverse the momentum of the insurgency, if the military and civilian effort is directed towards a durable political settlement in Afghanistan.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o7"><a name="100201-0004.htm_para2"><a name="10020113000170">That was the impetus behind my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister's decision to convene the London conference.</p>

<p><a name="st_o110"><a name="10020113000171"><a name="100201-0004.htm_spnew4"><a name="10020113000949"><b>Mr. Bernard Jenkin (North Essex) (Con):</b>

 He is in Northern Ireland, actually.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o8"><a name="100201-0004.htm_para3"><a name="10020113000173">Our aim was to mobilise international resources-military and civilian-behind a clear political strategy to help to deliver the ambitious agenda that President Karzai set out at his inauguration last November. Our goals are threefold: first, to win over the active support of more of the Afghan population; secondly, to split the insurgency; and, thirdly, to encourage Afghanistan's neighbours to become part of the solution. Following my consultations in Pakistan, Afghanistan, Washington, Istanbul and Brussels, representatives from more than 70 countries and international organisations travelled to London to attend the conference. The communiqué, which was agreed among all conference participants, provides the detail of what was agreed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o9"><a name="100201-0004.htm_para4"><a name="10020113000174">First, in respect of security, the focus was on the Afghan national security forces. The growth and development of the indigenous security forces are intended to give the Afghan population the confidence to resist Taliban intimidation and bribery. Afghanistan now has almost 200,000 soldiers and police, and they are already assuming greater responsibility for military operations, but the London conference agreed new, more ambitious targets to increase the Afghan national security forces by more than 50 per cent. by October 2011 by training 70,000 additional members of the Afghan national army and 38,000 more police.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o10"><a name="100201-0004.htm_para5"><a name="10020113000175">The conference also marked the beginning of the transition process, by agreeing the necessary conditions under which we can begin, district by district and province by province, the process of transferring responsibility for security from international forces to Afghan forces.  <br>


<meta name="Date" content="1 Feb 2010">

<notus-date day="1" month="2" year="2010" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><b>1 Feb 2010 : Column 24</b><br>
The intention is for some provinces to transition by late 2010 or early 2011, on the road to meeting President Karzai's target that within three years Afghans should have taken the lead and be conducting the majority of operations in insecure areas. The additional troops-Afghan and international-will mean that the insurgency will come under increasing military pressure. President Karzai is launching a peace and reintegration programme for those who can be persuaded to switch sides; the rest will face growing military danger. It is essential that all the ethnic groups of Afghanistan are given a route back into Afghan society, as long as they respect the Afghan constitution and break links with al-Qaeda-we support all effort towards this goal. The Peace and Reintegration Trust Fund announced last Thursday is the vehicle through which the international community will provide financial assistance, and some $140 million has already been pledged for the first year.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o11"><a name="100201-0004.htm_para6"><a name="10020113000176">Governance and development was the second priority for the London conference. Local and provincial government in Afghanistan is chronically weak; less than a quarter of Afghanistan's 364 governors have electricity in their offices and some receive only $6 a month in expenses. That is why the conference agreed to provide additional support to train, over the next two years, 12,000 sub-national civil servants in core administrative functions vital to the exercise of local and provincial power. However, if the Afghan Government are to win the support of more of the population, they need to govern in the population's interests, so the commitments that the Government made at the conference to take steps to end the culture of impunity are important. They have promised to do the following: first, to strengthen the independent High Office of Oversight in order to investigate and sanction corrupt officials; secondly, to bring their laws in line with the UN convention against corruption; and thirdly, to invite a group of Afghan and international experts to develop benchmarks for progress and report regularly against those benchmarks-their first visit will take place within the next three months.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o12"><a name="100201-0004.htm_para7"><a name="10020113000177">Those promises must be translated into rapid action. The international community again pledged its support on Thursday, and for the first time it said that, once key conditions are met, it will increase the proportion of development assistance channelled through the Afghan Government, and will support the Government to meet those conditions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o13"><a name="100201-0004.htm_para8"><a name="10020113000178">Development assistance is important in its own right in Afghanistan, which is the fourth poorest country in the world, but it will also help to draw people away from the insurgency and the drugs trade. That is the significance of Thursday's announcement that Afghanistan will receive up to $1.6 billion extra in debt relief from major creditors and that there will be a new International Monetary Fund programme from June 2010. The legal economy-notably agriculture-needs substantial support, and progress in reducing drug production is important in that respect, as well as in its own right.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o14"><a name="100201-0004.htm_para9"><a name="10020113000179">The third element is relations between the countries of the region. The situation in Afghanistan threatens to destabilise the whole of south Asia: crime, drugs, terrorism and migration spill across borders. There is a growing awareness within the region that the status quo in Afghanistan benefits nobody. Afghanistan's neighbours also increasingly accept that no country within the region, let alone the international community, will allow Afghanistan to become a client state.</p>
<br>

<notus-date day="1" month="2" year="2010" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><b>1 Feb 2010 : Column 25</b><br>

<p><a name="stpa_o15"><a name="100201-0004.htm_para10"><a name="10020113000180">In these twin changes-a recognition that a client state is out of reach for all and that an unstable state is damaging for all-is the seed of a shared interest. That shared interest should be the basis of greater regional co-operation. Each neighbour needs to know that their restraint and co-operation will be reciprocated so they need reassurances about each other's behaviour and intentions. That is why last Tuesday I attended the regional summit in Istanbul to discuss how Afghanistan's neighbours can support stability in Afghanistan and enhance regional co-operation. At the London conference the Afghan Government requested that the relevant regional bodies develop a co-ordinated plan for Afghanistan's regional engagement as soon as possible. The prize of regional co-operation is immense: Afghanistan's neighbours will cut off the lines of funding, support and shelter that stretch across Afghanistan's borders.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o16"><a name="100201-0004.htm_para11"><a name="10020113000181">This political strategy and the agreements reached on Thursday need to be pursued with drive, determination and without delay. The Afghan Government will host a further conference in Kabul later this spring. By then, President Karzai will need to have made real progress on security, governance and development.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o17"><a name="100201-0004.htm_para12"><a name="10020113000182">The international community also has an important role to play in ensuring effective implementation. That is why three new international appointments are being made: at the UN, where there is an upgraded Senior Representative; in NATO, where the NATO Secretary-General has created a new NATO Senior Civilian Representative to strengthen the co-ordination of development and governance work with the military effort-our ambassador in Kabul, Mark Sedwill, took up this role on Thursday-and in the EU to create greater unity of civilian command.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o18"><a name="100201-0004.htm_para13"><a name="10020113000183">Afghanistan and Yemen are 2,000 miles apart. They have diverse histories, different cultures and are fighting different enemies, but there are common themes. In both cases the lack of development, weak governance and absence of security provide a vacuum for extremists who threaten our shores. In both cases, these underlying long-term causes must be addressed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o19"><a name="100201-0004.htm_para14"><a name="10020113000184">The purpose of the London meeting on Yemen on 27 January, as agreed with President Saleh of Yemen, was threefold: first, to forge international consensus about the challenges the country faces; secondly, to build impetus behind the economic and political reform agenda; and thirdly, to improve international co-ordination of support for the Yemeni people and Government.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o20"><a name="100201-0004.htm_para15"><a name="10020113000185">The Government of Yemen were represented by Prime Minister Mujawar. The Foreign Ministers from the Gulf Co-operation Council countries and the key regional and international partner nations all participated alongside representatives of the EU, the UN, the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and other international institutions. Prime Minister Mujawar gave an honest appraisal of the challenges his country faces-"brutally honest", in the words of the US Secretary of State. The threat from al-Qaeda has put Yemen in the headlines but it has long been the poorest country in the Arab world, with a rapidly growing population, fast dwindling oil and water reserves, an armed conflict in the north and increasing civil instability in the south.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o21"><a name="100201-0004.htm_para16"><a name="10020113000186">All present were clear that responsibility for tackling those challenges lay first and foremost with the Yemeni Government, but decisions were taken to upgrade international support in five important respects. First,  <br>


<meta name="Date" content="1 Feb 2010">

<notus-date day="1" month="2" year="2010" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><b>1 Feb 2010 : Column 26</b><br>
all present committed to support the Government of Yemen in the fight against al-Qaeda. The meeting welcomed the recent UN sanctions committee decisions on designation and called on all states to enforce the terms of the designation under UN Security Council resolution 1267.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o22"><a name="100201-0004.htm_para17"><a name="10020113000187">Secondly, the meeting agreed to engage in further helping Yemen to address its broader security challenges, including through increased international support for the Yemen coastguard. Thirdly, Prime Minister Mujawar confirmed that his Government would continue to pursue their reform agenda, notably on economic reform, and start discussion of an IMF programme. The director of the IMF made a compelling case for the way in which economic reform could be supported by the IMF. Fourthly, participants agreed concrete actions to improve the disbursement of aid, an issue that was raised when we discussed this matter in the House two weeks ago. The GCC Secretary-General called a meeting of Gulf and other international donors to share analysis of the barriers to effective aid disbursement and establish a joint dialogue with the Government of Yemen on their reform priorities. The meeting will take place in Riyadh on 27 and 28 February.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o23"><a name="100201-0004.htm_para18"><a name="10020113000188">Finally, the 25 countries and organisations represented also agreed to establish a Friends of Yemen group to help the Government implement their national reform agenda. Two working groups on economy and governance and justice and law enforcement will report at the first Friends of Yemen meeting.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o24"><a name="100201-0004.htm_para19"><a name="10020113000189">Conferences and meetings can seem-and are-a long way from the daily danger of improvised explosive devices in Lashkar Gah or the 40 per cent. unemployment rate in Yemen, but neither problem will be resolved without coherent plans confidently advanced by sovereign Governments with huge support from the international community. As a result of last week's efforts, there is a new confidence and clarity. The test is to turn these words into deeds. That is what we are now committed to doing.</p>

<p><a name="st_o112"><a name="10020113000190"><a name="100201-0004.htm_spnew6"><a name="10020113000951"><b>Mr. William Hague (Richmond, Yorks) (Con):</b>
 I thank the Foreign Secretary for his statement. Before turning to Afghanistan, may I ask a couple of questions about the meeting on Yemen? We welcome both that meeting and the creation of a Friends of Yemen group, but is he confident that the Government of Yemen will take the urgent and concrete action on political and economic reform that they pledged to take when they were at the meeting? Did he detect a willingness from our European and other international allies to devote resources to the sort of specific initiatives that Britain and the United States have started in Yemen to buttress those efforts?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o25"><a name="100201-0004.htm_para20"><a name="10020113000191">I join the Foreign Secretary in paying tribute to the men and women who are serving in Afghanistan, whose work I have also seen for myself in recent weeks. I also pay tribute to their families here in Britain and to the 251 service personnel who have given their lives. I agree with his description of 2010 as a "decisive year" for Afghanistan. We welcome the hosting of the conference in London, and we support its conclusions. Like the Government, we are committed to ensuring that there is sufficient stability in Afghanistan for Afghans to look after their own security without presenting a danger to the rest of the world. To that end, the strategy that has been adopted in recent months must be given time and support to succeed, and must be accompanied by a viable political process alongside our military efforts.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o26"><a name="100201-0004.htm_para21"><a name="10020113000192">I want to ask about three main areas: the military strategy, the political strategy and the transition to Afghan control. On the military strategy, we welcome the decisions taken by other countries to commit additional manpower. Can the Foreign Secretary say how many of the 9,000 additional non-US forces that have been announced will be stationed in the south, where the heaviest fighting is? Will every effort be made to ensure that the use of those forces will not be hampered by restrictive rules of engagement? One new benchmark is the achievement of a total of 300,000 Afghan security forces by October next year. Can he tell us the projected cost of that expansion? Is he satisfied that the Afghan state will be able to meet the cost that that will entail over the long term? Can he assure the House that NATO trainers and mentors will be in place in sufficient numbers to achieve that target? The conference communiqué urges countries to provide more support for the reform of the Afghan national police. Can he say when the detail of that support will be fleshed out? Can he confirm that there is still no agreed national strategy for the reform of the police? When does he expect that finally to be in place? On the civilian aspects of the strategy, we welcome the appointment of a new NATO Civilian Representative and a new UN special representative. As it is also intended that there will be a new EU special representative with strengthened powers, what mechanism is being put in place to co-ordinate the work of those three officials to avoid the duplication that has happened in the past?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o27"><a name="100201-0004.htm_para22"><a name="10020113000193">On the political strategy, does the Foreign Secretary agree that the fairness and credibility of the elections that are now scheduled for September are of huge importance, given what happened in the presidential elections? Does he think it is the true intention of the Afghan authorities to run a seriously improved electoral process? How will confidence be given to opposition parties that they will be given a fair chance to compete in those elections? Corruption is one of the key problems that needs to be addressed by the Karzai Government. The communiqué talks about</p>

</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o28"><a name="100201-0004.htm_para23"><a name="10020113000194">Can he shed some light on the composition and powers that are intended for that office?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o29"><a name="100201-0004.htm_para24"><a name="10020113000195">As the Foreign Secretary has said, at the conference there was a major focus on the new Peace and Reintegration Trust Fund. Can he provide more detail about how the expenditure of that huge amount of money will be overseen? Who will be responsible for the distribution of the funds at a regional level, and how will oversight be ensured? Is he confident that the scheme will be designed to avoid creating perverse incentives for non-combatants to join the insurgency in order to benefit from the fund later?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o30"><a name="100201-0004.htm_para25"><a name="10020113000196">In his evidence to the US Senate Foreign Relations Committee last week, the Foreign Secretary proposed "relocation and deradicalisation programmes" for former Taliban members. Can he say whether such programmes have now been agreed and, if so, where they will take place and whether any lead nation will take responsibility for them? It is well known that Taliban elements operate in Pakistan's border area, posing a threat to both Afghanistan and Pakistan. Does he therefore envisage any of those funds being channelled  <br>

to the Pakistani Government for the same purposes, or will we encourage that Government to make their own arrangements?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o31"><a name="100201-0004.htm_para26"><a name="10020113000197">On the final issue-the handover-the conference said that a number of provinces, but an unspecified number, would be transferred to Afghan control by the end of this year or by the start of 2011. Can the Foreign Secretary say whether that timetable has slipped, given the Prime Minister's specific commitment in November that five Afghan provinces needed to transferred by the end of 2010? The communiqué says that the goal is that Afghan forces take responsibility for physical security within five years, but President Karzai says that the training and equipping of Afghan security forces may take up to 10 years and that they will need outside assistance for up to 15 years. Does the Foreign Secretary share those assessments?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o32"><a name="100201-0004.htm_para27"><a name="10020113000198">The goals set at the London conference are important and worth while in our view, but we must remember that many of the commitments made at the last London conference on Afghanistan in 2006 have never been met.

 I am grateful to the right hon. Gentleman for his broad welcome for the strategies that have been developed in respect of Yemen and Afghanistan.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o33"><a name="100201-0004.htm_para28"><a name="10020113000200">On confidence about the implementation of the plans agreed by the Government of Yemen, such confidence should be born of the deeds rather than the words that have been used. It is obviously better for words to be used than not to be used; but in the end, one learns to look for actions, rather than words, to give real confidence. However, the depth of the problems that Yemen faces and the remarkable document that the Government of Yemen produced about those problems suggest that no one can accuse them of being in denial.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o34"><a name="100201-0004.htm_para29"><a name="10020113000201">On the devotion of resources, notably by European countries, the right hon. Gentleman allowed, unusually for him, a degree of scepticism to emerge about what he thought other European countries might be doing. That would come rather amiss to the German and Dutch contributors to the development effort in Yemen. After all, their contributions are on a par with ours, and that commitment is welcome. So I am sorry to disappoint him, but there is no division in Europe on this issue or on its importance.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o35"><a name="100201-0004.htm_para30"><a name="10020113000202">On Afghanistan, the right hon. Gentleman rightly raised the need for additional manpower and for caveats to be lifted. I therefore think that it is worth putting on record the fact that the German Government announced last week not only an extra 500 troops-rising, I think, to 900 for the elections-but the removal of their caveats. That is the sort of decision that we welcome and want to be taken much more widely.</p>

from outside, but, obviously, the twin track of a military strategy and a civilian strategy, including an economic one, is very important. Certainly, current estimates are that we-at least, the international community-will have to support the Afghan security effort for some time to come.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o37"><a name="100201-0005.htm_para1"><a name="10020113000204">In respect of NATO mentors and trainers, the most recent concern has been for Afghan troops to be delivered, mentored and trained. I am pleased about the way in which the NATO training effort is now working. The mentoring and partnering strategy takes us a long way forward.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o38"><a name="100201-0005.htm_para2"><a name="10020113000205">In respect of the police, I will send the right hon. Gentleman the national strategy that was recently published by the Interior Ministry of the Government of Afghanistan. I commend the national strategy to him. He may have met Interior Minister Atmar-perhaps he has not-who has been responsible for the Afghan national police force for a year or 18 months and is doing an excellent job.</p>

On the relationship with the NATO and UN command, the right hon. Gentleman will know that the UN is superordinate in its role in any country-it is the apex of the international effort-but it will have a different role from that of the NATO Senior Civilian Representative, whose job is to combine military and civilian efforts.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o40"><a name="100201-0005.htm_para4"><a name="10020113000207">On the elections, it is clear that, for reasons of both security and electoral reform, it was hard to see those elections taking place on 22 May, which was the first date suggested. The need for reform in the intervening months to September is essential. The Opposition parties want elections but those can take place only if progress is made on reform, and we are working on that.</p>

Gentleman is right to point out that the detailed implementation of this policy will be critical to its effectiveness. The purposes of the fund, which are to provide employment, to provide security and to force the pace on the deradicalisation agenda, are the right outcomes. He asked who was the lead nation. The lead nation must be Afghanistan. The concept of lead nationhood was applied to G8 nations after the 2003 Bonn conference, but I think we have a much clearer method now of putting the Afghans in the lead and of ensuring the right balance between international and Afghan responsibility.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o42"><a name="100201-0005.htm_para6"><a name="10020113000209">The right hon. Gentleman asked questions about the number of provinces that will be under Afghan security leadership. The timetable has not slipped. As the Prime Minister said in his speech on Thursday, he thinks that more progress will be made than people realise, but it is important that we do this on a conditions basis. The figure of five years that the right hon. Gentleman raised is President Karzai's figure from his inauguration speech. It is he who said that within five years the whole of Afghanistan, every province, should have Afghan security leadership. That does not mean the end of an international support role, but it is a very different role.</p>

 I thank the Foreign Secretary for his statement, and for his courtesy in providing an advance copy. He was right to begin with a tribute to our British troops and their families. The whole House stands together in admiration and gratitude for their courage and sacrifice.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o44"><a name="100201-0005.htm_para8"><a name="10020113000212">Although the true success of the London conference on Afghanistan can be known only a few years hence, may I begin by welcoming the communiqué wholeheartedly? Liberal Democrats have long argued for a coherent political strategy to sit alongside the military strategy, and the conference appeared to mark the first internationally agreed attempt to define that political strategy in detail. Does the Foreign Secretary recognise that for many people, success for Britain's involvement in this important mission rests crucially on deepening and strengthening this new political strategy as the only realistic way forward?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o45"><a name="100201-0005.htm_para9"><a name="10020113000213">Given its significance, can the right hon.

<p><a name="stpa_o46"><a name="100201-0005.htm_para10"><a name="10020113000214">On the national elements of the new political strategy, I welcome the breadth of the proposals to tackle corruption, while sounding a sceptical note on delivery. Was it made clear to President Karzai that neither the international community nor his own people are likely to believe that the Afghan Government are serious about corruption until some of the more powerful warlords and their placemen are ejected from the top table?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o47"><a name="100201-0005.htm_para11"><a name="10020113000215">I especially welcome the proposals for the Peace and Reintegration Trust Fund. The Foreign Secretary will know that Liberal Democrats were widely criticised for such ideas earlier last year, but I am delighted that he and his colleagues last week did not shy away from the controversy. Does he agree that planning the structure and implementation of any payments to former Taliban fighters is critical, to make sure not only that are there no perverse incentives, but that there is clear financial support for Afghans who did not co-operate with the Taliban? But does he also agree that it must make sense to hold out real prospects of employment and hope to insurgents who are often mercenaries and rarely Taliban ideologues?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o48"><a name="100201-0005.htm_para12"><a name="10020113000216">Can the Foreign Secretary say what plans there are to provide the necessary security to former Taliban fighters-their families and villages-who decide to defect and switch sides? Given that some NGOs already report an upsurge in the assassination of local leaders whom the Taliban suspect of being ready to defect, does he accept that this is a pressing issue if the counter-insurgency strategy is to work?</p>

 I find myself in agreement-non-violent, I hasten to say-with the hon. Gentleman about the importance of the political strategy. The right hon. Member for Richmond, Yorks (Mr. Hague) asked about Pakistan and international engagement, however, and I failed to answer him. He inquired about whether the reintegration fund would be available on the Pakistan side of the border, and the answer is no, because the situation involves Afghans who should be in the Afghan political system, not in the Pakistani political system.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o50"><a name="100201-0005.htm_para14"><a name="10020113000219">The hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton (Mr. Davey) asked which forums would be used for international engagement, and the region is debating that issue. There are already four or five different regional organisations, including the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation and others, and there is an issue about co-ordination. There is also an issue, which the Afghan Government must address, about whether there should be a specific effort on Afghanistan. I think that there is a strong case for it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o51"><a name="100201-0005.htm_para15"><a name="10020113000220">The hon. Gentleman is right that corruption afflicts many levels of the Afghan system. In a recent BBC poll, 95 per cent. of Afghans complained of corruption in local policing and governance. The importance of that was made clear not just to President Karzai but to all his Ministers who were at the conference, and they replied that it was important for them, too. However, implementation will be a key point, as the hon. Gentleman said, and the oversight board and other committees will be important in that respect. On local corruption, local police wages are important, and the way in which security is offered on the routes between major cities is an absolutely key point, so the security effort and the anti-corruption effort go together.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o52"><a name="100201-0005.htm_para16"><a name="10020113000221">The hon. Gentleman asked about the implementation of the peace and reconciliation effort. The money that is available does not exist as pots of money to be paid to individuals; it exists to provide for jobs, for deradicalisation and for the security of those who return to their communities. He is right to emphasise the importance of security, because the intimidation that the Taliban apply to the local population applies in spades to their former comrades. On that point, the security effort is the key.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o53"><a name="100201-0005.htm_para17"><a name="10020113000222">On Yemen, the hon. Gentleman will know that the Gulf countries have pledged large sums of money; we do not suffer from an absence of pledges on Yemen. We need them to be turned into reality, because of those made in London in 2006, only 7 per cent. have been delivered, notably those from the Gulf countries. An important part of the Gulf Co-operation Council's engagement will be not only Yemen's road to GCC membership or labour market issues, but aid issues.</p>

 The short answer is no, the Russian Prime Minister did not make such an announcement.

 As a member of the Defence Committee who recently visited Afghanistan, I can attest to the new sense of political, civil and military direction there.

 My hon. Friend makes an important point. I saw Speaker Qanuni in Kabul two weeks ago. It is fair to say that the definition of a party in the Afghan context is pretty loose, and not the same as we might recognise in this country. However, the amount of fragmentation and splintering reflects the sort of tribal society that it is, and also emphasises the importance of the parliamentary elections. A presidential system, by definition, elects one person, whereas a parliamentary system allows a broader range of interests to be represented. We did not take it upon ourselves to try to reform the Afghan political party system last Thursday, but the civil society representatives who spoke at the conference were insistent about the need to open up the political process to more people from community groups and civil society more generally.</p>

 The steps towards the shared goal of all parties in the House are: for the Afghans to take on lead security responsibility-a clear timetable has been set for that-and for a political settlement to take the place of the combat in which British troops from all parts of the UK have been engaged for the past eight years. The hon. Gentleman knows that the efforts of soldiers from Scotland are part of an effort to keep all citizens of this country safe, and it therefore deserves all-party support.</p>

 Is the Foreign Secretary aware that, if we are to get out of this war, we must make bigger philosophical shifts than have been announced today? However, a few cautious sentences from him and others over the weekend indicate that maybe the political strategy is more important than continuing the war. With Northern Ireland, we had to make shabby compromises, let prisoners out and all the rest, which the media regarded as bad at the time. Yet that is now accepted as something that was right to do at the time. That is what we must do with Afghanistan. It may be that, in this thinly attended House, a few words have been said today that mark the end, and getting out of Afghanistan much sooner.</p>

 I appreciate my hon. Friend's perspective. The military and civilian effort is in the service of a political strategy. A political settlement in Afghanistan involves three things: al-Qaeda being kept out, the tribes being kept on side, and the neighbours supporting stability. That is the sort of political settlement that my hon. Friend recognises and that we are seeking.</p>

 Do not the peace and reintegration programme and the Peace and Reintegration Trust Fund represent a dramatic shift in Government policy? Are we not attempting to buy some aspects of the enemy? Given that we have now reached that point, why did we not reach it earlier? How many British lives would have been saved if the Government had examined that option more closely earlier?</p>

 The hon. Gentleman will know from my speeches and those of the Prime Minister that the Government have advocated such a strategy for a long time. However, it is not right to say that it is only just being tried. The right hon. Member for Richmond, Yorks (Mr. Hague), who speaks for the Opposition on such matters, referred to the 2006 attempts at reintegration and reconciliation, which were done in a way that included some of the perverse incentives to which the hon. Member for Bosworth (David Tredinnick) referred and were not administered correctly. However, the unity of effort to achieve a political settlement is more coherent and clearer, and we welcome that. In that sense, last Thursday's conference was a signal event for the international community, because it represented a clear recognition on the part of all countries there of the need for all parts of the Afghan effort to be directed towards the durable political settlement that is needed.</p>

 With the caveat that it must be led by the Afghan Government, we are in complete agreement on the need for an Afghan political settlement that separates those with political grievances from those who are determined to pursue global jihad. The latter group is a small minority who are currently attacking their own communities, never mind our own forces, so the Government adhere very strongly indeed to the commitment to a political strategy and a settlement of the sort my hon. Friend advocates.</p>

 Given that the Pakistani armed forces are configured for state-on-state conflict with India rather than counter-insurgency, what will be the strategy on the Pakistani side of the border with regard to the Taliban? Will it be the military strategy on which the Pakistanis have just embarked, or will they, too, change to a political tack?</p>

 The hon. Gentleman makes an important point. I think the Pakistani forces are being reconfigured to take care of what the Pakistani Government would call twin threats, but he is right to say that the sort of effort, training and structures that are needed for a counter-insurgency are quite different from those for traditional warfare. The evidence from Pakistan shows the folly of pursuing a political strategy on its own-a deal-making strategy will not work, and it has not worked in the federally administered tribal areas over the past two decades-but equally, a military strategy on its own will not work either. The absence of any sort of political process in the FATAs is as dangerous to their stability as the absence of any kind of security and order. The Pakistani experience shows the importance of combining military and civilian effort in the service of a durable political settlement. The fact that for, I think, the first time ever, that is happening on both sides of the Durand line in a complementary fashion, is a significant change in the past year.</p>

 Other than the very welcome additional debt relief that my right hon.

 My hon. Friend makes a very important point.

 The honest answer is that I have more confidence than I had a year ago. The passage of the Kerry-Lugar Bill-notwithstanding the controversy that that stirred up in Pakistan-represents a signal change in the American attitude towards its relationship with Pakistan, and a rebalancing away from military hardware towards comprehensive development. The exchange of letters between President Obama and President Zardari, which has now been publicised, needs to represent a further opening up of a dialogue between Pakistan and the US that leads to a completely different relationship between those two countries.</p>

 I contribute to this debate as Chairman of the Standards and Privileges Committee. The Committee's report on the hon. Member for Leyton and Wanstead (Harry Cohen) was published on 22 January. As the House has just heard, on Friday last the hon. Member made a personal statement in which he fully apologised to the House and accepted the recommendations of the Committee. I would like to echo what the Deputy Leader of the House said in congratulating the commissioner and those who helped him in the preparatory work needed for us to make our report to the House.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o61"><a name="100201-0006.htm_para3"><a name="10020113000266">The background to this case, briefly, is that over a five-year period the hon. Member for Leyton and Wanstead had claimed additional costs allowance for his designated second home in his constituency, having identified his main home as a house in Colchester. It is very relevant in understanding the background to this case, and was a matter of agreement between the hon. Member and the Committee, that the hon. Member's wife experienced a series of debilitating health-related incidents at frequent intervals from 2003, including a stroke in March 2004.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o62"><a name="100201-0006.htm_para4"><a name="10020113000267">The hon. Member and his wife felt that they had to spend more time at their constituency home from 2003 in order that he could care for his wife while continuing to carry out his parliamentary duties and to make it easier for Mrs. Cohen to receive necessary medical treatment at a specialist hospital in north London. Unfortunately, Mrs. Cohen continued to experience bad health from time to time and she and her husband therefore continued to live mostly in the constituency in London, letting the Colchester house for periods, but always hoping to return there.</p>

registered the fact that he owned and had received rental income from the Colchester property. He did not, however, subsequently declare any further income as he should have done. It was the hon. Member himself who drew this omission to the commissioner's attention and non-registration did not form part of the original complaint.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o64"><a name="100201-0006.htm_para6"><a name="10020113000269">The commissioner concluded that the hon. Member was in breach of the rules in relation to the registration of Members' financial interests in not registering his Colchester house and the fact that he received substantial rental income from it in each year from 2004 to 2008. The hon. Member has apologised for that breach and has now made an appropriate entry in the Register of Members' Financial Interests.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o65"><a name="100201-0006.htm_para7"><a name="10020113000270">According to the best estimate that it has been possible to make in the absence of proper records, in 2002-03 the hon. Member spent 55 per cent. of nights in his designated main home in Colchester. The following year, he spent 45 per cent. of nights there. In 2005-06, the hon. Member did not stay in his designated main home at all. In other years, he spent well below half of nights there. For long periods, the hon. Member did not even have the option of using the house in Colchester because it was occupied by tenants.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o66"><a name="100201-0006.htm_para8"><a name="10020113000271">The commissioner concluded, and the Committee agreed, that the hon. Member was in breach of the rules of the House in identifying for allowance purposes his house in Colchester as one of his two homes from April 2004 to August 2008, because his use of the property was in fact constrained by regular and substantial periods when it was let to others. The Committee has concluded that the hon. Member's arrangements for his properties over the period of four and a half years represented a particularly serious breach of the rules.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o67"><a name="100201-0006.htm_para9"><a name="10020113000272">The hon. Member sent us written evidence in which he stated his views. His main points were as follows. He had always regarded the house in Colchester as his main home. His circumstances were not normal because of his wife's serious health problems, and it would be unfair to apply to his case the rule that a Member's main home will normally be where he spends most nights.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o68"><a name="100201-0006.htm_para10"><a name="10020113000273">During the four and a half years when the Colchester house was let for periods, the hon. Member said that there were also periods when it was not let, but used by him and his wife. He said that claiming the London supplement instead of the additional costs allowance would not have saved the taxpayer a penny, because he could also have claimed other expenses. He also claimed that it was not necessarily against the rules for a tenant for periods of time to occupy a house that was subject to claims for the additional costs allowance.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o69"><a name="100201-0006.htm_para11"><a name="10020113000274">Although the Committee had great sympathy with the hon. Member's difficulties arising out of his wife's health, we had no hesitation in concluding that his house in Colchester could not be regarded as his home for the purposes of claiming parliamentary allowances during the time in question. For most of that time he was not living there and the house was let, so for long periods it was not even accessible to him. In our view the hon. Member is also wrong to argue that letting a home for extended temporary periods is in accordance with the rules.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o70"><a name="100201-0006.htm_para12"><a name="10020113000275">It follows that the hon. Member's constituency home in Leyton and Wanstead was his main home-and for long periods his only home-throughout the four and a half years when he was making little use of the house in Colchester. We entirely accept that he and his wife were continually hoping to move back to Colchester, but as the commissioner has pointed out, it should have been clear to the hon. Gentleman that that was not going to happen in the short term. The fact that the house was let and re-let on a six-month lease suggests that he understood that. We calculate that during the period when his Colchester house was let between 2004 and 2008, the hon. Gentleman claimed and received more than £70,000 in total from his additional costs allowance. Over the same period, as a Member for an outer London constituency with only one home, he could instead have claimed about £9,000 in the London supplement. Taking the latter sum from the former, the Committee concluded that he had received more than £60,000 from parliamentary allowances over those four years to which he was not entitled.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o71"><a name="100201-0006.htm_para13"><a name="10020113000276">We have considerable sympathy with the hon. Member and Mrs. Cohen for the difficulties that they have faced in recent years. We believe that we understand their strong attachment to the house, to which they plan to retire. We certainly understand the pressures on the hon. Member, not only as a Member dealing with a heavy work load created by a busy constituency, but as one who has had to cope with considerable stress and demands on his time caused by the ill health of his partner. The House will wish to bear his personal situation very much in mind.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o72"><a name="100201-0006.htm_para14"><a name="10020113000277">In our second report of the current Session, we responded to the recommendation of the Committee on Standards in Public Life that the House should be prepared to withhold the resettlement grant from Members who commit serious breaches of the rules. We stated that we would regard a recommendation to withhold the resettlement grant as an option available to us in cases where it appeared to be the right sanction to apply in light of the breach that had occurred. We consider this to be just such a case. The hon. Member's breach was particularly serious and involved a large sum of public money. Withholding of the resettlement grant is a severe sanction that will effectively recover from him a similarly large sum of public money. We understand that the resettlement grant payable to a Member with his length of service is about £65,000, which is the maximum. He has announced that he will stand down at the next general election, so implementation of the sanction will not be unduly delayed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o73"><a name="100201-0006.htm_para15"><a name="10020113000278">We recommended in our report that for committing a particularly serious breach of the rules on claiming parliamentary allowances the hon.

accepted the decision and ruling of the Standards and Privileges Committee "without proviso," as he put it. That is to be welcomed. We have also heard that the Standards and Privileges Committee report says that the Committee had sympathy for his personal circumstances in recent years and that this, too, should be borne in mind when the House responds to that report. Although he did not draw on that paragraph in his statement last week, I am sure that all Members will have taken note of the Committee's view and will sympathise with him for having to look after his wife, who is not well.</p>

The withholding of a Member's resettlement grant in some cases was one of Sir Christopher Kelly's recommendations. The Kelly proposals have yet to be implemented, but the fact that the sanction is already being used should send a clear message about how seriously the House takes all his proposals.</p>

This further money resolution is required because, in implementing the proposals of the Committee chaired by Sir Christopher Kelly, we are extending the powers and duties of the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority, not least to include responsibility for setting and administering the pensions of Members of Parliament and Ministers. For that reason and others, this further money resolution is required, and I commend it to the House.</p>

 There are a lot of new clauses and new schedules in this group, but on this occasion I have a better explanation for that than is often the case, and it is as follows. The Committee will recall-in technicolour-how important it was for us to reach agreement before the summer on what became the Parliamentary Standards Act 2009, in order that the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority established under that Act could be in place and operating from the beginning of the forthcoming financial year, which starts on 1 April. Meanwhile, the Committee on Standards in Public Life, under Sir Christopher Kelly, was meeting, and as I explained in my evidence to Sir Christopher and his colleagues, we accepted that the committee might well make some recommendations that would require amendments to be made to the 2009 Act. That has, indeed, happened. Members will also recall that the leaders of all three main parties-indeed, effectively, of all the parties represented in the House-said they wished Sir Christopher's report to be implemented in full. These new clauses and new schedules seek to do exactly that.</p>

Sir Ian Kennedy and his IPSA members have already got a consultation under way on the form of allowances, and much else besides. I know that they are making themselves available for such consultation and that many Members have attended the open meetings that Sir Ian has held, but I urge Members who wish to make a response to do so by the close of the consultation on 11 February.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o106"><a name="100201-0008.htm_para0"><a name="10020113000768">The report contained 10 recommendations requiring further primary legislation, as they relate to the structure and functions of IPSA, which are governed by the Parliamentary Standards Act 2009. I shall now go through the recommendations, discussing first those relating to the status and enforcement powers of the compliance officer and then dealing with those relating to the new arrangements for determining Members' pay and pensions. A great debate took place-the shadow Leader of the House will recall it, because he was a participant-both in this Chamber and literally below it, in the cross-party consultations that were held downstairs, about where the investigator of complaints against the schemes that were to be enforced by IPSA would be situated. The debate was about whether the investigator would be part of IPSA, whether his role would be separate from it but alongside it-detached from Parliament-or whether he would be within the House.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o107"><a name="100201-0008.htm_para1"><a name="10020113000769">I shall not go back over the rather tortuous debate that took place, but I can tell hon. Members that we ended up with a Commissioner for Parliamentary Investigations who, in a way, straddled both the House and IPSA. The 2009 Act also made provision for the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards-currently Sir John Lyon-to be double-hatted, if the House wished, with the commissioner appointed under the original Act. Sir Christopher and his colleagues said that they wanted there to be a separation; they proposed that decisions on the financial code of conduct should be returned to the Commons so that that would become entirely a Commons matter, while compliance in respect of the system that they proposed should be operated by IPSA which would be separate and removed from the House.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o108"><a name="100201-0008.htm_para2"><a name="10020113000770">That is what we are proposing. There will be a compliance officer, but we then need to consider who appoints the compliance officer. One of the reasons for the length of the provisions before us is that, as the Committee will readily recognise, it is often one thing to describe in prose what one wants to do-as Sir Christopher and his colleagues did-but it is an often more complicated matter to set it out in legislation that can be enduring and clear. For that reason, some of the new clauses and new schedules are extensive.</p>

 The Justice Secretary has explained that the compliance officer will work with IPSA. Those of us who are not up-to-date with all this would understand from what he said that we will also have a parliamentary commissioner who will deal with non-pay, non-money and non-allowance matters. If that is so, what are the limits to what the parliamentary commissioner might take a look at?</p>

 The role of the parliamentary commissioner is to enforce the various codes-Standing Orders-that the House has established to deal with, for example, declarations of interest. That is the most obvious example, but included in that would also be examples of advocacy in the House-cases where somebody has been taking money from a particular organisation or individual to advocate a cause and has then failed to disclose that-and many other matters. The enforcement of the rules about allowances, for example in respect of office costs, travel and accommodation, is plainly a matter for IPSA and therefore would fall to the compliance officer.</p>

 It is subject to any advice that we get from those at the Table, but the responsibilities of the John Lyon figure and the Standards and Privileges Committee are entirely a matter for the House, full stop. These changes do not deal with that. What is in the tin will be on the tin. This is about the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority and its responsibilities to establish and administer schemes for the payment of pay, pensions and allowances and to ensure that there is proper compliance with those schemes not only from Members of this House but from the chief executive officer and staff of the authority.

<p><a name="stpa_o112"><a name="100201-0008.htm_para6"><a name="10020113000780">The solution on which we landed was that the IPSA board would appoint the compliance officer. There is nothing unusual about that, and Sir Christopher Kelly explicitly drew a parallel between the compliance officers of the Department for Work and Pensions who deal with benefits and those of Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs who deal with tax. Those departmental compliance officers are certainly not subject to any sort of elaborate arm's length appointment procedure, as in this case, but, as we all know when we take up complaints about benefits, they can still operate at arm's length from those who are responsible for the day-to-day administration of the benefits system.</p>

officer in DWP or HMRC, it goes to a first-tier tribunal. Appeals on tax used to go to the commissioners, but they now go to a first-tier tribunal. They can then proceed up to the appeals tribunal and, if there is a serious point of law, to the senior courts.

Many colleagues have raised questions informally with me, as I am sure they have with other Members of the House, about what will happen if a Member runs into difficulty not because of any malfeasance or failure on their part but because of maladministration by IPSA, its chief executive or staff. The answer is that the compliance officer will be able to investigate complaints not only against individual Members, but against the authority and its offices.</p>

 I am still slightly unclear about something, perhaps because I have not picked up some of the nuances of earlier interventions. Will there still be an overlap between what the compliance officer does and the work of the Select Committee on Standards and Privileges? Or is it envisaged that issues that are directly within IPSA's ambit will be matters entirely for the compliance officer, and that the Committee will therefore deal only with other issues? A failure to create such a separation will lead to overlap and ever more confusion, which will not be very helpful and will be very expensive for the taxpayer.</p>

 Day by day, those responsibilities will not overlap, but there must be the overlap that I am describing. I think that the Committee accepts that. Without that overlap, the system could be subject to outrageous abuse.

police prosecution-the case would go to the compliance officer and a civil sanction might be imposed, as might a requirement to repay money. However, if the abuse were particularly outrageous, the compliance officer might decide to refer the case to the Standards and Privileges Committee, with a view to the relevant person being expelled or suspended from the House. There is no rule here, any more than there is a rule in real life, that says that if one transgresses criminal law or a statutory code, the only consequences that will follow will be those related directly to the transgression of that law or code. If one transgresses criminal law and the case is serious enough, one might go to prison, but one might also lose one's job. Police officers who transgress the criminal law and the disciplinary code may lose not only their liberty and their job, but, in extreme circumstances, their pension as well. When I was the Home Secretary, I had to take decisions on such matters. The measures I am outlining will run parallel to such systems. I hope that that satisfies the hon. Gentleman. We do not propose that there should be second-guessing, or two parallel systems of enforcement.</p>

 No one would claim that these are easy things.

 Colleagues will know-it is a well-trodden path-that if someone was convicted of a serious offence, they would normally come within the automatic disqualification.

Let us say that someone was acquitted in a criminal court but the facts had been admitted and the acquittal rested on a technical matter, or that the facts had been admitted but the extent of the mens rea-the individual's guilt-was challenged and the jury decided on balance to acquit them.

They will certainly offer guidance in any event. I can think of cases from my own experience-they are nothing whatever to do with questionable expenses, but with straightforward matters that relate to the running of my office-where I have phoned someone in the Department and said, "Is this in line with the rules? I can't find it anywhere in particular," and they have said, "Yes," and then paid it, or they have paid it for a number of years and then said, "We don't think that it should be paid anymore," at which point I say, "I'm now in a slight difficulty. Do you think that you could think again, and by the way, here is the paper trail?" There is no fiddle; we must know where we are. Contrary to what is often thought outside, we do not have our own compliance officers. Assiduous Members of Parliament are busy, and we are trying to run what amount to small businesses, while abiding by what will be increasingly complicated, as well as very public, rules.</p>

 I recognise that, as the Secretary of State rightly says, all of us are busy, though I am sure that we will all have learned the lesson that all the forms and applications for expenses and allowances must be completed by us, and that we should not rely on office staff to do that. We all know that there have been some terrible abuses, but where an open and transparent claim has been signed off, the biggest concern and the aspect that has aroused the anger of many Members of Parliament on the grounds of natural justice has been the attempt at retrospection-a very successful attempt under Sir Thomas Legg-going back some years.</p>

If an open and transparent claim is made and accepted, surely it is wrong that many years later a Member should be expected to repay or more importantly, even if repayment is made, should be seen to have committed wrongdoing, where in fact there has been openness, transparency and the opportunity for clearance. Does the Secretary of State not see that there would be great benefits from putting in place some sort of clearance process that would avoid such problems in the future?</p>

 I accept entirely the burden of what the hon. Gentleman says. The issue is how to achieve that. Let us suppose that in such a case, the authority says, "We shouldn't have agreed this amount for training or for cleaning," and the Member says, "Sorry, but you did, and I did this in good faith"-there was no trickery, and on the face of it, the claim was entirely consistent with the rules. One of the things that we need to consider between now and Report is how to ensure that there is a clear power available to the compliance officer, to the first tier tribunal and so on, to say, "There has been a technical transgression here. We accept now that the authority is right to say that there was an error, but this was nothing whatever to do with the Member, so we are not requiring any repayment."</p>

Let us take as an example the issue that has not affected me, but has affected a number of Members, who are understandably sore about it-levels of cleaning costs, which were set retrospectively by Sir Thomas Legg at £2,000. My understanding is that some right hon. and hon. Members claimed considerably in excess of that. I am trying to remember whether cleaning costs are provided for. To the extent that an item is provided for, the parliamentary authority and the House have been much more specific.</p>

That said, there will always be areas where discretion has to be exercised, just as the Revenue, day by day, has to exercise discretion, as do tax accountants, about what is wholly, necessarily and exclusively incurred in pursuit of the individual's employment, which is the mantra for schedule E. Since that definition is taken straight from tax law, and is the fundamental test, aside from the specifics of the regulations as to whether an expenditure is acceptable, there is bound to be some scope for debate. I accept that some measure of guidance, good practice and consistency, which we did not get from the Fees Office all the time, will be very helpful.</p>

The member of staff may not be a senior member and is just giving informal advice, but that is regarded as holy writ. Nobody is suggesting that that should happen. I promise that between now and Report we will discuss the matter actively with colleagues here to try and reach wording that is acceptable to Members of the House and as far as possible to Sir Ian Kennedy and his colleagues on the authority.</p>

We passed a resolution saying that responsibility for determining pay should go to the Senior Salaries Review Body, and we established a formula for that. The Kelly Committee argued that one body should be responsible for considering in the round, and determining the full remuneration package for, Members' pay, pensions and expenses.

 I cannot say precisely what discussions took place with the trustees. However, I can tell the right hon. Gentleman about conversations that I have had, particularly with my right hon. Friend the Member for Islwyn (Mr. Touhig), on behalf of the chairman of the trustees, who is currently indisposed through illness. I hope to give the Committee some comfort about two key issues that the trustees have raised with me.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o131"><a name="100201-0009.htm_para3"><a name="10020131000027">The first issue relates to accrued rights-that is, the rights to a pension that Members have already accrued. These provisions are silent on whether IPSA could change accrued rights peremptorily, and there is some anxiety about that. That is no part of our intention, nor that of IPSA. The Committee will be aware that section 67 of the Pensions Act 1995 sets out the requirements that have to be followed if there are proposals to change accrued rights. If a so-called protective modification is to be made, the informed consent of the Members affected is required. Since what we are seeking to do through the whole IPSA arrangements is to put Members of Parliament in no better and no worse a position than members of the public in ordinary employment, we accept that there should be a similar protection for accrued rights. Discussions have taken place about how that might be done. Officials are considering whether, for example, provisions for Members' pensions should hook in with the provision in the 1995 Act, which might be the most sensible way of doing it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o132"><a name="100201-0009.htm_para4"><a name="10020131000028">The second issue, which relates to trustees, has been raised by several Members, including my hon. Friend the Member for Ellesmere Port and Neston (Andrew Miller). I have been to Ellesmere Port many times-<i> [</i><i> Interruption.</i><i> ]</i> No, it was not briefly at all. There is a huge petrol refinery there, and when we almost ran out of petrol in September 2000, and I was Home Secretary and therefore to blame, I made it my business to visit all the refineries in the country to try to avoid a similar crisis happening again. That is why I know my hon. Friend's constituency intimately.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o133"><a name="100201-0009.htm_para5"><a name="10020131000029">The provisions as drafted give IPSA the right to appoint whomsoever it wishes as trustees. There is provision in the Pensions Act 2004 that at least one third of trustees of any pension scheme should be representative of the members of the scheme. We propose to look at that to see whether such a provision could be brought in as an amendment on Report.</p>

 I accept what my right hon. Friend has said about the 1995 scheme in relation to accrued rights; that would be a sensible mechanism to develop. On his second point, under these provisions IPSA appears to have the power to remove a trustee from the fund. Under the 2004 Act, there are circumstances in which the trust body collectively can effectively dismiss a trustee. Can we be sure that my right hon. Friend does not intend to go any further than the requirements of the 2004 Act?</p>

 It is not our intention to do that. I cannot be absolutely certain that the wording does not take it further-that is why we are actively examining the matter. We will consult very quickly and come back with modifications, which I hope will accommodate the Committee's wishes.</p>

Many voices in both Houses urged caution at the time. Although we agreed with the Government on the need to demonstrate our commitment to urgent reform, it was inevitable-as my hon.

They were originally included because of the extraordinary haste with which we dealt with that measure, but the opportunity to return to the matter now, afforded to us by Kelly, allows us to put those concerns to rest.</p>

New clause 70 and new schedule 6 introduce the most radical departure from the 2009 Act by scrapping the external Commissioner for Parliamentary Investigations and replacing him with an internal compliance officer. That relates to recommendation 44 in the Kelly report.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o154"><a name="100201-0009.htm_para26"><a name="10020131000055">The Committee on Standards in Public Life was concerned about the confusion that would be caused by having a Parliamentary Commissioner for Investigations examining financial wrongdoings, and the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards looking at cases in which Members have, for example, breached the code of conduct, unless that breach related wholly to expenses or the rules on financial interests. Of course, the Committee has a point. However, does new clause 79 create an equal source of duplication? That was mentioned in earlier exchanges. Proposed new section 10A(3) of the 2009 Act states:</p>
<a name="100201-0009.htm_brev6"><a name="10020131000126"><ul><p class="tabletext">"Nothing in section 9 to 9B (or Schedule 4) affects the disciplinary powers of the House of Commons."</p>

That strikes me as double jeopardy, and I wonder whether the Government think that desirable.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o156"><a name="100201-0009.htm_para28"><a name="10020131000057">On top of that, we have IPSA's compliance and enforcement regime, which, as envisaged by the proposals, raises some rather profound issues. Under schedule 2 to the 2009 Act, the commissioner for investigations was to be appointed by Her Majesty, with the terms and conditions to be determined by Mr. Speaker. However, under new schedule 6, the compliance officer, as the Secretary of State said, will be appointed by IPSA, with terms and conditions to be determined by IPSA. Indeed, proposed new schedule 2(9) to the 2009 Act will allow IPSA staff to double-job with the role of the compliance officer for up to six months if there is a vacancy.</p>

At present, the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards follows his own rules, rather than those provided by the House, but under the Bill we would have a compliance officer appointed, employed and thus constrained by IPSA. That is exactly what the Commissioner for Standards warned against in evidence to Kelly.</p>

That is not the best comparison. In HMRC, the adjudicator works as a referee holding HMRC to account on behalf of its customers-the taxpayers. That is the normal role of a compliance officer in the financial services industry. But this is not what we are asking of this compliance officer, who would be holding the customers to account on behalf of the regulator, even in situations where the regulator itself had erred.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o166"><a name="100201-0010.htm_para1"><a name="10020131000067">I wish to make one further point about the compliance officer. Although the original Act stipulated a role for a Parliamentary Commissioner for Investigations, the position was not advertised or appointed at the same time as Sir Ian Kennedy or the other members of IPSA. It may be that the Government were envisaging that John Lyon would take over both roles in the future. Whatever the reason, the idea of a Commissioner for Parliamentary Investigations was quietly dropped after Kelly. As things stand now, IPSA will not be able to appoint the new compliance officer until after Royal Assent has been given to this Bill. Given that IPSA aims to be fully operational by the beginning of the next Parliament, do the Government think that they will be able to fill the compliance officer post in time? If not, what will be the procedure for complaints?</p>

Friend the Member for Worthing, West (Peter Bottomley) about dual mandates. Unless something happens to the rules within the House, it will still be possible for a constituent to make a complaint to the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards at the same time as a complaint is being considered by the alternative route. Those consequential issues need to be addressed.</p>

That is a welcome step, but the first time the tribunal finds against the compliance officer, as it could under new schedule 7, there is a risk that the whole compliance system could be compromised.</p>

That was not contained in the Kelly report and it is not current practice. It would be helpful if the Government could explain the rationale for what is a fairly radical change in the process and say why it is a good idea.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o170"><a name="100201-0010.htm_para5"><a name="10020131000071">There are two concerns about new schedule 7. First, what is the source of paragraphs 1(4)(a) and (b) of proposed new schedule 4 to the 2009 Act?

Any charge incurred could be extremely significant. I have known some cases, from when I was the Chairman of the Standards and Privileges Committee, that ran into many thousands of pounds. For example, the inquiry into the hon. Member for Bethnal Green and Bow (Mr. Galloway) involved considerable expense and a large amount of fees for translation. We also note that the adjudicator's services are entirely free of charge, whatever the verdict. What is the Government's reasoning for including paragraphs 1(4)(a) and (b), which were not part of Kelly?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o172"><a name="100201-0010.htm_para7"><a name="10020131000073">The whole procedure is just beginning to look rather bureaucratic. IPSA has to "prepare guidance" on the disciplinary regime, under paragraph 2(1) of proposed new schedule 4 to the 2009 Act, as well as having to consult the Speaker, the Leader of the House and other people, all within a short space of time. I contrast the relative speed of the current disciplinary process, whereby a case can be resolved within a matter of weeks, with the rather cumbersome, top-heavy and, I fear, slow-moving new regime that we are about to introduce.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o173"><a name="100201-0010.htm_para8"><a name="10020131000074">Let me briefly mention new clause 87, standing in my name and that of my hon. Friend the Member for North-West Cambridgeshire (Mr. Vara), about which the Secretary of State spoke movingly. <i> [</i><i> Interruption</i><i> .</i><i> ]</i><i> </i>He spoke movingly, but he was unable to accept it. New clause 87 would give IPSA a duty to offer advice to Members on claims and seeks to implement a recommendation in the Kelly report-recommendation 44, I think-that IPSA should be able to give advice to Members and "promote good practice". It would be a waste of time and resources if Members were left having to interpret the rules as they saw fit, only to have claims continually rejected. The current IPSA consultation document is silent on giving advice. However, I am grateful to the Secretary of State for saying that he would have another look at that before Report.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o174"><a name="100201-0010.htm_para9"><a name="10020131000075">A considerable influx of new Members is expected in the next Parliament who will be required to get to grips very quickly indeed with a new system. For that reason, if for no other, IPSA needs to have the capacity and ability to give them guidance. There are already stories of some candidates pledging to avoid claiming expenses altogether, owing to the confusion of events over the past year. MPs should not feel discouraged from legitimately claiming for expenditure incurred in the course of their duties. That point is underlined in the IPSA consultation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o175"><a name="100201-0010.htm_para10"><a name="10020131000076">Kelly has suggested that advice to Members should be channelled through the compliance officer, but that would be illogical. The title "compliance officer" implies that he will audit, review and determine outcomes, not offer advice. If a compliance officer gave advice about a claim that was later investigated, he would have compromised his role in any inquiry. We do not want to return to the culture of secrecy and collusion that may have existed in the past, but there is a recommendation in the Kelly report about giving advice, and we feel that it should be acted on.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o176"><a name="100201-0010.htm_para11"><a name="10020131000077">Let me turn to new clause 84 and new schedule 9, and return to pensions. Kelly is quite clear that salary and pensions should be taken out of the hands of Parliament, and we agree. However, although he is clear-cut on the need for a total separation between IPSA and Parliament on pay, there is much more ambiguity in how he envisages IPSA handling pensions. As he says:</p>
<a name="100201-0010.htm_brev1"><a name="10020131000134"><ul><p class="tabletext">"the independent regulator may decide, as a matter of practicality, to contract out the day to day running of the parliamentary pensions scheme to the existing professional administrators."</p>

Friend the Member for Worthing, West said that he knew of no parallel in the private sector where such provision exists. Although the measure does not say so explicitly, it does not specify who the trustees should be. It seems odd that, once the fund is transferred into IPSA's competence, the appointment of the trustees is to be left entirely up to IPSA, which will need to consult only the Prime Minister. One wonders what the Prime Minister's interest in this matter is, as opposed to everyone else's.</p>

The fact that we now have before us in the Government's name 15 new clauses, four new schedules and an amendment in order to implement Kelly shows that we were absolutely right to express such impatience.

I ask the Lord Chancellor to consider carefully what would happen if the compliance officer's position were challenged in court-as I suspect it will be-on the ground that they are a person adjudicating on the actions of IPSA while being complicit in those actions. The level of independence necessary to prevent such a challenge is insufficiently illustrated in the appointment procedure.</p>

The only thing that we learn from the details of the new schedule is that the officer will not be an officer of the Crown. By definition they will not be an Officer of the House-nor should they be-so it is a little difficult to know exactly where they will lie in the great firmament. It is important that we at least attempt to get an answer to that question. I know that my hon. Friend the Member for Cambridge (David Howarth) has suggested informally that the Judicial Appointments Commission might be a vehicle, and the Lord Chancellor mentioned it in his speech. I think that my hon. Friend would be the first to agree that it is an imperfect answer, but it may be better than all the other imperfect answers that have been brought forward. However, we may need to consider the matter again.</p>

It states that any of the new lay members who are to be added to the Speaker's Committee for the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority under proposed new section 2A(6) of the Parliamentary Standards Act 2009 will cease to be a member of the Committee if they become a Member of either House of Parliament. Why was that role not included in the list of disqualifications under the House of Commons Disqualification Act 1975, which new schedule 6 states will apply to the compliance officer? Why adopt the way of disqualifying lay members set out in new clause 71, rather than simply list them under the 1975 Act? It would be simpler to have people listed in one place than to have to search around various laws for statutory disqualifications.</p>

but on the remuneration and allowances of the members. It does not seem entirely unreasonable that Mr. Speaker should consider the matter and put it before the House for resolution, rather than simply determine almost by holy writ how much the members should be paid. There have been occasions when the actions of previous Speakers and their advisers on the House of Commons Commission have not been as transparent as some Members have wished, and this is a matter on which transparency is devoutly to be wished for.</p>

How could the compliance officer possibly advise on the appropriateness or inappropriateness of a particular claim, and then if challenged determine the matter on the basis of his own advice? It is simply an untenable position.</p>

In my view, advice should be part of that support.</p>

The new clause states that IPSA itself can decide what information it is appropriate to make available and how often and in what way that information should be published. That is fine-it is an independent body-but it will not be fine if we have backsliding from the position on the publication of Members' expenses that we have already reached through great adversity. It seems necessary that we impress on IPSA, even if only by exhortation rather than in statute, that the starting point should be the point that we have already reached.

 I will not invite you to declare an interest from the Chair in this matter, Mr. Gale, although I could. The provision is perfectly innocent. There is one class of Member-we are all elected as Members of Parliament. However, as the hon. Gentleman will recognise, some time ago the House decided that it should make additional payments to Chairmen of Select Committees and Public Bill Committees and other office holders. It also determined that there should be different levels of payment for different levels of responsibility. We have sought to replicate that in the new clause, to ensure that in setting pay, IPSA takes account of decisions of the House about such Members.</p>

 I was quite sure that that was the Lord Chancellor's intention, but I do not know why that is not considered to be covered by the term "different offices or positions" and why the new clause has to mention "different classes of member", which is an expression that inevitably rankles and one that I would not entirely encourage the use of.</p>

 No part of the new clause states that there is a first class of Member, which is Labour and Conservative Members, a second class of Scottish and Welsh nationalists and anybody else, and then a third class, well below the salt, of Liberal Democrats. Attractive though that may be, it is no part of our intention.</p>

 It is very important that IPSA hears that. Of course, different parties in the House are treated differently in how financing is provided, so it is not unreasonable to draw attention to the enormity suggested by "different classes of member".</p>

 The provision is drawn quite widely, so there is a concern that IPSA might choose to define different classes of Member or decide that Members from different constituencies are due different pay levels depending on the nature of the work that they do for their constituents. The new clause would enable IPSA to make that decision if it wanted to.</p>

 It would indeed. This may be a particularly live issue for Members representing Scottish constituencies, as it is not beyond the bounds of reason for someone to suggest that, because there are other elected Members doing casework in those constituencies, there might be a discrepancy. This is an unwise signal to send, so I ask the Lord Chancellor to look at it.</p>

I would like to raise an issue of concern, on which the House should take a view in the very near future. Owing to the number of right hon. and hon. Members who have declared that they are standing down at the next election, we shall have an unprecedented turnover of Members and many new ones will enter the House. That will require a significant degree of induction in order to bring them up to speed. I have always felt that our system is too precipitate-immediately following a general election, the pantechnicon arrives at No. 10 Downing street and everything changes; we start with a new Government and a new Parliament at the earliest opportunity.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman puts a delicate point, but provision is made for pay to go back to the day or day after the election.

 That may be true, but I hope the hon.

They then may face the prospect of being without payment for a considerable period after the election. That puts pressure on the House authorities to convene the House at an earlier time than would otherwise be the case.

In my own case, I recall having to take out a whopping great loan from the bank-a fairly unacceptable position to be in, but there we are.

Its proposed role in the appointment and, particularly, the "disappointment" of trustees is unhelpful, and contradicts the normal practice applying to major pension schemes outside the House. In its excessive zeal to prevent MPs from determining their pension arrangements, the measure prevents them from taking a view as members of a pension scheme-rather than as Members of Parliament-on the administration of that scheme.

For example, I found myself needing to renew a lease for a photocopier in my constituency office whose terms caused me to want to take advice. We currently have a mechanism for that, although people have suggested that it is not very satisfactory. I agree that that should not be a function of the compliance office, to the spirit of whose role it would be entirely contrary, but it should be possible for a Member to say to someone, for instance, "I have been confronted with the following situation.

 I agree with my right hon. Friend the Member for North-West Hampshire (Sir George Young) that it essential for us to put these matters on to a statutory footing, and I welcome the Government's determination for that to be done. As my right hon. Friend said, nothing would be more damaging to the reputation of parliamentary democracy in this country than for the allowances scandal to permeate the next Parliament as it has permeated this one. These issues require urgent and definitive resolution, and, as a number of other Members have said, we owe it to the many people who will serve for the first time in the next Parliament to put the House in order, however belatedly.</p>

as 1 April 2012. I appreciate that the Secretary of State said that that was of IPSA's own doing, but we need to recall that this whole allowances scandal started because successive Executives over about the past 30 years refused or failed to implement Senior Salaries Review Body recommendations for salary increases. We heard a lot of grandstanding by party leaders over that period-and I acknowledge that leaders of Conservative, as well as Labour, Governments have been guilty of that. We therefore allowed a system to develop under which there was, effectively, a salary supplement through the allowances system, which grew like Topsy, especially after the resolution of the House in July 2001-without an SSRB recommendation-for a hefty 40 per cent. increase in the second-home allowance.</p>

What happens if the formula that was set in place in January conflicts with, for instance, a pay pause in the public sector? If we choose the path of least resistance, how can we suggest that MPs are not once again setting their own salary-the problem that started much of this episode, which has been so corrosive to parliamentary democracy in the past nine months? I would prefer IPSA to be given the authority at once. I accept that it will need to be in touch with the SSRB, and this may well take as long as a year, so we might not be able to do anything until April 2011. However, giving a long-stop date that is, effectively, two years in the future will bring forth the potential for there to be lots of problems, which will mean that this issue will not go away in the next Parliament, as all of us would wish.</p>

I would have liked that Committee to have been abolished. We have a notional safeguard in place, as it is proposed that three lay persons should be appointed by resolution of the House of Commons, but we have to face facts. The Members Estimate Committee-the body that preceded the Speaker's Committee-conducted itself, at the margins at least, in a disgraceful way. There was deliberate manipulation by party managers of all parties to ensure that, as far as possible, the public were kept in the dark. Why else did that body go to such unbelievable trouble to prevent publication of all the parliamentary expenses? We had a protracted High Court case that did great discredit to this House. I personally feel that the MEC-now the Speaker's Committee-does not speak for me; I do not share the notion that it represents the interests of Members of Parliament. Rather, its behaviour has been one of the biggest problems. In view of what we are trying to achieve with IPSA, I would have liked all these matters to have been taken out of the hands of any such committee, and, indeed, out of the hands of the Speaker of the House of Commons.</p>

and my hon. Friend the Member for North-West Cambridgeshire (Mr. Vara). I hope that the Secretary of State will give some consideration to the concerns in this regard. We should have a pre-clearance system, in order to avoid the terrible, and nonsensical, situation whereby open and transparent claims are entirely reversed some years further down the line. If we are going to have the IPSA machinery and a compliance officer in place, it is not beyond the wit of man to ensure that we also have such a system in place for the protection not only of Members of this House, but the taxpayer.</p>

 I do not plan to delay the Committee for long, but I think it is worth going through the genesis of the changes we are discussing this evening. When the expenses abuse revelations were at their height, the then Speaker convened a meeting of the leaders of all the parties that take up seats at Westminster: the three UK party leaders, joined by colleagues from the Northern Irish, Welsh and Scottish parties, myself included. We agreed that radical action was required. We decided that, first, there should be immediate restrictions on expenses pending a review, and a Scottish National party proposal that the transparency standards operating in the Scottish Parliament should also apply to Westminster was agreed. I think that was the most important agreement at that meeting, because from now on it will be impossible to go back to the kind of secrecy that was highlighted by the hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster (Mr. Field). We cannot go back to the days of secrecy; transparency is the key to the future. We also agreed that an independent inquiry should proceed, and that conclusions should be agreed in full. The party leaders thought that it was important that all our parties should work together, and I am seeking to reflect that in my comments.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o216"><a name="100201-0012.htm_para1"><a name="10020144000031">Following this meeting, there were regular follow-up meetings, chaired by the Justice Secretary and the Leader of the House. I cannot remember how many meetings there have now been since that inaugural meeting, but the figure is about six or seven. Given the justified levels of public opprobrium about the expenses abuses, it was absolutely right for the political parties to work together to expedite these changes as speedily as possible. Everybody has in the back of their mind a concern that rushed legislation might be bad legislation, and it has to be said that a variety of hoops have had to be jumped through at a variety of stages to get us to where we are now, but, by working together, we are finally getting close to finding a fix for the problems facing us.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o217"><a name="100201-0012.htm_para2"><a name="10020144000032">These meetings were the driving force behind the creation of the parliamentary standards authority. I am pleased that it was an SNP proposal that the agency should be designated as "independent". That argument was persuasive; clearly, even Westminster parties are open to persuasion on independence, at least sometimes. We therefore now have a body called the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority-because independent it must, of course, be.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o218"><a name="100201-0012.htm_para3"><a name="10020144000033">Initially, IPSA was empowered to deal only with expenses. Pay and pensions were not included in the initial legislation for reasons we completely understand. That was to be put right at the earliest opportunity, however. We have heard from the right hon. Member for North-West Hampshire (Sir George Young) of the confusion about how quickly that might proceed, but we are here today and that is very much to be welcomed  <br>

because, together with other improvements including on matters relating to compliance, we are now moving ahead on the pay and pensions issues. That is key, because parliamentarians should not be responsible in any way for their own pay and pensions, or for setting their own expenses levels.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o219"><a name="100201-0012.htm_para4"><a name="10020144000034">The Justice Secretary is well aware of my disappointment that the gold standards operating in the Scottish Parliament for matters of compliance were not emulated in legislation dealing with MPs transgressing in this House. There is an irony in this. The Westminster Chamber legislated for the creation of the Scottish Parliament and set the rules under which it would operate, including criminal sanctions when Members of the Scottish Parliament transgressed the rules. However, Members of this House-Members of the Conservative and Labour parties-did not agree that that same high, gold standard of criminal sanction should apply to Members of Parliament in this Chamber in the future. That is totally beyond me. The SNP believed, and continues to believe, that criminal sanctions that can apply to MSPs should also apply to Members of this House. Notwithstanding that shortcoming, I believe that creating an IPSA with real teeth is vital, and that is what is being completed by these provisions. MPs have forfeited any credible right, as have the UK Government, to determine pay, expenses and pensions-that was forfeited some time ago.</p>

Member for Somerton and Frome (Mr. Heath) raised some important and commendable points about compliance officers and some other queries, but I have no reason to doubt that the Justice Secretary will continue his collegial approach before Report so that things can be smoothed and ironed out. For that reason, I shall be supporting the progress of these provisions today.</p>

 I often agree with the hon. Member for Moray (Angus Robertson), but I do not agree with him on a number of points today. For example, why should MPs not be responsible on these matters? For most of my time in Parliament, it has been perfectly reasonable for Members of Parliament to say what their pay arrangements should be. The fact that they have not always adopted what I thought was sensible is probably more my fault than that of my colleagues. It is clear to me that MPs' pay arrangements should be set before a new Parliament, should come into effect at the beginning of it and should not change during the Parliament, irrespective of whether it lasts for six months or for five years until the Parliament expires. That would be a far more elegant and sensible arrangement than the current one of wondering whether there should be increases each year or other kinds of conventional things. Even if the arrangement is not conventional, if we know what the terms are when we get elected, that should do us until we again come up for election or deselection.</p>

the areas where he and I failed on a number of occasions. If I were to allocate some of the "blame"-that is probably the right word-I would say that the House authorities or past occupants of the Speaker's Chair did not do what they might have done when Elizabeth Filkin was the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards. I doubt whether compliance officers, whatever their responsibilities, can carry the same weight as a good Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards. Therefore, I put it to the Secretary of State that if he were able during the passage of this Bill to find a better expression than "compliance officer" to balance the "Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards", that would be a good thing. We know what is understood by "compliance officer" and what the responsibilities will be, but it is not an elegant title.</p>

Any sudden increase of 30 per cent. in the pay of such a person in recognition of various parts of an MP's job would multiply through all their previous years of service, even though their actual pay would have been much lower. Members of Parliament ought to have a way of expressing in public, whether just to IPSA or in this Chamber too, that we think that we ought to move on to an average salary system at best. By all means, let us keep what we have got in the past-I declare that I have the full limit-but we ought to be able to say clearly that we need a reasonable compromise between not putting people off coming into Parliament and not maintaining this kind of gilt-edged, gold-plated standard pension. It may have been good at a time when our pay was very low but if IPSA is to do its job, the pay will not remain very low for very long. I do not see where in the IPSA proposals we can reach the stage where it is possible for IPSA to recommend that part of any significant change in MPs' pay should be non-taxable and non-pensionable.</p>

 Non-taxable and non-pensionable. The idea of bringing in a receipt for every small bit of spending is one of the mistakes into which the House and those who have been invigilating its affairs have fallen. I examined my spending for two weeks, keeping the receipts for two weeks. If I buy 80 items in Lidl in Worthing for £120, two of which are relevant to my office expenses, I am supposed to put in the list of all 80 things-the details of everything other than those two things either will or will not be redacted-so that I can get back some money that I have spent on batteries, CDs and so on. Such an arrangement is bizarre. I shall not go into the detail of all the other allowances, but one element that I hope IPSA will consider is having part of the pay being non-taxable and non-pensionable.</p>

There is an argument as to what constitutes approval and what is accepted, but we need to have some way of ensuring that MPs cannot be chased back too far, too often on too many things. MPs ought to be able to take advice from the authorities, rely on that advice, make their arrangements as simple as possible and maintain them.

 Thank you, Mr. Gale. I apologise for not being able to be here at the start of the debate because of a meeting of the House of Commons Commission. I wish to contribute a few remarks in my capacity as a trustee of the parliamentary contributory pension fund. I know that the Secretary of State indicated during earlier exchanges that he acknowledges the need for further thought to be given to the specific measures proposed, but I am anxious to ensure that the trustees' concerns are articulated in this debate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o227"><a name="100201-0012.htm_para12"><a name="10020144000048">We all accept that the world has changed, that the coming into being of IPSA means that there is a need for some change in our pension arrangements and that it will be necessary to make some legislative changes to give effect to such change. However, I am concerned at the speed with which these arrangements have appeared, at the lack of any consultation and-far more so-at the way in which they sit very uncomfortably, to my way of thinking, with the fact that during the latter part of last year the Government commissioned from the Senior Salaries Review Body a fundamental review of MPs' pension arrangements. To the best of my knowledge that body completed its work by the end of last year, as it was asked to do. I do not know whether it has yet submitted its report to the Government-the trustees have certainly not yet seen it. I would have thought it made a great deal more sense for that report to have been delivered and for its recommendations to have been assimilated and taken on board before we made the sort of changes that are anticipated and provided for in these new schedules and other add-ons to the Bill.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o228"><a name="100201-0012.htm_para13"><a name="10020144000049">In particular, the trustees have a concern that serving Members of this House should have confidence that the pension benefits that they have already built up in the fund to date cannot be taken away without their consent. As drafted, the Bill does not provide that protection because it is giving huge additional powers to IPSA that, in the past, this House and its Members, as members of the pension fund, have held. Although under the current fund structure the power is exercised by the Leader of the House, that takes place only through regulations. The Leader of the House has to bring to the Floor of the House, for consideration by the members of the scheme, any changes that are wished. In future, according to these arrangements, IPSA could, in the extreme, simply make a scheme that removes the entitlement to all or any of the benefits earned in the fund by any or indeed every member. Although we would all hope, obviously, that IPSA would never take such a course of action, one has to ask whether it makes sense to give it the power to do so.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o229"><a name="100201-0012.htm_para14"><a name="10020144000050">The Kelly report made two recommendations on MPs' pensions. The first was on the independent determination of MPs' pensions and the second was on oversight of the administration of parliamentary pensions. The Bill goes well beyond that and gives IPSA substantially greater powers over the structure of the fund-the power to determine how it is administered goes well beyond the oversight and scrutiny recommended by Kelly and gives the authority control over the management of the fund, the application of its assets and the constitution and proceedings of the funds' trustees as well as the  <br>

power to determine, with Treasury consent, the rate of the Exchequer contribution without consulting the Government Actuary.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o230"><a name="100201-0012.htm_para15"><a name="10020144000051">Although, in a sense, those powers replicate the existing arrangements by vesting with IPSA the powers that are currently vested in the Leader of the House, the difference, of course, is that the Leader of the House has to bring these matters to the House for its consent. We need proper and detailed consideration of whether it is right for IPSA to have these extensive new powers that go far beyond what was recommended in the Kelly report. I think it would be better to leave vested with the trustees some of the powers that they already have. I do not think we should undermine the objective of MPs' pensions' being influenced by an independent body, but the arrangements as proposed today go too far.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o231"><a name="100201-0012.htm_para16"><a name="10020144000052">For example, IPSA has the power to appoint a trustee body without any Member representation on it. I do not think anybody would take exception to the idea that IPSA should nominate a member of the board of trustees, but to give it the power, in effect, to remove the trustees and to appoint its own board of trustees seems to me to be going much too far. Is there any other pension fund anywhere that could be subjected to such a degree of interference? It would be unlikely, in practice, that IPSA would ever do so, but the measure goes too far in terms of the sweeping powers that it gives the authority.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o232"><a name="100201-0012.htm_para17"><a name="10020144000053">The legal structure of the fund is highly complex and the detail is largely set out in 1993 regulations, which are regularly amended. I think that the wholesale transfer of powers to IPSA, as proposed by the Bill, will in effect empower IPSA to rewrite the rules of the fund and could jeopardise the ability of the trustees properly to manage it. I welcome the fact that the Secretary of State has said that there will be further consultation with the trustees, but as the Bill is drafted all Members should be deeply concerned at what is being proposed. We frequently say that we want our arrangements to be comparable to those elsewhere and those in the real world, but my concern is that these proposals go to lengths that no other pension fund anywhere would expect.</p>

 Although I have a lot of sympathy with what the hon. Gentleman has to say, does he not understand that it is not a matter of whether the pension fund is working well and whether the trustee arrangements provide an arm's length between Parliament and the taxpayer? The issue is the perception that we are enriching ourselves. As my hon. Friend the Member for Worthing, West (Peter Bottomley) rightly said, a lot of MPs' spouses do a fantastically good job and provide tremendously good value to the taxpayer, but none the less there is a perception of our own enrichment. The changes therefore apply not only to employing spouses and issues to do with our salary but to our pensions. We have a different and rather more generous pension scheme than many others, even in the public sector. The public perception means that IPSA needs to have its tentacles across this matter, and that is no reflection on the ability or otherwise of the trustees who have done their work in this regard over the past few years.</p>

Kelly report made two recommendations on pension arrangements. Specifically, IPSA will have a say in what we get out of the scheme and what we pay into it. I am not trying to resist that at all. The hon. Gentleman just used the expression "IPSA needs to have its tentacles across this matter". I am not resisting that-I am merely resisting the idea that IPSA should delve its tentacles into these matters in an attempt to run the whole thing. It is possible to hit the right balance but, as the Bill is drafted, the Government have failed to do that. I would welcome it if they would get into a meaningful dialogue with the trustees so that on Report we can arrive at some arrangements that will take account of the points that the hon. Gentleman is making while leaving a viable pension arrangement with a scheme that will have the same sort of autonomy and power to organise its own affairs that any other pension fund would take for granted.</p>

 I shall be very brief. I want to start by apologising to my wife Fiona, my son Alistair, my other son James and my daughter Charlotte. I wish, on reflection, that I had made a great deal more money before I got into this place. If I had private wealth, I would not need to rely on the taxpayer to fund my excellent staff, my travel and the cost of my office. If I did not have to rely on the taxpayer to do those things, I would not fear the knock at the door from the media, the investigators or the new compliance officers. I and my family fear that knock at the door. We fear the reputational risks that now go hand in hand with being a Member of Parliament.</p>

I think that the only comparable public sector group that makes such a significant contribution is firemen and fire officers. Yes, our pension is generous, but it is not as generous, when set against other pensions, as the press would have our electorate believe.</p>

in the Parliamentary Standards Act as amended that will ensure that the new system of parliamentary pay, allowances and pensions command the respect of the public-that is fundamental-and enable Members of Parliament to do their duty without harassment or undue penalty to them or their families. Let me pick up the remarks of the hon. Member for Broxbourne (Mr. Walker). He made a generous and heartfelt apology, probably not for the first time, to his wife and children for his eccentricity in choosing to put himself in the public firing line, and I think that his position will be echoed in the experiences of Members on both sides of the House.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o236"><a name="100201-0013.htm_para1"><a name="10020153000002">It is worth recalling that there was a great fight to have Members of Parliament paid at all; I think it was the Liberal Government of Asquith who first provided for their payment. The right hon. Member for North-West Hampshire (Sir George Young) and I have been in the House for more than three decades, and certainly when I came to the House 31 years ago, the pay was lousy.</p>

I thought about going back to the Bar but, as colleagues who have been in that noble profession will know, although I may have earned quite a lot of money, I would have received virtually nothing from ever difficult solicitors. Granada Television offered me a job as a researcher, and even that was better paid than the pay I "enjoyed" when I became a Member of Parliament.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o238"><a name="100201-0013.htm_para3"><a name="10020153000004">I was fortunate, because I was able to earn a bit of extra money through journalism-quite a lot in due course-and I had a wife who had embarked on a sensible and stable career, but notwithstanding the beginning of Short money when I went into the shadow Cabinet in 1987, my office costs had to be subsidised out of my family's income every year until I became a Minister. Every year, the Fees Office would approach me with an estimate of what I had to pay it, not because I had over-claimed and had to repay, but so that my staff in Blackburn and in the House could be paid and so that other costs could be met. Yes, the House went too far in correcting that situation, but we are all anxious-I am sure that Sir Ian Kennedy and his colleagues at IPSA are taking this on board-that the situation should not revert to that which obtained before, when a lot of people were actively prevented or put off from coming to the House.</p>

We all have to accept such scrutiny because the House signed up with great alacrity to the Freedom of Information Act 2000; indeed, it was the House itself that demanded that Parliament should be included in that Act. Ever compliant with the wishes of the House, I, as the sponsoring Minister said yes to that. I worry that future generations will also be put off by the overall remuneration, which is a worry for us all. It is the people of the country, rather than the people in the House, who will suffer if we cannot attract into politics people of quality and assiduity, whatever their social background, monetary wealth or lack thereof.</p>

 When I first came to the House, there was no secretarial allowance at all, and the pension for MPs had been introduced only the year before. However, will my right hon. Friend reflect on the comments of several Members in this debate, at least since I came into the Chamber, who seem to blame the Fees Office for much of what has occurred and what has been exposed in recent months? I believe that, on the whole, the Fees Office did a useful job and gave good advice, and we should be careful not to transfer the blame from ourselves on to officials who have given very good service over the years.</p>

 I have had the benefit of being in the Chamber for the whole debate and I do not think that there has been any personal criticism of members of the Fees Office. Everybody understands that a system that was not fit for purpose developed and that officials in the Fees Office did their best. Some completely impersonal general points about the experiences of Members have followed from that, one of which was that if a Member has made a complete disclosure to the Fees Office about an item of expenditure that they believed to be consistent with the rules, and if the Fees Office, after proper examination, then said that it was consistent with the rules and paid the Member, it is a little hard, to say the least, if subsequently there is a retrospective judgment that the Member should pay back that money. That would be even harsher in future, when the rules will be much clearer.</p>

I could have been cavilling in advance, by tweaking his tail about the fact that we would not have needed some of the legislative changes if the House had stuck to the original proposals that I put forward rather than those that he persuaded it to accept. I hope that we can conduct the rest of the debate in the spirit in which it proceeded after he had read out that cavilling stuff, which was no doubt put in there by Andy Coulson just to prove that the right hon.

He talked about the possibility of double jeopardy under new clause 70 and new schedule 6. Double jeopardy applies where someone has been through a criminal trial and is tried again for the same offence. There is double jeopardy: if someone commits a criminal offence, there can be consequences in respect of their employment. If someone in a position of trust with their employer commits fraud, even if it is not against their employer, and it is drawn to their employer's attention, they are unlikely to continue to be employed. There cannot be a rule to say that someone who has  <br>

committed fraud against the building society that is nothing to do with his employer-let us say that it is a building firm, not a building society-cannot be drawn to the attention of the employer and has an absolute right to continue in that employment, notwithstanding the fact that it is plain that he was a fraudster from beginning to end. We all understand that, and the truth is that if someone egregiously breaks IPSA's rules, leaving aside whether he or she is prosecuted, other consequences are bound to flow from that, aside from any general reputational damage.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o242"><a name="100201-0013.htm_para7"><a name="10020153000012">On the firewall between IPSA and the compliance officer, as the right hon. Member for North-West Hampshire knows, there was a lot of discussion about the architecture. The direct responsibility for administering the scheme of allowances and paying them and, I accept, giving day-to-day guidance and advice rests not with the authority qua the authority, but with the chief executive officer and his or her employees. The only job that IPSA has to do in respect of the compliance officer is to make the appointment. We have discussed whether there can be any alternatives, possibly to dismiss the compliance officer, but on very limited grounds.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o243"><a name="100201-0013.htm_para8"><a name="10020153000013">Once appointed, as the schedule 6 makes clear, the compliance officer is appointed for a fixed term of five years and then they go. So having been appointed, no purpose would be served by their toadying to IPSA in the hope of getting a further term, because no further term is permissible. That is sensible, and it is certainly something that Sir Christopher Kelly wanted.</p>

Gentleman implied that a system could fall down if the compliance officer was asked to pass judgment on the people who appointed him. In a sense, it is not the first time that people in a judgmental, quasi-judicial position may be asked to do that. He or she will be appointed by IPSA. He or she is a separate, independent officer. Yes, it is very unlikely that he or she will pass judgment on the authority itself. He or she may well pass judgment on the chief executive officer and his or her staff. That is his or her job. I do not think for a second that the system will break down.</p>

To repeat the point that was implicit in many of the remarks, we want to be in neither a better nor a worse position than other people in the public sector and in the private sector for that matter. I looked at my payslip yesterday, and the hon. Member for Broxbourne is entirely right to remind the House and public that, although we get good benefits, the deductions are huge.

There is an automatic regulator of our salaries: the House has said by resolution that any recommendation of the Senior Salaries Review Body will be implemented.

That has certain attractions and would certainly mean that every Member of Parliament carefully checked the inflation rate. Over a normal Parliament, if the Bank of England's target had been stuck to, one's salary would have been eroded by a compound 10 per cent. He and the right hon. Member for North-West Hampshire were sitting in the House-I was a hired hand-in the 1975 period, when inflation rose to 27 per cent., through no fault of the Labour Government. It then rose again to 22 per cent. in 1981, through every fault of the Conservative Government, including the doubling of VAT. Leaving aside the cause, the fact is that inflation was very high under both parties; that was difficult; and a fixed, flat salary would have caused all sorts of problems.</p>

 The arrangements for members of staff will be a matter for the Parliamentary Standards Authority. I cannot anticipate what it will say. Meanwhile, one of the good things that has happened in recent years is that scales are now laid down. Members of staff must have contracts of employment and so on. That is a dramatic change from the ramshackle arrangements that existed years ago, when MPs themselves had to run the PAYE schemes, as those of us of a certain antiquity will remember.</p>

 That is a fair point. Another point, which I thought the hon.

I see no prospect of employing a member of my family, so that may allow me to say that I think that some of the adverse publicity that members of families have received in the course of the expenses row has been very unfair indeed. Everybody knows that because of serious abuse by one Member in particular, there need to be proper controls, but if members of the public want Members of Parliament to do two jobs, which they do-representing them in the House and also being available with great frequency in their constituency and at weekends-they must accept that that produces greater disruption even than working away from home.

My predecessor could go to my constituency one Friday a month for about six hours. She never had a house in the place and never wanted one.

We expect the other provisions to be broadly neutral, as compared with where we were before, as IPSA will be losing functions as well as gaining ones. Overall pay and pensions will not add hugely to running costs because IPSA is already paying. A small policy function will be required, and it will use the SSRB to do the analysis.</p>

I was asked whether a new compliance officer could be in post before Royal Assent and before April. Subject to the approval of the Committee today, which is the equivalent of a Second Reading of the new clauses, we are exploring with IPSA whether it would have the legal basis to go ahead and advertise for a compliance officer. It is entirely a matter for IPSA, but I hope it feels able to do so. Whether that means that the compliance officer will be in post by 1 April is a moot point, but I think we can expect the compliance officer to be in post by the time there is anything to comply with and any complaint to be made. I think IPSA will be able to meet that requirement.</p>

<p><a name="st_o248"><a name="10020220000261"><a name="100201-0019.htm_spnew0"><a name="10020220000890"><b>Mr. Wills:</b>
 Welcome to the Chair, Mr. Illsley. The Government have made it clear on several occasions that they support the principle that parliamentarians should pay taxes in the United Kingdom. All parties now seem to agree, and the proposed changes from the official Opposition, the Liberal Democrats and some of my hon. Friends suggest different ways of addressing this very issue.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o433"><a name="100201-0019.htm_para30"><a name="10020220000262">The Government's group of proposed changes would deem Members of this House and Members of the other place resident, ordinarily resident and domiciled in the UK for the purposes of income tax, capital gains tax and inheritance tax. As a result, they would be liable to pay those taxes on their worldwide income, capital gains and assets in exactly the same way as the vast majority of taxpayers. Moreover, they would be unable to access the remittance basis of taxation. In lay terms, they would not be able to avoid tax as a non-dom while a Member of this Parliament.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o434"><a name="100201-0019.htm_para31"><a name="10020220000263">The vast majority of parliamentarians do pay full UK taxes, but there has been widespread popular concern about the exceptions to that rule. The net result of these proposed changes would mean that MPs and peers were liable to pay the same taxes as the vast majority of UK taxpayers, regardless of their actual common law status in the UK. The new clauses will come into force from Royal Assent, so they might apply to the next Parliament.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o435"><a name="100201-0019.htm_para32"><a name="10020220000264">New clause 85 provides that all MPs will be deemed resident, ordinarily resident and domiciled from taking up their seat in this House upon taking the oath. Therefore, only those who were full UK taxpayers may sit and vote in this House. In the other place, all those appointed after the Bill receives Royal Assent would be aware that if they accepted a life peerage and a seat in the other place, they would be deemed resident, ordinarily resident and domiciled for tax purposes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o436"><a name="100201-0019.htm_para33"><a name="10020220000265">It is not possible to change a person's resident, ordinarily resident and domiciled tax status part way through a tax year, so in both instances MPs and peers would be deemed to be resident, ordinarily resident and domiciled for the whole of any tax year in which they were Members. That means that they would be deemed as such from the start of the tax year in which they took up their seat and to the end of the tax year in which they stood down.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o437"><a name="100201-0019.htm_para34"><a name="10020220000266">We acknowledge that the situation is different for incumbent Members of the House of Lords, who will be unable to resign from the House until the provisions in part 3 of the Bill come into force. As such, new clause 86 provides for a transitional period of three months during which incumbent peers can give notice in writing to the Clerk of the Parliaments that they are not willing to be subject to the deeming provision, and from that point their membership of the other place would cease.</p>

 The Minister is aware that we have signed up to the proposed changes, but it would be helpful to clarify the point about the ability of a Member of the other place-this does not really apply to the House of Commons-to get their affairs in order in sufficient time both to comply with the three-month rule and not to have an issue of retrospectivity over their tax. Will he explain how the marriage between the three months and the start of the tax year will work in practice?</p>

 In general, the way in which it will work is quite clear. There will be a three-month period after Royal Assent, and thereafter there will be a choice, which peers will make. I cannot pretend to be an expert on the tax affairs of every Member of the other place, but if the hon. and learned Gentleman would like to give me the details of any instances that he thinks might be caught up in that interaction, I should be very happy to address them and seek specialist advice on them.</p>

 As matters stand, I understand that one does not even have to be a national of this country to be a Member of the House of Lords; one can be a Member as a Commonwealth citizen. On that basis, some Members of the House of Lords might even originate from Commonwealth countries and have never been UK domiciled. Although this is a hypothetical matter, I can think of a number of Government appointees who might fall into that category. I want to understand how they will put their affairs in order if they wish to opt to remain in the House of Lords: what procedural mechanism will be required for that?</p>

 The hon. and learned Gentleman has put his name to these new clauses, and as such I would have hoped that he understood the purpose of a deeming mechanism. He keeps referring to people putting their affairs in order, but it is not clear whether he means their financial affairs or their status as a non-domicile, or in any other way. We have chosen this mechanism of deeming someone to be ordinarily resident and domiciled for a very particular reason. There may be a perfectly good, entirely benign reason, which has nothing to do with their tax affairs, why someone might wish not to change their status in the way that he mentions. That is perfectly fine, but what is not fine is that Members of this Parliament should not be placed in exactly the same position as the vast majority of British citizens for whom this place legislates. If people are prepared to pay tax in this country, like the vast majority of British citizens, that is fine, and they have three months to put themselves in order. If they do not want to do that, that is also fine, and they can cease being a Member of Parliament. I hope that the hon. and learned Gentleman fully understands the purpose of the deeming mechanism in these provisions.</p>

 I think that I do: that is why I was hoping to encourage the Minister to clarify the position in the way that the Secretary of State clarified it when I wrote to him about this matter as soon as I saw the amendment.  <br>

<notus-date day="1" month="2" year="2010" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><b>1 Feb 2010 : Column 117</b><br>
The key issue is whether somebody could end up being subject to double taxation. I believe that the Minister may be in a position to give the Committee some reassurance on that matter. If it is not satisfactorily covered, it provides the one opportunity that somebody who ended up being double-taxed might have to bring legal proceedings against the Government on the grounds of discrimination. As I entirely support the Government amendments, I wish to avoid that happening; that is why I want to press the Minister on this point.</p>

<p><a name="st_o254"><a name="10020220000274"><a name="100201-0020.htm_spnew5"><a name="10020220000896"><b>Mr. Wills:</b>
 Good-I am glad that at last we have managed precisely to elucidate what the hon. and learned Gentleman is about. If he is concerned about double taxation agreements, he can simply nod to tell me that that, and nothing else, is the burden of his concern.</p>

<p><a name="st_o255"><a name="10020220000275"><a name="100201-0020.htm_spnew6"><a name="10020220000897"><b>Mr. Grieve</b>

 Right. In that case, the position is clear; I think that the hon. and learned Gentleman is already aware of it. These new clauses do not affect the UK's double taxation agreements. For someone who is resident in the UK but also resident in another country or receives income from another country that is taxed in that country, the double taxation agreements exist to ensure that there is no double taxation. If no double taxation agreement is in place, Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs will give unilateral relief that allows relief for the foreign tax paid, and the individual will be liable only to tax for the difference, if UK tax rates are higher. That means that there will not be double taxation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o439"><a name="100201-0020.htm_para1"><a name="10020220000277">It is worth pointing out that these arrangements are available to all those resident in the United Kingdom: they are not special arrangements for Members of Parliament or for peers. That is important, because the fundamental point of principle is that Members of Parliament, whether in this House or in the other place, should be subject to the same taxation arrangements as the vast majority of British citizens. I hope that the hon. and learned Gentleman is reassured and that I have clarified his concerns about the matter.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o440"><a name="100201-0020.htm_para2"><a name="10020220000278">As I said, new clause 86 provides for a transitional period of three months during which incumbent peers can give notice in writing to the Clerk of the Parliaments that they are not willing to be subject to the deeming provision, and from that point their membership of the other place will cease. Members who remain will automatically be deemed resident, ordinarily resident and domiciled after that period. Once part 3 of the Bill comes into force, a peer may resign from the other place at any time if they do not wish to continue to be deemed resident, ordinarily resident and domiciled for tax purposes. New clause 86 provides that when a peer stands down from the other place during the transitional phase, they will be enfranchised. It also provides that when clause 33 comes into force they may disclaim their peerage. This is consistent with the approach we have taken in part 3 whereby those who leave the House for whatever reason may also, if they wish, disclaim their peerage.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o441"><a name="100201-0020.htm_para3"><a name="10020220000279">The new provision will not apply to the Lords Spiritual, as their membership of the House of Lords is inextricably linked to their professional position in the Church. They do not take a seat after accepting a peerage-it comes with their position in the Church of England.</p>

 I do not want to harp on about bishops to any great extent, as I did so last time we discussed the Bill. However, surely it is possible for a bishop to claim to be non-domiciled on the grounds of having foreign income and then take advantage of that position by being taxed on a remittance basis. I cannot understand why this provision should not apply to bishops.</p>

 Clearly, it is theoretically possible that there could be an enormously wealthy bishop who was escaping large amounts of taxation in this way, but I am not aware of any in that position. It is important to look at the facts to see why we have taken this view; obviously, all these matters are proportionate. Bishops in the House of Lords do not accept a peerage-they assume the position as a result of their profession as a bishop in the Church of England. If there were to be such a bishop who was non-domiciled and not ordinarily resident and who had these advantageous tax arrangements, then under these new clauses, they would, if they were not exempt, have to cease their profession, because the only way that they could cease to be a Member of the House of Lords would be to stop being a bishop.</p>

the same as that of new clause 53, albeit that it is fleshed out in greater detail, as I would expect. I was always conscious that in a matter of this sort a Government amendment would be required to resolve the legal minutiae, particularly regarding an issue that concerns revenue matters.</p>

However, it is worth flagging up. There are currently provisions in the upper House for Members to take leave of absence. That enables them to go abroad to pursue their lives, professions, trades or businesses, but leaves them the option of returning and starting to sit in the House again when their leave of absence ends. I should be grateful if the Minister endorsed, in his winding-up speech, that the new provisions effectively mean that that system of leave of absence would no longer be possible if, during the course of it, the person went abroad and became domiciled there for business purposes, because he would be required to continue to be deemed UK-resident, even though he was not playing an active part in the life of the other place.</p>

 I am not too sure whether that point works, given that new clause 85 is a deeming clause. The person concerned would therefore be treated for tax purposes as resident and domiciled, regardless of the facts.</p>

 I understand the hon. Gentleman's point. My understanding from raising the matter with the Government is that, although in future Members of the other place could seek leave of absence, as they have done in the past and still do, there would be no possibility, once the Bill was enacted, of their being non-domiciled in this country for tax purposes during that leave of absence. They would not be treated as not being domiciled in this country-they would continue to receive tax demands and be required to pay UK tax as if they were still here. Their only avenue out in those circumstances would be to resign from the House of Lords. That would mean that they could not-as they could hitherto-return to the service of the House on their return from some foreign appointment.</p>

be resident in this country for tax purposes until one decides to resign. As I can envisage some difficulties in adapting the provisions to take account of leave of absence, I assume that the Government have decided to ignore that. However, I ask the Minister for a rationale behind the Government's approach to the matter. He did not provide one in his opening speech this evening, but it would be helpful if could do so because I do not believe that anyone has complained in the past of mischief in the case of a peer who has leave of absence being away from the UK or not domiciled, but perhaps the Government think that somebody has done so.</p>

It is ultimately about loyalty to one place or another. It is also true-this is relevant to the comments of the hon. and learned Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Grieve)-that one can have more than one residence, but only one domicile.</p>

Let us say that that person then fails or declines to change their domicile from that of their father to domicile in this country. That is not a technicality about tax, but a reality about that person's view of themselves, and of which country and community they wish to belong.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o459"><a name="100201-0020.htm_para21"><a name="10020220000307">That example has something in common with the situation of Mr. Zac Goldsmith. His position, as far as I understand it, is that his father's domicile of origin was a different country, and that since the age of 16, he has had the opportunity to change that but has not done so. He now says that he is about to change his domicile, but he did not do so from when he was 16, which I believe was about 1981, to the present day. The question is not about paying tax, but about a person's commitment to this country.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o460"><a name="100201-0020.htm_para22"><a name="10020220000308">Other people are in a similar position. It is perfectly reasonable for a migrant to this country to have a domicile of origin in a different country, but once they come here, assuming they are of age, they are entitled to choose a different domicile. If they do not do so, especially over a long period, one must ask whether they have the commitment to this country that is required of someone who wants to sit in our legislature. That appears to be the case with Lord Paul, who came to this country in, I believe, 1966. Throughout that period, he has had the legal right to change domicile to this country but has not done so.</p>

One could be born in Sussex to a British father, and therefore, I suppose, have a domicile of origin in Britain, but then one might move to a different country-to Belize, for example, or to the Turks and Caicos islands-and develop an intention permanently to live there for the rest of one's life. Making a domicile of choice somewhere else would be an intention not to live in Britain. One could argue that of the Goldsmith-Paul and Ashcroft examples, the latter shows even less commitment to this country, because it is a case not of someone being landed with a domicile by their family or origin and then having to decide what to do about it, perhaps without realising what the law is, but of someone consciously going out to develop a domicile of choice in a different country.</p>

This is the importance of the remittance basis of tax: a person living in this country might have a long-term intention to live in a different country, but they do not want to take advantage of that for tax purposes. That might show a sufficient commitment to this country. However, someone who has a long-term intention not to be domiciled here and takes advantage of that for their personal advantage is not the kind of person who has sufficient commitment to be a Member of our legislature.</p>

If they are not willing to say whether they are non-doms or not, they should be suspended from the Lords until they do so. If they make a declaration about their status but lie about it, that should be a crime and they should be disqualified from the Lords. That is a straightforward approach.

The other thing about my new clause and retrospection is that it does not apply to the wider population, but to a small subset of the population: us and our colleagues in the House of Lords. I accept that it is in the public interest generally to avoid retrospective legislation, but there are cases where it is justified.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o482"><a name="100201-0021.htm_para20"><a name="10020220000343">I thought at this stage that I would be looking at the back of the head of my friend the Member for Blackburn (Mr. Straw), but he is not here. However, I will make this point anyway. The Criminal Evidence (Witness Anonymity) Act 2008 was introduced by him and it has retrospective provisions. The Election Publications Act 2001 was also introduced, I think, by my friend the Member for Blackburn, who was Home Secretary in 2001, so there are many-well, not many; I am getting carried away-there are a number of Acts containing retrospective provisions of which my friend the Member for Blackburn was the author. There is also the Banking Act 2009, which gives the Treasury powers to make orders with retrospective effect. I have tried to do a little homework for this debate, because to me it is about an important issue. The House of Lords Select Committee on the Constitution has said:</p>
<a name="100201-0021.htm_brev7"><a name="10020220000852"><ul><p class="tabletext">"there is no absolute prohibition on retrospective legislation in British Constitutional law or practice. There does, however, need to be a compelling reason in the public interest for a departure from the general principle that retrospective legislation is undesirable."</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o483"><a name="100201-0021.htm_para21"><a name="10020220000344">If ever there was an important issue that justified retrospective action, surely it is this one, where people have been in Parliament under what I would say were false pretences.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o484"><a name="100201-0021.htm_para22"><a name="10020220000345">That is as much as I can do here; I now leave it to people outside. What a sad reflection it is on our procedures that I have to rely on the Information Commissioner, who is acting on the view that I put to him, which is that there is a public interest imperative in knowing how people who, unlike us, are not elected get into the legislature down there, in the other place. The Information Commission is doing a very good job.</p>

 It is a great pleasure to follow the hon. Member for Pendle (Mr. Prentice). If he pushes his new clause 52 to a vote, I would certainly support it. Hon. Members must understand that I come at this issue from the point of view of independent election candidates, who fight on a very unlevel playing field. To my mind, new clause 52 would level the playing field for us independents and, perhaps, the smaller parties as well.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o486"><a name="100201-0021.htm_para24"><a name="10020220000348">Let us look at the recent changes to the election expenses regulations. We now have a long campaign as well as a short campaign. In the long campaign we are allowed to spend £25,000, plus an amount for each constituent. What independent hopeful or smaller party has 25 grand to spend, unless they happen to be multi-millionaires? It is enough of a struggle to raise the £7,000 and a bit for the short campaign, so anything that placed more control on outside donors, with a retrospective focus on their tax status, would certainly make it rather more difficult for these super-rich people to donate to the main parties. I realise that that would not be popular with Members who belong to parties. However, in view of the desire to improve the reputation of the House and of our electoral system, I appeal to hon. Members to look at the use of rich supporters in the football league. It is well known that money buys the best footballers.</p>

I remind him that the policy intention behind the new clauses is to ensure that those who sit in the United Kingdom Parliament pay tax on the same basis as the majority of the population. I hope that he will accept that his concerns would come into play only when someone was working abroad on public service. They would not refer to someone taking a leave of absence to avoid, or even evade, paying tax in this country. We are talking about people who go away to work on public service and, for the most part, for only a short period of time.</p>

He rightly said that a position in the other place ought to be a job, not an honour. If someone stops doing that job, that is a matter for them. The option is clear: they can resign their position in the other place and not be covered by these provisions, or, if they wish to maintain a presence in the House of Lords, they should be covered by them. Apart from that, I am grateful for the hon. and learned Gentleman's support, and to him and his colleagues for putting their names to the new clause. This is the right way forward.</p>

He gave his argument full justification, and I will not repeat most of it. I am interested in his definition of "belonging", however. He seems to take exception to the symbolic perpetuation of the position of non-domiciles, saying that it somehow undermines their commitment to this country. He acknowledged that there could be perfectly good reasons for retaining that position that would not have any practical impact on the commitment of a Member of the other place to this country. I am interested to find out why a symbolic affirmation of commitment, in relation to the status of domicile, is more important than the huge practical manifestation of commitment through paying tax in this country. That is the point.</p>

He mentioned one such situation. Nevertheless, it is a bad principle and axiomatically an affront to natural justice. There must be an overwhelmingly compelling case for it, and I am not sure that he made it. Our new provisions will deliver everything for which he has campaigned for a long time. He has been a diligent campaigner on the matter, and the Government have always accepted the principle behind the campaign. We have had problems finding a way to make the system effective so that it works in the way that most people want it to work.

 It is retrospectivity that I wish to ask the Minister a question about. I can see that there should be a strong presumption against it when it means that a new requirement is applied retrospectively to a person who could not or should not have been able to foresee it. In this case, however, are we not talking about solemn undertakings given to a body of Parliament in order for people to take their seat? Should they not have anticipated that, one day, somebody would ask them whether they had complied with the undertakings that they had given?</p>

He will correct me if I am quoting him wrongly, but I believe he said that it was a sad reflection that we had to rely on the Information Commissioner in such matters. It is not a sad reflection, as that is precisely why the Government set up the Information Commissioner's office-to ensure that people have access to the information to which they are entitled. That is a fundamental principle of our programme of constitutional reforms. We are proud of the Freedom of Information Act 2000 and we are going to enhance it, not row it back. It is not a sad reflection at all; it is a celebration of this Government's achievement with the Freedom of Information Act. I hope that my hon.

 On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker. The debate that we have just had finished very early. Some of us felt strongly that new clause 52 should have been put to a vote, but we were told very clearly that when the Government new clauses were put to the Committee and accepted, that would be prevented. That would have made some sense if we had had no time in which to vote, but there was plenty of time. May we have a ruling from you, Mr. Deputy Speaker, on why the procedure was dealt with in that way?</p>

<p><a name="st_o305"><a name="10020220000386"><a name="100201-0022.htm_spnew21"><a name="10020220000947"><b>Mr. Deputy Speaker:</b>
 I am sorry to say that those events occurred in Committee, and I am not able to comment on what happened during the Committee stage.</p>

 Further to that point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker. One of the problems that we experienced when the Committee stage finished early was that, because of the timetable motion, we could not continue to deal with amendments and new clauses which were quite properly tabled for discussion in Committee. Is there any possibility that the House could revisit the timetable motion, so that we can make proper progress on a constitutional Bill on the Floor of the House while we are here waiting to debate it?</p>

<p><a name="st_o307"><a name="10020220000388"><a name="100201-0022.htm_spnew23"><a name="10020220000949"><b>Mr. Deputy Speaker:</b>
 I entirely understand the point that the hon. Gentleman has made, which is firmly on the record, but I am sure he will appreciate that there is nothing that I can do to deal with it at this point.</p>

 Further to that point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker. I realise that you cannot comment now on procedures carried out when the House was in Committee, but may I ask you to request that the Speaker examine the <i> Hansard </i>record tomorrow and make a statement tomorrow about the procedure that has been applied? As a result of that procedure, a significant new clause tabled by a Back Bencher could not be put to a vote, although I believe it was the will of the House that that should happen. It would be helpful to have a ruling from the Speaker on the matter, or at least a statement that the procedure might be reformed in the future.</p>

 I can say to the hon. Gentleman that Mr. Speaker always takes a very close interest in all the business of the House, but I will personally make sure that all these matters are drawn to his attention tomorrow morning.</p>

 On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker. As a result of the procedural mix-up tonight, we have lost about six minutes during which time we could, and should, have been debating item 10 on the Order Paper on section 5 of the European Communities (Amendment) Act 1993, when arguments could have been made that we should not pass such motions, or move forward with that Act at all, until we have made progress on the common agricultural policy and root-and-branch reform of our relationship with the European Union. Will Mr. Speaker be minded to extend tonight's business by six minutes after 10 o'clock, so we that can make up that valuable time?</p>

 Children's homes should provide a safe, positive and caring environment for young people who are unable to live at home. It is important that they provide the highest standards of care. Over the years, care and inspection of children's homes has been subject to changes. Indeed, before the Care Standards Act 2000, homes with fewer than four children did not have to be registered at all. Quite rightly, inspection is becoming more rigorous, and I welcome the new draft minimum care standards, issued by the Department for Children, Schools and Families, on which Ofsted will base future inspections. That is happening in response to the changing nature of children's homes over the years.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o509"><a name="100201-0023.htm_para4"><a name="10020220000785">When I first worked as a social worker in Stockport in the 1980s, small family-type care homes provided a family environment for quite young children. The carers were often a couple resident in the home. Now, of course, younger children are placed in foster families and the young people placed in children's homes are older. They present very difficult and challenging behaviour and often come into care with multiple problems and complex needs.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o510"><a name="100201-0023.htm_para5"><a name="10020220000786">In Stockport, a high number of children and young people are placed in our children's homes from other local authority areas. Some 53 per cent. of all looked-after children are from outside the borough, compared with the national average of 35 per cent. Our percentage is one of the highest in the country. Many of the children who live in the homes about which residents have complained to me are from outside Stockport and are young offenders. Owners sometimes charge up to £4,500 a week per child and some advertise aggressively in other boroughs for "priority and prolific offenders".</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o511"><a name="100201-0023.htm_para6"><a name="10020220000787">In Stockport, we have more than 30 private registered children's homes-the third highest number in the country-and we can bear testament to the changing nature of those homes, given the problems that we have encountered with antisocial behaviour. It is important to improve outcomes for vulnerable, often difficult young people in care, but it is also important to ensure that proper consideration is given to the location of the home.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o512"><a name="100201-0023.htm_para7"><a name="10020220000788">Standard 23 in the draft minimum standards, entitled "The design and location of the home", says:</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o513"><a name="100201-0023.htm_para8"><a name="10020220000789">That presumes the existence of some planning process, as well as a registration process.</p>

My constituents made the point that they were never consulted about the change of use.</p>

He told me about their "monumentally distressing situation". He and his mother have been subjected to much abuse and damage to their home. He described how the home for young people came into existence without local people knowing anything about it or being given any say in the change of use from a private dwelling house. It turns out that the house next door was classified under the Town and Country Planning (Use Classes) Order 1987 to be in use class C3-a dwelling house, which covers use by a single person or by people living together as a family that has not more than six residents living together as a single household and can include a home where care is provided to residents.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o516"><a name="100201-0023.htm_para11"><a name="10020220000792">My constituent wrote to Stockport council and was told that no planning breaches had occurred, as a domestic property could be converted, under use C3, into a facility for care for up to six residents living as a single household, without anyone seeking planning permission or consulting local residents. However, a planning application would have been required if residential accommodation and care to people in need of care were being provided, other than use within class C3, as that would fall within class C2. Apart from being a somewhat circular definition, that is very confusing. When is a children's home a residential provision where care is being provided-that is, a C2 use-and when is it a single household where care is provided and therefore a C3 use? It seems to depend on the number of persons, according to the local planning authority.</p>

The key element in the use of a dwelling house for non-family purposes is the concept of a single household. The single household concept will provide more certainty over the planning position of small group homes which play a major role in the Government's community care policy which is aimed at enabling disabled and mentally disordered people to live as normal lives as possible in touch with the community.</p>

In response to the problems, the Department for Communities and Local Government issued a consultation on HMOs and possible planning responses. The responses were published last week, on 27 January, and the most popular planning request was that the use classes order be amended to provide a specific definition of an HMO which removed the ambiguity of the term</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o524"><a name="100201-0023.htm_para19"><a name="10020220000800">I am pleased to say that Stockport has now issued new planning guidance, which states:</p>

This requires a judgement, having regard to the provisions of the latest government advice and guidance and any relevant case law. The Use Classes Circular updated in March 2005, clarifies that proposals for small care homes should be assessed/determined as a class C2, 'Residential Institutions', use class, distinct from the Class C3 'Dwelling Houses' class.

Friend the Secretary of State for Children, Schools and Families said last week that the Government response on the draft national minimum standard is due in June. If standard 23 is accepted, the presumption that all applications for children's homes will have been through a thorough planning application will have implications for the current interpretation that children's homes are C3 use and no planning approval is required to open one.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o528"><a name="100201-0024.htm_para3"><a name="10020220000804">I agree that the use classes order must strike a balance between the categories that are too broad, which leave local planning authorities with too little control of changes, and the categories that are too narrow, which increase the number of planning applications. I understand that tension, but, if planning authorities try to deal with the difficulties of community opposition to a children's home by simply not introducing a planning process, local people's hostility to children's homes will continue.</p>

The best way of getting community support for children's homes is to ensure that there is a proper planning process, and that local residents' comments are taken into account and reflected in planning conditions. The wider community would then feel that it had some influence and control over the process, because it clearly does not have any at the moment. A proper planning process would also mean that any failure to comply with planning conditions could be reported to Ofsted, which would take that into account in its inspection of the home. That would help raise standards.</p>

 I congratulate my hon. Friend on securing this important debate and recognise her contribution to the Government's support for children who either go missing or run away from care or from home. Would planning approval for a change of use provide police forces with the information that they need on the number and location of children's homes in their area? A senior police officer told me last week that he had not been able to obtain from the registration authority the information on the location and number of children's homes in his police force area, and that he had had to resort to checking the Yellow Pages and other advertising media in order to identify their location. Would my hon. Friend's proposals have any wider benefits than those that she has already identified by virtue of their helping those authorities that needed to work together?</p>

 I thank my hon. Friend for that intervention.

was happening in that neighbourhood and provide better details to inform the planning decision on whether the location was appropriate for a home. Furthermore, the owners of a home would therefore try their very best to ensure that a proper management system was in place, because without one they would break their planning conditions, and that in turn would affect their registration. That process would be important in raising standards.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o531"><a name="100201-0024.htm_para6"><a name="10020220000809">Our local authority has a larger number of children missing from home, compared with the conurbation average of 65 per cent. of children running away having gone missing from children's homes. That reflects the complex difficulties of those young people, the high level of private provision in Stockport and the difficulty that those private homes have in managing such children. It also gives some indication of the pressure on local agencies. I welcome the measures in the Children and Young Persons Act 2008 to restrict out-of-borough placements. That should help, but it will not resolve planning process issues.</p>

Children's homes must have proper management systems and provide the high-quality care that is needed to improve the life chances of those young people. The registration process is integral to the establishment of those high standards, and so is the planning process. The Government have consulted on planning responses to HMOs and recognised the problems caused by high concentrations of those homes. However, I urge my hon. Friend the Minister to undertake a similar consultation on the possible planning responses to children's homes, and to remove the current ambiguities of the single household-a singularly unhelpful definition that has had its time. That would also ensure that people, wherever they live, have the protection of planning laws that respond to the challenges of providing high-quality children's homes in appropriate locations. Times have changed since 1987, and the planning laws need to be adapted. I urge my hon. Friend to bring about the necessary changes.</p>

They also require a home and its registered manager to maintain appropriate links with the local community to ensure good relations with neighbours. The regulatory system thereby aims to tackle problems of the sort that my hon.

Where homes do not meet the required standards, Ofsted has a range of enforcement powers at its disposal. Action needs to be taken against poor homes, in the interests not only of local communities that may be affected but of the children living there.

These include new powers such as restricting new admissions to a home. Further provisions will ensure that all local authorities are notified of enforcement action being taken by a home in cases where the chief inspector has brought proceedings or where a notice to cancel registration has been issued. These measures should lead to greater transparency and will improve the information available to local authorities in making decisions about commissioning placements. I would expect any local authority to investigate instances where a children's home has been badly run or is the subject of complaints from the local community.</p>

Friend has raised the planning aspects of providing accommodation for looked-after children, particularly in relation to concerns about the operation of the Town and Country Planning (Use Classes) Order 1987. The planning system is primarily concerned with the use of land and the effect on amenity of any alteration or changes to the use of land. It may be helpful if I explain briefly how the order works. It operates by grouping together into classes land uses that have similar amenity impacts. The order allows changes between certain land uses where the amenity impacts of such would be minimal, without the need for planning permission. In most cases, the permissible change of use is within the same class, but there are cases where movement between classes is permitted. For example, premises currently used as a restaurant-class A3-could be converted to a shop, which would be class A1, without the need to seek planning permission, because the impact of a shop on the surrounding area would be likely to be the same or less than that of a restaurant.</p>

However, it is for local planning authorities to decide on a case-by-case basis which class a particular use falls into. When a change of use occurs, the local planning authority must consider whether a material change has occurred that would require planning permission. The planning guidance from Stockport council, which my hon. Friend quoted, recognises that. It is an important principle that material change of use is the test for whether planning permission is required.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o539"><a name="100201-0024.htm_para14"><a name="10020220000818">Under the use classes order, I would expect most children's homes to fall into the same use class as other residential institutions, such as nursing homes or training centres-class C2. It applies when there are more than six occupants, or when the occupants are not considered to be living together as a single household.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o540"><a name="100201-0024.htm_para15"><a name="10020220000819">However, as my hon. Friend said, it is also possible that some smaller children's homes could fall into the same class as dwelling houses-class C3. That use class provides for dwelling houses used by a single person or a family, but also for small groups of people living together as a single household, including cases where there is an element of care. As she has been advised, there is discretion in the way in which local planning authorities apply that. It is important to retain some discretion to avoid unintended consequences, given the variety of living arrangements that broadly have the same planning impact.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o541"><a name="100201-0024.htm_para16"><a name="10020220000820">Depending on the particular circumstances, there may be occasions when a house previously occupied by a family could be changed to a children's home, which would take the premises into class C2 and so require planning permission. There could also be instances of such a change resulting in a children's care home that would still be classified as C3 in planning terms. For example, it would be difficult to argue that significantly different planning impacts arise from a family of six living in a house on the one hand, and four or five children with a carer living there on the other.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o542"><a name="100201-0024.htm_para17"><a name="10020220000821">My hon. Friend has drawn attention to the need to consider carefully the location of a home for looked-after children, in relation to the needs of children and young people and to those of the host community. I absolutely agree that such considerations should be carefully applied, and they can take place in other ways, in addition to the planning system.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o543"><a name="100201-0024.htm_para18"><a name="10020220000822">For example, the draft standards that my colleagues in the Department for Children, Schools and Families are considering include draft standard 23, which says among other things that</p>
<a name="100201-0024.htm_brev1"><a name="10020220000871"><ul><p class="tabletext">"location is carefully considered at the planning stage for a new home",</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o544"><a name="100201-0024.htm_para19"><a name="10020220000823">and that</p>
<a name="100201-0024.htm_brev2"><a name="10020220000872"><ul><p class="tabletext">"the home is situated in a location which takes into account the safety and protection of children living there and the community."</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o545"><a name="100201-0024.htm_para20"><a name="10020220000824">The importance of that is already stated in the "Children Act 1989 Volume 4: Statutory Guidance on Residential Care". Those provisions are not about blanket planning requirements, but are intended to make providers of children's homes consider the location when setting up a children's home.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o546"><a name="100201-0024.htm_para21"><a name="10020220000825">For example, particular thought should be given to the suitability of the location to providing an environment helpful to each child's development, by giving access to  <br>

schools, shops and amenities. The standard also lays down that thought should be given at the planning stage to any aspects of design and location which might assist in maintaining a responsible, positive relationship with the neighbourhood.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o547"><a name="100201-0024.htm_para22"><a name="10020220000826">As my hon. Friend pointed out, the nature of children's homes has changed over the years and I am sure that it will continue to change. It is therefore right that local authorities have the discretion to determine whether a material change of use has occurred on a case-by-case basis so that we can achieve a balance between giving local authorities strong powers to shape their local areas and not being unduly burdensome on users of the planning system.</p>

 Will my hon. Friend give particular consideration to the point that I made earlier? It is so important that local authorities and police forces work together to protect vulnerable children. An aspect of that, considering the police of the 24/7 authority, to which missing children are reported, is that they know where children's homes are located in their area and can build up a relationship with them. Will the Minister consider how he can use the levers in his Department to help with that?</p>

 I thank my hon. Friend for raising that important point, which she mentioned earlier. I hope that she accepts that I am not an expert in the way in which the police and local authorities react to those matters. I am surprised, because I would have thought that, if the standards require proper management, it is reasonable to expect what my hon. Friend suggests to happen automatically. I will ask ministerial colleagues who are responsible for those matters to contact my hon. Friend and perhaps meet her to discuss them.</p>

 I should also like to mention comments that have been made in the past few weeks on national indicator 71, in which my hon. Friend's Department has a key interest, on support for runaway and missing children. It has been in place since April last year, and the evidence I am getting from local authorities, police forces and charities working with vulnerable children is that it is driving change very effectively. Will he consider how he can support that?</p>

 My hon. Friend is an acknowledged expert on such issues and probably knows more than any other hon. Member about how those things work. I would be happy to look at the details and perhaps to arrange for her to meet officials in my Department so that she can provide evidence as to how those measures are working on the ground.</p>

 Will the Minister and some of his officials meet me to explore further how the planning responses to the HMO document might impinge on the planning applications for children's homes, particularly as they are clear that the single household definition is unhelpful? As he knows, the definition also applies to whether a children's home application is determined as C2 or C3 use. It would be helpful if I had the opportunity to discuss the matter further with him.</p>
