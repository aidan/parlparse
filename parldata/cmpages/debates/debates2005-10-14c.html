<p><a name="st_1"><a name="51014-01_spnew0"><b> Mr. Marsha Singh  (Bradford, West) (Lab):</b> 
 I beg to move, That the Bill be now read a Second time.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51014-01_para0">
<a name="stpa_0">It is with great pleasure that I present the Bill to the House. Its purpose is self-evident in its title. If it is successful, it will address an imbalance between England, Wales and Northern Ireland and Scotland. The Scottish Parliament has recognised that failure to provide assistance to victims of employment discrimination contravenes article 6&nbsp;of the European convention on human rights, which establishes the right to a fair hearing. In Scotland the problem was tackled by extending legal aid, but I believe that there is a viable alternative, which I propose in my Bill.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51014-01_para1">
<a name="stpa_1">Citizens Advice gets to the heart of the issue in a simple statement:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_0">&quot;Citizenship requires that rights granted by Parliament must be enforceable. Erecting ever-tighter barriers to justice through legal aid eligibility tests and rationed supply of subsidised services undermines citizenship.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="51014-01_para2">
<a name="stpa_2">I stand for social justice above all else. There can be no principled justification for failing victims of discrimination. We cannot continue to confer rights and not provide the wherewithal to exercise them: access to justice should be&#151;must be&#151;a fundamental right.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51014-01_para3">
<a name="stpa_3">A veritable mountain of evidence demonstrates the need for my Bill. Despite 30 Acts, 38 statutory instruments, 11 codes of practice and 12 European directives and recommendations, widespread employment discrimination persists. That the legislation is so complex and inaccessible is one of the strongest points in favour of the Bill.
</p>








<p><a name="st_2"><a name="51014-01_spnew1"><b> Mr. Oliver Heald  (North-East Hertfordshire) (Con):</b> 
 One way of dealing with the problem would be for the Government to review the law of discrimination to make it much simpler. Discrimination law has grown piecemeal, which has led to a large and complex body of law. Would it not be better to review the whole area?


<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>14 Oct 2005 : Column 526</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br></p>








<p><a name="st_3"><a name="51014-01_spnew2"><b> Mr. Singh: </b> 
 I would not oppose such a review, but in its absence we need to do something to ensure that the victims of discrimination have some way of exercising their rights and challenging that discrimination. That is what the Bill is intended to do.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51014-01_para4">
<a name="stpa_4">Unfair dismissal accounts for just over a quarter of all employment claims in recent years&#151;a proportion that has remained fairly constant. Such cases are the most successful, whether they reach the tribunal or are settled by conciliation: almost 60&nbsp;per cent. are successful, of which 47&nbsp;per cent. are settled by conciliation. Discrimination claims are increasing, however, from just over 11&nbsp;per cent. of claims in 2002&#150;03&nbsp;to more than 13&nbsp;per cent. in 2004&#150;05, with the largest increases occurring in equal pay and sex discrimination claims. More than 10,000&nbsp;claims went to tribunal in 2004&#150;05. In 2001, there were more than 1,434&nbsp;pregnancy claims alone.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51014-01_para5">
<a name="stpa_5">It has been well documented that women continue to earn significantly less than men&#151;18&nbsp;per cent. less in 2003&#151;and they are concentrated in lower-paid jobs, but that is far from their only disadvantage in the workplace. New research published by the Equal Opportunities Commission in February this year illustrated the shocking fact that, each year, approximately 30,000&nbsp;women lose their job as a result of pregnancy; this includes being sacked, forced to leave or made redundant. Only a quarter of women surveyed did not experience any problems.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51014-01_para6">
<a name="stpa_6">That is only the tip of the iceberg. The EOC research indicates that the majority of women do not pursue a claim because it is so difficult and costly and, in some cases, because they are not fully aware of their rights. Two BBC website readers described what happened when they told their employer they were pregnant. Clare, 29, from Bristol, had been working for an internet company as a project manager for six months when she became pregnant. Off sick because of morning sickness, she phoned work. She says:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_1">&quot;I was told that I would have to see the manager on Monday but on the Sunday I was called at home by the managing director who said I didn&#039;t have a job to go back to&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. . They said that as I had only been with them for six months, I had no rights&quot;,</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="51014-01_para7">
<a name="stpa_7">and


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_2">&quot;if I tried to sue them they would say that I had been sacked because I didn&#039;t fit in.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>








<p><a name="st_4"><a name="51014-01_spnew3"><b> Mark Tami  (Alyn and Deeside) (Lab):</b> 
 Does my hon. Friend have further information on that case? Was the woman represented by a union, and was she able to pursue it through that means?
</p>








<p><a name="st_5"><a name="51014-01_spnew4"><b> Mr. Singh: </b> 
 I am sorry, I do not have those details, but I can try and get them. If my hon. Friend will be patient, I shall come to trade unions later in my speech.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51014-01_para8">
<a name="stpa_8">Sarah, aged 28, from London had worked in public relations for eight years and for her current employer for eight months when she became pregnant. Within a fortnight she was called to a disciplinary meeting and given a list of grievances. She reported:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_3">&quot;I was told that they would decide over the next fortnight whether I would be able to stay.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="51014-01_para9">
<a name="stpa_9">Two weeks later she was sacked. Her solicitor advised her that she had a good case for sexual discrimination but would need to find between &#163;7,000&nbsp;and &#163;10,000&nbsp;to fight it.


<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>14 Oct 2005 : Column 527</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>

<p>
<a name="51014-01_para10">
<a name="stpa_10">Similarly, the <i>Birmingham Evening Mail</i> reported in April 2003&nbsp;the case of Carol Bonehill, who received a card from work congratulating her on the birth of her baby, only to find that her P45&nbsp;and a dismissal letter were enclosed. The northern complainants aid fund took up her case.
</p>








<p><a name="st_6"><a name="51014-01_spnew5"><b> Mr. Kevan Jones  (North Durham) (Lab):</b> 
 I used to practise regularly in industrial tribunals. My hon. Friend mentioned someone who was told that the case would cost &#163;7,000. Does my hon. Friend agree that the problem with industrial tribunals is that lawyers have turned them into a feeding frenzy for themselves, not for claimants?
</p>








<p><a name="st_7"><a name="51014-01_spnew6"><b> Mr. Singh: </b> 
 I entirely agree. One aspect of the Bill, to which I shall return, is that it does not put matters back into the hands of lawyers, but introduces a different system of advice and support.
</p>








<p><a name="st_8"><a name="51014-01_spnew7"><b> Huw Irranca-Davies  (Ogmore) (Lab):</b> 
 Although my hon. Friend said that he did not have all the information about the representation in those cases, one of the main issues is trade union representations. Unions have made great strides, but does my hon. Friend agree that the Government should consider improving the competence of trade union representatives? Does he recognise that a major issue is representation in non-unionised work forces, which are increasingly common?
</p>








<p><a name="st_9"><a name="51014-01_spnew8"><b> Mr. Singh: </b> 
 I agree. I wish more people were union members. As I shall show, large parts of the work force, especially the most vulnerable workers, are not unionised. We have a duty and a responsibility to protect those workers as well.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51014-01_para11">
<a name="stpa_11">On the case taken up by the northern complainants aid fund, although the employers denied dismissing the woman for being pregnant, she won her case at tribunal. The case was instrumental in prompting the equal opportunities investigation that I mentioned.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51014-01_para12">
<a name="stpa_12">Citizens Advice told me about the case of Jean, a nursery worker who was eight months pregnant and a single mother-to-be when she sought advice from her local citizens advice bureau. Her employer of two years had been paying her less than the national minimum wage, had been making illegal deductions from her wages in respect of her attendance at antenatal clinics, and had never provided her with a written statement of her terms and conditions. Shortly before Jean was due to start her maternity leave, she had been summarily and unfairly dismissed&#151;at a time when the Government are promoting the new deal to enable single mothers to go to work, instead of relying on state benefits. Here was a woman who had a job and lost it on spurious grounds.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51014-01_para13">
<a name="stpa_13">The treatment of that young woman highlights other issues. It is not just about losing one&#039;s job. Unfair treatment can take other forms. A young pregnant woman who sought advice from a citizens advice bureau in London was working for a cleaning company. After she fell ill because of her pregnancy, her employer had suggested a reduction in her hours. She asked whether that would affect her maternity leave or pay, and her 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>14 Oct 2005 : Column 528</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>employer stated that it would not. However, shortly before the expected date of birth, her employer told her that she no longer qualified for statutory maternity pay as her earnings were now below the qualifying level. Clearly, the woman had been atrociously misled. We can only imagine the impact that the loss of pay would have at a time when a new baby is due.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51014-01_para14">
<a name="stpa_14">Both the last two cases highlight important issues for wider social policy. We have made huge advances in ensuring access to antenatal care. Research has proved time and again that that is essential to the well-being of mother and child. If women suffer loss of wages by attending hospital appointments, we risk that progress being set back decades. We are committed to ending child poverty. Maternity pay is a crucial element in that quest, yet we see women being manipulated into losing that right.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51014-01_para15">
<a name="stpa_15">Discrimination continues after maternity leave is over. The employer of a woman who approached a citizens advice bureau in Dorset in May 2000&nbsp;had refused her request to work part-time on her return from maternity leave, on the grounds that there was no part-time culture in the firm. A citizens advice bureau in Wales reports the case of a woman working as a mechanical draughtsperson, whose employer had refused her request to return to work from maternity leave on a part-time, job-share or reduced hours basis. She felt pressurised into resigning and wrote to the company to say so, but received no reply. When she telephoned to try and discuss the matter, she was told that her employers were too busy to talk to her.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51014-01_para16">
<a name="stpa_16">Bringing a case is costly and beyond the resources of most complainants. A three-day tribunal in London costs between &#163;15,000&nbsp;and &#163;40,000.

<p><a name="st_10"><a name="51014-02_spnew0"><b> Mark Tami: </b> 
 My hon. Friend is making a good argument for workers joining a trade union. One of the most significant benefits of being a trade union member are the excellent legal services that unions provide. I defy anyone to get the same level of legal protection from a firm of lawyers for the same amount of money as they pay for trade union membership. We should encourage people to join and make access to properly recognised unions easier.
</p>








<p><a name="st_11"><a name="51014-02_spnew1"><b> Mr. Singh: </b> 
 I entirely agree, but what do we do in the meantime? What do we do about people who do not want to join a union? Should they not have access to justice?
</p>








<p><a name="st_12"><a name="51014-02_spnew2"><b> Mr. Mark Harper  (Forest of Dean) (Con):</b> 
 If workers choose not to join a trade union and not to avail themselves of the services that it provides, they clearly will not get them. I do not see why we should pass legislation to give them services that are available but which they have chosen not to take up. If members of a work force want those services, they should take the advice of Labour Members and join a union or some other organisation.
</p>








<p><a name="st_13"><a name="51014-02_spnew3"><b> Mr. Singh: </b> 
 The hon. Gentleman clearly does not support access to justice for all. I do, and I hope many of my colleagues agree with me. We will find out later.


<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>14 Oct 2005 : Column 529</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>

<p>
<a name="51014-02_para0">
<a name="stpa_17">Tribunals in London cost between &#163;15,000&nbsp;and &#163;40,000. Evidence of intimidation and unjustified threats has also been revealed by Citizens Advice.
</p>








<p><a name="st_14"><a name="51014-02_spnew4"><b> Mr. Kevan Jones: </b> 
 I am interested in the figures that my hon. Friend quotes. In complex equal pay cases where barristers are employed and legal opinion must be obtained, such figures may pertain, but in my experience in some cases the tribunal will find in favour of the applicant because they are by definition unfair. Is it not possible that the Bill will be welcomed by lawyers in anticipation of higher fees for themselves?
</p>








<p><a name="st_15"><a name="51014-02_spnew5"><b> Mr. Singh: </b> 
 One of the main selling points of the Bill is that it will do precisely the opposite, by setting up a system of advice and representation in which lay people and specialists in the subject who are not lawyers will also be involved.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51014-02_para1">
<a name="stpa_18">Revised procedural rules introduced in 2001&nbsp;increase the costs that can be awarded from &#163;500&nbsp;to a massive &#163;10,000. Although there is little evidence that high awards are being made, this is not deterring employers from using the threat to intimidate complainants. Northampton citizens advice bureau was acting for a woman who had been dismissed two days after informing her employers that she was pregnant. She received a letter warning her that they could seek costs against her. Despite her strong case, she withdrew her claim. We can only speculate why more than half the sex discrimination claims were withdrawn in 2004&#150;05.
</p>








<p><a name="st_16"><a name="51014-02_spnew6"><b> Mark Tami: </b> 
 I worked for a trade union for 15&nbsp;years and was involved in several tribunals. In my experience, it is rare that they even threaten to award costs. I am not aware of a case where that happened.
</p>








<p><a name="st_17"><a name="51014-02_spnew7"><b> Mr. Singh: </b> 
 With his experience in the union, my hon. Friend has probably dealt only with a unionised work force. I am speaking about the huge number of people who are non-unionised. Perhaps my hon. Friend does not know about their experiences out there, but they are what I am describing.
</p>








<p><a name="st_18"><a name="51014-02_spnew8"><b> Mr. Kevan Jones: </b> 
 I accept that many employers use such an approach as a threat against the applicant, but the applicant can always ask for a pre-hearing, or the tribunal chairman can have a pre-hearing to assess whether the case is frivolous and vexatious. During my long experience, I dealt with just one case during which a chairman applied a costs warning. Such a course of action is open to an applicant whether they are legally represented or they go themselves before a chairman.
</p>








<p><a name="st_19"><a name="51014-02_spnew9"><b> Mr. Singh: </b> 
 My hon. Friend makes an important point, but some of the people I am discussing here number among the most vulnerable groups in society. They have the least support available to them, and they are also probably among the least well informed about their rights.
</p>








<p><a name="st_20"><a name="51014-02_spnew10"><b> Ms Diana R. Johnson  (Kingston upon Hull, North) (Lab):</b> 
 Perhaps my hon. Friend will comment on the role of community law centres in giving advice and in providing representation in employment tribunals. Such 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>14 Oct 2005 : Column 530</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>advice can often put people&#039;s minds at rest about pursuing an employment tribunal case and the associated potential costs.
</p>








<p><a name="st_21"><a name="51014-02_spnew11"><b> Mr. Singh: </b> 
 Community law centres play a very important role, but the problem is that many of them rely on funding from local councils or other bodies, and such funding is not always secure. In fact, because of the funding situation my own law centre in Bradford no longer has an employment lawyer. The case for this Bill is that we need a solid system throughout the country that enables people to get advice and help, without having to rely on law centres obtaining funding from local councils or the Law Centres Federation. That said, law centres do play an important role.
</p>








<p><a name="st_22"><a name="51014-02_spnew12"><b> Huw Irranca-Davies: </b> 
 I have a genuine question that I should like to put both to my hon. Friend and to the Government, and perhaps I can expand on it later if I am fortunate enough to catch your eye, Madam Deputy Speaker. How many cases actually fall beyond the scope of the unionised work force and of legal aid? As it stands, I have no idea whether we are talking about a tidal wave of such cases, or just a few individual ones that are slipping through the net. If there is not a mass of such evidence, how relevant is this Bill?
</p>








<p><a name="st_23"><a name="51014-02_spnew13"><b> Mr. Singh: </b> 
 I know that my hon. Friend is a very patient Member, and if he will bear with me I will deal with that point in due course.

 Will my hon. Friend give way?
</p>








<p><a name="st_25"><a name="51014-02_spnew15"><b> Mr. Singh: </b>

</p>








<p><a name="st_26"><a name="51014-02_spnew16"><b> Mark Tami: </b> 
 I want to make just one further point, concerning the community legal service. I have compared the terms of reference of the body that my hon. Friend seeks to create with those of the CLS, and there appears to be a lot of overlap. Does he accept that in effect, he will be duplicating the CLS&#039;s role, and if so, what, in his opinion, is the future of the CLS?
</p>








<p><a name="st_27"><a name="51014-02_spnew17"><b> Mr. Singh: </b> 
 The CLS&#039;s role will not be duplicated. The fact is that there is no nationwide system that provides assistance to victims of discrimination. We need such a system because the help available is very patchy; indeed, in many areas it is often non-existent. In Bradford, for example, employment advice, assistance and representation are now non-existent. My Bill will not lead to duplication; rather, it will set up a new system that will enable people to get proper access to justice, wherever they happen to live.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51014-02_para2">
<a name="stpa_19">As I said, we can only conjecture as to why more than half of sex discrimination cases were withdrawn in 2004&#150;05. My hon. Friend the Member for Ogmore (Huw Irranca-Davies) asked for some figures, which I can provide. The Equal Opportunities Commission estimates that 1&nbsp;million women will experience discrimination in the next five years. The snapshots that I have outlined today conceal the vast amount of discrimination and misery that is experienced at what should be a happy time for such women. Moreover, there is also a loss to the economy. Replacing these 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>14 Oct 2005 : Column 531</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>women costs industry &#163;126&nbsp;million, so such practices are not only in many cases illegal and immoral, but uneconomic.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51014-02_para3">
<a name="stpa_20">It may surprise the House to learn that such evidence is not entirely partisan; it comes from many unexpected and independent sources, such as the Industrial Society and the Policy Studies Institute. Even the CBI has acknowledged that a problem exists. On 1&nbsp;October, amendments to sex discrimination legislation came into force, and employment experts believe that that could lead to an increase in the number of tribunal cases, as more women will be aware of their rights. But as I said at the beginning of my speech, rights are only part of the picture; they are meaningless without the means to assert them.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51014-02_para4">
<a name="stpa_21">Of course, it is not only women who suffer employment discrimination. Disabled people are nearly nine times more likely than non-disabled people to be out of work and claiming benefits. Unemployment rates for ethnic minorities are 10&nbsp;to 15&nbsp;per cent. higher than for the white population; in some regions, they are more than 20&nbsp;per cent. higher. Racial discrimination still features extensively.

 I am particularly grateful to my hon. Friend for his lucid presentation of his Bill. He mentions discrimination against disabled people&#151;a problem that has long since been recognised.

</p>








<p><a name="st_29"><a name="51014-02_spnew19"><b> Mr. Singh: </b> 
 No, I do not know its views, but to be frank, in general, equal opportunities bodies are not in favour of the Bill. Funding for such a system would come from their existing budgets, and they are not going to support a Bill that would reduce their budgets.

<p><a name="st_30"><a name="51014-03_spnew0"><b> Mr. Harper: </b> 
 That was a very helpful question and reply but I remain a little confused. As I hope later to discuss, quite a lot of taxpayer-funded organisations can already provide advice for those who need to go to employment tribunals. What on earth is the point in setting up this new organisation, cannibalising funding for the existing organisations and shifting it to another layer of bureaucracy, just so that the new organisation can provide advice that is already being provided? That seems a bizarre idea.

 As I said earlier, the advice available for people who have suffered employment discrimination is very patchy. The equal opportunities bodies are not providing a national system of access to justice, and it is not a question of cannibalising funding for them. The point that this House must address, and which I shall deal with later, is that such bodies have not been spending enough of their budgets on helping those at the chalk-face who are suffering from employment

<br>&nbsp;<br>discrimination. We need to ensure that complainants have the access to justice that they currently lack, despite the existence of equal opportunities bodies.

 If the existing bodies, which receive a lot of money from the taxpayer, are performing as poorly as the hon. Gentleman suggests, what are they doing with their time?

<p><a name="st_34"><a name="51014-03_spnew4"><b> Mr. Singh: </b> 
 I am sure that those bodies do a lot of important work in raising awareness of such issues, and so on, but I am not here to speak about what they do or do not do, except in the context of providing representation for discrimination complainants. Those bodies could doubtless answer the hon. Gentleman&#039;s questions perfectly adequately, were he to approach them.
</p>








<p><a name="st_35"><a name="51014-03_spnew5"><b> Kerry McCarthy  (Bristol, East) (Lab):</b> 
 The Bill&#039;s supporters cite the fact that a very small percentage of the current commissions&#039; budgets&#151;about 2&nbsp;per cent. for the Commission for Racial Equality, just over 3&nbsp;per cent. for the Equal Opportunities Commission, and 5.5&nbsp;per cent. for the Disability Rights Commission&#151;goes towards directly funding discrimination cases. But is it not true that the commissions also give a lot of money directly to bodies such as racial equality councils and local community groups, so that they can fund and support those involved in discrimination cases? Do they not also spend a significant part of their budgets on carrying out formal investigations, such as the recent inquiry into discrimination in the Prison Service? As in the case of the investigation into the death of Zahid Mubarek, we can sometimes be talking about loss of life rather than discrimination, so if 25&nbsp;per cent. of the budget were taken away, would it not amount to a real hit on that sort of work?

 In response to my hon. Friend, the funding of racial equality councils can be quite precarious: it is supplied on an annual basis and can be taken away at any time. If the leadership complexion of the Commission for Racial Equality changes, so can its priorities. I do not believe that taking some funding away to establish the proposed board would affect the organisation&#039;s major investigations. I would argue that there is room within the budgets to accommodate my proposals as well other work in the field.

<p><a name="st_37"><a name="51014-03_spnew7"><b> Mr. Heald: </b> 
 Clause 3(3) effectively says that the Lord Chancellor must pay however much money is demanded by the board that the hon. Gentleman wants to establish. The money thus comes from the budgets of other organisations that we have mentioned, yet the hon. Gentleman claims to be worried about the precariousness of their finances. Could not the provision have the effect of destroying such organisations?

<p>
<a name="51014-03_para0">
<a name="stpa_22">I should like to provide a couple of examples to illustrate my argument. The first case relates to my own constituency and underlines two important points. First, it not only demonstrates a vivid picture of

<br>&nbsp;<br>discrimination, but was directed against young Muslim women, one of whom was in her first job. Younger workers are particularly vulnerable. Secondly, it illustrates how the specialist help provided by the citizens advice bureau&#151;the body contacted in the first instance&#151;gave the workers the necessary confidence to take the case forward.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51014-03_para1">
<a name="stpa_23">Four Asian young women were awarded nearly &#163;50,000&nbsp;in July 1998&nbsp;in what was described as one of the most serious cases of racial discrimination against young women ever to come before an industrial tribunal in Britain. The tribunal heard an appalling catalogue of racial discrimination. The girls&#039; wages were reduced, while white workers were moved to other jobs. Their terms and conditions were different from those of the white employees and they were systematically bullied and threatened by their white supervisor to the extent that one of them was called a &quot;black bitch&quot;. One had been employed as a supervisor and had assumed the duties of the head supervisor, when the latter was absent, yet when the position became vacant, a white woman from another area of the company was given the job.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51014-03_para2">
<a name="stpa_24">Asian workers in this company were instructed to undertake additional menial tasks, from which white workers doing the same job were excused. They were forbidden to speak to each other in their own language. It had been custom and practice to allow Muslim workers to carry holidays over, but that was abruptly changed, leaving the Asian women in a lottery in which only two of them could take holidays.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51014-03_para3">
<a name="stpa_25">As the situation escalated and two of the young women were sacked, they sought the advice of the citizens advice bureau and were referred to the northern complainants aid fund. Although the company had a staff handbook, it was not readily available to the work force. White staff had time to read it, but Asian staff had to lose piece-rate pay to do so. The managing director was unaware of the CRE code of practice and staff had no training or understanding of their own equal opportunities policy. The judgment entered on their cases stated:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_4">&quot;Rarely have we seen a case where there has been so much evasion and contradiction. It is clear the respondent set out to smear the applicants.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="51014-03_para4">
<a name="stpa_26">The second case relates to a national company. In April 2003, a south London employment tribunal found that the UK&#039;s largest rental company, Hertz, racially discriminated against Howard Morant, a black supervisor at its Victoria branch in London. For 15 months after he was employed, he was kept on a lower wage than white workers doing the same job, and less experienced workers were promoted while he and other black employees were passed over. During the course of the hearing, it emerged that, although the company claimed to be an equal opportunities employer, it had failed to train its managers in race equality. As part of the tribunal&#039;s decision, Hertz was required to provide training in race equality for its managers in Victoria and other London branches within three months. It applied particularly to managers responsible for recruitment, selection and staff appraisals.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51014-03_para5">
<a name="stpa_27">The provision of such training is one of the main recommendations in the CRE code of practice for the elimination of racial discrimination and the promotion

Between 1983&nbsp;and 2003, the CRE spent vast amounts of public funds encouraging employers such as Hertz to comply with the code and the law. Yet in the Hertz example, a single case brought by an employee&#151;I emphasise, a single case&#151;achieved greater compliance than the CRE managed in 20&nbsp;years.

 The point of the Bill is not to have deserts and oases, but to establish a constant pattern of support across the country, which does not exist at the moment. If we leave it to existing bodies, I do not believe that we will see much further action taken: it has not happened so far. If the Scottish Parliament has addressed the issue by extending legal aid, is it not incumbent on our Parliament to extend similar rights of access to justice to complainants of discrimination in this country?

 I have been listening carefully to the case that the hon. Gentleman is putting to the House.

Costs will be involved in setting up the board and whoever the board appoints. Even worse, in the wider context of paragraph (v), subsection (f), clause 13, the costs of those attending the tribunal would also be met, irrespective of whether they had a proper case. The case might be vexatious or the complainants might be liars but their costs would still be paid. Can the hon. Gentleman give the House some idea of what he expects his Bill to cost the Exchequer?

 No. I cannot give the hon. Gentleman that information, but codes of practice would be drawn up by the board so that the type of case he cites would not go through.

<a name="stpa_28">Age discrimination is on the increase. By 2006, there will be more people aged between 55&nbsp;and 64&nbsp;than 16&nbsp;to 24, and 45&nbsp;to 59-year-olds will form the largest group in the labour force.

They are directly attributable to the Lord Chancellor because a private Member&#039;s Bill cannot include increased costs to the Exchequer; ipso facto, all the costs that the hon.

<a name="stpa_31">I want to turn to some of the specific principles that underpin the Bill. Recent legislation and policy guidance have demonstrated a trend toward discouraging litigation in favour of dispute resolution. We have seen that in the revised employment tribunals regulations and the Employment Act 2002. I am in favour of that, provided that it genuinely works to resolve discrimination rather than simply pushing complainants into withdrawing genuine claims. It must not be an excuse to conceal or bury discrimination. My Bill will ensure that that does not happen.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51014-04_para4">
<a name="stpa_32">The Bill&#039;s provisions will provide the best possible support for complainants; they are not about lining the pockets of the legal profession. The Bill explicitly does not provide for lawyers and barristers as the first recourse, but for specialist help that is properly accredited and monitored. Many claims are settled without a tribunal&#151;as many as 46&nbsp;per cent. for unfair dismissal, 49&nbsp;per cent. for disability discrimination and almost 40&nbsp;per cent. of equal pay claims.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51014-04_para5">
<a name="stpa_33">An employment lawyer, quoted in <i>The</i> <i>Guardian</i> in July 2004, estimated that 85&nbsp;per cent. of employment claims are settled out of court&#151;a strong indication that the majority of complainants would prefer a conciliated settlement. Few actually want their day in court; they want to exercise their human right to access to justice and to redress discrimination and unfair employment practices. There will of course be a few cases where lawyers are necessary, but the process will ensure that it is only when they are really justified.

<a name="51014-04_para6">
<a name="stpa_34">Since the 1990s, we have seen an emphasis on fostering development in the voluntary and not-for-profit sector. While this confers a valuable and desirable degree of independence, it is vital to ensure that the service delivered is to a high standard. The Bill aims to do just that.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51014-04_para7">
<a name="stpa_35">We are all well aware of the sterling work carried out by many voluntary bodies, such as Citizens Advice and law centres, which undertake a range of advice services and are frequently constrained by lack of adequate funding. A quote from Citizens Advice illustrates this. Citizens advice bureaux place great emphasis on mediation, negotiation and settlements, use of tribunals, ombudsman schemes and other alternative dispute resolution procedures where these are effective. But, as I mentioned, they are constrained, not only by the total amount of funding they have overall, but restrictions on how it can be used, and

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_5">&quot;there are no incentives or rewards for publicly funded practitioners to pursue these avenues for clients.

<a name="stpa_37">I also draw attention to an example from my constituency. The northern complainants aid fund was founded in 1991 by a group of former complainants in Bradford. Between 1992 and 2003, the NCAF represented complainants in 110 successful discrimination cases at employment tribunals and negotiated settlements in hundreds more cases. It also provided training for union staff and others working on

<a name="stpa_40">Some hon. Members may say that this work should be covered by the existing equality bodies. That is clearly not happening. Between 2002&nbsp;and 2005&nbsp;there was a systematic reduction in the already small amount of money available for representation.

<br>&nbsp;<br>3.1&nbsp;per cent. and the Disability Rights Commission 5.5&nbsp;per cent. That does not amount to significant support. The Equal Opportunities Commission, for example, tends to take up cases of &quot;strategic importance&quot;, which to some extent applies to the CRE and the DRC. That is, it will support a claimant in bringing a case that will assist in setting a precedent for other cases.

<a name="stpa_41">Hon. Members may also argue, as they have, that such support is a job for trade unions. I do not dispute that. My concern, however, is that union membership is not as high as many of us would like, and some groups of workers are especially vulnerable. Department of Trade and Industry figures for 2004&nbsp;show that fewer than a third&#151;28.8&nbsp;per cent.&#151;of workers are union members, and in the private sector fewer than a fifth&#151;17.2&nbsp;per cent.

 Does my hon. Friend accept that there must be a balance and we have to be careful that while giving the appropriate rights we do not legislate unions out of existence? In countries such as France, where perhaps the terms of such legislation would go much further, trade union membership is very low indeed, apart from in a few sections of the public sector.

<p><a name="st_67"><a name="51014-05_spnew7"><b> Mr. Singh: </b> 
 The reality is how I portrayed it, and I am trying to achieve a balance between those people who do get support because they are in unions&#151;I would encourage more people to join a trade union&#151;and the vast majority of people who are not in trade unions, who cannot access the support that they need in such cases. Young people are especially vulnerable. They are unlikely to be unionised and may face discrimination at the point of finding a job. In July 2005, Radio Five Live carried out a survey that exposed discrimination between job applicants. It sent dummy CVs to 60&nbsp;companies. It found that 23&nbsp;per cent. of those with &quot;white&quot; sounding names were offered interviews, while only 9&nbsp;per cent. of applicants with Muslim names and 13&nbsp;per cent. of those with African names were offered interviews. Nine years before, a young Bradford jobseeker, Tahir Hussain, had tested that himself with the same result, which resulted in 11&nbsp;successful tribunal cases. In the 1980s, the charity Scope conducted a survey on similar principles in relation to disability&#151;and yes, the results were the same.

</p>

<p>
<a name="51014-05_para3">
<a name="stpa_42">Some might suggest that no win, no fee arrangements are available to complainants. Such arrangements have received a bad press of late. There is no doubt that such agreements do not favour early conciliated resolution. Indeed, they are specifically geared to litigation. As well as often leading claimants into debt, they lead to gridlock in the courts. The complex financial and legal processes involved are often misunderstood by complainants. There is widespread mis-selling of legal insurance products. Complainants are subjected to high-pressure sales tactics by unqualified salesmen. Inappropriate marketing and sales practices are used&#151;for example, with salesmen approaching accident victims in hospital.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51014-05_para4">
<a name="stpa_43">Few complainants seem to understand the risks and liabilities that they are exposing themselves to when they are misled into thinking the system will be genuinely conducted on a no win, no fee arrangement. They often find that there are hidden and unpredictable costs. Loan-financed insurance premiums, in addition to other legal costs, can often wipe out claimants&#039; compensation. In some cases, complainants even owe money at the end of the process. So we can see that discrimination in employment is widespread and begins at the point of application. The existing equality bodies allocate a pitifully small portion of their budgets to casework support, and the number of cases is accordingly small.

However, there is no public funding available for legal representation at tribunals and users often find themselves dealing with complex legal issues and procedures unassisted. Across all the advice areas that come within the scope of the Community Legal Service, CABs frequently report cases, which demonstrate a clear need for public funding to be made available for representation at tribunals, and additional benefits to helping clients resolve issues through tribunal processes rather than allowing legal problems to escalate further. Given the principles imposed by the Human Rights Act, it is increasingly difficult to justify the exclusion of tribunal representation from the scope of the funding code.&quot;</p>

<a name="stpa_48">Research shows that representation can make a real difference to the outcomes of tribunals.

At election time or during the meetings that we attend, we can wear our hearts on our sleeves and say how much we oppose discrimination and how much we support equal opportunities and a multicultural society, but discrimination is still prevalent.

 I congratulate the hon. Member for Bradford, West (Mr. Singh) on his success in the ballot and on presenting a Bill that highlights an important issue: public funding for employment discrimination cases. However, although he has raised a important issue, I do not believe that his Bill is the correct way to rectify the present situation. The Bill would create yet another quango: the tribunal representation and assistance board. We have far too many quangos already, and we should be getting rid of some of them, not creating yet another one. He raised the important issue of legal aid not being available for representation in employment tribunal cases in England and Wales, although it is available under certain circumstances in Scotland, but there is no need to create yet another quango to address the matter.

<a name="stpa_56">The functions that the Bill proposes to give to the new board could just as well be carried out by existing quangos&#151;by the Legal Services Commission or the Scottish Legal Aid Board. In most cases, legal aid is not appropriate for employment tribunals. There is, however, one exception, which I will come to later. Employment tribunal hearings were not intended to be as formal as a court of law. They were designed so that the parties could represent themselves or be represented by lay representatives. Indeed, two of the three members of the tribunal are usually lay members.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51014-06_para9">
<a name="stpa_57">Appeals on a point of law can be made to employment appeal tribunals where parties are entitled to apply for legal aid, and parties may also be entitled to legal aid to help prepare them for employment tribunals. As employment tribunals are meant to be accessible to people who are representing themselves, I support the general principle that public funding should not be available for legal aid in most cases.

<p>
<a name="51014-06_para10">
<a name="stpa_58">There is, however, one exception. That is on those rare occasions when the tribunal hearing will involve complex legal issues so that detailed and effective presentation are required for a case to have any hope of success.

 The arguments for the establishment of the tribunal representation and assistance board, as proposed in the Bill, appear in many cases and on an initial consideration to have some merit in ensuring that applicants in discrimination cases brought before the employment tribunals and appeal tribunals have access to legal advice and representation. Some of the arguments that we have heard and that we will hear in the debate are valuable.

<a name="51014-07_para2">
<a name="stpa_62">The Bill would provide for legal advice and representation whereas the Legal Services Commission generally only provides for advice and not representation. Indeed, the LSC provides its assistance only after testing for eligibility, and representation can be made only in exceptional circumstances. Such circumstances applied to only six cases between 2000&nbsp;and today. The fact that legal aid is, as we have heard, available only for employment tribunal appeals and not at the tribunal appears to draw one towards the arguments for the Bill. Experienced representatives could arguably make it easier to present the applicant&#039;s case and the Bill&#039;s point about the ability to charge for representation is, if taken at face value, a useful proposition. It argues that it could create a revenue stream.
</p>

<a name="51014-07_para3">
<a name="stpa_63">Labour Members also support the argument that this Government have introduced more rights since 1997, and we are very proud of that. We applaud the House for taking that opportunity. As a consequence of that, there must be a necessary growth in the number of tribunals.

<p>
<a name="51014-07_para4">
<a name="stpa_64">I have outlined the face-value merits of the Bill, but we must also consider the arguments against it in evaluating the proposals. As we have heard, many cases do not require legal representation and, in those instances, the advice offered will duplicate the services already provided by the Legal Services Commission. It is that body&#039;s responsibility to ensure that not just legal advice but &quot;quality assured legal advice&quot; is delivered. We must also be aware of the fact that the equality commissions can fund legal representation, but I reiterate that, in most cases, legal help and advice is sufficient. Legal representation is not a necessary service. We must also consider the fact that such duplication would create an extra layer of bureaucracy and lead to additional expenditure.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51014-07_para5">
<a name="stpa_65">It is argued that the proposed tribunal representation and assistance board could be a revenue earner, but what evidence do we have that clients who were liable for costs incurred would use the service instead of alternative legal specialists?

 As my hon. Friends have explained, many tribunal cases are shown to be quite frivolous, and are turned down. A minority of cases are accepted, so I do not accept the idea that no frivolous claims go to tribunals.

 I am sorry, but that is the case. Is the hon. Gentleman questioning the ability of tribunal chairmen and panels? In my experience, frivolous and vexatious cases are struck out. Moreover, under the Employment Act 2002&nbsp;there is an onus on both employers and applicants to ensure that they have gone down all the avenues to try to resolve disputes before they get to a tribunal, and that has reduced the number of tribunals over the past two years.

 All that this Bill would do is to lead to even more frivolous claims. People would be able to take a claim to a tribunal knowing that it would cost them nothing, and that they had nothing to lose. It does not matter what they say, because someone else&#151;taxpayers, such as me and the people in my constituency&#151;picks up the tab for the most ridiculous, frivolous and stupid complaints. Why should decent, honest, law-abiding, tax-paying people in this country pick up the tab for people who make frivolous claims?

 My hon. Friends have made the point perfectly well about the number of cases that end up with a successful prosecution of the company concerned. Very few do, so the facts are perfectly clear: most of these cases are not grounded in any basis of fact, and there is no case to answer. The Bill will simply lead to even more of these frivolous cases going to tribunals, because people will know that they will not have to pay any money themselves, and the good old taxpayer will have to dig his hand into his pocket one more time to pay for another politically correct pet project from new Labour.

 The Bill is about whether we give people free legal representation at employment tribunals no matter how good or bad their case, and whether that would be a good thing or a bad thing.

 The right hon. Member for Bromley and Chislehurst (Mr. Forth) has in five seconds made a far more comprehensive critique of the Bill than we have heard in half an hour from the hon. Gentleman. May I bring him back to the core point? I realise that he once achieved great things as customer services manager for Asda. I am not sure how he served the customers, but his comments have caused me to have doubts. Will he, once and for all, without equivocation, state for the House whether his thesis is that all complainants to tribunals are frivolous and vexatious and that the burden on small business is such that the entire system, which has served us so well under Governments of both complexions, should be swept away?

Gentleman asked earlier was exactly the same as the one he has just asked, and my answer is that I have nothing against people who make a genuine claim of discrimination; my concern about the Bill is that it will lead to more people making frivolous claims because they will be able do so at no cost to themselves. They will know that the taxpayer will pick up the tab, however much it is, because the Bill, as my right hon.

<a name="stpa_90">I spent my legal career in community law centres, where we acted for the most disadvantaged members of our community. Where we could, we would help them under the legal aid scheme, but we would also represent people at tribunals.

I would make it clear to them if I thought that their claim had no chance of success, because I certainly did not want to get in front of a tribunal and find myself in trouble with the chair, possibly with cost orders made against me and the law centre.

Her employer wrote to her at the hospital, wishing her all the best in getting better but saying that she was dismissed forthwith. Her husband came to see me to say that that did not seem quite fair. The family did not have English as their first language, but they had a feeling that things were not quite as they should be.

 I am sure that the House is grateful to the hon.

</p>








<p><a name="st_178"><a name="51014-11_spnew11"><b> Ms Johnson: </b> 
 There are cases where it is vital that people have access to legal representation, or representation through a trade union.

<p><a name="st_180"><a name="51014-12_spnew0"><b> Ms Johnson: </b> 
 That is right. My hon. Friend has already talked about the measures and proceedings that are in place. A case can be brought before the tribunal in a preliminary hearing. The tribunal chair has the opportunity to ask for a deposit from a claimant. There are measures in place to deal with frivolous and vexatious cases. CABs, law centres and trade union representatives will be clear with people taking claims to the tribunal that it is stressful and that they can get themselves into hot water if they reach the tribunal with a frivolous claim. There are lots of steps along the way to stop that happening.
</p>








<p><a name="st_181"><a name="51014-12_spnew1"><b> Mr. Harper: </b> 
 The hon. Lady powerfully explains her approach to these matters in her previous profession, but the Employment Tribunals Service&#039;s annual report and accounts give the success rate for claims that reach the tribunal: in sex, race or disability discrimination cases, it is 28, 15&nbsp;and 29&nbsp;per cent. respectively. That 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>14 Oct 2005 : Column 560</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>implies that, when giving advice, not all her fellow practitioners are as robust in suggesting to claimants that they have a weak case. She is right. Those giving professional advice should advise clients when their claim is weak, but the evidence seems to be that many are not giving robust advice and too many weak claims are proceeding to tribunal; otherwise, the success rates would be higher.
</p>








<p><a name="st_182"><a name="51014-12_spnew2"><b> Ms Johnson: </b> 
 Any person who has represented someone in a tribunal will know that a case may not always go as well as one thought it would in the tribunal. Witnesses may not always come up to proof, although they have perhaps in a witness statement beforehand. All sorts of issues happen, but my experience and that of employment lawyers whom I have dealt with has been that there is every attempt to try to settle cases without the stress and anxiety of the client having to go through a tribunal case and sit through what can be often quite vigorous cross-examination by an employer&#039;s representative. Most employers will have a barrister or solicitor present to represent them at the tribunal. That is where I support the principle of legal representation in tribunals: we have to be aware that at the moment there are cases that go to tribunal where people do not have the opportunity of legal representation.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51014-12_para0">
<a name="stpa_93">We have talked a lot about trade unions and the important role they play. I am passionate about ensuring that as many people as possible understand why it is important to be a member of a trade union, to give them that protection if they get into difficulty in their employment.

<p><a name="st_183"><a name="51014-12_spnew3"><b> Mr. Kevan Jones: </b> 
 From my experience in tribunals, many companies employ barristers for cases that do not need it. Does my hon. Friend agree that there is a danger in the argument that she has just advanced, in that one may have to ratchet a case up when, for example, a company brings a lawyer and then a barrister in? That would then have to be paid for by the taxpayer. Nine times out of 10&nbsp;in the cases I have experienced, no barrister or solicitor is needed.

<p><a name="st_184"><a name="51014-12_spnew4"><b> Ms Johnson: </b> 
 Some of the most effective representatives whom I have come across in employment tribunals are not lawyers but people who have a lot of experience working in citizens advice bureaux or law centres. Often they will have a more common-sense approach, too.

<a name="51014-12_para1">
<a name="stpa_94">Again, I agree with the principle of representation in employment tribunals for some cases. I do not believe that we need the extent and range of representation that perhaps this Bill is putting forward. Agreeing in principle but looking at the practicalities of my own experience, I would say a better way forward was to charge the Legal Services Commission with looking again at how best legal advice and representation can be provided where it is needed in tribunals. There is a wider issue about community law centres and the valuable role they can play in educating local communities about the rights they have, taking forward claims of discrimination and other employment matters when necessary, and using all the alternative dispute resolution mechanisms. I found ACAS vital in the claims I took forward.

<p><a name="st_186"><a name="51014-12_spnew6"><b> Ms Johnson: </b> 
 That is right. I am pleased that the Government have introduced a range of measures. We have the commitment to the community legal service. We have funding of some community law centres.

<a name="51014-12_para2">
<a name="stpa_95">I want to say something about the problems applicants have in employment tribunals if they have to represent themselves. When I started practising employment law, the procedures in the employment tribunal&#151;it was then called the industrial tribunal&#151;were far simpler. It was almost as if one could turn up on the day and present one&#039;s case. Now a range of procedures have to be adopted. We have to disclose evidence before a tribunal hearing, provide witness statements and further and better particulars when requested by the other side. Applicants find those things difficult to do. It is getting technical and legalistic. That is why it is vital to have input from a law centre or a trade union rep. They can deal with those things.
</p>








<p><a name="st_187"><a name="51014-12_spnew7"><b> Mark Tami: </b> 
 I know from being involved in tribunals that, when the person turns up and sees that there is a barrister on the other side, that can be frightening. They link it to a court situation and feel vulnerable.
</p>








<p><a name="st_188"><a name="51014-12_spnew8"><b> Ms Johnson: </b> 
 My hon. Friend is correct. Tribunal chairs are often very good about assisting applicants to put their case, but I have encountered chairs who are less helpful and supportive of applicants who are acting on their own, and if the other side has a barrister it can cause real problems in terms of justice being seen to be done.

 I agree with the hon. Lady&#039;s basic argument that building on what we have is preferable to a new quango.

Does she accept that, with only about 5&nbsp;per cent. of discrimination cases succeeding in the tribunal, she is talking about a massive burden on British business? Anything that encourages a surge in claims will make that huge burden even worse.

 I have tried to stress the range of alternatives that are now available to deal with employment problems and claims; we are not telling people simply to go to the tribunal. The alternatives include ACAS, which is an extremely important body: it plays a strong role in bringing claimants and employers together and securing some good settlements, without businesses having to spend time going to the tribunal.

 Does my hon.

We had reached the door of the tribunal when I heard through the wall a barrister shouting to both employers that one of them had to take responsibility, and that if the claim reached the tribunal both would get massive bad publicity. We should focus on the useful role that lawyers can play, but stress to employers&#151;good ones&#151;that it is much better for them to deal with claims sensibly and reasonably, lest they get themselves into difficulty in a tribunal.

Often they lead people up the garden path or get them to sign up to pay for an insurance policy to fund the case. People who have come to see me have been asked to pay &#163;150&nbsp;up front. They think the case is proceeding, but they are asked for another &#163;250, and before they know it, a large sum of money has been expended, often to no good end.

It is not sensible to let bodies determine the level of funding that they want. I have problems with that clause.

I should be interested to hear about the example in Scotland. We must have regard to article 6(1) of the European convention on human rights and the opportunity for people to have a fair hearing, but the Bill is not the best way forward for employment law or employment relations in this country.

<p><a name="st_203"><a name="51014-13_spnew8"><b> Mr. Mark Harper  (Forest of Dean) (Con):</b> 
 I want to make a few introductory points before discussing the Bill itself. The Bill&#039;s purpose is to make provision about representing and assisting complainants, and it highlights&#151;as some of today&#039;s contributions have also done&#151;the increasing complexity of employment tribunals. One root cause of the need felt by the hon. Member for Bradford, West (Mr. Singh) to introduce this Bill is the fact that employment tribunals can be very complex. Indeed, some 32&nbsp;different Acts of Parliament can give rise to claims that go before employment tribunals, which is perhaps why a number of parties on both sides feel the need to be represented.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51014-13_para3">
<a name="stpa_102">As several Members have noted, there are already many places where those wishing to bring claims to employment tribunals can seek advice. The Employment Tribunals Service website lists a number of sources of free advice, several of which have been mentioned. They include ACAS&#151;I shall come on to trade unions shortly&#151;citizens advice bureaux and community law centres. As the hon. Member for Kingston upon Hull, North (Ms Johnson) said, solicitors and other professional advisers sometimes give their services free on pro bono work. In most constituencies, a range of organisations already exists from which people can seek advice, so setting up a new quango and a new form of provision seems unnecessary.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51014-13_para4">
<a name="stpa_103">The hon. Lady also said she would like to see an increase in representation. However, the flaw in the Bill as drafted&#151;if it is to achieve the objectives that the hon. Member for Bradford, West seeks&#151;is that it provides no new funding; rather, it simply cannibalises funding for existing bodies. The money for the new board would come straight out of the budgets of the Equal 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>14 Oct 2005 : Column 565</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>Opportunities Commission, the Disability Rights Commission and the Commission for Racial Equality. As a result, they would have to cut their funding for the many valuable groups working on the ground that provide such services in our communities. Taking the money away and giving it to another organisation would damage many of these existing organisations, of which Members have had experience.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51014-13_para5">
<a name="stpa_104">In trying to justify the need for this Bill, the hon. Member for Bradford, West failed to make a clear case for the argument that valid discrimination claims are not finding their way to employment tribunals. He mentioned some individual cases, but in passing legislation that would affect all the various commissions, and businesses and individuals throughout our country, we need to be sure that there is a clear need for it. He failed to establish that such a need exists. He said that he has consulted the Equal Opportunities Commission and the Disability Rights Commission, and that they oppose the Bill. I shall deal with the impact of such opposition a little later, when I consider some of the clauses.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51014-13_para6">
<a name="stpa_105">The role of the trade unions has also been discussed. One Labour Member pointed out that in the private sector, just one fifth of employees are in a trade union. Trade unions should focus on providing excellent representation in the workplace. If they spent more time on that aspect of their role, and less on the party political aspect, they might find it easier to recruit members in the private sector workplace.
</p>








<p><a name="st_204"><a name="51014-13_spnew9"><b> Huw Irranca-Davies: </b> 
 I genuinely welcome the hon. Gentleman&#039;s comments, and if for no reason other than the issue that we are discussing today, will he join me in proactively encouraging every employer not only to recognise unions in the workplace, but to support their active participation in it? Does he further accept that some employers are a little recalcitrant in their approach to unions?
</p>








<p><a name="st_205"><a name="51014-13_spnew10"><b> Mr. Harper: </b> 
 No, and I disagree with that approach. It is the role of the unions to explain cogently to potential members the services that they provide. It is their job, not the employers&#039;, to recruit members. If unions are so weak that they need employers to do their recruiting for them, it is perhaps no surprise that they are in such a state.
</p>








<p><a name="st_206"><a name="51014-13_spnew11"><b> Mark Tami: </b> 
 I agree, but the employee must be able to be approached by the union without being threatened with the sack, demotion or exclusion, as people sometimes are as a result of talking to someone in the union or becoming active in it. My hon. Friends and I know many cases where unions have tried to recruit in the workplace, but employers have adopted all sorts of tactics to obstruct them. The same applies to recognition, even at the stage where cases go to the Central Arbitration Committee. For example, employers may move employees out of certain groups of workers in order to make the union membership lower. There are all sorts of tricks and tactics going on out there. Yes, let us have a level playing field, but the employer must accept it as well.

<p><a name="st_207"><a name="51014-14_spnew0"><b> Mr. Harper: </b> 
 That raises an interesting point, but if the hon. Gentleman will forgive me, I shall focus my remarks on the Bill that we are debating. We could have a much wider discussion on the role of trade unions in employment, but we are talking now about the advice and representation that unions can provide in respect of employment tribunals. One important point that emerges from our discussion is that if unions improved their provision of such advice, they might be able to recruit more members. However, the unions have been singularly unsuccessful at doing that, so perhaps the hon. Gentleman should talk to some of his colleagues in the trade union movement.
</p>








<p><a name="st_208"><a name="51014-14_spnew1"><b> Huw Irranca-Davies: </b> 
 I am half tempted to warm to the hon. Gentleman for his words on the unions. He seems to recognise the quality and depth of knowledge that a union can offer, but I wonder whether he would go one step further. If the Bill were to fall today, who else, in the absence of a union in the workplace, could an individual at risk of discrimination turn to for the requisite expert advice? That is my question to the hon. Gentleman. He is half way there already.
</p>








<p><a name="st_209"><a name="51014-14_spnew2"><b> Mr. Harper: </b> 
 If the hon. Gentleman continues to pay me such warm tributes, I may have to fear for my reputation on the Conservative Benches.
</p>








<p><a name="st_210"><a name="51014-14_spnew3"><b> Mr. Vara: </b> 
 On the question of the role of trade unions, I would have thought that, in the present circumstances where much advice and information is available to the individual that was previously provided by the unions, it is better to advise employees of other options rather than simply encourage them to join a trade union. That is only one option, but I am mindful that I may be straying from the main subject of today&#039;s debate.
</p>








<p><a name="st_211"><a name="51014-14_spnew4"><b> Mr. Harper: </b> 
 To answer the question put by the hon. Member for Ogmore (Huw Irranca-Davies) about the avenues open to those who do not have the services of a trade union, I have already provided, as have others, a comprehensive list of the help available. I mentioned ACAS, citizens advice bureaux, community law centres, solicitors and other professional advisers who give their services free under pro bono work. If the services of a union are unavailable, people can turn to a range of other organisations.
</p>








<p><a name="st_212"><a name="51014-14_spnew5"><b> Huw Irranca-Davies: </b> 
 I am sorry to labour the point, but in the absence of a union, does the hon. Gentleman believe&#151;contrary to the view expressed a few moments ago by the hon. Member for North-West Cambridgeshire (Mr. Vara)&#151;that it is incumbent on the employer to set out the grievance policies and procedures clearly to anyone who thinks that they are suffering from discrimination and to affirm that the company actively encourages employees to come forward with their grievances about discrimination in the workplace?
</p>








<p><a name="st_213"><a name="51014-14_spnew6"><b> Mr. Harper: </b> 
 Of course&#151;any good employer will have a comprehensive set of policies and grievance procedures. I used to work for a large company that had a comprehensive set of procedures and made every effort to deal with cases within the company. Frankly, that is 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>14 Oct 2005 : Column 567</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>usually the best policy for all concerned. Employment tribunals are usually set up only after a failure in that respect.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51014-14_para0">
<a name="stpa_106">Before referring specifically to the Bill, I want to say a few words about employers and the way in which employment tribunals have developed. If I understand it correctly, when tribunals were first introduced the laudable idea was that their hearings would be relatively straightforward and able to deal with most cases. It was thought that neither side would need to be legally represented, which would keep the costs down. However, because things have become much more complicated, that is often not the case. Hon. Members have referred to employers using legal representatives. The last thing that small employers want to do is hire an expensive lawyer, who will send a bill every time the client talks to them, writes to them or coughs in their presence. Employers hire lawyers when they read about the more extreme examples that come before employment tribunals.
</p>








<p><a name="st_214"><a name="51014-14_spnew7"><b> Mark Tami: </b> 
 I accept what the hon. Gentleman says. There is a problem for smaller employers who often panic when faced with such situations and rather than try to resolve the problem with the employee, they bring in expensive lawyers, which they do not need to do. Employing a barrister or taking cases further is a massive cost to an employer, whether big or small, and it certainly does not help the employer-employee relationship.
</p>








<p><a name="st_215"><a name="51014-14_spnew8"><b> Mr. Harper: </b> 
 That is a good point, but employers would not take that course if they felt that there were other options. There is no level playing field for employment tribunals, in the sense that if employers have to use representation, they must pay for it, whether they win or lose. Even if they win the case they are still saddled with a large bill, while many of those who represent employees are not paid by the employee.
</p>








<p><a name="st_216"><a name="51014-14_spnew9"><b> Mr. Kevan Jones: </b> 
 The hon. Gentleman makes a good point, but a person does not need a lawyer to go before an industrial tribunal. Like my hon. Friend the Member for Alyn and Deeside (Mark Tami), I know of cases where employers have hired lawyers for no apparent reason.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51014-14_para1">
<a name="stpa_107">I draw the attention of the hon. Member for Forest of Dean (Mr. Harper) to the Employment Act 2002, which gave ACAS far more powers and provides for free advice so that fewer cases come before tribunals. The measure tries to ensure that small employers adopt basic grievance procedures. If they follow those procedures they should never need to go before a tribunal.
</p>








<p><a name="st_217"><a name="51014-14_spnew10"><b> Mr. Harper: </b> 
 That is a good point and one of the things it highlights is the divide between larger and smaller employers. Large companies are able to employ specialists, they have human resources departments with specialists in all types of law. Smaller companies often have no full-time member of staff who is familiar with all the legislation&#151;as I said earlier, I think there are 32&nbsp;Acts relating to such matters. It is extremely difficult for a small company, even one that is desperately trying to do the right thing and provide an excellent workplace, 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>14 Oct 2005 : Column 568</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>to be sure that it is complying with all those pieces of legislation. That is one of the reasons why, when they are hit with an employment claim, they panic, as the hon. Member for Alyn and Deeside (Mark Tami) said, and reach for a lawyer.
</p>








<p><a name="st_218"><a name="51014-14_spnew11"><b> Mr. Heald: </b> 
 It is not simply a question of the strict legality of the matter. For a company to be accused of an act of discrimination is a reputational issue. Does my hon. Friend agree that although well over half such cases fail, the employer has to take each one seriously?
</p>








<p><a name="st_219"><a name="51014-14_spnew12"><b> Mr. Harper: </b> 
 That is the case. That is one of the reasons why employers are concerned and feel that, because of the threat to their business&#151;for example, from damaging press reports&#151;they have to be legally represented.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51014-14_para2">
<a name="stpa_108">I have concluded my preamble and I now turn to the Bill. I note that 11&nbsp;Members supported the hon. Member for Bradford, West, but I have seen only one of them in the Chamber this morning&#151;the hon. Member for Bolton, South-East (Dr. Iddon), although he is not in his place at the moment. I hope that we shall hear from as many of the Bill&#039;s supporters as possible during our proceedings. I look forward to that.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51014-14_para3">
<a name="stpa_109">When I was considering the purposes of the Bill, I wondered why, as discrimination cases account for only a proportion of those that go before an employment tribunal, the hon. Member for Bradford, West felt that the extra quango should be set up only for discrimination cases. He seems to be saying that such cases are more important or more worthy of assistance than others that go before employment tribunals.
</p>








<p><a name="st_220"><a name="51014-14_spnew13"><b> Mr. Singh: </b> 
 My concern, which caused me to introduce the Bill, is the fact that the equal opportunities bodies responsible for tackling discrimination are not doing so at the individual&#039;s level. Last year, those organisations supported 250&nbsp;cases of strategic significance out of more than 20,000&nbsp;that were lodged. My concern is that those 250&nbsp;people got the support that they needed and deserved but thousands of people did not, and did not have access to justice in terms of their claims.
</p>








<p><a name="st_221"><a name="51014-14_spnew14"><b> Mr. Harper: </b> 
 The hon. Gentleman makes an interesting point, but earlier some of his hon. Friends pointed out that the commissions to which he has referred do a great deal of work through funding organisations on the ground. They might not themselves represent very many claimants, but, because of the funding that they provide to grass-roots organisations&#151;I see that many hon. Members agree&#151;they offer indirect support to those cases. With respect, I think that his argument may be flawed.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51014-14_para4">
<a name="stpa_110">Accreditation is one of the functions of the board set out in clause 2(2). It strikes me that requiring the tribunal board to go through a process of accrediting organisations to say that they are appropriate to provide representation, will not only be a cost for the new quango but will impose a whole set of costs, red tape and burdens on all the organisations that we have mentioned that provide assistance to people going before employment tribunals. No doubt such organisations will have to fill in long, complicated application forms, explaining how their organisation works and making

<br>&nbsp;<br>the case for it to be accredited. It will place a cost burden on all those very worthy organisations that provide support to those going to employment tribunals, and will reduce the amount of effort and work that they can put into representing people, which will have the opposite effect to the one that the hon.

But clause 3(1) only refers to annual funding. It states:


</p>
<ul>

<a name="stpa_125">The board would have to work closely with the equality commissions and it strikes me that if, when it is set up, its funding is arrived at by raiding the budgets of those commissions, the relationship between the board and the commissions will not start off as a particularly happy one.

<a name="stpa_126">Clause 7&nbsp;talks about the agency arrangements, and this is where the point made by the hon. Member for North Durham (Mr. Jones) becomes even more important. The clause says that arrangements may be made between the board and the equality commissions for the functions of the board to be carried out either by members of the equality commissions or by members of staff of those commissions. The Bill proposes setting up a board that would be funded by raiding the budgets of the equality commissions, and the board could then turn round and sub-contract the work to the very commissions whose budgets it had just raided to enable it to be created in the first place. That would mean a lot of red tape and complexity and the establishment of new quangos, but not any appreciable change in the delivery on the ground. However, there would be much more cost, which means a lot less funding available for the delivery of representation work.

 I know that when my hon. Friend carries out his analysis of schedule 1&nbsp;he will come to the board and its membership. Does it not appear that the Bill would set up conflict in many different ways? We would have an incestuous relationship between the board and these rather ghastly commissions. Their memberships would overlap, they would appoint one another and they then would argue with each other about funding. This is surely a prescription for resentment and a complete lack of focus and productivity.

<a name="51014-16_para0">
<a name="stpa_127">The hon. Member for Kingston upon Hull, North talked about making sure that we have value for money in these processes. Clause 9&nbsp;talks about giving the board a duty to

<a name="stpa_128">However, it does not define any of that, and it does not give the board any means by which to prioritise between carrying them out &quot;effectively&quot; and &quot;efficiently and economically&quot;. There is no way of weighing that up. Given the other provisions in the Bill, it strikes me that it may well be biased towards the &quot;effectively&quot; and not worry too much about the &quot;economically&quot;.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51014-16_para2">
<a name="stpa_129">The other point overlaying the debate relates to the position in employment law, and the hon. Member for Bradford, West focused his specific examples on complicated cases. Therefore, if we are to pass the Bill, it is incumbent on us to try to make it as simple and easy to understand as possible. The interpretive provisions in clause 11&nbsp;refer to when the Act would apply to proceedings and how someone would know whether their particular case was covered by it. There are detailed references to sections in many other Acts of Parliament, so how could any member of the public who might benefit from this Bill be clear about whether they fell under its provisions? They are very complicated. There would be a little sub-industry, with people arguing about whether their cases fell within the realms of discrimination so that they could get assistance from the board, or whether they were cases of a different nature, which would mean that they would get no such assistance. That would add complexity to an area that is already too complicated.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51014-16_para3">
<a name="stpa_130">Clause 12&nbsp;details the meaning of an eligible complainant: the sort of person who would benefit&#151;if benefit is the right word&#151;from the Bill. The clause is both complicated and specific. The hon. Member for Bradford, West focused on dealing with discrimination, but I have difficulty reconciling myself to a Bill that would only help people to take complaints about discrimination to employment tribunals, rather than about other matters. The hon. Gentleman is being discriminatory by picking a subset of the cases that go to employment tribunals. To introduce rules about eligibility would create a lot of complexity.

 The hon. Gentleman is again perceptive and anticipates that I had noted that point as something about schedule 1&nbsp;to which I wanted to draw attention.

</p>

<p>
<a name="51014-16_para4">
<a name="stpa_131">Clause 13&nbsp;sets out the wider meaning of assistance, but given that the hon.

<a name="stpa_132">and arranging for representation by a whole range of people. More interestingly, such assistance could include the payment of many of the costs that could be incurred by a person going to an employment tribunal, even down to travel expenses. That would tilt the playing field further towards a person going to an employment tribunal and against others, especially small businesses.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51014-16_para6">
<a name="stpa_133">Before the Bill makes any progress, the hon. Gentleman should give us a detailed estimate of its possible cost. I do not think that he is correct, but he says that thousands of people who suffer discrimination are not able to take their cases to employment tribunals because they do not receive appropriate advice. Labour Members have estimated that some cases that reach tribunal can cost thousands of pounds. Simple arithmetic shows that, if the Bill allowed those thousands of people to take their cases to tribunal, thousands of cases costing several thousand pounds each would lead to a cost of millions of pounds. The hon. Gentleman thus has a duty to the House to quantify the costs that might be incurred as best he can.

<a name="51014-17_para7">
<a name="stpa_151">Surely the principle of access to justice for everyone is absolutely right. A major bone of contention is the expense and scope of the proposals&#151;the belt-and-braces approach. It is said that, in effect, the Bill is a universal charter of prescription, and there is the worry that it is a universal charter for legal aid rather than a more proportionate response that would target those with the greatest need whose complex cases require full legal assistance against what are often highly professional teams of solicitors and barristers. That is one of the major criticisms.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51014-17_para8">
<a name="stpa_152">Linked to that is the argument that, in some ways, the Bill, well-intentioned though it is, is unnecessary on two counts.

<p><a name="st_255"><a name="51014-17_spnew14"><b> Huw Irranca-Davies: </b> 
 I entirely agree. On the latter point, availability is not the only issue, and we have, as a Government, made great strides with the various legal services and the voluntary sector to extend coverage. There is also the fundamental issue, which has frequently been mentioned in the debate, of how we draw these matters to people&#039;s attention when they cannot easily turn to somebody who can give them advice, either because they are in a workplace where they are actively discouraged from doing so or because they simply do not have access to a well trained, highly skilled and capable representative, union or otherwise. I shall return to that issue later.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51014-17_para10">
<a name="stpa_154">Members have mentioned the principle that prevention is better than cure. The aim is to keep cases out of the legal system, not simply to try to pull back money from solicitors wherever possible but because it is far better to deal with issues as they arise. We should aim for early intervention rather than people getting into the costs, stress and anxiety caused by making a legal case and taking it through hearings and tribunals. That is very much the thrust of the Government&#039;s approach.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51014-17_para11">
<a name="stpa_155">The dispute resolution process can take many forms, including mediation and arbitration. The use of grievance and disciplinary procedures is part of the process. I have learned through my experience in various voluntary sector organisations how crucial effective working relationships with all staff are. Employers should actively encourage people to express concerns or grievances, rather than slap them down or create a culture in which they feel unable to speak. In addition, there must be written procedures, even if, as my hon. Friend the Member for North Durham (Mr. Jones) said, they are the basic required grievance and disciplinary procedures.
</p>

<p><a name="st_256"><a name="51014-18_spnew0"><b> Mark Tami: </b> 
 That is a crucial point, because not only the employee but the employer must be aware of the procedures. The grievance procedure allows an employee to raise an issue and have it dealt with. The vast majority of cases do not result in a tribunal or in the employee leaving the company, but are resolved through the grievance procedure.
</p>

<a name="stpa_156">Perhaps I can give succour to those who have been concerned by some of the comments of Opposition Members. We should be trying to improve employers&#039; access to advice that enables them easily to put in place written procedures, as well as training and upskilling that does not involve sending people away on a two-day course at immense expense. We have done work on that already, but we need to keep applying pressure to make it easier and simpler for employers.

The Government are committed to ensuring that cases do not get to a tribunal, which clearly proves that they

<p><a name="st_259"><a name="51014-18_spnew3"><b> Huw Irranca-Davies: </b> 
 That should be the clear message from the House today. The aims of the 2002&nbsp;Act were specifically


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_32">&quot;to create a successful workplace through fairness and partnership at work and make it easier to settle disputes in the workplace&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="51014-18_para1">
<a name="stpa_157">That is the crux of the matter. My worry is that, if we impose an overarching, super-organisation at the top, it will go against that ethos. The principle of resolving disputes at the appropriate level, which the Government rightly support, may mean progressing into tribunal or into court. However, if we look at it as a pyramid shape, the vast majority of cases should be capable of resolution at the base&#151;in the workplace&#151;before they reach the system of tribunals and court hearings.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51014-18_para2">
<a name="stpa_158">At court, one of the things that the judge will look at is whether dispute resolution has been tried. That is right and proper. He will look at an application poorly if one of the parties has been offered the option of alternative dispute resolution and said that they were not interested. That is absolutely right. There has been a fundamental change in the ethos and the way in which we deal with the issue.
</p>








<p><a name="st_260"><a name="51014-18_spnew4"><b> Mr. Jones: </b> 
 If the applicant refuses to go through a company&#039;s formal disciplinary procedure, the application will automatically fall, even if it has good cause in terms of grievance. That flies in the face of the claim that frivolous and vexatious cases are queuing up to go before employment tribunals.
</p>








<p><a name="st_261"><a name="51014-18_spnew5"><b> Huw Irranca-Davies: </b> 
 That is correct. It is worth drawing attention to one of the most instructive cases in this regard, the Burchill and Bullard case in 2005. In his summing-up, Lord Justice Ward made four specific points. One was that the defendants&#039; belief that their case was so watertight that they did not need to resort to alternative dispute resolution was unreasonable. Secondly, in his opinion, their claim that the case was far too complex for alternative dispute resolution was &quot;plain nonsense&quot;. Thirdly, the costs of alternative dispute resolution would have been a drop in the ocean&#151;we have said it repeatedly&#151;compared with the legal costs that were incurred by bringing it to that level. Finally, Lord Justice Ward said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_33">&quot;The defendants cannot rely on their own obstinacy to assert that mediation had no reasonable prospect of success&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="51014-18_para3">
<a name="stpa_159">That is a fundamental challenge to what used to happen. Previously, there was almost a charter saying, &quot;Get straight to the lawyers; take it straight to the highest level.&quot; There are now appropriate levels at which disputes can be dealt with.
</p>








<p><a name="st_262"><a name="51014-18_spnew6"><b> Mark Tami: </b> 
 That is a key point. The grievance procedure in many ways acts as a cooling off period. It stops people almost straight away bypassing everything else and going straight to lawyers. I know from my casework that once lawyers are involved, reasonable cases that could be resolved by other means often get 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>14 Oct 2005 : Column 580</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>very nasty and expensive. All employers, regardless of whether they are big or small, have grievance procedures enabling talks between them and employees. In the vast majority of cases, that results in a sensible outcome.
</p>








<p><a name="st_263"><a name="51014-18_spnew7"><b> Huw Irranca-Davies: </b> 
 Indeed. It is vital to put on record the importance of looking at it as a process. It is not a one-size-fits-all approach. We are saying, in tune with what we have done in recent years, &quot;Let us solve these issues, where we can, at the earliest possible level of intervention, without going through the courts.&quot; Lord Justice Ward said in his summation:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_34">&quot;Mediation has established its importance as a track to a just result running parallel with that of the court system. Both have a proper part to play in the administration of justice. The court has given its stamp of approval to mediation and it is now the legal profession which must become fully aware of and acknowledge its value.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="51014-18_para4">
<a name="stpa_160">There is a strong message there for the whole legal profession. In a debate such as this, it is tempting to indulge in scurrilous anti-legal profession stories, but, tempted though I am, it would be unfair to do so. As we all know, many legal practitioners do good work, especially at the edge, where they deal with some of the most vulnerable members of society. However, there are also those who are willing to exploit this area of law. Perhaps the Minister will say how we can prevent people who suffer from the present gaps in provision from becoming vulnerable to those who would take money from them, even though there was no hope of the case being taken further.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51014-18_para5">
<a name="stpa_161">I applaud the aim of the Bill, which is to deal with what we might call equality of arms. Where two individuals or an organisation and an individual confront each other at any stage of a dispute they should have the same capability, expertise and skills on which to draw to present their case in the best possible way. The starting point is article 6&nbsp;of the European convention on human rights, which has been incorporated into law in this country through the Human Rights Act 1998, with which the Legal Services Commission and the Department for Constitutional Affairs have a duty to comply. Article 6&nbsp;establishes that people must have effective access to courts and tribunals for civil cases; that there should be equality of arms; and that there should be no disadvantage for either party, be it the person making the complaint or the small business man&#151;or the small voluntary sector organisation&#151;against whom the complaint has been made. The article allows that, sometimes, that can be achieved without legal aid and without resorting to solicitors and barristers, other than in exceptional circumstances.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51014-18_para6">
<a name="stpa_162">In England and Wales, we already have provision for exceptional funding. Many of the cases that have been highlighted in this debate by hon. Members on both sides of the House have been peculiarly complex and challenging; they do not fit into the standard tribunal approach. In such cases, it is right and proper that there be a method of funding available to ensure equality of arms. I argue that exceptional funding meets that requirement.
</p>








<p><a name="st_264"><a name="51014-18_spnew8"><b> Mark Tami: </b> 
 Much has been said about how different provision in Scotland is. In fact, the Scottish system provides aid where the case is evidently complex. 

<br>&nbsp;<br>

<br>&nbsp;<br>I regard that as very similar to the system of exceptional funding. Although there is a difference, it is not as great as it has been made out to be.

 I agree. The hon. Gentleman&#039;s point is well made, but what analysis has been made of cases that may have slipped the net? An important premise of today&#039;s debate is that many of the necessary mechanisms and agencies already exist and operate. I am more interested, therefore, in an analysis of the cases that were not successfully taken up at an early stage.
</p>








<p><a name="st_270"><a name="51014-19_spnew2"><b> Mark Tami: </b> 
 The Scottish system takes into consideration language issues and physical or mental illness or disability. I am not sure whether the exceptional funding covers that. If not, I hope the Minister will deal with it, as it is a valid point.

 My hon. Friend makes an excellent point. I hope the Minister will address it in her remarks.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51014-19_para0">
<a name="stpa_164">Let me explain why I believe we have many of the right mechanisms in place. There has long been a tradition of support in the workplace. Support has come from colleagues, unions, friends and, increasingly, voluntary sector organisations. The diversity of support that is available from the beginning of a potential case or from the early mediation stage ensures that widely differing cases and circumstances are recognised. In an intervention on my hon. Friend the Member for Alyn and Deeside (Mark Tami), I mentioned the case of homeless young single males in the Bridgend area. They are exactly the sort of people who would not reach out or be reached out to by a normative countrywide organisation. They need individuals who are trained and well funded to work closely with them and give them 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>14 Oct 2005 : Column 582</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>advice. The tradition of grassroots support should not be jeopardised. Community legal services have traditionally sought to maximise their impact in the union and the not-for-profit legal support sector.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51014-19_para1">
<a name="stpa_165">Legal help, formerly known as the green form scheme, has been subject to means-testing and the merits of the case. So there is a filtering system and a progression that tests the efficacy of a case and whether the individual requires financial support to pursue it. Exceptional funding under the Access to Justice Act 1999&nbsp;is available for complex cases, as we have discussed. The reason that so few cases qualify is that they are examined individually and recommended by the Legal Services Commission.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51014-19_para2">
<a name="stpa_166">The question is whether the principle of targeting resources on those whom we recognise as most requiring assistance&#151;the equality of arms issue&#151;is right or whether we should adopt a much wider approach. I believe we should fine-tune the current system, rather than try to replace it or overlay it with a different system. The history of such reorganisations is that they lead to confusion and inefficiency, instead of tightening up the system. However, I have several questions that I should like to pose and ask the Minister to respond to.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51014-19_para3">
<a name="stpa_167">First, what evidence is there that under the current system people are losing out? Has there been any independent review of what is working and what is not working in the current system? My hon. Friend the Member for Kingston upon Hull, North (Ms Johnson) touched on that. There are independent bodies out there, and in the light of the debate perhaps it is timely to discover where there are gaps in provision. Secondly, is access to justice under the present system clear enough? Is it sufficiently well signposted at the time of need in the workplace? Thirdly, how seamless is the system? In the progression from early identification to deciding whether the case should be solved through early arbitration or mediation or progressed through tribunals into the court system, is the signposting clear enough or are there differences, depending on location and the organisation in question?
</p>

<p>
<a name="51014-19_para4">
<a name="stpa_168">At the very first level&#151;trade unions, reliance on work colleagues and so on&#151;how confident are we as a Government that there is good coverage in skills, training and experience not only in workplaces that have union representatives, but in those where unions do not exist? If we are not confident that such coverage is near perfect, what can we do to make it so? We have already talked about the onus on employers to encourage such a climate. What more do we need to do to ensure that gaps do not exist?
</p>

<p>
<a name="51014-19_para5">
<a name="stpa_169">I have raised this issue before in the past two or three years, during which time we have made great improvements. However, in closing I have a question for the Minister. What recent analysis has been made of funding gaps in the current system, particularly in universal coverage of legal aid? I also have some points for my hon. Friend the Member for Bradford, West, who introduced this Bill, to consider. One of my concerns is how the Bill would synthesise with existing legal and support structures on the ground. He has heard several Members express the worry that, at best, it would be a superstructure that duplicates existing practice, and that, at worst, it would damage 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>14 Oct 2005 : Column 583</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>existing provision by taking funds away or by skewing priorities on the ground. As I said earlier, diversity of provision is very healthy.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51014-19_para6">
<a name="stpa_170">As several Members have also said, we must clarify the costs that the Bill would entail. Providing a blank cheque for legislation&#151; any legislation&#151;is an extreme worry, and although I would not want the question of funding to prevent a good Bill from making progress per se, it is incumbent on any Bill that its financial implications be as clear as possible. Have other ways of overseeing access to justice in discrimination cases been considered that are less &quot;belt and braces&quot;? What suggestions did the Equal Opportunities Commission and other such bodies make to my hon. Friend the Member for Bradford, West during his discussions with them? What did they have to say about developing the current system and dealing with its deficiencies?
</p>

<p>
<a name="51014-19_para7">
<a name="stpa_171">Today&#039;s debate has shown that there is general consensus that the Government&#039;s current approach is right. However, concerns have been expressed about clarity of provision, and about the ability of people throughout the UK to access such provision. I hope that the Minister will discuss the integrity of the current system and the potential for improvements to it in her response. However, I am worried about rolling out new legislation that might destroy or damage the very elements that my hon. Friend the Member for Bradford, West is seeking to enhance.

 I congratulate the hon. Member for Bradford, West (Mr. Singh) on coming first in the ballot and thereby being able to introduce what is his second Bill on this subject, he having introduced the first, I believe, during the last Session. The Bill does raise important issues about the way in which employment tribunals operate in the sphere of discrimination law. I do not believe, however, that he has found the right solution. Setting up another quango and taking money from organisations that are already providing important services is not the way forward, but he has lit on an area in which difficulties exist.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51014-19_para8">
<a name="stpa_172">In the early days of the industrial tribunal&#151;I suppose that I should admit, as a lawyer, that I practised there for quite a few years&#151;the atmosphere was very informal. It used to be described as the industrial jury, and there was an employer&#039;s representative and an employee&#039;s representative. Sometimes, just the employee and the boss would argue the case. At other times, the union representative or someone from HR&#151;human relations, but we used to call it personnel in those days&#151;would be involved. The environment was excellent and there was a real workplace feel about it. I can honestly say that it was not legalistic. The employer explained the reason why the person had been dismissed and argued that it was reasonable in the circumstances.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51014-19_para9">
<a name="stpa_173">Discrimination cases are slightly different. Over the years, there has been a piecemeal accumulation of law on discrimination, leading to a large and complex body of law. I believe that it places a considerable burden on employers who have to try and understand the different 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>14 Oct 2005 : Column 584</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>matrices of discrimination within three different categories. From the employees&#039; point of view, the protections are uneven, which is often poorly understood by employees themselves. I agree with the hon. Member for Kingston upon Hull, North (Ms Johnson) that people often require good advice in this sphere of the law.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51014-19_para10">
<a name="stpa_174">Other problem areas include constructive dismissal, the Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) Regulations 1981, and so forth. Over the years, the atmosphere in the industrial tribunal&#151;now the employment tribunal&#151;has changed from being informal and constructive in how it operated to becoming more lawyerly, more formal and more legalistic. The rules have changed and become rather more restrictive, so it is time to look again into the whole subject of how this area of law operates. Indeed, the time has come for a review of discrimination law to see whether it can be made simpler. I would also welcome another look at how tribunals operate to see whether we could return to something more firmly rooted in what is happening in the workplace. I agree with the point made by the hon. Member for Ogmore (Huw Irranca-Davies)&#151;that prevention is always better than cure. Providing decent grievance and disciplinary procedures that operate fairly in the workplace offers the best way forward.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51014-19_para11">
<a name="stpa_175">I would make one point in defence of how employment law, rather than the courts generally, has operated, in that ACAS has always had an important role in dealing with cases, which allowed many settlements to be reached at an early stage. Lawyers practising in the employment field can justifiably feel that they were trailblazing to some extent.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51014-19_para12">
<a name="stpa_176">In the really difficult cases of exceptional public concern where the highest issues of law apply, exceptional funding may be justified. However, for cutting-edge cases of discrimination, the Equal Opportunities Commission, the Commission for Racial Equality and the Disability Rights Commission are providing funding that is likely to make a difference in respect of clarifying, amplifying or extending the law. I do not believe that we have that much of a problem in getting the law right. The real problem is ensuring that someone worried about understanding the law has the opportunity to get the necessary advice in order to weigh up whether to proceed with a case.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51014-19_para13">
<a name="stpa_177">The number of discrimination cases has increased, but levels of success at tribunals are pretty low&#151;below 5&nbsp;per cent.&#151;and many cases are either withdrawn or dismissed. That may show either that many initial cases are of poor quality or, as the hon. Member for Bradford, West argued, that applicants feel unable to continue because they do not know how to navigate the system and need a lawyer. The community legal service provides a network throughout the country, but is currently under pressure. The legal aid practitioners group pointed out that its funding from the Government is being squeezed because the criminal legal aid budget is expanding rapidly and it has not been possible to ring-fence the civil side. That matter needs full review and we could talk about it for hours on end, but it is important for the Government to consider it carefully to ensure that that network of organisations that struggle for funding is not compromised by being squeezed in that way.

In the 1970s, I was a member of the committee of the Free Representation Unit, which the hon. Member for Kingston upon Hull, North mentioned. We received referrals from organisations, but the network was patchy. It is better now and the organisation has grown like Topsy; it has caseworkers as well as trainee lawyers and is doing very well. However, we need to ensure that there is a proper pipeline so that people who ask for advice from citizens advice bureaux, community law centres or somewhere else have access to the type of services provided by FRU, the Bar pro bono unit and the solicitors pro bono unit. We need to look at referrals.

It has been said that a large number of people are never offered the opportunity to join a trade union. One or two Members blamed employers, which I thought was a bit rich, but trade unions could do much more to explain to potential members the services they offer and sell themselves a bit. In the mid-1990s, when I was a member of the Employment Select Committee, trade unions carried out a survey in docklands, asking employees whether they had ever been approached to join a union. It turned out that only about 13&nbsp;per cent. had ever been asked. It was said at the time that unions spent on average 10&nbsp;times more on their annual conferences than on membership.

I notice that the hon. Member for Shipley (Philip Davies) has left the Chamber&#151;perhaps he has gone to join a trade union.

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>14 Oct 2005 : Column 586</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>most cases fail, because they are either withdrawn or dismissed, we must not simply consider the effects on applicants. No company that is accused of discrimination can take it lightly, and much as I like the informal atmosphere of the tribunal, if a company is accused of discrimination, particularly if it has other workers from an ethnic minority or workers who might be in the same category of employee as those who have made the accusation, it cannot ignore it; it must take legal advice, in my view. So probably almost all the companies that are subject to claims that eventually fail or are withdrawn have employed a lawyer, and have gone to a great deal of trouble to investigate the case, to be ready for a hearing. These are amazing burdens on business.

<a name="51014-20_para2">
<a name="stpa_182">Obviously, if we can have more cases that are accurately targeted and fewer that are not, it would be a good thing, but we must think carefully about the likely impact of setting up a board to hand out legal aid without any merit test, particularly as it would, I believe, have the effect of creating a surge of claims. I also think that it would be bad to undermine the existing arrangements, with that tracery of small bodies across the country that are providing advice services already. Every penny that is spent on the new quango and its work, including the salary of the chairman and other appointments, will be taken out of the budgets of the organisations that are already doing the job.

 Like many hon. Members, I fully accept the principles behind the Bill. There is absolutely no place in today&#039;s society, which wants to call itself decent, for allowing discrimination of any kind to continue unchallenged. The promotion of equal opportunities at work and in the community and the elimination of discrimination on the grounds of race, gender, sexuality, disability, age or creed should be two of our core aims&#151;the core aims of government and all those who are party to it. There is considerable evidence from all quarters&#151;the Commission for Racial Equality, the Equal Opportunities Commission, the Disability Rights Commission, academics, the trade union movement, and the Government&#039;s own research&#151;to show there is still an awful lot to do to overcome discrimination.

<a name="stpa_190">Evidence shows the slow progress that we have managed to achieve so far, with the gap between white and non-white participation in employment and with higher unemployment rates and associated links to deprivation. Indeed, my constituency has the lowest employment rate in the country. Even some 30&nbsp;years after the Equal Pay Act 1970, the pay gap between men and women still stands at 18&nbsp;per cent. and even more for those who are part-time and undertaking a caring responsibility. Of course that is why the Prime Minister recognised the need to establish the women and work commission, which is examining the barriers that women face at work, in training opportunities and because of their often less-than-equal pay compared with male comrades. The fact that disabled people have for so long faced not just physical but social and cultural barriers has been recognised in legislation, which now needs the teeth to make it work. Age discrimination continues, whether against the young or the more

<br>&nbsp;<br>mature. All such discrimination affects people not just at the personal level, but also in their contribution to the economy and in their interaction with society at large.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51014-20_para11">
<a name="stpa_191">It is shameful that, in the 21st century, we still have discrimination in the workplace&#151;whether unconscious or blatant&#151;from colleagues and employers, or caused by how the organisational structures operate, but those problems are known and action is being taken. Progress may be slow, but it is definitely speeding up now. Many employers are exemplary and ensure that their structures, policies and procedures support equality at work and leave little or no room for discrimination. When discrimination is found, they often have good processes to deal with it. But there are also many employers who, left to themselves, would do little or nothing to ensure that discrimination does not occur. In fact, some of them do not even understand, or make an effort to understand, that discrimination even exists in their workplaces or that they have a responsibility to eradicate it.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51014-20_para12">
<a name="stpa_192">There is no doubt that current discrimination legislation is complex, potentially costly and time-consuming. It is confusing and inconsistent, and it relies on those suffering discrimination to take the responsibility for tackling that discrimination after the event, rather than encouraging organisations to prevent the possibility of discrimination in the first place. The only exception is the duty on public sector bodies to promote race equality, which I hope will soon be joined by a duty to promote sexual and disability equality. But let us be clear that any burdens are not just on employers but on workers, who have often felt strongly enough, or been forced by financial difficulties, to overcome the barriers that they face to seek some form of redress, who have often overcome stressful processes before they get to tribunal in taking their concerns through internal grievance procedures, and who almost definitely did not set out to bring themselves to what, in effect, is a courtroom to be quizzed in what is becoming an increasingly difficult and litigious way, and who still face a comparatively low success rate at tribunals.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51014-20_para13">
<a name="stpa_193">Yes, there are increases in the number of discrimination cases being registered, but mainly in the areas of sex discrimination and equal pay. There is a reason for that. Women are becoming increasingly aware that unequal pay for equal value is against the law, so they are rightly claiming their due. It is not easy for others who face discrimination. They still face low success rates, because it is difficult to prove not only that a worker has suffered detriment, but that the detriment was because of the discrimination. We should also realise that the rising number of cases still reflects only a fraction of those employed and those who experience difficulties at work, but do not take a case to a tribunal.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51014-20_para14">
<a name="stpa_194">I can see why colleagues are drawn to the Bill. The system is not easy to understand and some people have to contend with it on their own. With the diminishment of collective rights over the 1980s and 1990s, 70&nbsp;per cent. of today&#039;s employees do not have the support of a trade union, which means that the employees who are most likely to be dismissed or suffer unfairness at work are least likely to have the support at an employment tribunal. Therefore bringing forward proposals that appear to support individuals in their claims at tribunals seems just and fair.

 I am bit worried about the phrase that the hon. Lady has just used. She said that if no compensation is paid, that is all right. Surely the whole point about the phrase the &quot;compensation culture&quot; and the debate about the Bill is that, in encouraging people excessively to make claims, to lay blame or to seek compensation even if they fail, we add burdens to the judicial process, the business community and so on. That is the problem on which we must remain focused. Her Government, her Prime Minister and her Chancellor of the Exchequer repeat over and over again the need for us to remain competitive. If we do not keep a close eye on this sort of thing, it will run counter to that aim.

 I thank the right hon. Gentleman for that point. The point that I am attempting to make&#151;and perhaps have made badly&#151;is that if one has suffered a wrong, one deserves compensation for the wrong that has been wrought. I accept that we need to be competitive in business, but I also believe that one of the things that we have not covered today is the fact that people who have been wronged deserve compensation. We need to find a way of ensuring that they receive that compensation. I am sure that Members on both sides accept that there were wrongs in the cases that my hon.

The number of sex discrimination cases that have been dealt with has jumped from 3,809&nbsp;in 1999&#150;2000&nbsp;to 16,211&nbsp;in 2004&#150;05.

<a name="stpa_203">There is no way of assessing what the Lord Chancellor would be asked to pay because there are no means-testing provisions in the Bill. There are pretty much no merit-testing provisions either because not only accredited bodies, but non-accredited bodies, may be funded. It is difficult to understand why the principle of means-testing does not apply to the Bill because it seems to chime perfectly with the Labour party principle of targeting the most help on those who need it most. Means-testing applies to other forms of legal assistance, so why does it not apply to the Bill?
</p>

<p>
<a name="51014-21_para8">
<a name="stpa_204">Two recent high-profile cases demonstrate my point. Elizabeth Weston, who was a solicitor earning &#163;60,000&nbsp;a year at Merrill Lynch, took the firm to court for a discrimination claim and was awarded &#163;1&nbsp;million in an out-of-court settlement. Perhaps I should declare an interest because I used to work for Merrill Lynch, although I had no grounds to think about taking out a claim against it. Elizabeth Weston was quite capable of representing herself at the hearing and paying for legal advice, but she would have been entitled to free legal advice under the Bill. An executive at Merrill Lynch who earned roughly &#163;1&nbsp;million a year also took the company to tribunal, although she lost her sex discrimination case. Are we really saying that someone like that should be entitled to free help and legal representation? I do not understand the justification for that.

<p><a name="st_283"><a name="51014-21_spnew5"><b> Mr. Harper: </b> 
 On the subject of means-testing, clause 12(4) specifically rules out anyone being eligible for help if they are receiving assistance from a trade union in connection with the complaint, but still allows help to be given if someone is getting help from another source, such as a solicitor or a citizens advice bureau. As the hon. Lady says, it does not mention finding out whether someone has means themselves.

<p><a name="st_284"><a name="51014-21_spnew6"><b> Kerry McCarthy: </b> 
 Exactly. The escalation of costs under the scheme could be phenomenal; there is no way of predicting what they might be. As other Members have said, costs would also be involved in duplicating current processes. For example, the Legal Services Commission already has the role of awarding quality marks, not just to private sector firms but not-for-profit organisations involved in giving advice on employment law. There would be duplication of those resources, and two bureaucracies assessing people, which might be doing exactly the same sort of work.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51014-21_para9">
<a name="stpa_205">Above all, there is a problem with the timing of the Bill. We need to examine discrimination in the context of inequality. For example, only 57.3&nbsp;per cent. of people of working age from the black and minority ethnic communities are in work, compared with 75.5&nbsp;per cent. of whites. We could say that that was a clear case of discrimination, but we could also say that there are many other factors affecting those communities: 67&nbsp;per cent. of people from the black and minority ethnic communities live in the 88&nbsp;most deprived wards and there is economic and social deprivation, low educational achievement, cultural factors, limited employment opportunities, health inequalities and language issues. All those factors have contributed, and we have to consider them all in the round; we cannot just assume that discrimination is to blame.

There is also the discrimination law review, which is working towards single equality legislation. The Government had a manifesto commitment to bring in a single equality Act, which I understand could come before Parliament in 2007. They have also set up an equalities review, examining the underlying causes of inequality. It is chaired by Trevor Phillips, and will report to the Prime Minister in 2006. We need to put some of the points in the Bill on hold, until we have examined the underlying issues of inequality. Perhaps if we start to address some of those, we will not need to fund so many discrimination cases.

<a name="stpa_224">I took the liberty of speaking to colleagues and friends from the trade union movement who represent employees at employment tribunals. They harked back to the days when, I think someone said, their mum could have gone along to a tribunal and effectively stated her case, represented herself and been heard, helped and encouraged by the tribunal to give evidence and get to the bottom of the case. It was in some ways better to be unrepresented and unassisted. People had a better hearing and better consideration of their case if they went along without a solicitor in tow.

<a name="stpa_225">Moving through the Bill, I turn to clause 4, on accreditation and monitoring. There is, again, duplication about the quality mark and the work of the community legal service. When Government policy seems to be about minimising the numbers of those who are not at the coalface, the point of delivery of the service, and trying to move more funding into service delivery, we are at risk of creating a body that does exactly the opposite and draws resources away from the point of delivery, albeit for the best of reasons.

<a name="stpa_226">Let us consider what information is readily available. I spent a few moments last night looking at what information is available from the community legal service; I mentioned some of that in an intervention. Its direct information leaflet No. 18, &quot;Rights for Disabled People&quot;, helpfully explains what employees should do about discrimination at work and what routes are available to them, including employment tribunals. It also answers questions such as &quot;Who will pay for my case?&quot; Other hon.

 I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Bradford, West (Mr. Singh) on winning first place in the ballot and introducing this private Member&#039;s Bill today. Having successfully steered the Christmas Day (Trading) Bill through the House last year, with the assistance of the right hon. Member for Bromley and Chislehurst (Mr. Forth), I know how much work has to go into preparing for these Fridays and ensuring that people are aware of the Bill before it reaches the Floor of the House.

<p><a name="st_292"><a name="51014-23_spnew2"><b> Mr. Jones: </b> 
 Like many colleagues who have spoken, I sympathise with my hon. Friend the Member for Bradford, West because he is a passionate advocate of the cause against discrimination, and he should be supported in that. However, unfortunately, I cannot support the Bill as it stands. I was going to go through the Bill, but the hon. Member for Forest of Dean (Mr. Harper) did an excellent job of doing so clause by clause. He raised a lot of fundamental problems with the Bill. We saw there the future of the Conservative party. That contribution must have been a relief to the Conservative Front-Bench team following the contribution of Mr. Gradgrind, the hon. Member for Shipley (Philip Davies), which was ill informed and 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>14 Oct 2005 : Column 596</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>plainly wrong on occasions. He told the House that he had worked for Asda. All I can say is that his election to the House is Asda&#039;s gain and this House&#039;s loss.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51014-23_para1">
<a name="stpa_229">Another reason that I have reservations about the Bill is to do with the way tribunals work. For many years, for my sins, I practised, not as a lawyer, but as a trade union official in tribunals in Newcastle. I found it sad that, over the years, many lawyers and barristers came before the tribunal who frankly were not needed. It appalled me that sometimes large multinational corporations employed lawyers for the simplest case, which was offputting for a lot of applicants, but welcome from my point of view, as it used to irritate many chairmen who did not like being told by a top London barrister about points of law.
</p>








<p><a name="st_293"><a name="51014-23_spnew3"><b> Mr. Heald: </b> 
 Does the hon. Gentleman agree that many of the barristers came from the chambers that the Prime Minister was in?
</p>








<p><a name="st_294"><a name="51014-23_spnew4"><b> Mr. Jones: </b> 
 I do not think I ever came across a barrister who was from those chambers. The fact is that tribunals were set up to be a simple way of considering disputes. Older colleagues in the trade union movement have told me that, in the 1960s, tribunals were exactly that: people got around a table and discussed the case or injustice. Unfortunately, this Bill would lead to many more lawyers being engaged and the legal profession having a banquet, as my hon. Friend the Member for Stoke-on-Trent, South (Mr. Flello) said.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51014-23_para2">
<a name="stpa_230">The Government have taken some sensible measures to make it easier to get justice, but at the same time to stop the frivolous and vexatious cases. It is sad when there is a contribution in the House by someone who clearly does not understand the present system and has no knowledge of it. The hon. Member for Shipley made comments on the compensation culture and frivolous and vexatious cases as though he were talking in a local golf club bar. The important thing is that the frivolous and vexatious cases will not get to an employment tribunal. Processes have been put in place to involve ACAS and to ensure that employers and applicants have to go through the grievance procedure before they can take a case to a tribunal. It is right to try to get the case resolved at the workplace. That has to be welcome.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51014-23_para3">
<a name="stpa_231">I congratulate ACAS, which does a fantastic job advising not just applicants but, increasingly&#151;this is important&#151;firms about their procedures, bringing them up to date. From my experience, if an employer had good disciplinary procedures in place, they would never end up in a tribunal.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51014-23_para4">
<a name="stpa_232">The worst ones I dealt with were working men&#039;s clubs, whose chairmen were often trade unionists: they were Arthur Scargill during the day and Margaret Thatcher at night, when they went into the club committee room. If the right procedures had been followed, many of those cases would never have ended up at a tribunal.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51014-23_para5">
<a name="stpa_233">Trade unions play a vital part in giving free legal advice but they are not the only option. I would not want to set up, as the Bill proposes, an expensive organisation that cut across a raft of organisations that are doing a good job&#151;reference has been made to citizens advice bureaux and law centres. If one has to get a lawyer to go before a tribunal&#151;I certainly would not recommend it unless one had to have one&#151;there are 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>14 Oct 2005 : Column 597</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>ways in which to fund that. For example, conditional fee agreements limit the costs and allow people to get legal redress.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51014-23_para6">
<a name="stpa_234">I am aware that there are more complex cases, such as sex or disability discrimination cases, which need input from the legal profession, and I acknowledge that there are gaps in provision and people who cannot get access to legal aid, but we need to examine that problem rather than invent an expensive new organisation. If the Bill were passed in its current form, we would need a lorry load of smelling salts to bring round the Chancellor of the Exchequer after he had realised its implications.

<p><a name="st_295"><a name="51014-23_spmin0"><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Constitutional Affairs  (Bridget Prentice): </b> 
 I begin as other hon. Members have by congratulating my hon. Friend the Member for Bradford, West (Mr. Singh), first, on coming top of the private Members&#039; ballot&#151;an ambition held by us all at some point in our careers in Parliament, but realised by only a few&#151;and, secondly, on bringing the issue of employment discrimination to the House for debate today. The principle of removing discrimination is one that we all support&#151;perhaps with the exception of the hon. Member for Shipley (Philip Davies). My hon. Friend the Member for West Ham (Lyn Brown) made a passionate speech in which she outlined the importance of removing discrimination in the workplace and explained precisely why we should all work to achieve that.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51014-23_para8">
<a name="stpa_236">First, let me respond to some of the concerns raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Bradford, West in his opening speech. He said that he was concerned about cost and suggested that it cost between &#163;15,000&nbsp;and &#163;45,000&nbsp;to take forward a discrimination case in London. According to the Department of Trade and Industry survey of employment tribunal applications, however, the average legal costs of those complainants who paid for advice and representation in discrimination cases amounted to &#163;4,433.
</p>








<p><a name="st_296"><a name="51014-23_spnew5"><b> Mr. Harper: </b> 
 The Minister helpfully clarifies the costs for those who brought a case to an employment tribunal. Does she have the equivalent figures for the amount spent in those cases by the defendants, so that we can see the total cost of bringing and defending a case?
</p>








<p><a name="st_297"><a name="51014-23_spnew6"><b> Bridget Prentice: </b> 
 I do not have those figures to hand, but if they are available I shall make sure that the hon. Gentleman has sight of them.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51014-23_para9">
<a name="stpa_237">My hon. Friend the Member for Bradford, West voiced concern about the success rate in pregnancy cases and gave some harrowing examples. The Equal Opportunities Commission conducted a review of the employment tribunals in 2002&#150;03. As my hon. Friends the Members for Stoke-on-Trent, South (Mr. Flello) and for North Durham (Mr. Jones) pointed out in their exceptional speeches, the success rate for women who represent themselves compares favourably with the rate for women who are represented: approximately 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>14 Oct 2005 : Column 598</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>53 per cent. of unrepresented women were successful, compared with 50&nbsp;per cent. of those who had a barrister in tow and 47&nbsp;per cent. of those who had a solicitor with them.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51014-23_para10">
<a name="stpa_238">My hon. Friend the Member for Bradford, West was asked by my right hon. Friend the Member for Coatbridge, Chryston and Bellshill (Mr. Clarke) about the views of the Disability Rights Commission. The DRC has said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_41">&quot;While being strongly supportive of the principle of equal access to justice for all, we are not sure that this Bill is necessarily the best means of tackling the current barriers to justice.

<a name="stpa_240">My hon. Friend the Member for Bradford, West asked about the situation in Scotland. In an intervention on the hon. Member for Argyll and Bute (Mr. Reid), I made it clear that not only is legal aid granted for employment tribunals in Scotland in very limited circumstances where there has been a breach of article 6&nbsp;of the European convention on human rights, but in England and Wales we have a similar test for exceptional funding. That provision goes further than the Scottish one, because it allows for cases with a significant wider public interest to be funded.

<p><a name="st_298"><a name="51014-24_spnew0"><b> Mr. Reid: </b> 
 Under Scottish legislation, the Legal Aid Board is allowed to take into account the applicant&#039;s inability to present their case because of, for example, age, inadequate knowledge of English, mental illness or other mental or physical disability. Does the legislation in England and Wales also permit that to be taken into account?
</p>








<p><a name="st_299"><a name="51014-24_spnew1"><b> Bridget Prentice: </b> 
 I am pleased that the hon. Gentleman raised that. Not only does the exceptional funding regime allow for that, but it is specifically intended for people who would for any reason be incapable of bringing the case on their own, so they are very much included in the regime.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51014-24_para0">
<a name="stpa_241">My hon. Friend the Member for Bradford, West suggested that citizens advice bureaux would not be able to represent people. We know that in 7&nbsp;per cent. of cases citizens advice bureaux do go along and represent people. He was concerned, too, about legal advice deserts. A number of my hon. Friends made positive and welcome comments about the community legal service. I am delighted that so many people have had access to its website.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51014-24_para1">
<a name="stpa_242">Today&#039;s debate has given us an opportunity to bring to the attention of the House and the wider public the excellent work that the community legal service is doing. Let me provide some figures for the new ways in which it is delivering advice and assistance. Through the internet there were 500,000&nbsp;visits to CLS Direct last year. The community legal service has taken more than 200,000&nbsp;telephone calls, including 22,000&nbsp;specialist acts of advice and assistance by telephone. It continues to monitor provision closely and to ensure that quality provision is available across the country.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51014-24_para2">
<a name="stpa_243">My hon. Friend argued, rightly, that advice and assistance should be available to the most disadvantaged. He suggested that his Bill would be the way forward in 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>14 Oct 2005 : Column 599</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>that, but I can only endorse the comments of my hon. Friend the Member for Bristol, East (Kerry McCarthy), who provided examples of how people who were very wealthy by any standard would fall within the remit of the Bill, contrary to the aims of legal aid.
</p>








<p><a name="st_300"><a name="51014-24_spnew2"><b> Mr. Heald: </b> 
 One issue has troubled Members of all parties. Given that most discrimination cases fail&#151;they are withdrawn or they are dismissed at the tribunal&#151;does the hon. Lady have any information about whether that is because applicants do not have the legal representation that they need to pursue the case properly, or because the cases are of poor quality? If she does not know the answer, will she have some research done? It is important to know why discrimination cases are not succeeding.
</p>








<p><a name="st_301"><a name="51014-24_spnew3"><b> Bridget Prentice: </b> 
 The hon. Gentleman makes a valid point. There are a number of reviews. In particular, the Department of Trade and Industry constantly reviews the way that employment tribunals go about their work. One of the strengths of the system is that cases that have no merit do not get to the table in the first place. Pre-tribunal scrutiny allows vexatious and frivolous cases, which the hon. Member for Shipley suggested happen all the time, to be sifted out, so that they do not happen all the time. However, the point was made that we need to look at why cases do not succeed&#151;an issue that the Government want to consider on an ongoing basis.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51014-24_para3">
<a name="stpa_244">As I said, my hon. Friend the Member for Bradford, West expressed concern about legal advice deserts, and I should point out that from this March onwards some 238&nbsp;organisations&#151;164&nbsp;solicitors and 74&nbsp;law centres and citizens advice bureaux&#151;have been specially accredited by the CLS to provide advice and assistance in employment matters. There are also 26&nbsp;employment tribunal hearing centres throughout the country. So through the current spread of advice and assistance&#151;the hon. Member for North-East Hertfordshire (Mr. Heald) described it, rather beautifully, as a tracery&#151;we are trying comprehensively to cover the country. Of course, we always want to do more.
</p>








<p><a name="st_302"><a name="51014-24_spnew4"><b> Mr. Paterson: </b> 
 Why, in the Government&#039;s view, has the total number of discrimination claims increased from some 8,000&nbsp;in 1999&nbsp;to just under 28,000&nbsp;in 2004? Moreover, why do there appear to be such a large number of weak claims? Claims relating to sex, race and disability succeeded in only 28, 15&nbsp;and 29&nbsp;per cent. of cases respectively.
</p>








<p><a name="st_303"><a name="51014-24_spnew5"><b> Bridget Prentice: </b> 
 One explanation&#151;it is based purely on anecdotal evidence&#151;is that people are more aware of the existence of tribunals, and that they also perhaps feel that there has been an increase in discrimination. Reviews need to take that point into account. However, as my hon. Friend the Member for West Ham said, many employers&#151;whether they are taken to tribunal or not&#151;realise when mistakes have been made in the workplace and address them before the tribunal stage is reached.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51014-24_para4">
<a name="stpa_245">My hon. Friend the Member for Bradford, West also asked what access to justice means. It means that when people need help, there are effective solutions that are 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>14 Oct 2005 : Column 600</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>proportionate to the issues at stake. In some circumstances that will involve going to court, but in others that will not be necessary. It is in no one&#039;s interest to create a litigious society. The hon. Member for Shipley went on at length about vexatious cases, and I should point out that this country does not have a compensation culture, and that we intend to ensure that we do not create one. People must make responsible decisions about whether a case is worth pursuing, about whether to proceed by negotiation, court action or in some other way and about how far to take what might be a relatively minor matter.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51014-24_para5">
<a name="stpa_246">When the hon. Member for Shipley made his observations about the compensation culture, he was responded to very expertly by my hon. Friend the Member for Kingston upon Hull, North (Ms Johnson). The Government are developing legislation to tackle the perception of a compensation culture, and tightening the regulatory net around unreliable providers of poor advice, including employment advisers.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51014-24_para6">
<a name="stpa_247">The House will be aware that the way in which justice is delivered in administration and in the workplace is already undergoing significant change. A new executive agency of the Department for Constitutional Affairs will bring together tribunals under one unified administration. The Government have announced their intention to introduce, when parliamentary time allows, legislation that will enable tribunals to use a range of dispute resolution methods. The employment tribunal system will become part of that new agency when it launches in April 2006. Until then, we are working with colleagues at the DTI as they review the current arrangements, in order to explore how we can make the employment tribunal system work better for the user.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51014-24_para7">
<a name="stpa_248">The Bill does not take into account the Legal Services Commission&#039;s existing role in administering legal aid, and in ensuring that quality assured legal advice and assistance is available for those who need it in employment cases. As has been outlined, legal help is available. Legal representation can be granted in individual cases under exceptional funding arrangements. Full representation under legal aid is already available in cases brought before the Employment Appeal Tribunal.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51014-24_para8">
<a name="stpa_249">My hon. Friend the Member for Ogmore (Huw Irranca-Davies) asked whether exceptional funding covered language and mental health problems. As I said to the hon. Member for Argyll and Bute, yes, it does. Part of the practice of the exceptional funding is to comply with article 6&nbsp;of the European convention on human rights. Language and mental health will be taken into account.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51014-24_para9">
<a name="stpa_250">My hon. Friend also asked what analysis had been made of current provision and I can tell him that the community legal service is undertaking a comprehensive review of its provision of advice and assistance. The consultation stage of that process will close this month. That is part of a wider Government strategy to provide a fairer deal for legal aid in order to tackle rising criminal costs and ensure the future of civil legal aid.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51014-24_para10">
<a name="stpa_251">On the subject of costs, the hon. Member for North-East Hertfordshire, among others, talked about the open-ended nature of cost provision in relation to the Lord Chancellor.

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>14 Oct 2005 : Column 601</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>that she is not here to ensure that I do not agree to that particular part of the Bill. The Department for Constitutional Affairs would not agree to that part of the Bill, even if we were to agree to any of the rest of it. It is unacceptable for any Government Department to be asked to pay unlimited costs to a body that is undemocratic and unaccountable to Parliament. Furthermore, we are being asked to provide not just unlimited costs, but unlimited costs plus, as the Bill provides. I assure the House that although the Government are opposing the Bill as a whole, they would oppose it on that ground alone.

The establishment of a new board would be unduly democratic and disproportionate, and would inevitably increase the amount of taxpayers&#039; money spent on administration, diverting resources from supporting individual cases.

 Will the Minister say a few words about the burdens on business? Reasons connected with reputation oblige every employer to take seriously every case that is brought.

 I can tell the hon.

If we reach the stage where a tribunal cannot deliver for its users without such arrangements, we shall have to look at the situation carefully.

<p><a name="st_315"><a name="51014-25_spnew6"><b> Grant Shapps  (Welwyn Hatfield) (Con):</b> 
 I am most grateful for the opportunity to present this matter, which relates to one of my constituents but has wider ramifications across the nation.

</p>

<p>
<a name="51014-25_para8">
<a name="stpa_261">On 12&nbsp;March, a constituent in Welwyn, Mr. Rodney Bailey, was woken at 3&nbsp;am when his car window was smashed by a youth who had thrown a rock through it. Fortunately, Mr. Bailey lives in the same street as a police officer who was off duty and immediately jumped out of bed and managed to capture the youth involved. The police were called and the youth was taken to Hatfield police station, whereupon he confessed.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51014-25_para9">
<a name="stpa_262">Following Home Office guidelines, the police decided that as there was no previous record they would issue a caution to that individual. Mr. Bailey, who lives, appropriately, in Robbery Bottom lane, thought that acceptable as long as he could take some form of civil action to recover the moneys due as a result of the damage to his windscreen. Not unreasonably, he asked for the name, address and details of the offender, who had, after all, admitted to the crime. The police said that would be fine but that he would have to apply in writing. He did so, but the police then told him that they could not in fact release the information as it would contravene the Data Protection Act 1998.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51014-25_para10">
<a name="stpa_263">In my view and, I am sure, that of many other people, the police should never protect a criminal against a victim whose rights have clearly been contravened. To stand in the way and prevent civil proceedings from being taken must be wrong, but such, it seems, is the law. There is a loophole in the legislation.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51014-25_para11">
<a name="stpa_264">There are a number of exemptions to the Act, one of which comes close to the type of exemption required in this case&#151;disclosure to courts in legal proceedings. One might think that would help the police in releasing the necessary information, yet it transpires that it applies when legal proceedings have already begun. If one does not know who committed the crime, how on earth is one supposed to take out a summons? That exemption would not work in this case. We must reframe the law to enable an individual to take action where the police know who committed the crime and the individual has admitted it but where the police are prevented from allowing the action to be taken.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51014-25_para12">
<a name="stpa_265">The police eventually agreed to release the information. When Mr. Speaker was kind enough to grant me this debate, which resulted in full-page stories in the<i> Daily Mail</i>, the <i>Sunday People</i>, local television and other media outlets, the police decided that it would be appropriate to release the information. However, the chief constable, Mr. Frank Whiteley, did so against the specific advice of his own legal team. It must be wrong that, in order that an individual can take a case to court, the police force involved should be expected to go against its own legal advice. Surely there must be a problem in law.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51014-25_para13">
<a name="stpa_266">There are, as I said, some exemptions, but none is satisfactory in this type of case. I strongly believe that a provision should be made for this type of case. One can 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>14 Oct 2005 : Column 604</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>imagine a number of scenarios. Perhaps it would be appropriate for a summons to be issued but for the person issuing the summons simply to refer the court to the police station and the reference number, so that the police can link up the numbers. I fully accept that there is a danger about which the police are nervous: they are concerned that the victim might take individual retribution&#151;that they might go round to the person&#039;s house and take it upon themselves to take immediate action, and of course none of us wants that to happen. It does not take a great deal of imagination to envisage ways around that problem. One way could simply be to send the form for a summons to the court, for the court to apply to the police, and for the police to provide the name and address of the defendant direct to the court, so that at that stage, before the case comes to court, there is no need for the plaintiff&#151;the victim in the case that I am talking about&#151;to access the information.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51014-25_para14">
<a name="stpa_267">You see, Mr. Deputy Speaker, there is a dichotomy here. Had the individual been charged&#151;had the individual admitted to the crime, as he did, and had the case been taken to a criminal court in the normal way&#151;the information would be public, and it would be simple for Rodney Bailey to issue a civil action and recover the money. The difficulty arises because of the dancing-on-a-pinhead issue of the caution being issued. As I understand it&#151;I shall be interested if the Minister can tell me otherwise&#151;a caution remains on a person&#039;s police record, so I see no reason why the victim in a case such as this should not be able to seek recompense.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51014-25_para15">
<a name="stpa_268">I am sure that there are other, perhaps more creative, solutions. The police are in a very unsatisfactory position. Perhaps you might think, Mr. Deputy Speaker, that the police should be prepared to issue a caution as opposed to prosecuting, but only if the individual has already agreed to repay the money.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51014-25_para16">
<a name="stpa_269">I understand that police forces up and down the country will be concerned about such a proposition. They do not want to put themselves in the position of debt collectors. I hesitate to call this plea bargaining because it brings with it all sorts of other connotations, but I do think that there should be a system in place so that if the individual is going to get off relatively lightly, with a caution rather than a full prosecution, it should perhaps be incumbent on the police to ensure that the victim is in some way in a position to seek compensation. It seems fair; it seems just.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51014-25_para17">
<a name="stpa_270">You will be interested to hear, Mr. Deputy Speaker&#151;I hope that the Minister will respond&#151;the words of my own chief constable in Hertfordshire:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_42">&quot;This legislation puts the police in a difficult position.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="51014-25_para18">
<a name="stpa_271">In this case, the chief constable had to go against the explicit advice of his own solicitors. It seems to me that after 15&nbsp;years of Data Protection Act training, staff are now in a position where the idea that information cannot be released under such circumstances has become so bred in the bone that they fear for their job&#151;their livelihood&#151;if they release the information. It is easier not to release the information&#151;to play safe&#151;even when justice is clearly denied by so doing. We must get to the bottom of this situation.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51014-25_para19">
<a name="stpa_272">I should be very interested to hear whether the Minister can propose some solutions. I suspect that he may well refer to some Home Office circulars on the subject. I am familiar with them. Home Office 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>14 Oct 2005 : Column 605</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>circular 55/1998, which repeats circular 20/1988, says that the police can release information to the courts in the event of legal proceedings, but those circulars are overridden by the Data Protection Act and, indeed, by the Human Rights Act 1998. Again, they are only advisory, so the guidance can be trumped by all sorts of other laws and legislation.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51014-25_para20">
<a name="stpa_273">We must get this case clarified so that the situation does not continue to arise. I am sure that the Minister will be interested to hear that, since I raised this matter in the national media, I have been inundated from people throughout the land who are in exactly the same position and have found it impossible to seek justice because the police feel that they would break the law by releasing information on whom the criminal was in any instance. Surely, that must be wrong. I call on the Minister to look again at the situation, perhaps to consider amending legislation very much with the idea that it should be formed on the basis of protecting the victims, not of putting the police in the position of defending the criminals.

<p><a name="st_316"><a name="51014-26_spmin0"><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department  (Paul Goggins): </b> 
 I congratulate the hon. Member for Welwyn Hatfield (Grant Shapps) on securing this debate, which it has given him an opportunity to speak about the understandable concerns of his constituent, Mr. Bailey, and a chance for me to explain how the Data Protection Act 1998&nbsp;was applied in this case and to outline the overall policy on police cautions and data protection.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51014-26_para0">
<a name="stpa_274">The offender in this instance was a juvenile, as we have heard, and it might be helpful in setting the context for this case if I say a little about the principles underpinning the youth justice system and the many factors that need to be taken into consideration before determining how best to deal with a young person who has broken the law. Those factors include the circumstances of the offence and the juvenile&#039;s offending history. A young first-time offender with no previous convictions is usually eligible for a reprimand. With a second offence, he can be given a final warning. With a third offence, he is likely to be charged. Of course, depending on the seriousness of the offence, the young person may be finally warned without receiving a reprimand, or even charged without first receiving a reprimand or a warning.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51014-26_para1">
<a name="stpa_275">The system of dealing with young offenders by way of pre-court intervention was established by the Crime and Disorder Act 1998, which made it clear that the main purpose of the youth justice system is to prevent offending by children and young persons. In deciding how to proceed under the scheme, the police are guided by a system drawn up by the Association of Chief Police Officers and the Crown Prosecution Service which classifies offences according to their seriousness, thus helping consistency in decision making.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51014-26_para2">
<a name="stpa_276">I want to make it clear to the House and, in particular, to the hon. Member for Welwyn Hatfield and his constituents that, although the final warning scheme involves a pre-court intervention, it is most certainly not a soft option. To be eligible for the scheme, the young person must first admit guilt, which can be quite a step for a very young person. He must accept personal 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>14 Oct 2005 : Column 606</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>responsibility for what he did. He must know why it was wrong and the effect that it had on the victim. In most cases, he must do all that with his parents present in a meeting run by a police officer. It can, therefore, be a real challenge and it would be wrong to underestimate the impact of this approach. Indeed, in many cases, it is sufficient to prevent further offending, which, as I said earlier, is the main aim of the 1998&nbsp;Act. It provides an opportunity for the young offender to learn from their mistake and gives them an opportunity to keep out of trouble. Of course, if they continue to offend, they will quite rightly be subject to heavier sanctions.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51014-26_para3">
<a name="stpa_277">The reprimand and final warning scheme does not provide for compensation for criminal damage, as a warning is not a criminal conviction. When a criminal conviction is handed down by the courts, the victim is entitled to make a request for compensation and the court can make out a compensation order against the young offender. Section 130(3) of the Powers of Criminal Courts (Sentencing) Act 2000&nbsp;requires the courts to give reasons when they do not make a compensation order in any case where personal loss, damage or injury has resulted from the offence.
</p>








<p><a name="st_317"><a name="51014-26_spnew0"><b> Grant Shapps: </b> 
 This is interesting stuff and, in particular, I understand the Minister&#039;s point about it being a difficult step for a young offender to admit to a crime and to be issued with a warning when their parents are in the room. I do not know whether they were in this case. However, the point does not deal in any way, shape or form with the fundamental point that criminal damage was done and it will cost the victim money to repair it. I note that the Minister has jumped from that missing point to the way in which the courts operate if the case goes to court. I hope that I described in sufficient detail the problem of getting the case to court in the first place. Will he be kind enough to address that point as well?
</p>








<p><a name="st_318"><a name="51014-26_spnew1"><b> Paul Goggins: </b> 
 I am coming on to that, but the hon. Gentleman would expect me to give a full answer to the points that he has raised. I am about to come to the point in my speech where I deal directly with some of the issues that he has raised.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51014-26_para4">
<a name="stpa_278">The hon. Gentleman may ask&#151;indeed, initially Mr Bailey himself may well have asked&#151;how victims are expected to recoup financial compensation from juvenile offenders and their parents or carers when the matter does not come to court. Victims of property crime may look to their own insurance arrangements to make good any losses, but justice demands that, wherever it is appropriate and possible, the offender should make good the damage that has been done.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51014-26_para5">
<a name="stpa_279">This approach is increasingly reflected in the emphasis placed on the use of the restorative approach within pre-court interventions that I have described. In some cases, this can involve acts of reparation and even a face-to-face meeting between the victim and the offender and his parents at which the offender is made to face up to the consequences of his behaviour and to offer an apology.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51014-26_para6">
<a name="stpa_280">Whatever the outcome of criminal proceedings, victims can sue their offenders for damages in the civil courts, although they cannot get compensation twice for the same offence. Of course, the ability of the victim to 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>14 Oct 2005 : Column 607</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>pursue civil action depends on his knowing who the offender is, which brings us to the particular case raised by the hon. Gentleman.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51014-26_para7">
<a name="stpa_281">As we have heard, on 12&nbsp;March this year, a young person was given a reprimand by Hertfordshire police for smashing the rear windscreen of Mr. Bailey&#039;s car while it was parked on the driveway at his home address. In deciding on the appropriate way to deal with this case, the police used the system that I outlined before to take account of the circumstances of the offence and the offender. Of course, it is not for me or for any of us in this place to offer any comment on that decision; it was a decision for the police.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51014-26_para8">
<a name="stpa_282">Mr. Bailey made a written request to Hertfordshire police asking for the details of the offender, information that in law is protected data under the Data Protection Act 1998. At first, the request was refused and, to be fair, the police have a responsibility to satisfy themselves that the information is to be used for an appropriate purpose. The hon. Gentleman acknowledged in his speech that care had to be taken on that issue. From the initial information that the police received, they felt that they could not be absolutely certain that this was the case and so made the decision not to disclose the information to Mr. Bailey.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51014-26_para9">
<a name="stpa_283">In recognition of the fact that Mr. Bailey had a legitimate interest in recovering the cost of repairs to his vehicle, the police wrote to him and informed him that they were prepared to disclose the young offender&#039;s details to his insurance company in accordance with the memorandum of understanding between ACPO and the Association of British Insurers. They anticipated that disclosure to the insurer would provide an adequate solution to the matter. However, at the time of the offence Mr. Bailey&#039;s vehicle was off the road and not insured, so that course of action was simply not available.
</p>








<p><a name="st_319"><a name="51014-26_spnew2"><b> Grant Shapps: </b> 
 It is important not to be disingenuous about the facts of the case, although I appreciate that you will have received a brief from the force involved.
</p>








<p><a name="st_320"><a name="51014-26_spmin1"><b>Mr. Deputy Speaker  (Sir Alan Haselhurst): </b> 
 Order. The Minister will have received a brief, not me.
</p>








<p><a name="st_321"><a name="51014-26_spnew3"><b> Grant Shapps: </b> 
 Indeed. I apologise, Mr. Deputy Speaker.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51014-26_para10">
<a name="stpa_284">The version of the case that the Minister presents is rather sketchy because he has entirely removed several facts: first, my constituent had to write to me; secondly, I then had to approach the police; and, thirdly, the police rejected several further requests to release the evidence, although I would have thought by that stage that it was becoming fairly apparent that it was going to be used for proper reasons, namely, to take the case to a civil court. The case only really started to get moving, with the decision being overturned, when this debate on the Floor of the House was organised. That sparked media interest in the<i> Daily Mail</i> and the <i>Sunday People</i> and on regional television and several radio stations&#151;the Minister will get the message.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51014-26_para11">
<a name="stpa_285">At that point, the police did a quick rethink&#151;perhaps the whole thing escalated, although one does not know&#151;and all of a sudden the information was 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>14 Oct 2005 : Column 608</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>released. I know from further conversations with the police constable, with whom I have every sympathy because he has been placed in a difficult situation, that his problem is one of not contravening the law. It is important to cite all those facts because the Minister is making it sound like one other letter was sent and the whole thing was resolved.
</p>








<p><a name="st_322"><a name="51014-26_spmin2"><b>Mr. Deputy Speaker:</b> 
 Order. It is also important that the hon. Gentleman should not make a second speech.
</p>








<p><a name="st_323"><a name="51014-26_spnew4"><b> Paul Goggins: </b> 
 Thank you, Mr. Deputy Speaker. I ask the hon. Gentleman to show a little patience, because I am about to deal with many of the points that he just made in great detail.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51014-26_para12">
<a name="stpa_286">Let me pick up the story where I left it off, with Mr. Bailey having been refused the information that he had been requesting and it being found that the issue regarding the insurance company was not relevant. Mr. Bailey then repeated his request for the information to be disclosed to him and the police had to decide whether or not to disclose the offender&#039;s details directly to the victim. The police understood that the Data Protection Act 1998&nbsp;allowed the release of information to enable civil proceedings to be taken by Mr. Bailey against the offender. I am assured that they carefully considered the relevant provisions of the Act, but still had some concerns about how the information might be used and remained reluctant to disclose the details requested.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51014-26_para13">
<a name="stpa_287">By late August, Mr. Bailey&#039;s case had received widespread media coverage and, indeed, the hon. Gentleman had secured parliamentary time for today&#039;s debate, as he made clear. To obtain greater clarity on the operation of the Data Protection Act 1998&nbsp;in such a case, Hertfordshire police decided to approach the Information Commissioner, who referred the police to Home Office circulars 20/1988&nbsp;and 55/1998. I am pleased that the hon. Gentleman is familiar with those circulars. I can confirm that I, too, am now familiar with them, thanks to his prompting.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51014-26_para14">
<a name="stpa_288">Circular 20/1988&nbsp;includes at paragraph 8(b) guidance about releasing the name and address of a cautioned offender to the victim for the purpose of instituting civil proceedings. It says:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_43">&quot;The name and address of a cautioned offender should be disclosed if the victim requests it for the purposes of instituting civil proceedings, unless there is good reason to believe that the information might be used for an unlawful or improper purpose e.g. to take retaliatory action against the offender&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="51014-26_para15">
<a name="stpa_289">On 5&nbsp;September, on his return from annual leave, the chief constable of Hertfordshire police was made aware of the situation and, after further consideration, he made a decision to release the information under the provisions of the Data Protection Act 1998&nbsp;to assist the instigation of civil proceedings, provided that Mr. Bailey was prepared to give an undertaking not to use the information for other purposes. The undertaking was duly given and the information was thus released. Although that may have taken a little longer than many might have wished, it was, I think, a very sensible outcome.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51014-26_para16">
<a name="stpa_290">The clear purpose of the law on data protection is, of course, to provide necessary safeguards, and there is, rightly, a presumption against releasing personal data. 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>14 Oct 2005 : Column 609</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>Generally speaking, personal data may be disclosed only with the consent of the data subject. However, as the hon. Gentleman said, there are a number of exemptions to this general principle, which include preventing and detecting crime, and investigating and prosecuting offences or taking civil proceedings.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51014-26_para17">
<a name="stpa_291">It took a long time for Mr. Bailey to receive the information that he had requested. Although I think that the advice of the Information Commissioner and the Home Office circulars are both accurate and adequate, clearly there are lessons to be learned so that decisions in such cases can be concluded more speedily than was the case here. In the end, of course, decisions have to be taken on a case-by-case basis after full consideration of all the circumstances.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51014-26_para18">
<a name="stpa_292">The Data Protection Act 1998&nbsp;should not be seen as a barrier to disclosure. It permits disclosures where they are required for legitimate purposes, but does not permit those which would be an unwarranted invasion of privacy. The Act is complex and requires careful judgements to be made, but the starting point should always be to look for reasons to enable information to be shared rather than blocked.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51014-26_para19">
<a name="stpa_293">The hon. Gentleman will, I am sure, be interested to know that the Department for Constitutional Affairs, working with the office of the Information Commissioner, is planning new ways to promote a better understanding of the law relating to data protection. The

<br>&nbsp;<br>statutory role of publicising and encouraging a proper understanding of and compliance with the Data Protection Act lies with the Information Commissioner, the independent regulator for the Act.

<a name="stpa_294">I understand that the Information Commissioner has already replied to the original press article highlighting Mr Bailey&#039;s case, to correct any misunderstanding of the legal position. The Information Commissioner&#039;s website also contains valuable information on the application of the Act in a wide variety of circumstances.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51014-26_para21">
<a name="stpa_295">In conclusion, the Data Protection Act would therefore in general prevent the disclosure of personal data to a third party only where to do so would in all the circumstances of a particular case be unfair. This judgment must balance the interests of all the parties involved. It does not prevent disclosure of relevant information for legitimate reasons. In the particular case at issue in this debate, the Act actually contains a specific provision which allows disclosure where it is necessary for the purpose of any impending or prospective legal proceedings.
