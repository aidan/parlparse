<a name="stpa_2">The Government want to ensure that there is sufficient time to debate the important issues that arise in the Bill, and we recognise the need to allow adequate time to debate the amendments relating to best interests and advance decisions. That is why we have provided for the debate to last until 3.30&nbsp;pm on all the amendments in the first group. It is also important that we allow time to discuss the other important issues&#151;independent consultees and research. A number of amendments have been tabled on those subjects, which concerned hon. Members on Second Reading and in Committee. I hope the time allocated this afternoon will allow us to debate all the amendments and the technical arrangements in the three groups.

<p><a name="st_53"><a name="41215-02_spnew3"><b> Jim Dobbin: </b> 
 Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41215-02_para1">
<a name="stpa_10">It is important to say at the beginning that there are several very important amendments that colleagues want to discuss, and time is short. It is therefore important that we get on with the debate and reach as many of those amendments as possible.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41215-02_para2">
<a name="stpa_11">Like many hon. Members, I welcome the Bill, which is long overdue and contains many good things that will benefit and protect those in a vulnerable position. As the Minister said, there has been genuine dialogue, which I have been part of, and some welcome changes have been made to the Bill, especially on clause 58, which 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>15 Dec 2004 : Column 1534</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>makes it clear that the Bill does not change the law on murder, manslaughter or assisted suicide. I made that point on Second Reading, and it has been taken up.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41215-02_para3">
<a name="stpa_12">Nevertheless, I still have concerns. One danger that needs to be addressed is that clause 58&nbsp;would inadvertently allow euthanasia by omission. I know that that is not, and never has been, the intention, and that euthanasia forms no part of the Government&#039;s policy. That has been made clear in many statements over the last few years. However, if the wording in this area were strengthened, the danger of euthanasia by omission would be averted.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41215-02_para4">
<a name="stpa_13">Unamended, the Bill would mean that those making proxy decisions to withdraw or to omit medical treatment could commit euthanasia without infringing clause 58. As it stands, if a proxy instructed a doctor to stop life-sustaining treatment, the doctor could do so with impunity because the purpose of his doing so would be to uphold the law which gives enforcement to the proxy&#039;s instructions. Even if the proxy had an unlawful purpose in making a decision to stop life-sustaining treatment, it would not be the proxy&#039;s decision that would cause death, but the doctor&#039;s action in withdrawing the life-sustaining treatment. Many proxies and decision makers would have been persuaded that because of the patient&#039;s feelings and values, death would be in the patient&#039;s best interests. They would argue that the lawful purpose of bringing about death by omission should be pursued. At present, under this jurisdiction only a court makes that decision and it is made only in rare and exceptional circumstances.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41215-02_para5">
<a name="stpa_14">Unfortunately, if unamended, the Bill would allow proxies and decision makers to withhold life-sustaining treatment, including food and fluid, and in numerous circumstances. That would not be a problem if all decision makers and proxies were influenced by the purest motives and sought only the patient&#039;s best interests, but we know that in some cases the motive of proxies may be their own self-interest. What is best for the patient could be replaced by what is best for the proxy. A doctor does not have to challenge the proxy&#039;s decision in court if he or she feels that the withdrawal of life-sustaining treatment is not in the patient&#039;s best interests: who then is going to protect the patient? If we adopt new clause 1, doctors will be able to resist a proxy if they think, in their clinical judgment, that continuing treatment would be in the patient&#039;s best interests.
</p>








<p><a name="st_54"><a name="41215-02_spnew4"><b> Mr. Kevin McNamara  (Hull, North) (Lab):</b> 
 My hon. Friend will be aware of the statement made by the noble Baroness Warnock over the weekend in which she urged people going into homes to consider the financial implications for their relatives. Would not this be the start of a slippery slope towards the impure motives that attorneys or personal representatives might have, and to which my hon. Friend alluded? Did not the Baroness inadvertently do us all a favour by saying what the true interests of many people may be?

 Yes, I heard Baroness Warnock commenting on the matter on television. Those implications are the reason for tabling new clause 1, which would enable doctors to resist a proxy if, in their clinical judgment, they believed that continuing treatment would be in the patient&#039;s best interests. It would also allow doctors to withdraw treatment that is

 There is another aspect to &quot;unreasonably burdensome&quot;. Let us take the case of someone in their last days who is likely to die and finds it uncomfortable to be fed or receive fluids.

It is a declaratory provision and does not create any new criminal offence or civil wrong. If it did, it could be argued that it seeks to overturn the Bland judgment. However, that is not so. It is a declaratory provision that makes it clear that provisions with the purpose of causing death have no place in the Bill. New clause 2 (2) expressly reserves the power of the court to make decisions on withholding or withdrawing life-sustaining treatment, which is an important safeguard against the exercise of unscrupulous motives. We have not tabled new clauses 1&nbsp;and 2&nbsp;because we are vitalists and seek to preserve life at all costs. It is right that we should limit medical care where it will not work, where it is futile or when it is burdensome.

In <i>The Times</i> today, my hon.

 In the cases that the Minister mentioned, where a tumour is at an advanced stage and hydration and nutrition are withdrawn, inevitably, painkilling drugs have to be increased.

 I support new clauses 1&nbsp;and 2. The hon. Member for Heywood and Middleton (Jim Dobbin) has set out a strong, factual case as to why the Government should support our proposal. I shall concentrate on only one thing, because there is a tendency to overcomplicate the issue. This group of amendments is at the heart of our debate today and we should consider whether or not, at the end of it all, we should withdraw food or fluids from people who would otherwise live. That is the critical point. The problem 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>15 Dec 2004 : Column 1538</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>with the Bill is that it would give powerful legal backing to a certain interpretation of living wills. By the way, many Members may not know that a living will does not have to be a written document, and could result from a general conversation while watching a television programme which, like one shown in the United States, graphically depicts what happens to people who are in pain later in life. Someone might say to someone else, &quot;Look, you are going to be my advocate. I do not want to be kept alive unnecessarily, and I do not want medical intervention to keep me alive.&quot; When the individual is incapacitated, their advocate can say that they made it clear that they did not want any medical intervention. However, the individual concerned would not have said that they wanted food and water, the most natural form of treatment, to be withheld. That is at the heart of our proposals which, as the hon. Member for Heywood and Middleton said, do not aim to overturn the Bland judgment.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41215-03_para8">
<a name="stpa_23">To make my position clear, I think that the Bland judgment was wrong. I have tabled amendments proposing that Parliament should make such decisions and not leave them to the courts. Why, after all, are we elected to the House if not to represent the interests of our constituents and make these decisions on their behalf, having discussed the matter with them? However, I am prepared to compromise, and I support new clauses 1&nbsp;and 2, which will not reverse the Bland judgment, much as I would have liked them to do so. They make it clear that we should find in favour of life&#151;that is the critical issue. Some people have asked for a definition of &quot;burdensome&quot;. At the moment, however, the priorities are the other way round, and under the Bill it would be easy to withdraw food and fluids from an individual.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41215-03_para9">
<a name="stpa_24">Doctors and nurses in other parts of the world often disagree with the advocate&#039;s judgment. Some of them say that they can communicate with the individual, but their arguments have failed in court. That is the problem with the Bill, which removes the opportunity to reconsider what happens to a loved one. If the person concerned is conscious, even briefly, it prevents them from making a final judgment. That is the key issue. Many hon. Members on both sides of the House will agree that the hon. Member for Crosby (Mrs. Curtis-Thomas) spoke movingly about her experience when her mother died. If they have not already done so, I recommend that they read her speech, which makes it clear that we should make a judgment in favour of life. If we persistently confuse medical treatment with administering food and water, we will find against life.

 I am listening carefully to what the right hon. Gentleman is saying. He makes the point that he does not agree with the Bland judgment. I agree with it, although, at the other end of the scale, I do not agree, under any circumstances, with euthanasia. He is essentially arguing against Bland, which makes things difficult as it is confusing the issue surrounding new clause 1.

That, in essence, is euthanasia.

<p><a name="st_81"><a name="41215-04_spnew4"><b> Mr. Frank Field: </b> 
 Does the right hon. Gentleman accept that we are not discussing the Bland judgment? That comes later, but it is important to make that clear. My hon.

The vast majority of our constituents do not have living wills in any form, written or unwritten.

There is a case for debating that issue in respect of living wills and for honestly debating euthanasia, but there is no case for having euthanasia by the back door&#151;withdrawing food and liquids from people when we are professing to do something else.

 I agree: that is where we are and what I began with in speaking in support of the new clause. I genuinely cannot understand why any Member of the House would not support the new clause, because as has just been made clear and as I made clear earlier, this does not deal with the Bland judgment. It would 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>15 Dec 2004 : Column 1540</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>make it clear, should these issues go to court, that the favour rests on whether a treatment is worth while. That is what the two new clauses address and I do not consider this such a radical move. It would be a fair decision that took into consideration concerns that the Minister raised in Committee, I gather, and on Second Reading. It would do no Member any harm to vote for the new clause, because it would help to reshape the Bill with regard to the issues that all those charities referred to.

<p><a name="st_84"><a name="41215-04_spnew7"><b> Mr. Duncan Smith: </b> 
 I can give the hon. Gentleman the assurance of a non-lawyer and of someone who, I hope, comes to the House with a certain amount of common sense. These new clauses were drafted so that that could not happen. If the Government think that areas of the new clauses would cause a problem, please come forward and help us to redraft them. Let us do that right now and vote on them, but they will not do that, as they seem almost scared stiff of any amendment to the Bill. We heard from the right hon. Member for Manchester, Gorton (Sir Gerald Kaufman), who said that Members of the House were all promised that amendments would be tabled. No such serious amendments have been tabled. The reason is that the Government do not want this area to be dealt with at all.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41215-04_para3">
<a name="stpa_28">I simply say to hon. and right hon. Members in all parts of the House that we have in front of us today a very serious question: do we make a presumption for life or a presumption that, in some circumstances an individual may have their life ended, and assisted to be ended, by doctors and others who might be against such a presumption for life?
</p>








<p><a name="st_85"><a name="41215-04_spnew8"><b> Mr. Lammy: </b> 
 The right hon. Gentleman frames his contribution around the advance decision as it pertains to new clause 1. Does he accept that the advance decision is exceptional in the Bill, as most of it concerns best interests? In dealing with the individual&#039;s right when he has capacity to say, &quot;One day, when I no longer have capacity, I do not want this kind of treatment,&quot; we are not dealing with best interests in that regard. Also, quite rightly, we say at clause 25(5) that the person should be specific when life-sustaining treatment is involved. That is an important hurdle and something that we should all take seriously.

<p><a name="st_86"><a name="41215-04_spnew9"><b> Mr. Duncan Smith: </b> 
 So presumably, the Minister is going to move an amendment that will result in all these living wills being written down and legally checked. Is he going to move such an amendment right now?

Of course not. The Minister knows very well that, as the hon. Member for Crosby said, people change their minds. We know that most people who attempt suicide do not want to die. That is the reality. Many such people have said it subsequently&#151;they changed their mind. The Bill does not allow for that, which is the key issue.

To be fair and honest, it is not reasonable to say that those qualities exist on one side of the argument but not on the other. Everybody is struggling to find a way through these difficult issues. In the course of trying to arrive at a form of words that makes some kind of sense, I sat through almost all of the Standing Committee, and consulted the British Medical Association and as many of the faiths groups as I could&#151;some chose not to respond, for whatever reason&#151;and I feel that there is a genuine wish in the House and elsewhere to arrive at a decent, straightforward conclusion that reflects in the best way possible the many circumstances in which the provisions will have to be applied.

 Does my hon. Friend accept that many of us could vote for his new clause but also for the others? He is dealing with an immensely important area that strengthens the role of the doctor. He will know that one of our most distinguished doctors, Professor Tallis, has written that he has undertaken treatment when he believed that he should not do so, because, like all other doctors, he was scared of what the relatives would do to him in the courts. The new clause strengthens the hand of doctors in saying that treatment is not right at such a stage, and it is therefore fair for some of us to support him in the Lobby on his new clause while also voting for the other new clauses that are down for discussion.

I am confident that he has the intellectual capacity to work out his own position. What I would say, however, is that there is some merit in his argument. Earlier, we both took part in a Merseyside radio programme&#151;we were not on the same programme simultaneously, but I had the benefit of hearing his contribution&#151;and he made that point then. The climate is difficult, and we live in what people have referred to as a compensation culture. His concern is genuine and I am

<a name="stpa_41">I have been trying for some time to make one or two general points about the amendment and the new clause before moving on to the more detailed argument. When I tabled the amendment, I was deeply conscious that I risked offending Members who have the same broad objectives as me, but wish to arrive at the same conclusion by a different route. To an extent, that risk has already been evident. I can only say that I recognise the absolute sincerity that those Members have brought to the debate, and hope they recognise that I am equally sincere. My disagreement with them relates not to their sincerity or objectives, but to how we can get to the best possible place. I believe that most Members, and most of the general public, want to get to the same place. The choice between the new clauses and amendments we are discussing is about how we get there. It is not that we want to be in different places; it is a question of which route we take.

That has given me insight into the need for the language of legislation to be kept simple, and the need always to be alert to the 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>15 Dec 2004 : Column 1546</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>fact that the more words we apply to complex moral issues such as this, the more the meaning of those words and the intention behind them can cause confusion and lead to misinterpretation. For those reasons, as I said earlier, I have gone to a great deal of trouble to consult those who take a strong interest in this matter, in the House and elsewhere. That includes my hon. Friend the Minister.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41215-06_para4">
<a name="stpa_43">I do not claim that the wording of amendment No. 2&nbsp;and new clause 4&nbsp;is perfect as it stands, but I believe it serves the objectives that I mentioned a moment ago. In what I considered a thoughtful speech, the right hon. Member for Chingford and Woodford Green said that he wanted to apply a simple test&#151;to find in favour of life. I do not think that I have misquoted him. That is why, in amendment No. 2, I refer in terms to that very issue. The presumption in the amendment is that it is in a person&#039;s interests to stay alive&#151;to be alive&#151;rather than the alternative.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41215-06_para5">
<a name="stpa_44">I made the wording simple because I think it carries the spirit of the Bill with it. It adds a qualification to the &quot;best interests&quot; referred to in clause 1(5). In other words, it is in the patient&#039;s best interests, in most circumstances, to stay alive. In my view, that gives a strong and clear signal to medical practitioners, and anyone appointed to act as a proxy or advocate, without giving them a set of instructions that in many cases they might be obliged to follow, even though they would not add to the comfort or dignity of the patient. Indeed, there will be cases in which the opposite will be the case.

 As was made clear at the start of the debate, a key issue is the ability of some advance decisions to be flexible. Does it worry my hon. Friend that, in taking account of what the best interests of a patient might be, doctors and medical authorities might place too much emphasis on what might or might not have been said by that patient five or 10&nbsp;years earlier? We have all heard the eloquent description given by my hon. Friend the Member for Crosby (Mrs. Curtis-Thomas) of the case of her mother, which is a classic illustration of why it is important to preserve flexibility. Does my hon. Friend feel that the wording of his amendment would allow doctors to make their decisions largely on the basis of the physical state of the person before them, rather than on what they might have said five or 10&nbsp;years earlier?

 This is a hugely complicated area, and I hope that so far I have avoided trying to score points or to make party political or other arguments. The reality is that the circumstances that my hon. Friend describes&#151;and which were indeed described eloquently on a previous occasion by my hon. Friend the Member for Crosby (Mrs. Curtis-Thomas)&#151;will not always be as simple as he suggests. There might be an advance directive or a living will that makes clear the person&#039;s wishes in terms that are appropriate in those circumstances. Most such cases could be dealt with, but it may well be that somebody has made an advance directive that does not take account of their current circumstances. Such cases will prove a struggle, and there is no way of avoiding that. There is the question of what is in the person&#039;s best interest medically, and the proxy&#039;s view as to what is in their best interest. Both will have to be taken into account.

</p>

<p>
<a name="41215-06_para7">
<a name="stpa_46">One of the strengths of the debate surrounding this issue has been the personal examples on which many people have been able to draw, not the least of which are the experiences that my hon. Friend the Member for Crosby described on Second Reading. Such experiences are difficult and emotionally wrought, and they have added to our understanding of what can go wrong, as well as what can go right. But we need to be conscious of the fact that it is very difficult to arrive at a general legislative proposition from particular examples. In fact, because each case is unique, it would be wrong to create a single template to govern an infinite variety of individual circumstances, and my fear is&#151;I say this in as friendly a way as possible&#151;that new clauses 1&nbsp;and 2&nbsp;do exactly that. They establish a set of instructions for people to follow in these very difficult circumstances. As the adage has it, hard cases make bad law.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41215-06_para8">
<a name="stpa_47">It was the hon. Member for Tiverton and Honiton who caused me to think further about this issue. Initially, I held the view that the &quot;best interest&quot; test, which first appears in clause 1(5) and subsequently in clause 4, was the right approach, in that it was sufficiently straightforward but also allowed adequate discretion as to what was appropriate in each individual case. However, the hon. Lady pointed out that in cases where hydration might not be appropriate, it could still be extremely uncomfortable for a patient to be left with a dry mouth, for example. Moreover, since such patients would probably be unable to communicate their discomfort, in many cases their need could be left unmet, either through lack of awareness&#151;that is always a possibility in a busy hospital ward&#151;or neglect, which is also possible. It was that concern that set me on this course.

 I am very grateful to the hon. Gentleman, who has made great efforts to simplify this issue. My only criticism of his amendment is that it asks the House to judge whether a person&#039;s life is worth while or otherwise; in my view, the issue should be not that, but treatment. He cites the BMA in respect of basic care, but he has not dealt with the issue, raised by my right hon. Friend the Member for Chingford and Woodford Green (Mr. Duncan Smith), of withdrawal of hydration and nutrition in palliative care. We call such care basic care. Does the hon.

 In the overwhelming majority of cases, the point made by the hon. Lady and the right hon. Member for Chingford and Woodford Green will apply, but as I have said, every case is unique. As the Minister made clear in an intervention, in some circumstances and in respect of some conditions, hydration and sustenance, far from helping, would actually make matters worse. I do not want to leave scope for any misinterpretation in that regard. Basic care is one thing; hydration and sustenance is another. In the overwhelming majority of cases, they will be the same thing, but in some circumstances they might not be. I want to make it clear that even in cases where hydration is inappropriate, it is not appropriate to leave somebody with a dry mouth, for example. That would be very uncomfortable for them, and it would make the dignity and comfort of their last hours worse, rather than better. Let the House be in no doubt about that.

I do not know what the Minister&#039;s response to it will be, but it is a genuine effort to retain the sentiment behind clause 4&nbsp;without allowing it to be read as a set of instructions in every circumstance, which would be a mistake. That is the intention behind our provision, and if the Minister can satisfy me on this point I will be very happy indeed.

It accepts that sustenance and liquid will normally be made available, but by stating the principle in simple terms, it allows for cases where doing so is undesirable and not in the patient&#039;s best interests. To put it starkly, I believe that it avoids setting up a practice that too often leads, albeit unintentionally, to people being attached to tubes or subjected to other invasive procedures to no useful purpose, with all the attendant discomfort and indignity caused to people in their final hours.

 I am most grateful. The hon. Gentleman cited what the Catholic bishops said. However, they also said that although clause 58&nbsp;could not be correctly described as introducing a permission for euthanasia, which would have meant opposition for that reason, it still had two serious and remediable weaknesses. They said that, unless the weaknesses were addressed, the Bill could still unintentionally become a vehicle for euthanasia by omission or withdrawal of medical treatment.
</p>








<p><a name="st_124"><a name="41215-07_spnew8"><b> Mr. Burstow: </b> 
 The hon. Gentleman is right. That is why, in Committee, I tabled an amendment that was not dissimilar to the new clauses before the House today. It posed the question of the central purpose behind the action. Is it to hasten a person&#039;s death or is it to palliate and provide care, comfort and support? That is central to today&#039;s debate and I am clear in my personal view that the new clauses provide the additional reassurance that both the Church of England and the Catholic bishops conference are seeking from the House today. That is why I started my remarks by observing that they have been assured on certain points, but the hon. Gentleman is quite right to draw attention to the fact that some further matters remain before the House today.

<a name="41215-07_para7">
<a name="stpa_56">As I was saying, the Bill is about giving people who lack capacity more control over the way they live their day-to-day lives. Understandably, our debate is focusing on end-of-life decision making, but the bulk of the Bill is about the millions of people in this country who lack capacity to take decisions and it provides a proper framework in which they can take more 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>15 Dec 2004 : Column 1550</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>decisions and exert more control over their own lives. It is about decisions as simple as what people eat, what they wear, when they go out and when they go to bed; everyday decisions that we in the House and many of our fellow citizens take for granted.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41215-07_para8">
<a name="stpa_57">The central purpose of the Bill is to maximise the opportunities for people to take such decisions for themselves. It enshrines in law a new starting point&#151;a presumption of capacity&#151;and only when it is proven that capacity is lacking can someone else start to take proxy decisions. Those outside the House who want to portray the Bill as somehow having an evil intention are doing a disservice to millions of our fellow citizens who will benefit from it. That, as well as the concerns of the Catholic bishops and others, needs to be put on the record.

 Is the hon. Gentleman aware of research showing that when a person is appointed a proxy or attorney&#151;whatever one calls it&#151;in many cases they do not always carry out the wishes of the person who gave them that power?
</p>








<p><a name="st_126"><a name="41215-08_spnew1"><b> Mr. Burstow: </b> 
 That is the sort of evidence that led me to draft my amendment before the House today. It is all 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>15 Dec 2004 : Column 1551</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>about ensuring that a person who lacks capacity is treated no less favourably than a person who has capacity.

<p><a name="st_127"><a name="41215-08_spnew2"><b> Mr. Tim Boswell  (Daventry) (Con):</b> 
 I have considerable sympathy with the hon. Gentleman&#039;s amendment. In cases of persons with learning disabilities, does he agree that there is a sad history of second-rate medical treatment&#151;physical as well as in relation to their specific mental disability&#151;because some members of the medical profession still somehow feel that they are less important priorities for treatment?
</p>








<p><a name="st_128"><a name="41215-08_spnew3"><b> Mr. Burstow: </b> 
 I am coming on to an example that addresses precisely that point. Sadly, that is what anecdotal, and some research, evidence suggests, so if we are putting in place statutory safeguards and arrangements for proxy decision-making, we must try to ensure that we avoid those pitfalls in future. That is what my amendment is designed to do. We should never make the assumption that life has less value for people who have difficulty in making decisions or need support to do so or who may not be able to make them at all. The adoption of the new principle would further increase confidence in the operation of the Bill.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41215-08_para0">
<a name="stpa_61">The amendment stems from evidence that has already been referred to and from anecdotal and other evidence that prejudices and attitudes about the quality of life of people with serious learning disabilities, serious mental health problems, head injuries or other conditions that affect capacity can get in the way of supporting those people as they are in respect of what they want and need. For example, decisions about treatment for elderly people or those with severe learning disabilities who lack capacity can sometimes be made by professionals on the basis that their lives are of less value than that of a much younger person.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41215-08_para1">
<a name="stpa_62">In other words, the date of a person&#039;s birth can determine access to treatment in a most unsatisfactory and inappropriate way. Such decisions can also be taken in a perfunctory way when it comes to consultation with families. There have been examples of families coming to visit an elderly relative in hospital to find a &quot;do not resuscitate&quot; notice hanging on the end of the person&#039;s bed without any proper dialogue with relatives or the individual in the bed about whether that was wanted. Amendment No. 46, therefore, will also complement families&#039; new legal right to be consulted about the care and treatment provided to a relative who lacks capacity.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41215-08_para2">
<a name="stpa_63">In Committee, I raised a similar problem with the Minister, who argued that the Disability Discrimination Act 1995&nbsp;and the Disability Discrimination Bill currently going through the House would provide protection for decisions and actions taken under this Bill. That may be so in many situations, but there are concerns that the Disability Discrimination Bill excludes a significant number of people who lack capacity. In particular, the requirement that a disability must have a long-term effect&#151;and &quot;long-term&quot; is defined as a period of at least 12&nbsp;months&#151;will mean the people who lack capacity because of an illness or injury for less than 12&nbsp;months will not be covered by the discrimination legislation currently going through the House.


<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>15 Dec 2004 : Column 1552</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>

<p>
<a name="41215-08_para3">
<a name="stpa_64">The Minister may say that such matters should be dealt with in the discrimination legislation, but I want to give the House an example. An older person who has an accident and loses capacity temporarily, but who is likely to recover, will still need professionals to make decisions on his or her behalf. Without the new clause as amended, there would be no protection for that person against prejudicial decisions based on age alone, especially if the person involved had no relatives to make representations. If the Bill makes no reference to discrimination legislation, it will create a lack of clarity for medical professionals and others about whether they are behaving in a lawful way.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41215-08_para4">
<a name="stpa_65">In the end, the courts will have to make decisions about the interface between this Bill and the Disability Discrimination Act 1995. Amendment No. 46&nbsp;would close that gap and ensure that people are treated with equal consideration, regardless of capacity.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41215-08_para5">
<a name="stpa_66">I turn now to new clauses 1&nbsp;and 2. The latest briefing from the Catholic bishops conference makes some important points. It states:
</p>

<p>
<a name="41215-08_para6">
<a name="stpa_67">

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_8">&quot;It is both moral and legal to withhold treatment when it is judged that the treatment, even if necessary to sustain a patient&#039;s life, is not in the patient&#039;s best interests because, given the patient&#039;s condition, the burdens it imposes are excessive compared with the benefits it offers&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. It is not true that life must be sustained at all costs&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. One can legitimately choose to forgo or withhold treatment because its burdensomeness is disproportionate to any likely benefit from it. One can do so even though one is sure that without it death will come soon, or come sooner.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="41215-08_para7">
<a name="stpa_68">The new clauses recognise that reality. They accept that the courts still have jurisdiction in terms of making decisions. As the right hon. Member for Chingford and Woodford Green said, they do not change the Bland judgment, but they do prevent that judgment from being extended by means of a statutory provision. The focus should be on whether the treatment is beneficial or burdensome, and the aim is not to keep a person alive at all costs. Hon. Members noted earlier that we should not strive officiously to keep people alive and, ultimately, such matters must be settled in the courts.

 Does my hon. Friend agree that one virtue of new clauses 1&nbsp;and 2&nbsp;is that they are highly specific? I have some sympathy for amendment No. 2, tabled by the hon.

</p>








<p><a name="st_130"><a name="41215-08_spnew5"><b> Mr. Burstow: </b> 
 One concern mentioned in the briefings is that focusing on quality of life, and on whether a person&#039;s life is worthwhile, causes us to miss the point. We should ask, &quot;Is this treatment worthwhile?&quot; That is why I shall not support the amendment tabled by the hon. Member for Knowsley, North and Sefton, East even though I know that it is well intentioned and attempts to bridge gaps.

 My hon. Friend and I seem to be conducting a dialogue through the hon. Member for Knowsley, North and Sefton, East), but I wanted to point out that, if the hon.

<p>
<a name="41215-08_para8">
<a name="stpa_69">Earlier, the Minister referred to certain forms of tumour that can grow larger as a result of continued hydration and nutrition. However, surely a court would decide that to withdraw treatment in those circumstances was to confer a benefit, as that would slow the progress of the condition and thus reduce the likelihood that the person involved would die sooner. That seems to be the debate that we are trying to have.
</p>








<p><a name="st_137"><a name="41215-08_spnew12"><b> Mr. Lammy: </b> 
 How is the benefit conferred by the amendment? We have all been working to ensure that no one can cause death, but the amendment as drafted deals with what is burdensome, and with a situation in which a person is unconscious. The Government have spoken to the medical professionals about the circumstances of people with cancer, because we are in sympathy with the aims of the amendment. They have told us that ANH might hasten death, but that that is not covered by the amendment as drafted.
</p>








<p><a name="st_138"><a name="41215-08_spnew13"><b> Mr. Burstow: </b> 
 The Government have considerable resources when it comes to drafting. The Catholic bishops have been very engaged with the Government, and very positive about their desire for dialogue. Today&#039;s debate is an opportunity to move that dialogue forward. If the Minister is able to reply to the debate by saying that he is seriously willing to enter into further dialogue with the aim of devising an amendment that would achieve a closing of the gap that has been described, that would be fine and wonderful.

<p><a name="st_141"><a name="41215-09_spnew2"><b> Mrs. Browning: </b> 
 I want to have a go at trying to persuade the hon. Gentleman to vote for amendment 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>15 Dec 2004 : Column 1554</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>No. 2, which deals with the principle of the matter. The Bill talks about many ways in which life can end, and it is always difficult to address such matters adequately, but the principle behind amendment No. 2&nbsp;is that it is in a person&#039;s best interest for life to continue. That may be for only a short while, or in circumstances in which invasive treatment cannot be considered, but surely the principle that life must continue must be placed on the face of the Bill. If not, the Bill will be specifically about ending life, and it should not be about that.
</p>








<p><a name="st_142"><a name="41215-09_spnew3"><b> Mr. Burstow: </b> 
 No, it should not. I am still uneasy about the interaction between the drafting of amendment No. 2&nbsp;and the new clause. The danger is that the Bill may be tilted towards asking whether a person&#039;s life has worth and so is worth saving. A better question is, &quot;Is this treatment worthwhile and beneficial?&quot; My amendment would try to change the presumption.
</p>








<p><a name="st_143"><a name="41215-09_spnew4"><b> Mr. George Howarth: </b> 
 Will the hon. Gentleman give way?
</p>








<p><a name="st_144"><a name="41215-09_spnew5"><b> Mr. Burstow: </b> 
 The hon. Gentleman said earlier that many hon. Members wish to speak, and I do want to make some progress, but I will let him intervene.
</p>








<p><a name="st_145"><a name="41215-09_spnew6"><b> Mr. Howarth: </b> 
 I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for giving way, but I think that he is misrepresenting amendment No. 2. The presumption in the amendment is not that it is the quality of a person&#039;s life that should be judged. It is simply that it is better for a life to continue than not to continue. Questions of quality have to do with what is appropriate in the period between a decision being made and the end of that person&#039;s life. As the hon. Member for Tiverton and Honiton (Mrs. Browning) said, that will vary in every case.
</p>








<p><a name="st_146"><a name="41215-09_spnew7"><b> Mr. Burstow: </b> 
 My anxiety is made worse by the fact that an amendment proposed to amendment No. 2&nbsp;would delete the word &quot;best&quot;, and water down the original in other ways. I accept that that is not the hon. Gentleman&#039;s doing, but that is the proposition before us today, and it gives rise to further concern.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41215-09_para0">
<a name="stpa_70">The amendments that I support are about clarity and reassurance. They are about ensuring that we are focused on treatment that is beneficial, not burdensome. We must make it clear that the courts still have jurisdiction in such decisions. Those amendments will be the subject of a free vote, but amendment No. 46&nbsp;is about ensuring that regardless of whether someone retains capacity, he or she is treated in an equal fashion and is not the subject of prejudice, or bogus assumptions that lead to inappropriate treatment. That is the key to amendment No. 46&nbsp;and I look forward to the Minister&#039;s response to it.

 I speak in support of amendment No. 32, in my name and that of other right hon. and hon. Members. The amendment has the clear aim of removing advance directives, or living wills, from the Bill. I should say at the start that I do not belong to any pro-life organisations and I do not practise any religion actively, so I am not under any pressure from that direction. I am disappointed that we can have a free vote 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>15 Dec 2004 : Column 1555</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>on beginning-of-life issues, but not on end-of-life issues. I would have preferred it if Labour Members had a free vote on this issue.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41215-09_para1">
<a name="stpa_71">I remind the Government that 102&nbsp;Members of Parliament have signed early-day motion 336, which recognises that there is a problem with this Bill. I cannot vote for advance directives&#151;sometimes ironically called living wills&#151;to become part of our statute law, because they have always been abhorrent to me. However, to those who believe in them, I say that I have no objection to people making living wills provided that they remain in common law and are not enshrined in this Bill.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41215-09_para2">
<a name="stpa_72">I shall explain why I cannot vote to include advance directives in the Bill. First, we had a considerable debate on living wills when similar legislation passed through the Scottish Parliament. That resulted in the Adults with Incapacity (Scotland) Act 2000. The debate there resulted in similar clauses to those we are discussing being removed from the Scottish legislation. That is a significant point that we should remember. Secondly, the House of Lords Select Committee on Medical Ethics recommended in 1994&nbsp;that advance directives should never be legally binding, as is proposed this afternoon. In paragraph 264&nbsp;of its report, the Committee stated:
</p>

<p>
<a name="41215-09_para3">
<a name="stpa_73">

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_9">&quot;We suggest that it could well be impossible to give Advanced Directives in general greater legal force without depriving patients of the benefit of the doctor&#039;s professional expertise and of new treatments and procedures which may become available since the Advanced Directive was signed.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="41215-09_para4">
<a name="stpa_74">The rest of the report contained similar comments.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41215-09_para5">
<a name="stpa_75">Thirdly, there is the uncertainty cast on advance directives by the recent challenge to them by Leslie Burke of Lancaster. The General Medical Council has appealed that decision and Parliament is awaiting the result, but it is pertinent to the decision that we will take this afternoon. Leslie Burke made the point that advance directives are very negative. One can ask the doctor not to do things, but one cannot ask the doctor to do things. That is the challenge by Leslie Burke and it is pertinent to our vote today. I cannot vote for advance directives when I do not know the result of that appeal.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41215-09_para6">
<a name="stpa_76">Fourthly and significantly, the 23rd report of Session 2003&#150;04&nbsp;from the Joint House of Commons and House of Lords Committee on Human Rights, published as recently as 29&nbsp;November, casts serious doubts on the Government&#039;s assertion that the Bill is compatible with human rights legislation. The Joint Committee believes that the Bill raises serious human rights concerns, which include putting advance directives in the Bill. It was not that long ago that the Government were against including advance directives in statute law. Why have the Government done a U-turn on that?
</p>

<p>
<a name="41215-09_para7">
<a name="stpa_77">I accept the good intentions of the Government in introducing the Bill that has had a long gestation&#151;about 15&nbsp;years, in fact&#151;and I am only sorry that the Bill has been spoiled by the failure to listen to its opponents. I am very disappointed that it came out of Committee unamended. Not a single principal amendment was accepted in the course of a fairly long Committee stage, and that concerns me.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41215-09_para8">
<a name="stpa_78">My fifth point is my real message: it is not what is in the Bill that counts, nor even what is left out of the Bill, but the signal that the Bill sends. I shall explain that by

They were launched in the United States of America in 1969&nbsp;in a law journal article entitled,&quot;Due Process of Euthanasia: The Living Will, a Proposal&quot;. That is the paper from which the subject of our debate arose. In 1977, a US health department official, Robert Derzon, advised President Carter to

<a name="41215-09_para12">
<a name="stpa_82">In 1991, the US Government made it compulsory for all patients admitted to a hospital, for whatever reason, to be presented with living will forms to complete. We might argue that that could never happen here. Well, it just has. In 2003, the Hammersmith Hospitals NHS Trust decided that it would offer living wills to all those admitted. It was followed by Imperial college hospital. Will that bandwagon roll further? Will the Government allow the NHS to give everyone admitted to hospital a living will? If someone is given a living will on entry to hospital, it puts them under pressure at a time when they are already sick and possibly depressed. What a time to give people a living will&#151;as they are admitted to hospital. I condemn Hammersmith Hospitals NHS Trust and Imperial college hospital for that.
</p>








<p><a name="st_148"><a name="41215-09_spnew9"><b> Mrs. Browning: </b> 
 Given that the Bill is about people who lack capacity and would be unable, therefore, to fill in such a living will, should a relative be able to fill in the form for them?

 I do not know what Hammersmith Hospitals NHS Trust has in mind. I do not know the details of its agreement. However, I would be worried about it whether or not a relative filled it in. I am against the principle, which comes from the US.

<p>
<a name="41215-09_para13">
<a name="stpa_83">Is it any wonder that some of us link the Bill to euthanasia? In fact, the Voluntary Euthanasia Society and other organisations appear to be behind the move to enshrine advance directives in the Bill. If they are successful this afternoon, they will get a signal that the bandwagon is beginning to roll. There have been three attempts, including this one, by people such as Lord Joffe, to bring assisted suicide or voluntary euthanasia before Parliament. This Bill sends out the signal that the Government might&#151;I emphasise the word &quot;might&quot;&#151;be willing to listen to those people at some time in the future.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41215-09_para14">
<a name="stpa_84">Let us be fair to the Voluntary Euthanasia Society&#151;it is, after all, one of the main propagators of living wills: its path is clear and if we do not know that, or cannot understand it, we should. Its path is to bring assisted suicide, or voluntary euthanasia, to this country, as has happened in the Netherlands, Belgium, Oregon and elsewhere. I am against that.

<a name="stpa_85">The bioethicists march on. In a leading article, published in 1997&nbsp;in the &quot;Hastings Center Report&quot;, one of the pre-eminent journals on bioethics, Professor John Hardwig argued that there was a duty to die and published criteria to help people make that decision. I am horrified that in the <i>Daily Mail</i> this week, Baroness Warnock told the elderly something similar, under the headline, &quot;Kill yourself, so you won&#039;t be a burden&quot;.

<a name="stpa_86">People can change their mind. My hon. Friend the Member for Crosby (Mrs. Curtis-Thomas) gave us an example when she talked of her mother. The respected journalist Claire Rayner signed a living will. Unfortunately, she had to go into intensive care where doctors could twice have switched off her life, but her relatives were not happy about it. I do not think that the doctors were happy either, but at the time living wills came under common law&#151;not statute law. She survived and the first thing she did when she came out of hospital was to tear up her living will.

<a name="stpa_87">At a conference in Holland in 1990, right to die groups pushed a pamphlet on living wills; on the back was the heading, &quot;The Living Will: Passport to Euthanasia&quot;. If Members do not believe that people who push living wills will not be pushing assisted suicide or voluntary euthanasia next, they are living in cloud cuckoo land. That is why I am so against enshrining living wills in the Bill, and that is why I shall vote against it today, good as other parts of it are.
</p>

<a name="41215-09_para18">
<a name="stpa_88">At a meeting of the education council of the Euthanasia Society of America, a new document was proposed, whose stated purpose was to provoke a gradual change&#151;a gradual change&#151;in public attitudes to euthanasia. The author of the document also made a link between living wills and euthanasia. That is why some of us&#151;perhaps only a minority&#151;link the application of living wills under the Bill to euthanasia by omission, if not by commission. People who sign advance directives are usually convinced that they are taking greater control of their life, whereas in fact they may be giving up control of their life. That is one of the dangers.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41215-09_para19">
<a name="stpa_89">The concept behind an advance directive must surely be that the patient be allowed to die with dignity and in the absence of pain, yet by refusing some medical treatments the patient could suffer a lengthy, painful and bedridden existence, simply because they wanted doctors to carry out an advance directive.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41215-09_para20">
<a name="stpa_90">I am also concerned about the pressure that such provisions would put on the health service. The Minister wants people to obtain advice from their doctors, but are not general practitioners already hard pressed? How would such provisions operate in a hospital, especially in an accident and emergency department? How much bureaucracy will they pile on the NHS? If living wills are accepted in the Bill, more people will think, &quot;They&#039;re a good thing, I&#039;ll make one, too.&quot; Relatives will start to talk. The whole process will gain momentum&#151;the very thing the Voluntary Euthanasia Society wants. The more of them that are written, the more bureaucracy will be piled on the NHS. That is another reason why I am against enshrining advance directives in the Bill.

<a name="stpa_91">I am concerned that we are developing negative attitudes in our health care and social care systems.

We should rejoice that people have had a good life and help them to die in dignity. We should promote palliative care and hospices. We should fund children&#039;s hospices properly.

 Does my hon. Friend agree that there are currently three positions on this matter? He makes a strong and impassioned case for altogether abandoning living wills and advance decisions. Under common law, people can seek to make living wills. People with Alzheimer&#039;s want to be able to say, &quot;This is what I want to happen to me when my mental faculties go completely&quot;&#151;which is why the society supports the provision&#151;and that is what they tell their loved ones. We either abandon living wills altogether, as my hon. Friend says, or we seek to make them safer and stronger so that the clinicians who have to apply them can do so in the right circumstances. In essence, that is the situation that we are debating.

 I never said that we should abandon living wills altogether.

 I support new clauses 1&nbsp;and 2. Neither has been proposed because we, on our side of the argument, are vitalists who seek to preserve life at all costs. It is right that we must limit medical care where it will not work, where it is futile or burdensome, and that is done regularly in clinical practice. However, that is a different matter entirely from requiring, as the Bill would in certain circumstances, that treatment and/or assisted food and fluids be withheld or withdrawn from non-dying patients. The question should always be: is this treatment worth while? It should not be: is this patient&#039;s life worth while? That is why I cannot support amendment No. 2, tabled by the hon.

 If I were to follow what the hon. Gentleman says, I think that I would make things even more complicated. I have no desire to do that because I am trying to stick to the simple issues that have emerged after long discussions and on which I have received many representations from my constituents.

<a name="41215-12_para5">
<a name="stpa_126">I plead with my hon. Friend the Minister to offer much more clarity on the two issues that I have raised than has been the case so far. Incidentally, I do not agree with my right hon. Friend the Member for Manchester, Gorton (Sir Gerald Kaufman) because I think that Ministers acted before the Committee with great courtesy. Clearly, however, they are carrying out whatever Government directive has been given to them, although I know that they will take on board the strong views expressed by hon. Members on both sides of the House.

<p>
<a name="41215-12_para6">
<a name="stpa_127">The scrutiny of the Joint Committee has helped our considerations. The Committee was headed by Lord Carter, who is a fine person, and was made up of Members of the Lords and Commons. On the Committee&#039;s advice, a clause to exclude euthanasia was included in the Bill. I accept that, but why then are people including representatives of the Church of England and the Catholic Church&#151;until we receive an explanation about the archbishop&#039;s letter&#151;still pressing for the clarification that I am seeking? I suggest that it is because they think that they have not received answers to the two simple questions that I posed. I also suggest that they rightly have it in mind that the Bill deals with a special group of people. All individuals in the group have a right to life, but nevertheless experience limited capacity. For that reason, they are entitled to even more protection from the House in our legislation than might otherwise be the case, and I hope that we will decide to give them that following today&#039;s deliberations.

Only last week I met a constituent in the House of Commons who had been in a coma for a year following a vehicle accident. His parents had been asked whether they agreed to the withdrawal of his hydration and nutrition. They said no, and five years later that young man is running his own business in Salisbury.

<a name="stpa_128">Fortunately death is no longer a taboo in this country, and we have heard moving personal testimonies to that today. Our personal experiences always colour the way in which we think about such matters and no doubt the way we vote. I am no exception to that. I recall having to make a life-and-death decision about my baby son while my wife was under sedation&#151;that was one of the loneliest decisions I ever had to make, although I am confident that I made the right one. Many of us have seen our parents dying, and I saw my dear sister-in-law dying from motor neurone disease, so I have my own opinions, just as I have my own faith to cope with that. However, what about the views of others? We must all have been influenced by the views of charities, the Making Decisions Alliance and other people and organisations who have been in touch with us.

<a name="41215-12_para8">
<a name="stpa_129">I shall vote to give the Bill its Third Reading, but first, on behalf of my constituents, I want to try even at this late stage to improve it. We in Salisbury are fortunate to have the Salisbury hospice care trust, which is made up of a group of dedicated professionals and clinicians who are held in the warmest esteem throughout our community. Indeed, I think that they are part of our extended family in Salisbury. I held conversations only this morning with several retired professionals who had worked in palliative care. I also asked a practising sister on the ward and a consultant in palliative care for their views this morning. Perhaps the views of such people have not been heard to a great extent&#151;they have certainly not been heard so far in this debate. The doctor said that advance directives were helpful because, as he put it, they help professionals to know what makes a patient tick. Forward care planning is seen as a good thing from a clinical point of view because it opens up lines of communication that would otherwise not exist. However, there is great concern about the validity of advance directives that were made 20&nbsp;or 30&#151;or even five&#151;years previously. We need solutions to the problems that patients will face as they come closer to death.

We do not need bioethics committees, but debates of this calibre in the House, with the one difference that all hon. Members should have a free vote.

Removing the fear of euthanasia by omission, as the Government have now specifically and directly undertaken to do, and writing that into the Bill is an important step forward and to a large extent overcomes the major prinicipled objection that I and others had to the Bill.

 I shall speak briefly, as I am conscious that the Minister has a good deal of explanation to give to the House.

The nature of the exchanges today has perhaps taught the Government that on issues of conscience it is well worth offering hon. Members a free vote.

<p>

<a name="stpa_152">The genesis of the debate lies in what might be termed the legal defence&#151;the argument that the concept of &quot;best interests&quot; already exists in common law, that advance decisions are permitted under common law, that euthanasia is explicitly prohibited by law, which is enshrined again in clause 58, and that euthanasia should not be divided as between acts of commission or omission, both of which are unacceptable under law. That is agreed, but there is, nevertheless, concern about how the law works in practice.

<a name="stpa_153">For a modern statement of the position, I refer the House to the judgment reported in <i>The Times</i> law report on 9&nbsp;December, in which the Court of Appeal considered and upheld a judgment by Mr. Justice Coleridge in relation to a person who lacked capacity. Rather than reading out the text, I shall summarise: it is clear from that judgment, which was upheld, that the withdrawal of non-intrusive hydration or nutrition in the absence of either an unequivocal advance decision, which did not apply in that case, or any conclusion by the court either that the person was in a permanent vegetative state or that the continuation of life would be intolerable would neither be permitted under the present law nor sanctioned by the Bill.

From what I have seen of the text that the Government are considering, the word &quot;motive&quot; may appear rather than &quot;purpose&quot;. However, the plain fact is that if one is considering matters of deliberate killing, motive is important as well as delivery, which might occur through the withdrawal of treatment.

Notwithstanding the detail on the purpose amendment, which we will get into shortly and which centres on new clauses 1&nbsp;and 2&nbsp;in particular, the Government are with the sentiment behind those new clauses, but the wording and unintended consequences would cause some problems.

 The Minister knows the concerns of the Joint Committee on Human Rights, which I chair. We were particularly concerned about advance directives. People who are required to sign advance directives would have to say that they agreed to the withdrawal of treatment. We are concerned that they will not know that treatment includes artificial nutrition and hydration, which would put people, and sometimes their medical carers and families, in an impossible situation. Will he undertake to introduce measures to make sure that people give consent, that consent is independently witnessed and that the procedure is agreed throughout the medical profession? The consent should be in writing or, for people who are unable to write, some form that gauges intention.

<p><a name="st_261"><a name="41215-16_spnew9"><b> Mr. Lammy: </b> 
 I must say from the Dispatch Box that we are not seeking to undermine Bland. That is precisely what Archbishop Peter Smith and Cardinal Cormac Murphy-O&#039;Connor said&#151;the Bill does not seek to undermine Bland. We want to ensure, however, that under the Bill it is not possible for someone by omission to act to assist suicide or euthanasia. That is the position that we have reached and that is the nature of the discussion that we have had today.

<p><a name="st_266"><a name="41215-17_spnew0"><b> Mr. McLoughlin </b> 
: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker. You were in the Chair during the closing stages of the debate when a letter from the Lord Chancellor became crucial to the House&#039;s deliberations. We were informed that the letter would be available in the Vote Office. It is still not available in the Vote Office; I have just been there to check. However, I did see people hand a copy of a letter, from a Box in the Chamber, to Government supporters and Government Whips. It was then passed along the lines. That letter is from the Lord Chancellor to Archbishop Peter Smith. It is dated 14&nbsp;December. The letter back to him from Peter Smith is also dated 14&nbsp;December.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41215-17_para0">
<a name="stpa_182">The point of order for you, Mr Deputy Speaker, is whether it is right that a document that became so crucial to the debate was made available only on the Labour Benches and was not made available in the Vote Office, as we were told it would be? Is that not a gross discourtesy to the whole House?
</p>








<p><a name="st_267"><a name="41215-17_spmin0"><b>Mr. Deputy Speaker:</b> 
 Let me say to the hon. Gentleman and the whole House that it is crucial for us to conduct our affairs in the House in an orderly manner, not just for our own sakes in terms of debate and reaching the right decisions, but because people outside the House are watching our proceedings and are very concerned about the decisions that we reach.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41215-17_para1">
<a name="stpa_183">It is vital, too, that any document relating to and important to the debate that we are having should be before Members in all parts of the House before the debate starts. Officials are in the House to advise Ministers; they are not here in any way to distribute material that is not available to every Member of the House before the debate starts. I hope that Members in all parts of the House, particularly on the Government side, will have learned lessons from today&#039;s debate&#151;which has not been organised as things ought to be organised here&#151;and that this kind of thing will not happen again.

The report said that an order made by the Secretary of State should stipulate whether a procedure required the prior approval of the court or, alternatively, a certificate from an independent medical practitioner. I understand that the Bill aims to protect the interests of the individual, especially when that person lacks the capacity to take decisions. New clause 3&nbsp;has been proposed because of the worry in the medical profession that the Bill may inhibit those factors that contribute towards looking after the interests of health professionals.

<br>&nbsp;<br>my attention two examples of that. Although I have no direct connection with the BMA, I remind the House that I am a lay member of the General Medical Council. As a result, other associations in the UK occasionally talk to me about matters such as this.

<a name="41215-18_para5">
<a name="stpa_190">The BMA is worried about testing health professionals for blood-borne diseases after they have suffered a needlestick injury when there are good reasons to think that the patient involved might have a condition such as HIV, for which prophylactic treatment is available. As the Bill is drafted, it would be illegal to take a blood sample for testing in circumstances where an individual is unconscious and unlikely to regain consciousness in the short term. A doctor who has received a needlestick injury cannot make an informed decision about ongoing treatment if a test cannot be undertaken to determine the patient&#039;s infection status. With my GMC hat on, the GMC&#039;s guidance to the profession on that issue, entitled &quot;Serious Communicable Diseases&quot;, makes it clear that taking a blood sample for testing in such circumstances may leave a doctor open to criminal charges and that testing an existing sample without consent may also be challenged in the courts or before the GMC under its fitness to practise procedures.

<a name="41215-18_para6">
<a name="stpa_191">The medical profession is worried about exactly how the Bill will affect doctors. The BMA has said that it would like the Bill to address the issue and allow doctors to take steps to protect their health and that of other professionals when such incidents occur.The BMA is pleased to note that provision is to be made in the Human Tissue Bill for regulations to allow genetic testing of a sample from an incapacitated adult for limited purposes other than their personal medical benefit. Clearly, in some circumstances information obtained from DNA analysis would be of huge benefit to other family members, and the BMA hopes that those circumstances will be covered by regulation. However, the BMA is concerned that this Bill makes no provision for samples to be taken for that purpose. It is not clear that taking blood for genetic testing for the benefit of a relative will satisfy the best interest test as a matter of law. In discussing the issue, the Human Genetics Commission said that

I know that individuals and organisations have wanted this legislation for more than a decade. Indeed, I support the Bill and the need to protect people who lack capacity when it comes to medical research. However, when a health professional has been put into a difficult situation, to say the least, after an accident, they would not be able to demand that a sample be taken on their behalf.

 There are some issues in the fifth report of the Shipman inquiry to which I take exception. In my five years on the GMC, I sat on fitness to practise committees for three years and I did not conclude that the GMC was soft on doctors. Nor was it the case that lay members felt differently about cases from the medical members of the committee. I hope that we will return to that issue in the future and I know that my hon. Friend the Minister will have discussions with the GMC about the implications of Dame Janet Smith&#039;s report. I would just say that in the past five years the GMC has had referred to it some 700&nbsp;doctors, 500&nbsp;of whom had findings against them on various levels of the fitness to practise procedures and 200&nbsp;of whom were struck from the register. Those statistics do not suggest to me that the GMC is soft on doctors, so I dispute that point. Indeed, in its favour, Dame Janet did not say that the council had done anything wrong in 1976&nbsp;when it was acting in the case of Dr. Harold Shipman. That was a bit before my time on the GMC&#151;indeed, it was a bit before my time in the House.

<a name="stpa_195">I am considerably worried about the scope that the new clause could give. Although I fully understand that the right hon. Member for Rother Valley (Mr. Barron) is talking about relatively trivial procedures, such as taking a blood sample for HIV or DNA testing, does he agree that authorising any medical or surgical procedure on a person could give scope for considerably more than that? It might involve drug testing or all sorts of things that would not, in any sense, be in the best interests of the person concerned.
</p>








<p><a name="st_301"><a name="41215-18_spnew8"><b> Mr. Barron: </b> 
 I do not disagree; it would depend on the circumstances. The problem that I am raising is one that concerns health professionals. There are four clauses on research and several Government amendments in the group and I should like us to get on to them. The provisions, rightly, are for the protection of people in particular circumstances, but questions arise about those working with them and about incidents such as the one I described earlier. What would be done to protect the interests of health professionals such as doctors, nurses or others working in close proximity to the patient?

 I appreciate that the new clause was presented to the right hon. Gentleman by medical bodies, and it is necessary for us to debate it, but have those bodies taken adequate legal advice? The test in the right hon. Gentleman&#039;s illustration&#151;the need to carry out a blood test so as to provide, for instance, the right conditions in which to nurse a patient&#151;would always be in the patient&#039;s interests; indeed, such tests would be directly related to their care, because without them adequate nursing care could not be provided. The medical bodies may be worrying about nothing on that point.
</p>








<p><a name="st_303"><a name="41215-19_spnew1"><b> Mr. Barron: </b> 
 I do not disagree. If someone is suffering from HIV, it is in their interests to know about it, but there may be circumstances&#151;for whatever reason&#151;when permissions cannot be given by the individual, certainly if they lack capacity. Apart from that, the victim of a road accident, for example, would not have been able to give pre-permission and, due to the accident, would be unable to give any form of permission at the time.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41215-19_para0">
<a name="stpa_196">The Bill has been drawn up to protect the interests of the patient and I completely agree that that should be so. However, we need to probe&#151;and the purpose of the new clause is to probe exactly what is likely to happen when such situations arise. We have just had a long debate about clinicians&#039; decisions and there were questions about what would be within the law or what professional advisers or regulatory bodies would think. The new clause is useful because Ministers will be able to consider it and tell us what they feel about the situation.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I support the clauses on research and do not want to amend them in any way. All research plans will be checked by independent experts through research ethics committees. That is important to ensure that research on people who lack capacity is safe, relates only to that person&#039;s condition and could not be carried out on a person who has capacity. That will apply in many cases, but I should like to know Ministers&#039; thinking about the circumstances where it does not apply.

 I am very concerned about new clause 3, which seems to open very widely a range of procedures that may not be of the sort described by the right hon. Member for Rother Valley (Mr. Barron) in moving the motion. For example, I am not sure whether carrying out blood tests on patients incapable of giving consent could be in their interests, although it might be necessary to carry out a blood test in any event to discover what is wrong with someone and that probably would be justified. I am worried about the extremely wide scope of the new clause, the huge discretion that it gives to the Secretary of State and the lack of any independent adjudication on the appropriateness of such actions.

 As a result of that operation, it was discovered that my mother had advanced cancer of the pancreas.

All I&#039;ve done is sew her up, and all we can do is make her comfortable for the few months that she has got left to live.&quot; I said, &quot;Do we tell her?&quot; and he said, &quot;Well, if she asks directly, yes, but a lot of patients don&#039;t want to know, so unless she asks me or asks you, we probably won&#039;t tell her the situation.&quot;

Yes, good; I&#039;m jolly pleased.&quot; I then contacted the surgeon concerned and asked, &quot;What&#039;s going on? You know perfectly well that she&#039;s in a terminal condition.

You&#039;ve raised her expectations, and you&#039;ll have to deal with deflating them.&quot; I say that purely to illustrate the attitude of some members of the medical profession to the way that they interpret what they may or may not do.

<a name="41215-19_para4">

 When the Joint Committee considered this part of the Bill, I expressed quite a few reservations about the principle of carrying out research on people who lacked capacity. We have had a long debate this afternoon about advance decisions. Of course, if someone who has capacity, but knows that they have a condition which means that they will eventually lose it, gives their full consent while they are compos mentis to some research being carried out on them, that is a different matter. However, like my hon. Friend the Member for Bournemouth, West (Sir John Butterfill), I share concern about the scope of the new clause.

 I have expressed my reservations about it. We were lobbied both in the Joint Committee and the Standing Committee by organisations, some of which I am personally associated with. I am sure that where there is a lack of research into certain medical conditions we all want to give as much opportunity as possible for research, but in the back of my mind I have a nagging problem about research being done on people who lack capacity, not for their own benefit but for the wider good of others, without their specific consent in an advance directive.

<p>
<a name="41215-19_para10">
<a name="stpa_206">New clause 3&nbsp;is extremely wide in scope. It says that the research should not cause the patient significant harm and should be of significant benefit to others.

<a name="stpa_207">I have an interest in the matter in another context that is appropriate to the points made by the right hon. Member for Rother Valley (Mr. Barron). I worked with the Government a couple of years ago to persuade them to change a Home Office Bill in respect of the perpetrators of road traffic accidents who were suspected of drink-driving but who went into a casualty department unconscious&#151;without capacity. The police had difficulty obtaining a blood sample from an unconscious perpetrator of an accident. It took three years, but we got there in the end and the legislation was amended. It was decided that a police surgeon, with the permission of the casualty admitting doctor, could take a sample under all the necessary constraints. When the person gained capacity, they had the right to say whether the blood sample could be used. The new clause would apply to many people who would never regain capacity and would not be able to exercise their right to make decisions.

For instance, it is not in an individual&#039;s interests to be barrier nursed as a precautionary measure simply because nobody knows whether they have a blood infection.

 The amendment tabled by the right hon. Member for Rother Valley (Mr. Barron) seeks to widen enormously the scope of the research clauses. On Second Reading, I said that those clauses were some of the most troublesome that the House had to consider. I appreciate that in the past, matters concerning research on an incapacitated patient who does not have the mental capacity to give consent have been conducted informally by the medical profession, usually with the consent of relatives. Nevertheless, there is something very stark about what happens when one reduces those informal procedures, which in my view were wrong, into a statutory form that, to my mind, remains ethically extremely troublesome.

Gentleman does not mind my using that expression&#151;of the provisions of the Council of Europe convention on human rights and biomedicine, which lays down strict guidelines on what is permissible in relation to an incapacitated patient: guidelines that the Government have not followed in their drafting of the Bill.

Even if the most rigorous research clauses were introduced, I do not believe that doctors or nurses should have any anxiety about the sort of test that exists for their safety when relating to patients&#151;that is plainly in the patient&#039;s interest&#151;or for deciding the best way in which to manage a patient.

<a name="41215-21_para3">
<a name="stpa_249">Let me deal with the clause more generally. The clauses on research differ substantially from the European convention. The differences have been highlighted by the Joint Committee on Human Rights, which scrutinises Bills. It stated that, unless the wording is tightened up, there is a serious risk that the provisions will be found to be in breach of the convention. A Government response to that is awaited and I hope that, at this late stage of the Bill&#039;s passage through the House of Commons, the Minister will give some idea of the Government&#039;s view of those criticisms.

<a name="stpa_250">Let me consider amendments Nos. 43&nbsp;and 44, which my hon. Friend the Member for Daventry (Mr. Boswell) and I tabled. I continue to have serious anxieties about the research clauses. There is an argument, which, doubtless, many people would try to avoid, that research can never be justified on an incapacitated patient unless one can show that it is directly for that patient&#039;s benefit. The fact that the research may be for the benefit of a wider section of society is arguably irrelevant. After all, if I am a person of full capacity and a doctor asks me whether I would be prepared to consent to tests, albeit not massively intrusive tests, which are not for my direct benefit but might benefit thousands of other people, as the law in this country currently stands&#151;thank goodness&#151;it is my right to say no. The idea that, if I were incapacitated, someone could make the decision for me is troubling.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41215-21_para5">
<a name="stpa_251">The logical outcome of the argument is that all sorts of medical research may be closed off. The alternative approach is that the Government should simply rewrite the clauses and provide that people have to sign up in advance, as they do for organ donation, and state that they are prepared for such tests to be undertaken. It is a difficult issue but the approach in the Bill leaves me feeling uncomfortable.

 I shall start by addressing the new clause tabled by my right hon. Friend the Member for Rother Valley (Mr. Barron). I have taken careful note of the points that he and the British Medical Association made, and the issue deserves serious consideration. I am sympathetic to the fact that doctors are often put in a difficult position when faced with the need for such testing. However, as other hon. Members have said, we have made the principle of best interest the cornerstone of the Bill, and I am afraid that it would be extremely difficult to accept a provision allowing P to be tested for a purpose that is not in his best interests. The BMA, understandably, has sought assurances that it would be possible to conduct a diagnostic test primarily of benefit to a family member in the case of genetic diseases, or perhaps to a nurse or doctor if a needlestick accident had occurred in P&#039;s treatment. That is the issue about which my right hon. Friend is particularly concerned, but I hope I can give him some reassurance here.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41215-21_para17">
<a name="stpa_263">As I have said, it would be difficult to imagine a situation, for example, where someone with capacity&#151;if there had been a needlestick injury in particular&#151;could say that they did not want any such test carrying out. We would then have a different scenario for people without capacity. That is the difficulty in what are obviously difficult situations in themselves.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41215-21_para18">
<a name="stpa_264">We believe that a proposal such as that tabled by my right hon. Friend is unnecessary, because the Bill will allow for acts whose primary purpose is to benefit a third party, provided that those acts are in P&#039;s best interests. I reassure the House that the interpretation of best interests could be broader than P&#039;s medical best interests. I can confirm that the Bill will not prevent a genetic test for a familial cancer, for example, that might not be essential to P&#039;s medical care but would provide considerable benefit to some other family member.

 Would not the scenario that the Minister has outlined equally apply to somebody with capacity?

 I am slightly concerned by the Minister&#039;s linkage between the investigation and the efficacy of treatment.

However, to link it too expressly with an effective start&#151;an early start&#151;to a therapy is unhelpful to the argument. I hope it is not an exclusive argument that she is making.

<p><a name="st_325"><a name="41215-22_spnew3"><b> Ms Winterton: </b> 
 I am simply saying that, in circumstances where it is impossible to know whether the incapacitated person might or might not be suffering from such a condition, if there is reasonable cause to think that they might be, it would be in their interest, and of benefit to them, to have a test so as to start treatment. Someone who has capacity, however, obviously still has the ability to refuse to be tested. If they are asked, however, and they refuse to be tested, it is extremely difficult to force them.

The problem, which is at the heart of these clauses, comes when research is not at all for the benefit of that patient or his immediate management.
</p>








<p><a name="st_327"><a name="41215-22_spnew5"><b> Ms Winterton: </b> 
 Perhaps I can address some of those issues shortly. I want to reassure my right hon. Friend the Member for Rother Valley that we will make it clear in the code that, in such cases, the possible wider benefit that accrues from testing, which has been endorsed already in legal judgments, will continue to be an important factor in determining best interests. If a diagnostic test is in P&#039;s best interests, it should be lawful, and doctors performing such tests have the protection from liability afforded by clause 5. We will also consult on a role for the independent consultee in such decisions, so that there are mechanisms other than the Court of Protection to ensure that P&#039;s best interests are met in the light of the specific circumstances of each case. In the light of the explanations and, I hope, reassurance that I have given, I therefore ask my right hon. Friend to withdraw his amendment.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41215-22_para0">
<a name="stpa_266">With regard to amendment No. 43, I agree that it is important that we make sure that people without capacity are properly protected. That is why we have included in the Bill some stringent safeguards. It is more difficult to define best interests in this area than in other parts of the Bill. The most that we can ask of research is that it offers a potential benefit to people. There cannot be guarantees, because, as was pointed out in Committee, if there were, such treatment would be offered. There is no way that researchers can prove in advance that something will be of benefit; they can only say that it may be of direct benefit. Were we to 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>15 Dec 2004 : Column 1601</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>undermine that and say that it had to be of benefit, a lot of research would not take place, and some research being done would have to cease.
</p>








<p><a name="st_328"><a name="41215-22_spnew6"><b> Mr. Grieve: </b> 
 What, then, is the ethical basis for the research clauses as they stand? That is not a trick question for the Minister; it is a fundamental issue. The Government must explain to the House the ethical basis of carrying out experimentation or testing on someone who is incapacitated, cannot give consent and has no direct benefit from such tests.
</p>








<p><a name="st_329"><a name="41215-22_spnew7"><b> Ms Winterton: </b> 
 Let us be clear; we are talking about potential benefit. As to the ethical basis, however, we must agree about whether or not we want to carry out research on the conditions, or the causes of the conditions, of people with incapacity. The safeguards put into the Bill make it clear that such research will only be that which cannot be carried out on someone with capacity; that relates to the causes or conditions of the person&#039;s incapacity; that the person has the absolute right to withdraw at any time from such research if there is any indication that they do not want to be involved in it; and that if somebody else objects to their inclusion in such research, they should be withdrawn from it. It must be approved by a research ethics committee, which will also look at the way in which consent has been obtained.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41215-22_para1">
<a name="stpa_267">The Joint Committee gave careful consideration to the issue. It decided that, on balance, despite concerns about research of this kind, it was not right for people who had incapacity not to benefit from the research in the same way as those with capacity. A number of groups made representations to the Government, and I am sure the hon. Member for Tiverton and Honiton (Mrs. Browning) will agree that they were made to members of the Committee. Those groups told us that excluding people without capacity from research would be detrimental to them.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41215-22_para2">
<a name="stpa_268">As I have said, it is always difficult to prove that something can be in someone&#039;s best interests. We can only say that it is of potential benefit to that person, or might benefit him or her in the longer term, or might benefit him or her indirectly once more research has been done, or might benefit others with the same condition now or in the future.
</p>








<p><a name="st_330"><a name="41215-22_spnew8"><b> Mr. Grieve: </b> 
 It is that last point that bothers me. The others do not trouble me all that much. Even potential benefit might be a justification, but the nub of the issue is research carried out on an individual that is of no possible benefit to that individual, but is justified on the ground that it is there for the wider public good. Are the Government comfortable with that set of ethical values?
</p>








<p><a name="st_331"><a name="41215-22_spnew9"><b> Ms Winterton: </b> 
 I am very comfortable that we are introducing a number of safeguards in the Bill. As the hon. Gentleman has said, research already can be carried out, but now safeguards will be introduced. I am confident that, as far as possible, medical ethics committees will ensure that research benefits individuals at the time. It may not always be possible for some research, particularly when it looks into causes, to be of 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>15 Dec 2004 : Column 1602</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>direct benefit immediately, but it could well be in the future. It might also lead to alleviation of current symptoms.
</p>








<p><a name="st_332"><a name="41215-22_spnew10"><b> Mr. Boswell: </b> 
 This is a difficult argument, but I think that the principle is simple. Clause 1(5) makes a commitment that embraces the whole Bill&#151;that acts done or decisions made should be in the best interests of the person involved. Is the Minister saying that that best-interests principle is suspended in the case of the research clauses? Yes or no?
</p>








<p><a name="st_333"><a name="41215-22_spnew11"><b> Ms Winterton: </b> 
 I am not saying that it is suspended, but I think that given the direct way in which it is interpreted in other parts of the Bill, it will be inevitably interpreted slightly differently in this part, for the simple reason that it is always extremely difficult to say that research is absolutely in someone&#039;s best interests. It is in the nature of research that it is almost impossible to prove that it would be of direct benefit.
</p>








<p><a name="st_334"><a name="41215-22_spnew12"><b> Mr. Cash: </b> 
 Would it not be possible to overcome some of the difficulty by making it clear in the principles that the provision would apply when it was of direct benefit to the person concerned, but not when it was of indirect benefit?
</p>








<p><a name="st_335"><a name="41215-22_spnew13"><b> Ms Winterton: </b> 
 As I have said, although one would hope that such research would be of direct benefit, it is not possible in every circumstance to prove that it would be. The Bill&#039;s provisions are absolutely consistent with all international legal and ethical norms and instruments. The Bill also makes it clear that if the research is for the benefit of others, the risk must be obviously negligible.
</p>








<p><a name="st_336"><a name="41215-22_spnew14"><b> Mrs. Browning: </b> 
 Will the Minister give way?
</p>








<p><a name="st_337"><a name="41215-22_spnew15"><b> Ms Winterton: </b> 
 I will, but I am anxious to move on and I know that the hon. Lady will want to discuss the independent consultee.
</p>








<p><a name="st_338"><a name="41215-22_spnew16"><b> Mrs. Browning: </b> 
 I thank the Minister and I shall be brief. Incapacity usually has a neurological base, and the benefit of research into conditions such dementia and Alzheimer&#039;s often lies in post-mortem pathology, rather than in research on living people. So I hope that the Minister will focus on such opportunities, rather than on performing research on people who are still alive.

 The hon. Lady is of course right. Some of these issues are covered in the Human Tissue Act 2004, so that we can be clear that such research can be carried out, with the proper consent.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41215-23_para0">
<a name="stpa_269">As I was saying, the difficulty is that it would be extremely difficult to ensure on every occasion that such research was in the best interests of P, so in effect, such a provision would prevent a great deal of research.

<p>
<a name="41215-23_para1">
<a name="stpa_270">Amendment No. 44&nbsp;deals with an issue that was raised in Committee. I understand and share Members&#039; desire to protect someone who may lack capacity from decisions taken by a court-appointed deputy whom they did not choose to represent them. However, the problem is that such a deputy might well know and be related to P; in effect the amendment would exclude a number of 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>15 Dec 2004 : Column 1603</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>people who might be in the best position to know whether P would have wished to participate in such research. The court might well appoint a relative, friend or carer as the deputy, and we would not want to exclude such a person. However, I sympathise with the concerns expressed and we will amend the code of practice to make it clear that if a deputy has no relationship to, or knowledge of, P before their appointment, they should not be consulted on the question of P&#039;s participation in research. I hope that that deals with the concerns expressed.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41215-23_para2">
<a name="stpa_271">I shall deal briefly with the Government amendments. Some very useful suggestions were made in Committee and I agreed to look into them. We have tabled a number of amendments that draw on policy intention behind the various clauses. As drafted, clause 31&nbsp;unintentionally prevented research into a condition or illness that causes incapacity, such as variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease or Alzheimer&#039;s, even where such research might be of benefit to P. As per our original intention, Government amendment No. 7&nbsp;will allow research into anything that causes or contributes to P&#039;s condition, as well as anything attributable to it.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41215-23_para3">
<a name="stpa_272">Government amendments Nos. 8, 9&nbsp;and 10&nbsp;deal with removing a researcher&#039;s right of appeal. As was pointed out in Committee, as drafted clause 32&nbsp;would give a researcher the right to apply to a court if a carer, friend or relative objected to P&#039;s taking part in the research. Frankly, that seemed rather unreasonable. If the carer or friend says that there should be no further research, there should be no further research and no further argument about it.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41215-23_para4">
<a name="stpa_273">Government amendments Nos. 11&nbsp;and 12&nbsp;deal with research in emergency cases. There were some concerns that the Bill as drafted was not clear enough about research done in emergency and acute medical settings. An example would be someone who had a head injury or stroke, for which swift treatment is often vital. There may be ways in which research could be done in relation to such treatment. Pumping someone&#039;s heart 15&nbsp;times instead of 10&nbsp;times in order to revive them might be relevant.

<a name="time_22">

</p>

<p>
<a name="41215-23_para5">
<a name="stpa_274">Presently, it is unclear whether consent is required before such treatment can be carried out. The amendments clarify the point that the provisions apply to cases where urgent treatment is needed. I hope that that makes our intention clearer&#151;that we do not envisage the provisions covering circumstances where a researcher just wants to act quickly. Rather, they apply to where people are suddenly incapacitated and the research relates to their particular condition at the time. Again, the research team would have to agree the specific detailed proposals with the research ethics committee before a trial could be approved.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41215-23_para6">
<a name="stpa_275">Government amendments Nos. 13&nbsp;and 14&nbsp;help to clarify the provisions on advance decision and the final amendments that we have suggested on research are also clarificatory. Clause 33&nbsp;states that a researcher must not act in a way that is contrary to a person&#039;s advance decision. Amendments Nos. 13&nbsp;and 14&nbsp;make it clear that that applies to any earlier statement a person has made 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>15 Dec 2004 : Column 1604</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>about not participating in research and is not limited to advance decisions as defined in clauses 24&nbsp;to 26. If someone has said in advance that they are opposed to medical research and do not want to take part in it, the researcher must respect that and not enrol them in the trial.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41215-23_para7">
<a name="stpa_276">In conclusion, I understand that there are difficult issues surrounding research, about which hon. Members feel very strongly. People who represent those who lack capacity, including their families or carers, have made it clear that they feel it would be wrong to exclude people from being able to participate in and benefit from research, either for themselves or others. They feel that it would be almost discriminatory to introduce such a measure. What we have tried to do within the Bill is to balance that need against some very stringent safeguards. We in Parliament are able to lay down some of the necessary safeguards and, by working through codes of practice, implement them. I hope that hon. Members will withdraw their amendments and accept the Government ones.

: I agree with the hon. Members for Bournemouth, West (Sir John Butterfill) and for Tiverton and Honiton (Mrs. Browning) about the extent of the powers that the Secretary of State could use if he were to bring in an order under new clause 3. It would be a brave and potentially foolish Secretary of State who wanted to deal with issues such as sterilisation or abortion by making an order, yet the new clause might well allow that to happen.

I would not use a phrase like &quot;guinea pigs&quot; in respect of the use of incapacitated people for research, and I would not condone the clauses on research if such language were used. However, in some areas it is vital to use people who lack capacity for research purposes. Such research must be carried out properly, but the benefits can extend beyond the person involved to other people who may suffer similar incapacity. An obvious example concerns people who lack capacity as a result of road accidents or head injuries. The effects do not always last forever, as people make progress with such injuries. I am no expert, but I am sure that the treatments and drugs derived from such research benefit others in similar circumstances. The medical profession wants people to know that there are legitimate reasons for conducting such research when the aim is to assist people who might in the future lose capacity because of similar accidents.

<p><a name="st_372">Government amendments Nos. 15&nbsp;and 16.</p>











<p><a name="st_373"><a name="41215-24_spnew1"><b> Paul Holmes: </b> 
 New clause 5&nbsp;continues a debate that occupied some time in Standing Committee. The Government propose to introduce independent consultees, along the lines of existing advocates, to advise NHS bodies and local authorities about what is in a person&#039;s best interests when a decision is being made about serious medical treatment, or before certain types of accommodation are provided. The Government also propose to provide &#163;6.5&nbsp;million to fund the arrangements, but only for persons without friends and family&#151;the unbefriended.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41215-24_para18">
<a name="stpa_300">Much of that is good, as far as it goes, but concerns remain. The Making Decisions Alliance encompasses some 40&nbsp;different disability campaigning groups and has been at the forefront in expressing those concerns. It said that what the Government call the independent consultee service could cause confusion by becoming a rival to the existing independent advocacy services and it believes that there is no need for two such services. That is why new clause 5&nbsp;would replace all the references in the Bill to independent consultees with the phrase &quot;independent advocates&quot;. Advocacy services already fulfil the role of independent consultees and make representations to decision makers. There is no need for a completely new service, with a completely new title to explain what it does.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41215-24_para19">
<a name="stpa_301">There is also concern about the restriction of the independent consultee service simply to the unbefriended. If the Government&#039;s advocacy-plus, as Ministers dubbed it in Committee, is to involve highly trained, skilled and experienced staff, why deny their services to those people who have family and friends?
</p>








<p><a name="st_374"><a name="41215-24_spnew2"><b> Mr. Boswell: </b> 
 I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for giving way as it will save me having to speak in this debate. May I cite to him the example&#151;it was mentioned in Committee&#151;of cases in which there are family disagreements? In such cases, it may be important to represent the views of the person without capacity in an objective way.
</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmhansrd/vo041215/debtext/41215-25.htm"/>







<p><a name="st_375"><a name="41215-25_spnew0"><b> Paul Holmes: </b> 
 We did discuss that example in Committee and it would indeed be helpful if the independent advocate or consultee were available to all relevant people.
</p>








<p><a name="st_376"><a name="41215-25_spnew1"><b> Ms Rosie Winterton: </b> 
 In view of the time, perhaps I could take the hon. Gentleman back to the discussions that we had in Committee. I made it clear that we would consider how we could extend the role of the independent consultee in just the circumstances that the hon. Member for Daventry (Mr. Boswell) outlined. I also said that it was important that we consulted widely on that before deciding absolutely who else should be included with the unbefriended.
</p>








<p><a name="st_377"><a name="41215-25_spnew2"><b> Paul Holmes: </b> 
 I welcome the Minister&#039;s reassurances on that point, but would the service be extended only in instances of family conflict about the advice given to family members, or would it be extended to those who are represented by friends and family but would benefit from the expertise of trained advocacy staff?


<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>15 Dec 2004 : Column 1608</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br></p>








<p><a name="st_378"><a name="41215-25_spnew3"><b> Ms Winterton: </b> 
 That is exactly why we said that we wanted to consult more widely on the issue. Several examples might arise of circumstances in which people would feel that it was appropriate for an independent consultee to be involved, without upsetting the principle that if people were reaching decisions amicably we would not intrude in family matters.
</p>








<p><a name="st_379"><a name="41215-25_spnew4"><b> Paul Holmes: </b> 
 There is still a feeling in the Making Decisions Alliance that the family carer is in the best position to know the views and safeguard the best interests of the person involved, but the independent advocate&#151; as a trained expert&#151;is more likely to know how to navigate the system better. There would always be a complementary role for the advocate to add their expertise and training to facilitate the process, even when family and friends are present.
</p>








<p><a name="st_380"><a name="41215-25_spnew5"><b> Ms Winterton: </b> 
 Does the hon. Gentleman also accept that in some circumstances people might think that that was intrusive? The presence of the advocate could cause difficulties in families who are in vulnerable situations. We have to strike the right balance when making such decisions.
</p>








<p><a name="st_381"><a name="41215-25_spnew6"><b> Paul Holmes: </b> 
 The Minister is correct and the Committee received some evidence on that point from a Welsh organisation of families and carers, who perceived a danger of intrusiveness. However, I am sure that any Government organisation would take due care with that and not tread on people&#039;s toes.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41215-25_para0">
<a name="stpa_302">New clause 5&nbsp;tries to address two other concerns. One is that the Government version of an independent consultee is available only once it has been established that a person lacks capacity, but the experience of the existing independent advocates is that in many cases someone is thought to lack capacity, but is able to express their views when given the appropriate support. New clause 5&nbsp;tries to extend the principle of independent advocacy to support people during the process of determining whether they lack capacity, as it will often turn out that they have capacity if given support.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41215-25_para1">
<a name="stpa_303">The Making Decisions Alliance has lobbied the Government on the second concern. It sought and received Government confirmation that the overriding function of independent advocacy is to support the individual, rather than the decision maker. It is felt to be important that the Bill should be amended by new clause 5&nbsp;to write that verbal clarification into the Bill.
</p>








<p><a name="st_382"><a name="41215-25_spnew7"><b> Mr. Tom Clarke </b> 
: I know that time is against us, but if my hon. Friend the Minister has the opportunity to confirm that instead of &quot;consultee&quot; the word &quot;advocacy&quot; will appear in the Bill, that would be very welcome.
</p>








<p><a name="st_383"><a name="41215-25_spnew8"><b> Ms Rosie Winterton: </b> 
 I know how strongly my right hon. Friend feels about that matter and I can give him&#151;

<p><a name="st_500"><a name="41215-30_spnew0"><b> Mr. Lammy: </b> 
 I beg to move, That the Bill be now read the Third time. I do so with great pleasure.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41215-30_para1">
<a name="stpa_307">This is an important and ethical Bill. Our progress on it has been fast, and much of today&#039;s debate has pertained to that. I think it right that, to meet the concerns of Members throughout the House, the Lord Chancellor undertook to continue discussions and negotiations until the eleventh hour, and I am pleased that Members have felt able to support the Government in the Lobbies on the basis of that. I am glad that we have achieved the ends, even if the means were a little unusual for Parliament.
</p>








<p><a name="st_501"><a name="41215-30_spnew1"><b> Mr. McNamara: </b> 
 I apologise for intervening so early in my hon. Friend&#039;s speech, but can we take it that the Government accept completely, precisely and in terms the interpretation of the correspondence between the Lord Chancellor and Archbishop Smith that the archbishop gives in his letter dated today?
</p>








<p><a name="st_502"><a name="41215-30_spnew2"><b> Mr. Lammy: </b> 
 I hope that my hon. Friend will forgive me if I say that I have been here all afternoon while others have continued the negotiations. We have talked about the exchange of letters. I have said that I accept the spirit of the intention behind the amendments. The discussion continues so that a draft amendment can be tabled in the other place, and can be debated here in due course.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41215-30_para2">
<a name="stpa_308">As I said, I have been here while discussions have gone on. I am pleased that they have been going on, because they were part of an effort to make the Bill better. I want to pause for a moment, however, to explain why the Bill is so important and why organisations that work daily with vulnerable people who need such legislation&#151;organisations such as the Alzheimer&#039;s Society, Scope, Mencap, the Disability Rights Commission and Age Concern&#151;support it. They support it because they want people who lack mental capacity to be valued and treated with respect.
</p>








<p><a name="st_503"><a name="41215-30_spnew3"><b> Mr. Tom Clarke: </b> 
 I thank my hon. Friend for his courtesy throughout our proceedings. As he mentioned disability organisations, and as I asked the Minister of State, Department of Health, my hon. Friend the Member for Doncaster, Central (Ms Winterton) a question but unfortunately time ran out, will he confirm that the word &quot;advocates&quot; will be used rather than the word &quot;consultees&quot;?
</p>








<p><a name="st_504"><a name="41215-30_spnew4"><b> Mr. Lammy: </b> 
 My right hon. Friend&#039;s points will be considered in the other place. We value the spirit in which he has spoken about advocacy throughout the Bill&#039;s passage so far.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41215-30_para3">
<a name="stpa_309">Why have organisations that have campaigned on what are indeed advocacy issues, and have worked in particular with people with learning disabilities, supported the Bill? They want those who lack capacity at different points, or who lack it entirely, to be able to make as many decisions as possible. The Bill&#039;s decision-specific approach to capacity means an end to the days when people were labelled incapable. Instead, they will be assumed to have capacity for each and every decision until it is established that they lack it.

<p><a name="st_505"><a name="41215-30_spnew5"><b> Mrs. Browning: </b> 
 I served on the Scrutiny Committee and the Standing Committee, and I shall abstain on Third Reading tonight, as I did on Second Reading, because the Minister has not yet dealt with two key elements. First, end-of-life issues have not been dealt with satisfactorily here and they will now be passed to the other place. Secondly, as I said in Committee and as the Scrutiny Committee clearly recommended, we need to close the Bournewood gap. The Government have said nothing about how they intend to close that gap. Is the Minister going to use this Bill or existing mental health legislation to do so? He cannot afford to wait for the draft mental health Bill, which I am currently scrutinising.

 The hon. Lady has heard the substance of my remarks on the issues pertaining to life-sustaining treatment. We are where we are, and all of us must applaud the fact that we are beginning to settle these important and vexing issues. Throughout our proceedings the hon. Lady has raised the issue of the Bournewood gap, and as we have said, we must consult on that important decision. I hope that she realises that we are doing so, notwithstanding her concern about how the Government deal with the problems arising from that case post-consultation.

</p>








<p><a name="st_508"><a name="41215-31_spnew1"><b> Mr. Lammy: </b> 
 If I may I shall make some progress.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41215-31_para0">
<a name="stpa_310">Those who support the Bill do so because they want those who lack mental capacity to be at the heart of the decision-making process. The Bill requires that everything done for someone who lacks capacity should be in their interests, and that it must be the best for that individual at that time, taking into account all the relevant factors. Those who support the Bill do so because they want professionals and carers&#151;some 6&nbsp;million of them&#151;to know what they can do for and to people who lack capacity, and when and how they can do it. The Bill and the code of practice, which has statutory effect, will provide the guidance that we were able to put in draft form, and to which Members and various organisations have contributed.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41215-31_para1">
<a name="stpa_311">Throughout the development of this legislation, the Government have listened to the wide range of people affected by it, some of whom I mentioned earlier. They include groups representing people with disabilities, the 39&nbsp;organisations in the Making Decisions Alliance, professional bodies, the Catholic Church and pro-life organisations. The Government have also consulted Members extensively, and the Bill has developed and improved greatly as a result of such consultation. When the Government listen and act as a result of Members asking us to listen, Members cannot then accuse us of bypassing Parliament.
</p>








<p><a name="st_509"><a name="41215-31_spnew2"><b> Mr. Duncan Smith: </b> 
 The Minister says that the Government have listened, but I do not understand why we have reached this stage. What consultation with Opposition Members and his own colleagues has to offer us is two letters at the eleventh hour, indicating that changes will be made in the Lords. That does not suggest that the Government are listening, given that such changes could have been made long before. One letter states:

</p>

<p>
<a name="41215-31_para3">
<a name="stpa_313">and the other letter, from Archbishop Smith, says the same. But even knowing that, the Minister moved an amendment to amendment No. 2, which was tabled by one of his own hon. Friends, in order to remove the word &quot;best&quot;. Are the Government going to reinsert &quot;best&quot; in the Lords? How is the Minister going to deal with this issue?
</p>








<p><a name="st_510"><a name="41215-31_spnew3"><b> Mr. Lammy: </b> 
 I hope that the right hon. Gentleman knows that the situation is not as simple as that. We tabled the amendment to remove the word &quot;best&quot; because we want the &quot;best interests&quot; clause to constitute the objective judgment at the end of the process. As drafted, amendment No. 2&nbsp;did not achieve that. The new amendment, which the Lord Chancellor discussed today, deals with purpose, motive and best interests at the end of the process, so the two amendments are different.

<a name="stpa_314">On the Bland judgment and the 36&nbsp;subsequent cases, I make no apology for the way in which we have dealt with this complex issue, which has challenged the minds of lawyers throughout the country.

<a name="stpa_315">The Government position is clear: we do not want to see Bland overturned, which is also the position of the Catholic archbishops. We have sought to ensure that we do not bring in euthanasia by omission, while at the same time resisting overturning the Bland judgment. That is why discussions have continued and why, even as I speak, I am receiving submissions on the negotiations. We may not like the means, but we should be pleased with the ends and I hope that the matter will be settled in the other place before it comes back here.

<a name="stpa_316">Many hon. Members have made invaluable contributions to the scrutiny of the Bill. The hon. Member for Daventry (Mr. Boswell) has been remarkable in his thoroughness. He is a self-confessed serial amender who relentlessly tabled probing amendments in Committee, which helped us to discuss key aspects of the Bill in greater depth. Throughout the process, he balanced constructive questioning with support for the Bill.

<p>
<a name="41215-31_para7">
<a name="stpa_317">It is as a result of one of the hon. Gentleman&#039;s questions that we tabled two amendments to clause 4. We wanted to make it clear that the test of best interests should be objective. Our amendments make it clearer that we must take into account all the factors that a reasonable person would consider relevant&#151;an important clarification that I hope was not entirely lost, at least for the <i>Hansard</i> record, in our earlier debate about life-sustaining treatment. The key point is that we cannot substitute our own judgments: they must be objective with a doctor balancing all the issues before him, particularly when they relate to life-sustaining treatment.

<a name="stpa_318">The hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam (Mr. Burstow) was also a valued member of the Committee. It was his amendment and a similar one tabled by the hon. Member for Tiverton and Honiton (Mrs. Browning) that led us to introduce an amendment to clause 3, under which the Bill provides that information must be explained to a person in a way that is appropriate to his circumstances. There is no longer any doubt: no one should be labelled incapable merely because insufficient efforts have been made to help him understand and communicate.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41215-31_para9">
<a name="stpa_319">On life-sustaining treatment, I have already mentioned that discussions on the issue continued up to the very last moment today, showing how very seriously the Government take people&#039;s concerns, particularly relating to the vulnerable, to advance decisions and to the power of attorney. I said earlier that we greatly welcome the amendment tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Knowsley, North and Sefton, East (Mr. Howarth). We value his commitment to the Bill, to helping vulnerable people and to building consensus around his amendment. We shall take the substance of his amendment forward, as I explained earlier, subject to the adjustments introduced by the Government, just as we have also accepted the spirit of new clauses 1&nbsp;and 2. We want to build on my hon. Friend&#039;s amendment to make it clear that the Bill does not authorise any decision motivated by a desire to bring about a person&#039;s death. We have also made it clear that we want to ensure that advance decisions about life-sustaining treatment are recorded in writing and witnessed. We are also exploring with health care professionals whether we can make it a requirement for people to consult their doctor before taking such an advance decision.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41215-31_para10">
<a name="stpa_320">Let me make it quite clear that the Bill both clarifies the law and makes it safer. The difficult and sensitive cases will, as now, go to court. Our new court of protection means that cases of persistent vegetative state will still go to court.

<a name="stpa_321">Throughout the Bill&#039;s passage hon. Members have talked about what might happen when wicked people&#151;be they doctors, attorneys or others&#151;conspire to bring about a person&#039;s death without regard to that person&#039;s best interests. We have sought to put safeguards into the Bill. None of us can say that such things can never happen again, but the Bill&#039;s purpose is to protect vulnerable people as much as possible. I am sure that we have achieved that, and in that regard I refer in particular to clause 58&nbsp;and the work of the Joint Committee on Human Rights. We have also worked with the Catholic community on amendments dealing with advanced decisions, life-sustaining treatment and the purpose or motive that might lie behind bringing about a person&#039;s end.
</p>

<a name="41215-31_para12">
<a name="stpa_322">I hope that I have been able to paint a clear and accurate picture of what the Bill will do. Much information has been spread about it, and I want to reassure the House and the public that it is about protecting the rights and interests of vulnerable people, regardless of the present political environment. People in Britain will benefit from the Bill, and we should be proud of it. It has been coming for 15&nbsp;years, and I am very pleased to be the Minister opening this Third Reading debate.

<p><a name="st_513"><a name="41215-31_spnew6"><b> Mr. Boswell: </b> 
 This Bill raises immensely serious issues. All parties involved in the debate&#151;and Ministers too, largely&#151;have engaged in the effort required to put it into an acceptable state. As the Minister said, the Bill has had a 15-year genesis already. Hon. Members have worked together to achieve the common objective of assisting persons with mental capacity problems. We all recognise the sensitivity of the issue, and have searched for the appropriate safeguards.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41215-31_para13">
<a name="stpa_323">The case for the Bill was well expressed on page 27&nbsp;of the recent report from the Joint Committee on Human Rights. The Committee states:

<a name="stpa_324">

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_60">&quot;Our view on initial consideration is that the Bill should be broadly welcomed from a human rights perspective because it enhances the ability of people who lack capacity to make their own decisions where they can, and makes it more likely that sound decisions will be made on their behalf when they cannot make those decisions for themselves.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="41215-31_para15">
<a name="stpa_325">That is a strong case for the Bill, but the Committee continues in the same paragraph:
</p>

<p>
<a name="41215-31_para16">
<a name="stpa_326">

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_61">&quot;A number of human rights issues arise, mainly concerning the adequacy of the various safeguards contained in, or envisaged by, the Bill.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="41215-31_para17">
<a name="stpa_327">That warning is perfectly reasonable. The Bill will help by codifying the existing common law, for example in relation to advance decisions. I was prepared to support the Government in the Lobby tonight on that, although I was not prepared to do so on other matters.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41215-31_para18">
<a name="stpa_328">I want to emphasise the safeguards that are required and, for reasons of convenience of reference, I shall follow the schema adopted by the Joint Committee. First, I turn to the matter of the Bournewood gap. My hon. Friend the Member for Tiverton and Honiton (Mrs. Browning) spoke characteristically powerfully about a matter on which the Minister said that he and his colleagues were still consulting. However, we need to deal with the problem promptly, and this Bill is the appropriate vehicle for that.
</p>

<p><a name="st_514"><a name="41215-32_spnew0"><b> Mrs. Browning: </b> 
 My hon. Friend will know that in Standing Committee I tabled new clauses to try and close the Bournewood gap. I understand that the Minister needs to consult, and I know that the lawyers are taking their time and are supplying differing legal advice. I do not criticise the Government for that, but it is clear that they have three options. If they opt for closing the Bournewood gap by means of this Bill, the relevant provision will have to be introduced in another place. I am concerned that this Chamber has not had a chance to discuss the matter in full, as I would have liked.
</p>








<p><a name="st_515"><a name="41215-32_spnew1"><b> Mr. Boswell: </b>

<a name="41215-32_para0">
<a name="stpa_329">The wider issues of reservation on human rights grounds also referred to by the Joint Committee include restraint, not just in the context of Bournewood; advance decisions; the conditions for research, which we have just been discussing; the need to see clear and unequivocal evidence in writing of the Government&#039;s commitment to deal with issues around motives for

</p>

<p>
<a name="41215-32_para1">
<a name="stpa_330">This afternoon&#039;s proceedings did little good to the reputation of the Department or the Minister, I am sorry to say. I hope that he and others have learned their lesson about the credibility of the Bill. It is right, proper and essential to consult all relevant bodies, but the prior consultees should always be the Members of this House and their interests in the matter.
</p>








<p><a name="st_516"><a name="41215-32_spnew2"><b> Mr. John Gummer  (Suffolk, Coastal) (Con):</b> 
 Does my hon. Friend agree that it is very difficult for us to reassure our constituents that their concerns are being properly heard in this House when the events of today show that the work has not been done, the papers have not been presented and we have not been involved, because of the incompetence of Ministers rather than an intention on their part to do wrong? We must be involved more effectively or our constituents feel disfranchised.
</p>








<p><a name="st_517"><a name="41215-32_spnew3"><b> Mr. Boswell: </b> 
 I have every sympathy with the remarks of my right hon. Friend on that point. I can understand why, in the circumstances, the Minister might want to get shot of the Bill and to pass it to his colleagues in the other place. I am sure that their lordships will do a good job of scrutiny on the Bill, but they are not the same as us and we still have an unfinished interest in it.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41215-32_para2">
<a name="stpa_331">The Minister was generous enough to mention that, as a result of pressure from Opposition Members in Committee, he has already carried out effective and useful improvements, especially in relation to the objectivity of the best interest test. I also acknowledge the introduction of the affirmative resolution procedure for any extension of the independent consultee service, which concerned many members of the Committee. However, every time one issue is resolved another aspect for concern arises. Ministers should not think that the list that I have given is a comprehensive one.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41215-32_para3">
<a name="stpa_332">The conclusion is that some progress has been made in considerations in this House, but the Bill is unfinished business and further safeguards are required. For that reason, although I support firmly the principle of the Bill, I cannot give it my support in the Lobby tonight.

 I share some of the concerns that the hon. Member for Daventry (Mr. Boswell) expressed, but I have not come to the same conclusion as to how I should cast my vote. If there is still room to improve the Bill through further scrutiny, albeit in the other place, we should allow it a Third Reading as long as the principles behind the Bill are sound and the purpose of the Bill is good&#151;which the hon.

<a name="stpa_333">I share the hon. Gentleman&#039;s concern about feeling like a bystander today on at least one aspect of the consideration of the Bill. The exchange of correspondence around the Chamber, which eventually became available to the Minister, was not the most desirable occurrence. It will have left many outside&#151;and some inside&#151;the House questioning the process that we have been through today.

 I want to record the fact that the hon. Member for Daventry (Mr. Boswell) and my hon. Friend the Minister have been helpful throughout the Bill&#039;s proceedings. Although some of this afternoon&#039;s events were unfortunate, the finger should not point directly at my hon. Friend.

</p>








<p><a name="st_523"><a name="41215-32_spnew9"><b> Mr. Burstow: </b> 
 The proof of the pudding is in the eating. As we do not have the amendments, we do not know quite what we have achieved. I want to make clear why I shall support the Bill in the Lobby.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41215-32_para5">
<a name="stpa_334">As the Minister rightly said, the measure has been 15&nbsp;years in the making, although some of today&#039;s comments were unfortunate, and the present law is confused and confusing. It allows people who lack capacity to be non-citizens because they lack rights and protections. It cannot be acceptable to leave the law as it currently is, which is why the Bill provides a necessary vehicle to give people far more control over their lives.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41215-32_para6">
<a name="stpa_335">The presumption of capacity is absolutely right. The principles set out at the beginning of the Bill have the potential to transform people&#039;s lives. They provide a framework in which those who act as proxies can, for the first time, take decisions with proper safeguards not only on health matters but also on welfare and finance. At present, those things are not clear and they need to be. The Bill provides the way to make them clear.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41215-32_para7">
<a name="stpa_336">We have strong support from Age Concern, the Alzheimer&#039;s Society, Mencap and many others who see the Bill as potentially transformative of the lives of people with learning disabilities, autism and Down&#039;s syndrome, but it is only a Bill with potential, as the Disability Rights Commission told us at Second Reading. There are still issues to be addressed and I hope that, in the other place, they will be.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41215-32_para8">
<a name="stpa_337">There is the question of equal consideration for those who lack capacity and those who have capacity. There is the interface with the Disability Discrimination Act 1995&nbsp;and the Disability Discrimination Bill. There is the need further to strengthen the provisions to ensure that a person who may lack capacity is given every possibility 

<br>&nbsp;<br>

<p>
<a name="41215-32_para9">
<a name="stpa_338">We had some useful exchanges on the question of independent consultees. We need to ensure that we end up with a system that is advocacy-plus rather than advocacy-lite, so that we really widen the scope of the role of independent consultees; for example, the system should pick up people who are befriended. We could also address the question of whether &quot;consultee&quot; is the right name. The Minister may ask, &quot;What is in a name?&quot;, but it is important to many organisations outside this place.

<a name="stpa_339">The hon. Member for Tiverton and Honiton (Mrs. Browning) tabled some important amendments in Committee.

We need that clarity and I hope that it will be forthcoming when the Mental Capacity Bill goes to the Lords. At present, people lack the safeguards they need.

<a name="41215-32_para11">
<a name="stpa_340">Advance decisions have been a key concern throughout the debate, and I welcome what the Minister said. If, at the very least, we are to codify advance decisions to refuse&#151;as the Bill would do&#151;they must be in writing. It is wrong that the Bill does not address that point and it should certainly be picked up in the other place.

<a name="stpa_341">The Bill advances the rights of those who lack capacity and, if we manage to address these issues in the other place, it will improve people&#039;s quality of life whether they lack capacity from birth or as a result of illness or accident.

I may be confused because of my age&#151;I therefore have a vested interest in the Bill&#151;but I am certain that my hon.

<p><a name="st_538"><a name="41215-34_spnew1"><b> Gregory Barker  (Bexhill and Battle) (Con):</b> 
 I start by thanking the Under-Secretary of State for Transport, the hon. Member for Staffordshire, Moorlands (Charlotte Atkins), not only for coming to the House this evening to answer my debate, but for the profoundly important decision that she made two weeks ago to allow the Bexhill link road to go ahead.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41215-34_para6">
<a name="stpa_352">A new route to join the A259&nbsp;to the A21&nbsp;is vital to my constituency and will reduce pollution and chronic congestion. The new proposal is on a smaller scale; nevertheless, it is a significant improvement on the old Hastings bypass. I know that the Minister had to examine the proposal carefully. However necessary any new road might be, important environmental considerations must always be weighed up. I am glad that she agreed with me and the vast majority of my constituents that in this case the benefits of the scheme significantly outweighed the costs.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41215-34_para7">
<a name="stpa_353">I know that the decision was a financial close call, as funding for new transport projects in our part of the country is limited, and the Minister had to turn down several competing projects. I am particularly grateful to her for taking the trouble to meet me and others from my area to listen to the arguments in person, before reaching her decision. Her courtesy and diligence will stand her in good stead as she climbs the ministerial ladder.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41215-34_para8">
<a name="stpa_354">The green light for the link road has come as a huge relief to my community. It is a major step forward in our endeavour to regenerate the economies of both Bexhill and Hastings, and with it to improve the life chances of so many local people. The link road is vital to the creation of new jobs and to the opening up of land to build sustainable homes for local families, and in so doing relieving pressure to build in villages in areas of outstanding natural beauty. First and foremost, the Minister&#039;s decision recognised that improved connectivity is crucial to the future of the whole area.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41215-34_para9">
<a name="stpa_355">It is almost unbelievable that at the same time as that historic decision to improve the road infrastructure of our area, the Government, through the Strategic Rail Authority, could even countenance axeing the direct train service to Gatwick, East Croydon and London from Bexhill and significantly downgrading the coastal rail service.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41215-34_para10">
<a name="stpa_356">Earlier this year, the SRA published a document entitled, &quot;Brighton Main Line, Route Utilisation Strategy&quot;, which has a nice picture of the clock at Brighton station on its cover. Richard Bowker&#039;s foreword to the document makes it clear that the document is primarily concerned with changes and improvements to the running of services from Brighton to London termini. Indeed, Mr. Bowker&#039;s foreword does not mention Bexhill, which gets a mention only towards the end of the executive summary.

<a name="stpa_361">That seemingly innocent afterthought to this completely Brighton-centred document would in fact have a devastating effect on the town of Bexhill were it allowed to be implemented. The psychological impact alone would be enormous. The net result of the proposal would be to lengthen the journey time to London and increase the scope for significant delays. Most importantly, however easy the SRA endeavours to make a platform change, the inescapable necessity of changing trains will have a profound effect on every passenger&#039;s willingness to use the train service.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41215-34_para16">
<a name="stpa_362">I appreciate that the principal aim of the route utilisation strategy is to improve performance, but there is very little in the SRA proposal that would be regarded by my constituents as an improvement, and a very great deal that would be seen as highly damaging. The whole town of Bexhill has been united in condemning these proposals, which saw the light of day only at the very end of the statutory consultation period.

<p>
<a name="41215-34_para17">
<a name="stpa_363">Opposition to the plans goes right across all political party boundaries, and they have been strongly criticised by Rother district council, Hastings borough council, East Sussex county council, the Bexhill town forum, the Bexhill chamber of commerce and the Hastings and Bexhill taskforce, on whose board I sit and whose other members include the South East England Development Agency and the Government office for the south-east. I want particularly to pay tribute to the energetic campaign of Rother district council&#039;s lead cabinet member for transport, Councillor Ian Jenkins, who was one of the first to spot the dangers that the proposals pose to Bexhill.

I can think of no other single act by an agency like yourselves that will ensure that these regeneration plans and the local economy goes rapidly into reverse. The &#163;6&nbsp;million spent on creating the biggest arts centre in the South East at Bexhill, the funding of the University Centre in Hastings, or improving Bexhill and Cooden railway stations will not lead to regeneration if the SRA&#039;s proposals mean that they make it very much more difficult for the public to reach them, or people to visit, live and work from Bexhill.&quot;</p>

<p>
<a name="41215-34_para23">
<a name="stpa_369">The Bexhill town forum has been equally vociferous in its opposition to the proposals. Mrs. Margaret Jones has made the forum&#039;s concerns clear to the SRA, reflecting its unanimous vote on 30&nbsp;November to oppose the SRA&#039;s plans. The forum is particularly concerned about the effect that the loss of a direct service from London will have on the De La Warr pavilion. The De La Warr will reopen next year, after an extensive refurbishment, as an international arts centre and the biggest contemporary art gallery in the south-east of England.

<p>
<a name="41215-34_para27">
<a name="stpa_373">We must not overlook the elderly population in Bexhill, who depend on the train service, especially its direct link to Gatwick airport. Bexhill has the second largest pensioner population in Britain and the highest proportion of over-80s in the south-east. The prospect of changing trains with suitcases and luggage would be a profound deterrent to those who do not wish to take the car to the airport.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41215-34_para28">
<a name="stpa_374">It is also vital when attracting new businesses into our area as part of the regeneration initiative that not only Bexhillians should enjoy direct rail access to Gatwick but foreign visitors landing at the airport should be able to enjoy direct rail access to Bexhill. The public transport policy officer at East Sussex county council rightly pointed out that the proposals are not only about cutting a direct link to London but proposed cuts to the volume of services.

<a name="41215-34_para29">
<a name="stpa_375">I should like efforts to be made to encourage more people off the roads and on to the trains. The proposals would have the opposite effect. The cuts, together with previous changes, have not happened anywhere else on the network on such a scale. Transport professionals have serious concerns about the proposed connection at either Eastbourne or Polegate. Previous promises about connecting trains from Brighton to Hove have not been kept and it is clear that a train coming along the coast would not wait for a delayed service from London, leaving Bexhillians who were travelling home absolutely stranded.

 I congratulate the hon. Member for Bexhill and Battle (Gregory Barker) on securing this debate, thus providing an opportunity for us to discuss rail services to Bexhill. I thank him, too, for his kind remarks about the approval of the link road a few days ago.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41215-35_para0">
<a name="stpa_390">Bexhill is currently served by the Brighton to Hastings stopping service, which runs at a frequency of two trains an hour for most of the day on Mondays to Saturdays. An hourly direct service to and from London Victoria runs seven days a week. It is also possible to travel to Ashford, destinations along the south coast and other London termini such as Charing Cross, Waterloo East and London Bridge by changing at Hastings, St. Leonards, Warrior Square and Brighton. At present, those services use a mixture of mark 1&nbsp;slam-door rolling stock and modern air-conditioned rolling stock. Most of the older rolling stock will be replaced by the end of 2004, and all of it will be replaced by mid-2005. The performance of the services that serve Bexhill is measured by the public performance measure published by the Strategic Rail Authority in &quot;National Rail Trends&quot;. In the past year, 81.8&nbsp;per cent. of trains arrived at their destination at the time shown in the timetable or within five minutes of that time. By comparison, the figure was 84.6&nbsp;per cent. in the previous year, and 84.5&nbsp;per cent. for all London and south-east commuter service operators. The slightly lower level of performance this year, especially when compared with that of similar operators, can be attributed to the teething problems of the new rolling stock and the growing unreliability of the mark 1&nbsp;slam-door trains, which are being replaced. Most of those teething problems have now been overcome, certainly in the operation of trains, although further work on heating and air conditioning systems is still needed. Clearly, that does not affect train performance, although it does affect quality and thus passenger satisfaction with train journeys. When all the new rolling stock is in service it is expected that train performance will improve.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41215-35_para1">
<a name="stpa_391">The SRA&#039;s Brighton main line route utilisation strategy clearly aims to improve the performance of train services and ensure that optimum use is made of available train and network capacity. We have set the SRA tight affordability constraints and it must demonstrate that any changes are financially robust. It proposes that one stopping train an hour between Brighton and Ore will call at Bexhill, and one fast train 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>15 Dec 2004 : Column 1646</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>an hour from Brighton to Ashford will also call there. Two trains an hour will operate between London Victoria and Eastbourne. They will run up to ten minutes faster, but they will not serve Bexhill directly. Passengers from Bexhill who wished to travel to Gatwick airport, East Croydon and London Victoria would have to change at either Eastbourne or Polegate.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41215-35_para2">
<a name="stpa_392">The level of service from Hastings and St. Leonards to London Bridge, London Waterloo East and London Charing Cross via Tonbridge is not affected by the Brighton main line rail utilisation strategy proposals. The SRA accepts that changing trains will inconvenience through passengers and risks discouraging people from making their journeys by rail. It is, however, working on making the connections between the Ashford to Brighton and the Eastbourne to London train as seamless as possible. By changing at Polegate, passengers would not have to cross the footbridge. They would alight from the train, wait on the platform and board the following train. The direct train service from Bexhill to Lewes would be reduced to two trains an hour, rather than three, but the direct link to the county town would be retained.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41215-35_para3">
<a name="stpa_393">One of the SRA&#039;s reasons for reducing the train service east of Eastbourne is the low level of patronage. The figures for travel between Bexhill and London&#151;both Charing Cross and Victoria&#151;suggest that there are, on average, approximately eight people per train travelling in each direction from Bexhill to London. Some of those passengers are presumably going via St. Leonards, so the number using the Brighton line service to Victoria is fewer than eight per train. In total, about 12&nbsp;people per train travel from stations between Eastbourne and Hastings to stations on the Brighton main line, so in practice those are the only people who will be inconvenienced by the SRA&#039;s proposals for changes to the service.
</p>








<p><a name="st_540"><a name="41215-35_spnew0"><b> Gregory Barker: </b> 
 Does the Minister accept that average figures can often be misleading as to the pattern of travel? If she goes to Bexhill early in the morning and takes the 6.34&nbsp;train, for example, she will find it packed with commuters, many of whom do not buy tickets, but buy season tickets in London and therefore do not show up in the figures that she quoted. I accept that on a wet Friday afternoon, very few people will be travelling on that link, but at peak times those trains are absolutely full.
</p>








<p><a name="st_541"><a name="41215-35_spnew1"><b> Charlotte Atkins: </b> 
 I appreciate the point that the hon. Gentleman is making. I thought that he said that 12&nbsp;people were travelling on that early train from Bexhill.

 That is from Cooden Beach&#151;one station. There are five stations along the coastal strip in my constituency, the principal one being Bexhill. The gentleman who wrote in travelled from Cooden Beach station, which is one of the minor stations that are threatened.

<a name="stpa_394">We understand that any direct service that is replaced by a connecting service might suffer a passenger reduction, but I think that the hon.

</p>

<p>
<a name="41215-35_para5">
<a name="stpa_395">One of the main recurring points relates to the effects of the Brighton main line route utilisation strategy proposals on the demography, economy and regeneration of Bexhill and Hastings. We are aware that significant regeneration efforts are being made&#151;the hon. Gentleman mentioned the link road, where the issue of regeneration was clearly crucial and that the De La Warr pavilion is being reconstructed&#151;to encourage significant numbers of visitors to travel to the area by train.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41215-35_para6">
<a name="stpa_396">It has also been mentioned that it is desirable that links to educational and arts establishments are provided and it has been suggested that there is the need for direct access to the transport and business hubs of Gatwick airport, Clapham Junction and East Croydon. Any route utilisation strategy is focused on improving performance and better use of track and train capacity, within the constraints of affordability. The SRA&#151;this is reflected in its appraisal guidelines&#151;examines only measures which might be taken to improve the efficiency and viability of the railway.
</p>








<p><a name="st_544"><a name="41215-35_spnew4"><b> Gregory Barker: </b> 
 The argument about regeneration&#151;the Minister knows well what Bexhill and Hastings face in terms of regeneration&#151;can be deployed where roads are concerned, but rail is a much more environmentally sensitive form of transport and the regeneration argument, or wider arguments, cannot be deployed. A narrow, stand-alone, financial case must be made. Surely the same wider arguments that can be deployed in favour of building a road ought to be deployed in favour of rail.

<p><a name="st_545"><a name="41215-35_spnew5"><b> Charlotte Atkins: </b>

<a name="stpa_397">The SRA met several local stakeholders affected by the Brighton main line route utilisation strategy proposals before the consultation document was launched. Those meetings were generally at the county council or regional assembly level. The SRA noted the apparent lack of information dissemination by some of those stakeholders, which it recognises as a problem, and that will be addressed directly with stakeholders in all future SRA work.

<a name="stpa_398">We have given directions and guidance to the SRA to develop the capacity of the railway, both of the trains and the network, so that they are both utilised to the maximum. In doing so, it must have very strong regard to the cost-effectiveness and affordability of services. We are not seeking to close any stations or lines, but we are aiming to rationalise services, which may mean that some previously through services will now involve a change of trains. The SRA is working to ensure that those changes are as smooth and trouble-free for passengers as possible, as it and we are aware that some passengers are actively discouraged from using trains if they have to change. We hope that the increased punctuality and reliability of services and the reduction in journey times, even including the time taken to change trains, together with the new modern rolling stock fleet, will encourage existing passengers to continue to use trains and encourage others to do so.

 The Minister rightly talks about encouraging passengers to use the train service, on which I agree. Why, then, has the SRA told me that it is precluded, when making its assumptions on future train use, from taking advantage of any forecast of increased growth? It is not allowed to take into account the planned homes that are to be built&#151;nearly 2,000, thanks to the Minister&#039;s link road&#151;or the additional hundreds of thousands of tourists who will come into the area to visit the De La Warr. The only figures that it is using in its financial model are historic figures, which incorporate a period when the De La Warr was closed.

 On that detailed point, the best thing that I can do is write to the hon. Gentleman, which I am happy to do.

<a name="stpa_399">The SRA aims to publish the final route utilisation strategy for the Brighton main line next spring, and I am sure that the hon. Gentleman will feed in both his comments and those of his constituents before that time.
