That is why we have worked so closely with the American Administration in recent weeks to ensure that there is a genuinely common approach to the issue, why I will take the opportunity this week to meet President Zardari of Pakistan, and why it is not coincidental that we published our Afghan country plan simultaneously with the Prime Minister making a statement to the House on the regional response.

The Prime Minister, the Foreign Secretary and the International Development Secretary continue to raise that issue&#151;the need for reform, starting with the release of Aung San Suu Kyi&#151;at every opportunity.

 My right hon. Friend raises an important issue. We know that many schools in Zimbabwe have not opened this year. Teachers are rightly demanding salaries in hard currency and poor Zimbabweans cannot go to schools that charge in US dollars. That emphasises the importance of the Government&#146;s rebuilding the education system, starting with paying teachers properly so that they turn up to teach the children of Zimbabwe. The good news is that, through UNICEF, we have ensured, with United Kingdom support, that more than 100,000 orphans and vulnerable children remain in school.

 Part of the extra support made available by us, both in the past and most recently, to strengthen health systems is about ensuring that the Zimbabwean health system has the capacity to tackle HIV/AIDS properly. We also want the new President in South Africa to remain committed to the new approach to HIV/AIDS there, which does not just affect attitudes in that country, but affects attitudes to how HIV/AIDS is tackled across the African continent. Our support for strengthening the health system means that we hope for a rapid improvement in the fight against HIV/AIDS.</p>

The Red Cross was able to unload 25 tonnes of food into the conflict area by boat on Saturday.

Afghanistan in the last week. They were: Sergeant Benjamin Ross of the 3rd Regiment the Royal Military Police; Corporal Sean Binnie of the 3rd Battalion the Royal Regiment of Scotland, the Black Watch; Rifleman Adrian Sheldon of the 2nd Battalion the Rifles; Corporal Kumar Pun of the 1st Battalion the Royal Gurkha Rifles; and a soldier from the 1st Battalion the Welsh Guards, who died yesterday of wounds sustained in Afghanistan at the weekend.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o3"><a name="90513-0002.htm_para0"><a name="09051352000085">I have been fortunate enough to witness at first hand the bravery, professionalism and dedication of our soldiers from every battalion fighting for us in Afghanistan. We are determined to ensure that we can be a force for good in helping the people of Afghanistan and protecting the security of people in Britain and the wider world. These men, and all those who have lost their lives in conflict, deserve our profound gratitude. Their service will never be forgotten.</p>

Laing O&#146;Rourke, a major construction firm in my constituency, has just announced that it is taking on several hundred extra apprentices this year, but unemployment nationally remains extremely worrying. What can my right hon. Friend do to invest in skills and jobs to ensure that we are well placed when we come out of the recession? I am sure that he would agree that unemployment is never a price worth paying.</p>

 In answer to my hon. Friend&#146;s first point, our responsibility is to create a system of MPs&#146; allowances that is transparent and will be seen by the country as wholly fair. We must prove ourselves worthy of the public&#146;s trust. We must apologise for the mistakes that have been made. We must rectify all the errors that have happened, and we must reconstruct the system in a way that the public will see as building confidence in the political process. I believe that the steps that were taken last night by the Members&#146; Allowances Committee were the first important steps in dealing with this matter for the whole of the House together.</p>

Friend is absolutely right: any unemployment is a tragedy in any area of the country, and it is our duty to do everything we can to help those people who are unemployed. Where people are being taken on, there is help available. Where people are on short time, we are providing help through the working tax credit and through training allowances. For where people have become unemployed, we have announced today the details of a scheme under which, for all 18 to 24-year-olds who are unemployed and out of work, there will be an offer after a year of training or of work. I am grateful that social entrepreneurs, as well as charitable organisations, are already involved in the offer of work. We aim to provide 150,000 jobs as a result of the initiative that is being taken today.</p>

 Yes, Mr. Speaker, I understand that the Committee on Members&#146; Allowances is looking at the issue. I think it important for there to be a transparent system so that when a claim is reported to the Fees Office, the Fees Office can itself put it on the internet.

By doing that for all MPs over a period of four years, we can show the public that we have taken every necessary action to deal with any anomalies, to repair them, and at the same time to build the confidence in the political system that is necessary for the future. I believe that this is a matter in which all parties will want to be engaged, and it is important that we deal with it now.</p>

 Of course I agree with the Prime Minister that we should all support the Kelly commission and the work that it is doing, and yes, we should all support the idea of establishing a committee to look back over the last four years, but is there not a problem with this, and does it not show that we need to get on with things now? If we just ask a committee whether everyone has obeyed the rules, it will take a long time to investigate and will then, I think, find&#151;surprise, surprise&#151;that everyone has obeyed the rules. The issue is not so much about whether the rules were obeyed as about the rules themselves. How much needs to be paid back is not really a legal issue; it is a moral and an ethical issue, and it requires some political leadership to sort it out. Does the Prime Minister not understand that?</p>

Let us be honest: taxpayers are effectively paying out thousands of pounds so we can all tell our constituents what a wonderful job we are all doing. We have all done it; we all know the facts.

I hope that, on reflection, the right hon.

I shall come back to report any progress that we can make to resolve this highly unsatisfactory situation.</p>

 On a point of order, Mr. Speaker. We have focused today on events with regard to Sri Lanka and the Tamil demonstrators, but over recent years there have been a number of demonstrations of different kinds.

 On a point of order, Mr. Speaker. The Joint Committee on Human Rights produced a report on policing and protest a few weeks ago, and one of our recommendations was that there should be no surprises, either from demonstrators or in the policing of demonstrations. We also stressed the importance of dialogue between police and demonstrators. In the light of that, would you consider inviting organisers of the Tamil protest to meet the people whom you are seeing later today, to discuss terms of reference for the demonstration?</p>

 I am meeting the people with responsibility in this matter, but who they write to is up to them.

</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o24"><a name="90513-0004.htm_para6"><a name="09051352000171">Eighteen years ago, an 11-year-old boy from my constituency, Jonathan Smith, was killed during an away game of the Witham under-12s. Jonathan was swinging from the crossbar when the goalpost fell on him, ruptured his heart and left his family devastated. Since his death, Jonathan&#146;s mother, Brenda Smith, who is here today watching the presentation of this Bill, has fought a tireless campaign to improve the safety of goalposts.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o25"><a name="90513-0004.htm_para7"><a name="09051352000172">I pay tribute to the hon. Member for Waveney (Mr. Blizzard), who secured a debate on this important subject in Westminster Hall in January 2000. Nine years on, however, there is still no legislation to improve goalpost safety standards.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o26"><a name="90513-0004.htm_para8"><a name="09051352000173">The beautiful game has a devoted following in all parts of the House. Many of us, including, I am sure, the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport, are wary of imposing new rules, regulations or requirements on the game, its clubs, supporters or amateur players, but my Bill is not an example of health and safety gone mad. I am not talking about professional football, or families having a kickabout in their back yard, and I am not out to ruin anyone&#146;s fun. As a passionate Newcastle United fan and father of five, I do not need to be told how important football is to young people. I know only too well that millions of people regularly enjoy playing football, and we need to encourage them to do so, but we also need appropriate legislation to help to keep them safe.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o27"><a name="90513-0004.htm_para9"><a name="09051352000174">It is true that some progress has already been made. We now have a good British Standards Institution standard, an up-and-running scheme to replace unsafe goalposts, some growing publicity, and letters of support for Brenda Smith from Her Majesty the Queen, sports personalities and the Football Association, among others.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o28"><a name="90513-0004.htm_para10"><a name="09051352000175">In 2005, a new BSI standard was introduced. The Football Foundation says that</p>
<a name="90513-0004.htm_brev1"><a name="09051352001373"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;the standard is good, the standard is solid&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o29"><a name="90513-0004.htm_para11"><a name="09051352000176">Nevertheless, manufacturers and buyers are only recommended to comply with it. In addition, the FA distributed more than 1 million leaflets to help clubs, schools and councils to understand better the risks posed by unsafe goalposts and how safety measures should be applied practice.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o30"><a name="90513-0004.htm_para12"><a name="09051352000177">The Football Foundation operates an excellent scheme, which allows any FA-affiliated club, local authority, school, community group or club in the national league system step 7 and below to apply for a 50 per cent. grant to replace any of their goalposts that do not adhere to the recognised BSI standard. However, my Bill seeks to go a step further, by making the replacement of any goalposts that do not meet the BSI standard mandatory by 2012. That will include goalposts used on property owned by councils, schools and clubs.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o31"><a name="90513-0004.htm_para13"><a name="09051352000178">The Bill will target in particular goalposts made before 1996&#151;the year in which British standards were first produced for goalposts. Despite the introduction of those standards, the FA says that some schools still use, for example, wooden goalposts, which are not illegal, but which do pose a threat to the children using them. Other unsafe goalposts include those that are corroded, rusted or free-standing, or those with metal cuphooks on the posts of crossbars.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o32"><a name="90513-0004.htm_para14"><a name="09051352000179">In 2005, the FA identified approximately 15,000 goalposts that did not meet the BSI standard. The Football Foundation has, to date, offered 3,192 grants with a value of nearly &#163;2 million. As the grants can be offered for multiple goalposts, they have enabled about one third of the unsafe goalposts identified to be replaced. That is an admirable achievement, but more can be done.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o33"><a name="90513-0004.htm_para15"><a name="09051352000180">I admit that I was surprised when I first became aware of the risk posed by unsafe goalposts. Since Jonathan&#146;s death in 1991, at least 10 other children in the UK and many others worldwide have been killed by falling goalposts. Even more have been injured, suffering broken limbs, bruising and fractured skulls, often leaving permanent damage and disfiguring scars. Adults, too, have also been injured in the same way: I recently heard from the parents of another constituent who, 10 years ago, when she was in her mid-20s, had an unsecured goalpost land on her, causing severe injuries for which she is receiving treatment to this day. I am sure that other hon. Members have similar stories.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o34"><a name="90513-0004.htm_para16"><a name="09051352000181">The Football Association says that one of the biggest problems is when children swing on goalposts, and I suppose that one answer is to admit that it is difficult to stop children wanting to play on goalposts. Nevertheless, we can minimise the risk as far as possible by ensuring that goalposts are fit for purpose, properly installed and well maintained.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o35"><a name="90513-0004.htm_para17"><a name="09051352000182">The goalpost that killed my constituent&#146;s son, Jonathan, was simply made of scaffold poles welded together, weighing 200 lb, that were not fixed to the ground. Jonathan was playing in a game for under-12s, who weigh perhaps 60 or 70 lb; they would not have been at risk if purpose-built, lightweight plastic or aluminium goalposts had been in use. Installation and maintenance is as important as manufacture; indeed, the current Football Foundation scheme insists on professional installation and offers training in proper maintenance techniques. Local authorities already have to organise an independent annual check on the conditions of their own pitches. I believe it would be a simple matter to ensure that the safety of the goalposts was also checked at this time.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o36"><a name="90513-0004.htm_para18"><a name="09051352000183">The Government have argued that enough has already been done and that a voluntary code will suffice. In a  <br>

letter sent to my constituent, Brenda Smith, in September last year, the Department for Culture, Media and Sport said that the Government still</p>
<a name="90513-0004.htm_brev2"><a name="09051352001374"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;do not have any current plans to introduce legislation covering this area&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o37"><a name="90513-0004.htm_para19"><a name="09051352000184">I agree that support, guidelines and recommendations are a major step forward in creating good practice, but we can do more to ensure that no other family has to mourn losing a child who should have been celebrating winning a football game.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o38"><a name="90513-0004.htm_para20"><a name="09051352000185">Other countries have taken more robust action on this issue. The New South Wales Government in Australia passed legislation prohibiting the manufacture of goalposts that did not meet strict criteria. This guarantees that goalposts cannot fall or tip over, and that they are of a limited weight and force.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o39"><a name="90513-0004.htm_para21"><a name="09051352000186">I never imagined that I would suggest to the House that France is a country that has anything to teach us about the beautiful game, but the French have legislated for a safety standard that makes the manufacture, distribution or use of non-standard goalposts illegal. I am sure that when it comes to goalpost safety, even my hon. Friend the Member for Stone (Mr. Cash) would not object to our following the French lead.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o40"><a name="90513-0004.htm_para22"><a name="09051352000187">Given the simple and accessible scheme already in operation, 2012 is a realistic target. The year of the London Olympics is also an important symbolic target, proving that we have a commitment to grass-roots sports and that we care as much for safety as for success. That would be a great British Olympic legacy.</p>

Well, it is now 18 years since Brenda Smith lost her son&#151;and that is not just the long term, but a whole lifetime. I hope that I will receive the support of all hon.

 I am following the logic of the hon. Gentleman&#146;s amendment, which is reasoned and, on the whole, has much to be said for it. If one starts to consult before putting proposals in a Bill, however, it is almost impossible to get anything down before it is publicised and various wrecking attacks are made on it.

 The hon. Gentleman makes an important point, but as we discussed in yesterday&#146;s debate on corporation tax, businesses are angry and frustrated about the lack of consultation before measures are announced, and that is one of the factors that makes Britain a difficult place in which to do business. They want a predictable, certain tax system, in which matters are clearly flagged, and they want more consultation, before legislation is introduced rather than after. From the direction of travel of HMRC, businesses had no sense that the measure was likely to be included in the Bill.</p>

The thrust of my amendment is that we need to get the proposals right, and we need time to do so. If senior accounting officers are to sign off on whether they have appropriate systems of tax accounting for financial periods starting effectively from when the Bill is passed, they will need guidance. They will need to comply for the whole year, and they will have only a matter of weeks before they must know what is meant by the proposal. I would be pleased if the Financial Secretary followed my amendment and decided to defer implementation by a year. That would achieve the objective of the hon.

 My hon. Friend is absolutely right. We have talked about large companies, and there is also the issue of limited liability partnerships.

What happens if the parent company is overseas and it has a very flat structure, with lots of operating companies in this country? Does each one have to complete a certificate?

 Indeed, and the hon. Gentleman makes an important point about those powers. Perhaps when the Financial Secretary responds, he could say whether he expects draft regulations to have been published by the time we debate schedule 46. It would be helpful if that did happen, because given the nature of the consultation that has taken place to date, we would not feel comfortable passing legislation without having seen a draft of the statutory instruments that will implement the detail of the measure. The issue is not just one of consultation. It is about what the measure means in practice. How far does it go?

Auditors will rely on the systems and controls in place to ensure that the accounts are drawn up on a proper basis. The Companies Acts also confer duties on directors to keep adequate accounting records, and there are penalties if they misfile. There are already obligations on companies to ensure that the tax charge and tax balances figures that appear in their accounts are based on proper accounting systems, so it is not clear how much further the Government are seeking to go in imposing additional duties on senior accounting officers.

Industry feels that that process has been much more open than it perhaps was historically. Guidance on tax compliance risk management is now published as an HMRC manual. It makes it clear that systems have become a key issue in moving corporates away from high risk and towards low risk. There has been a pilot scheme involving detailed systems reviews of 10 large corporates, and numerous other systems discussions are going on with large corporates, both within HMRC&#146;s large business service and outside that unit in the local compliance large and complex teams.</p>

Also under that Act, there is an obligation on corporate businesses to provide reasonable assistance to HMRC&#146;s information technology auditors. There are already significant obligations on companies to work with HMRC, so it is not clear, from a tax angle&#151;let alone from the angle of the normal responsibilities placed on a company through the Companies Acts&#151;what more HMRC is looking for through the powers in the Bill.</p>

 The hon.

There may not be a specific obligation relating to tax accounting, but there are already broad responsibilities placed on directors to maintain proper accounting records. HMRC needs to justify why it is going beyond the existing tax and legal obligations on companies to provide proper tax accounting systems.  <br>

It is not clear where it applies in the case that we are considering. Clearly, the fact that the Government introduced the proposal suggests that the level of materiality in company accounts is not sufficient: otherwise, they would not have needed to include the clause.

Let us say that, on his watch, there was a problem with record-keeping in a particular company for four or five years; that person could be asked for &#163;20,000 or &#163;25,000.

Despite the fact that I am a chartered accountant, and although I sit at annual general meetings and check that the accounts add up, in the anal way that accountants have, I did not crosscheck the calculations.

the proposed regime, but it is a large business&#151;be accountable for somebody at the till making such a manual calculation on a calculator? I think John Lewis programmed its tills properly, so perhaps that is an unfair example. Any big retailer that did not have time to programme its systems after something unexpected happened, such as the VAT cut, would be dependent upon somebody with a calculator to calculate the reduction at the till. Is that material or immaterial? To my mind it is immaterial. If there was a systemic problem in calculating the VAT cut, I suspect that that might be moving towards material, but we need some guidance on materiality.</p>

Although I understand the hon.

 That is fine, but there is already an obligation on directors to maintain proper books of records. They already have to sign off the accounts. If there was no responsibility anywhere in the business for signing off the books and records or for signing off the accounts, that would be a valid point. That is probably why it is in the Companies Act already. But we are going beyond the existing requirements, to create a new obligation on senior accounting officers, and I query the need for that move, given all the checks and balances that are in place already through the directors&#146; statutory duties, the audit and the work that HMRC is doing with large corporates on risk management.

 I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for his generosity in giving way. There is almost a clash of backgrounds here, but I think it is helpful. In the safety field, similarly, there is a panoply of legislation going back to the Factories Acts, the Factories Act 1961, the Health and Safety at Work etc. Act 1974 and so on, and the law of negligence stemming from the seminal case of Donoghue <i> v.</i> Stevenson in the 1930s. Having a nominated director seems to focus the mind of the organisation, even though there is that legislative background and all those duties exist.

 Behind the measure lies the particular role that the chief financial officer plays in a company. He is the ultimate point of accountability. That is why, in all the companies with which I have been involved, small ones and some comparatively large ones, the chief financial officer has always had the right of appealing direct to the board as a whole, quite apart from the chairman, and to the chairman, but separate from the executive officer. The provision is, in a sense, an extension of the very particular position that the chief financial officer has in relation to an extremely sensitive issue. The Bill is trying to take that a little further by imposing a sanction&#151;which will no doubt be covered by an indemnity&#151;so that the responsibility is registered personally, as all financial matters are and as the hon.

<p><a name="stpa_o67"><a name="90513-0006.htm_para1"><a name="09051352000241">The issue reminded me of a debate that I had with the current Secretary of State for Children, Schools and Families when he was the Economic Secretary to the Treasury. On that occasion, we debated the Investment, Exchanges and Clearings Houses Bill, which was introduced as an attempt to avoid imposing extra-territoriality on UK businesses, triggered by concerns about the impact of Sarbanes-Oxley. I am therefore rather surprised that the Government have used that legislation to back up this measure, because, at the time, the right hon.

I do not know whether the Government intend to tackle that, but there is a real problem in making a chief finance officer sign off responsibility for the whole company. I understand from my right hon. Friend the Financial Secretary that we are targeting the very biggest companies.

 I am pleased that we seem to have forced a concession from the Financial Secretary. Again, it illustrates the point about ill-thought-through measures and lack of consultation. If the Government had thought matters through properly, the regulatory impact assessment would be better defined than it was when the Financial Secretary signed it off on 20 April. If he is already seeking to narrow the scope, is it a sign that things are coming apart? It demonstrates the weakness of the approach of rushing into something and having to unravel it afterwards.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o81"><a name="90513-0006.htm_para15"><a name="09051352000263">We had the same experience in last year&#146;s Finance Bill on the treatment of residence and domicile.

We were assured that it was the last legislation on the matter, yet&#151;lo and behold&#151;this year&#146;s Finance Bill includes more provisions on residence and domicile as a consequence of lack of consultation.

 Let me reinforce the point that the hon. Member for Coventry, North-West (Mr. Robinson) made. I was with one public limited company, which had 140 units in the UK and one overseas, for five years. It would have been extraordinary if the finance director had been expected to spend half his time examining 139 units and the other half looking at one unit, simply to understand the one overseas operation.</p>

Is it simply straightforward accounting for day-to-day transactions and the normal run of business, or are we looking at a layer of tax planning above day-to-day transactions?

The proposed measure is disproportionate because it applies a potentially onerous personal liability on all the senior accounting officers ab initio. HMRC&#146;s risk analysis procedures should identify the small number of large companies that do not have adequate accounting systems to prepare a correct and complete return. Rather than introduce this measure, if HMRC is concerned about internal accounting systems it would make more sense to extend the existing declaration that is required on the corporation tax return.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o84"><a name="90513-0006.htm_para18"><a name="09051352000268">That is a balanced criticism of the provision, which has been hastily introduced with inadequate consultation. There are many grey areas, yet companies will be required to comply with it from an accounting period that starts the day after the Bill receives Royal Assent, without sight of draft secondary legislation. In the interests of maintaining industry&#146;s confidence in HMRC and ensuring that HMRC knows what it is doing, the reason for doing it and what the costs and benefits are, we should delay implementation until the first anniversary of the Bill&#146;s passage.</p>

 I want briefly to take up a few points in the light of that discussion. I shall start from the same point as the Conservative spokesman. Clearly, there must be a great deal of consultation on this provision, and it should not be implemented until the consultation has ironed out the bulk of the problems that are bound to be associated with it. However, I put it to the hon. Member for Fareham (Mr. Hoban) that if we consulted in detail on legislation like this before including it in a Bill, we would never get the Bill, because of the attitude of those who, understandably, do not want any form of additional regulation, bureaucratic control or paperwork, or any of the costs that the hon. Member for Dundee, East (Stewart Hosie) identified. We would never get there, so it is much more sensible to produce something first. HMRC is in touch with all companies&#146; accounting officers. It knows what it is after, and the companies do, too&#151;and that knowledge is built into what is before us. It is not as though the provision had been plucked out of the air&#151;although it may sometimes suit the Opposition to suggest that that is the case.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o85"><a name="90513-0006.htm_para19"><a name="09051352000270">The time to deal with the detail will be when the Bill goes into Committee upstairs. The companies meet HMRC in between the Committee sittings&#151;that is how it always happens&#151;and I am sure that the Government will be open to amendment, where appropriate. The hon. Member for Fareham makes a good case for consultation, which does happen, but he gets it the wrong way round if he thinks that we could have such detailed consultation before including anything in the Bill.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o86"><a name="90513-0006.htm_para20"><a name="09051352000271">However, I think that a year&#146;s delay would be sensible, if there were agreement on that&#151;but whether the Government would go that far, I do not know.</p>

However, that regulation did no good for the sector that was about to blow up in the United States, whereas our light-touch regulation is now being blamed for what happened here.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o89"><a name="90513-0006.htm_para23"><a name="09051352000278">What clearly went wrong was that people were not being intelligent about regulation&#151;that is what it comes down to&#151;and neither were the central banks. Although we took away regulation from the Bank of England and gave it to the Financial Services Authority, the Bank still had an overall direct responsibility. I remember Eddie George saying, &#147;I&#146;m afraid of a systemic collapse,&#148; which is why he wanted that responsibility, and the money for it. That responsibility was clearly left with the Bank of England when we made that change.

That is what happened in the United States. If we do not focus intelligently on the area that poses a threat to the economy, we will do no good, whatever sort of regulation we have, however many people we have and however many pieces of legislation we have to back it up.</p>

 May I give my hon. Friend an example? The Canadian banking system has been far stronger than the banking systems in the USA or the United Kingdom. However, in Canada, under the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions, there is less regulation. Banking is more heavily regulated in the USA, but the Canadians take a risk-based approach, on the basis that: &#147;We know risk when we smell it and we&#146;ll get in there.&#148; It is not just a question of regulation; it is a question of philosophy.</p>

I am sure that the Government will listen hard to what the industry says, and I am sure that we can get things right. As for why we are focusing on tax as we are, to me that does not pose the sort of problem that it seems to pose for the hon. Member for Fareham. In view of the multiplicity of taxation arrangements burgeoning throughout the world, I can quite understand the position of the United States Government under President Obama and that of the German and French Governments, who have always been strong on this issue, and why we have a particular focus in the UK on strengthening tax function and tax accountability; the words in the Bill speak of all this. It seems inevitable that that should be part of the review that we are having, when so much of the tax take appears to be disappearing overseas. I am not sure that that is directly linked, but I cannot help but feel that it is part of the mentality that has led to this part of the Bill.</p>

The chief finance office should be clearly seen to have an independent role in accounting to the board. When my right hon. Friend the Financial Secretary puts the Government&#146;s case, I wonder whether he could tell us whether it is automatically assumed that the chief finance office will be a board member, because the Bill refers to officers or directors. It is terribly important that the person charged with that responsibility should be a director, not some officer who can escape a sense of personal responsibility. A finance office in a major British multinational or international company will feel a heavy personal commitment and a personal burden, which he will have to bear in the interests of the whole company, with a direct responsibility enshrined in law and a fine attached, related to the performance of that function. If a finance officer were to be fined, in all probability he would seek and obtain an indemnity from the company, and rightly so. Nevertheless, the fact that he has been fined will weigh heavily on him, if he is responsible in the exercise of his duties, and therefore reinforce the general sense  <br>

of this part of the Bill, and the general purpose for which the Government have introduced it&#151;and I am pleased to see it there.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o93"><a name="90513-0007.htm_para1"><a name="09051352000284">I am sure that the Financial Secretary will reassure us on the need for consultation and the other matters that the industry will bring to him in due course. We look forward to hearing what he has to tell us in that respect.</p>

<p><a name="st_o151"><a name="09051352000285"><a name="90513-0007.htm_spnew0"><a name="09051352001587"><b>Mr. Jeremy Browne (Taunton) (LD):</b>
 The proposals are far-reaching in their implications and were introduced without meaningful notice or consultation. I have received representations from groups such as the Chartered Institute of Taxation and the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales, and from companies such as PricewaterhouseCoopers. They have raised a series of concerns with me, as they no doubt have with MPs from all parties, about the potential implications of what we are considering, including what they regard as possibly unforeseen implications. Indeed, the hon. Member for Fareham (Mr. Hoban) read out a quotation from the Institute of Chartered Accountants that summed up those concerns precisely.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o94"><a name="90513-0007.htm_para2"><a name="09051352000286">I propose to highlight three concerns that my party and I have about the Government&#146;s proposals, and then to suggest how we might deal with them. The first concern is about the aspect of personal liability. All parties in the House would wish to see companies that failed to comply with the law dealt with accordingly, but the Government&#146;s proposal makes a distinction between the organisation and the individual. The hon. Member for Poole (Mr. Syms) asked what implications that might have, and whether they might go further than the Government envisaged. It is therefore important to explore the aspect of personal liability in greater depth in Committee.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o95"><a name="90513-0007.htm_para3"><a name="09051352000287">Our second concern is about the lack of clear definition. Paragraph 8 of schedule 46 says that only the most recent senior accounting officer will be liable, but there will still be issues if errors have been made in the past. If the most recent senior accounting officer has been in post only for a short period, the provision may not be so satisfactory, whereas if he or she has been in post for a long time, we would be able to go back much further. There is therefore some doubt about how the provision will apply in practice.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o96"><a name="90513-0007.htm_para4"><a name="09051352000288">No one knows what HMRC thinks will constitute adequate or accurate reporting systems. One person&#146;s idea of adequacy may be markedly different from another person&#146;s. Indeed, in accountancy, one person&#146;s idea of accuracy may occasionally be different from another person&#146;s idea of accuracy. As far as I am aware, no guidelines have been published so far to clarify those points.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o97"><a name="90513-0007.htm_para5"><a name="09051352000289">My final point about the lack of definition is about the implications for UK multinationals based primarily in this country&#151;a point that was made earlier. However, I do not think that the following point has been made: what if the senior accounting officer is not based in the United Kingdom, even if most of the company is? How will the law work in practice then?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o98"><a name="90513-0007.htm_para6"><a name="09051352000290">The third area of concern that I have identified in gathering together the themes that others have expressed to me relates to the regulatory burden and the costs involved. The rules will be up and running from October, and there is genuine anxiety that this does not provide a  <br>


<meta name="Date" content="13 May 2009">

fair period for companies to respond and incorporate the new rules into their practices. My understanding is that the Government say that the new arrangements merely formalise the procedure that is often observed by companies, but all the representations that have been made to me by the industry bodies that I have just named suggest that the legislation goes further than that. There are also questions about the cost to business and the anticipated extra yield to the Exchequer, and about whether the additional money raised will be sufficient to justify the potential additional cost to business.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o99"><a name="90513-0007.htm_para7"><a name="09051352000291">Those are my concerns, based on my discussions with others. Thinking through these issues as carefully as I can has led me to come up with four brief guiding principles for seeking to address the situation. First, my party believes that we should support measures to improve accountancy procedures in the interest of transparency. Everyone would accept that we want to see companies complying with the law in a transparent way, and not unreasonably trying to avoid their obligations.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o100"><a name="90513-0007.htm_para8"><a name="09051352000292">I completely understand the Government&#146;s desire to maximise the tax yield within the laws of this country, particularly when we have such an enormous public deficit. The need for the Government to raise money is obvious for all to see. We also recognise, however, that there are many concerns over the wording, the short notice period, the regulatory burden and the personal penalties in schedule 46. It is therefore reasonable to allow this measure to go to Committee, because although the overall objective of greater transparency is reasonable, there will need to be further consideration of those specific points.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o101"><a name="90513-0007.htm_para9"><a name="09051352000293">The second point relates directly to the amendment tabled by the hon. Member for Fareham, with which I have a lot of sympathy. It is logical to provide for some breathing space in which the rules can be reviewed, so that companies do not fall foul of them unwittingly. Some concerns have been raised with me, however. First, there could be a tendency for some companies&#151;not those that observe best practice, which are unlikely to fall foul of the rules anyway&#151;to see a year&#146;s delay as another year in which they can ignore the problem, and they might not be any better prepared when the legislation comes into force than they would have been if it had taken effect sooner. To be more cynical, one could suggest that other companies could use the year to give themselves more time to think about how to evade the spirit of the law.</p>

<p><a name="st_o152"><a name="09051352000294"><a name="90513-0007.htm_spnew1"><a name="09051352001588"><b>Mr. Hoban:</b>
 The hon. Gentleman is making an important point about how people could use the year&#146;s delay. He will know from reading the Bill that there are two certificates involved: a type A certificate and a type B certificate. Certificate B is used when a company cannot sign off using certificate A and some explanation is required. One concern that has been expressed is that in the first year many businesses will have to file type B certificates anyway, and give an explanation of why they cannot comply, not because they are being difficult or because their systems are not up to scratch, but because of the short notice period. There is a danger of confusing the picture by rushing this measure in with undue haste, without properly identifying which companies are not compliant and which are.</p>

<notus-date day="13" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>13 May 2009 : Column 879</b><br>
we always have to grapple with on these occasions is that if a measure has some merit&#151;we all accept that there is some merit in the Government&#146;s proposals&#151;we have to decide how long to delay introducing it in order to ensure that it will work even more effectively. There is a strong case for saying that the added benefit of having a more workable measure will justify the year&#146;s delay in implementation, as the hon. Gentleman&#146;s amendment suggests. However, I believe that such a delay would have potential downsides as well as advantages.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o102"><a name="90513-0007.htm_para10"><a name="09051352000296">My third point is that I hope the matter will be examined in further detail in Committee. I am sure that the Committee will not seek to remove the clause altogether today, and I hope that I will be able to table amendments in Committee that could reconcile these points, as that might be a more appropriate forum in which to discuss them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o103"><a name="90513-0007.htm_para11"><a name="09051352000297">My final point is a broader matter of principle. Objections have been raised about the so-called concept of naming and shaming. I want to put on record the fact that my party is not against naming and shaming per se&#151;the practice might have a part to play&#151;but we want to ensure that it is those who deliberately evade tax who are treated in that way, rather than those who have made a genuine, and in some cases very small, error. The state should not treat individuals and their reputations in a heavy-handed way. If it puts their names into the public arena in a way that damages their career prospects and other private interests, and subsequently finds that that action has been out of all proportion to the offence&#151;which might have been committed unwittingly as well as being modest in scale&#151;it will have exceeded its power in terms of its relative might and the individual over whom it wields its power. We need to observe that important principle in our deliberations. We need to strike a balance between transparency and effectiveness, and between the rights of the individual and the understandable desire of the Government to collect tax revenue legally owed to them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o104"><a name="90513-0007.htm_para12"><a name="09051352000298">We accept that there is some virtue in the proposals, but they require considerable further attention, and it might not be desirable to bring these matters to a head this afternoon. After we have heard further representations in the House and externally, we should try to come up with proposals in Committee that are more satisfactory to more people who have a direct interest in these matters.</p>

company&#146;s addresses for which the officer is responsible? Will he or she have to give their home address, as they will have some personal responsibility for what is discharged? Will the individual in question have to be resident&#151;could they be a non-dom? These are important questions. HMRC does not require people to have DNA tests, but you never know.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o107"><a name="90513-0007.htm_para15"><a name="09051352000302">We have to be very careful when setting out what we want from senior accounting officers. We have already discussed subsidiaries, including overseas subsidiaries and those that are sometimes set up for particular financial transactions, such as the purchase of plant, and I think that there are difficulties involved in that. I also think that there are difficulties involved in the appointment of a new senior accounting officer. The first thing that he or she will have to do is go through all the accountancy procedures and conduct a risk analysis of every part of the business. In the case of large companies, that could not be done particularly quickly. We shall need to see HMRC guidance on what senior accounting officers have to do.</p>

In any large organisation it is possible to make small mistakes involving minimal amounts of tax, and no sensible tax authority will take everything to the nearest penny. However, the individuals living under this regime will need to know about scale. In the case of large or significant tax liabilities, that would seem to be a sensible requirement.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o109"><a name="90513-0007.htm_para17"><a name="09051352000304">We are told that there will be a fine of &#163;5,000 a company per year. If 20, 30, 50 or 150 companies were involved, could a multiple fine be imposed on a company and its subsidiaries, and could it be imposed over multiple years? What is the potential liability faced by individuals? As I said earlier, this is a bit different from limited liability. Could the fines be levied by HMRC, and is there an appeal process? According to the explanatory notes, a &#147;reasonable excuse for...failure&#148; will be accepted as a reason for HMRC not to levy fines, but we do not know how HMRC will be persuaded that an excuse was reasonable. There might be an argument between the tax authorities, which must discharge their responsibility to collect as much money as possible, and the company about what is reasonable.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o110"><a name="90513-0007.htm_para18"><a name="09051352000305">We need to know much more about the costs imposed on businesses. Even if the Minister qualifies what the impact assessment says about company size, I shall want to know whether the costs will be reduced for smaller companies. Will HMRC insist on the provisions applying to all limited companies at some point, and what impact would that have?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o111"><a name="90513-0007.htm_para19"><a name="09051352000306">We need much more information about clause 92.

It is important not to reduce the responsibilities of members of boards, and indeed those of auditors. My hon. Friend the Member for Fareham might agree that auditors quite often avoid their responsibilities nowadays, and that many of our financial problems might be caused by that.</p>

We know that it is important to raise legitimate tax from companies, and the American example might be a useful one, but I shall not be in favour of the proposed arrangement unless I am given a great deal more information about the impact on business and individuals, and about the Government&#146;s direction of travel.</p>

It is fine to talk in terms of generalisations and broad comparisons, but we need detailed experience if we are going to rely on it.

 We have had a useful discussion on this important measure. In the Budget, the Government took difficult decisions to support fiscal consolidation, taking steps to support businesses and households, but also setting out the credible path that we must follow to return public finances to sustainability in a fair way. Protecting tax revenues is an important part of that. It is right that as part of our fiscal consolidation, we act now&#151;I recognise that there is some urgency&#151;to lock in tax compliance and to protect tax revenues.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o125"><a name="90513-0008.htm_para2"><a name="09051352000328">The majority of senior accounting officers are already ensuring that appropriate tax accounting arrangements are in place in their companies or groups. For them, the burden of the new requirement will be minimal, requiring little more than to certify the existence of what is already in place. However, a minority&#151;I think it is quite a small minority&#151;of companies do not have robust systems and processes in place. It is difficult for either the company or HMRC to know whether the right tax is being paid. We want identified individuals to take responsibility for putting that right. I will give a couple of examples.</p>

 Let me give the hon. Gentleman the examples that I have in mind. There have been companies where tax computations are calculated incorrectly each year due to known accounting system problems. We want it to be clear whose job it is to sort that out. One group had systems problems every year, could not identify the source of the problems and could not satisfy HMRC that the tax computation was correct. It needs to be crystal clear whose responsibility it is to resolve such an issue. Therefore, this is not about human error or genuine mistakes, as paragraph 1 of schedule 46 makes clear. It is about systems problems leading to persistent under-reporting of tax.</p>

It builds on the approach that HMRC has been taking since the 2006 review of links with large business, which I think has been widely welcomed, enabling companies to work with HMRC and to establish a low-risk tax relationship through transparency, picking up the point rightly made by the hon. Member for Taunton (Mr. Browne), and through co-operation. Clause 92 simply provides that existing good practice among the majority of large companies is  <br>

spread across all large companies. The measure reflects what should already be in place. We are clarifying the responsibility for ensuring that tax accounting arrangements comply with established good practice.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o127"><a name="90513-0008.htm_para4"><a name="09051352000332">As we have established, the detail of the measure is set out in schedule 46, and I look forward to the full debate that has been presaged in this exchange, when we will discuss the detail in Committee. We said at the Budget that we would move quickly to consult on detailed implementation. I recognise some of the concerns that have been expressed in this debate; indeed, they have been raised with me. In response, we will table amendments to schedule 46 in Committee. I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Coventry, North-West (Mr. Robinson) that that is the right way to deal with these matters. Let me outline the amendments that I envisage tabling.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o128"><a name="90513-0008.htm_para5"><a name="09051352000333">First, as I said earlier, we need the right balance between safeguarding revenues from larger companies and the compliance cost for business in terms of what counts as a large company. I am now satisfied that the base of companies within the scope of the measure can be narrowed to strike a better balance. Our current thinking is to limit the measure to those companies with a large business relationship with HMRC, and a customer relationship manager reflecting that&#151;fewer than 2,000 companies in total, compared with about 15,000 under the definition set out in schedule 46 as drafted. We will have further discussions about that approach before we take a final view, but we will then table amendments in Committee, rather than introduce regulations under paragraph 17 of the schedule.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o129"><a name="90513-0008.htm_para6"><a name="09051352000334">Secondly, schedule 46 as drafted&#151;the hon. Members for Fareham (Mr. Hoban) and for Taunton commented on this&#151;requires senior accounting officers either to certify that the company&#146;s tax accounting arrangements are appropriate or otherwise to explain the respects in which those arrangements are not appropriate, with different certificates for each of those two cases. I am now satisfied that that would work better with a single certificate, on which the senior accounting officer sets out either one position or the other, rather than two different types of certificate as provided for in the draft schedule.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o130"><a name="90513-0008.htm_para7"><a name="09051352000335">I accept that the requirement to notify the company&#146;s auditors as well as HMRC of the respects in which the tax accounting arrangements are not appropriate could pose operational difficulties for businesses which are disproportionate to the importance of that measure, so an amendment will be tabled in Committee to remove that requirement from the schedule.</p>

 On amendments, may I suggest that the Minister looks at the definition of a senior accounting officer? Currently the definition is</p>

</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o131"><a name="90513-0008.htm_para8"><a name="09051352000337">I think that it should be a director; it should not just be an officer, who could be below board level.

 I will certainly reflect on that, but it should be for the company to determine who will have the overall responsibility that the schedule sets out, so I would be hesitant about being more prescriptive.</p>

 The point of the person being on the board, as opposed to being an officer, is that being on the board carries certain specific personal liabilities. The chief financial officer or the person with tax responsibilities might in many cases be taken off the board precisely so that they avoid that sort of responsibility, which a directorship carries with it. Will my right hon. Friend undertake to look into this point?</p>

 I will be very happy to reflect on it, but it should be the company concerned that makes the judgment as to which individual should carry this significant personal responsibility, which is rightly set out in this part of the Bill.</p>

Members for Fareham and for Taunton asked when guidance would be ready, and I agree with them about the importance of getting the technical guidance right. The legislation must be implemented in a way that is consistent with the intention that I have set out. There should be minimal impact on companies and their senior accounting officers who already have robust systems in place, and HMRC is having some good discussions with those involved. It will work with them to develop and agree the guidance, and I will ensure that draft guidance is with the Committee before it considers the schedule.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o133"><a name="90513-0008.htm_para10"><a name="09051352000342">The hon. Members for Fareham and for Henley (John Howell) talked about the reference to Sarbanes-Oxley in the impact assessment, and I understand why they did so, but we need to make it clear that we are not here importing Sarbanes-Oxley legislation to the UK. Sarbanes-Oxley is very extensive and covers a far wider range of issues than the quite limited measure in question, such as corporate governance, financial reporting and company law, rather than tax. No specific element of Sarbanes-Oxley is replicated in clause 92 or schedule 46. There is an analogy in that an element of personal responsibility is a characteristic of both the Sarbanes-Oxley legislation and this measure, but none of the specific Sarbanes-Oxley measures is replicated here.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o134"><a name="90513-0008.htm_para11"><a name="09051352000343">Let me pick up on some of the other points that have been raised in the debate. I hope that former accountants enjoying their retirement in Sandbanks and elsewhere will be reassured to learn that because the obligations imposed apply only in relation to financial years beginning on or after Royal Assent, there is no question of any senior accounting officer being held retrospectively responsible for any shortcomings in a company&#146;s tax accounting arrangements.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o135"><a name="90513-0008.htm_para12"><a name="09051352000344">I have mentioned one set of regulations that the draft schedule gives us the power to introduce: those to restrict the number of companies.

We will be able to bring forward in draft form the other set of regulations, on penalties, that schedule 46 allows us to introduce before we reach that part of the debate in Committee.</p>

earlier in the context of the materiality that auditors use to sign off accounts. What level of materiality will HMRC employ when looking at the appropriateness of tax accounting systems and the accuracy of returns?</p>

 As the hon. Gentleman knows, companies already have an obligation to deliver correct and complete returns. The measure ensures that the minority of senior accounting officers who do not oversee systems that generate correct and complete computations take responsibility for addressing that. That is the level of the bar that we envisage applying.</p>

 There may be a systemic problem in a system that means that the calculation of tax on each transaction is out by as little as a penny or as much as a pound, and clearly those different amounts will have a different impact on the tax liability. How precise does the Revenue expect to be in applying these sanctions to senior accounting officers?</p>

<p><a name="st_o172"><a name="09051352000349"><a name="90513-0008.htm_spnew10"><a name="09051352001608"><b>Mr. Timms:</b>
 That is a perfectly fair point and we will certainly need to address it in the guidance, but what is important is that this is about ensuring that the systems are sound and robust, rather than about the dangers of mistakes that might from time to time occur.</p>

 I do not know the precise figures in that case. The hon. Gentleman mentioned the figure that we set out in the Budget documentation on Budget yield over the next few years arising from this measure. We estimate that in the first year there will be an additional tax yield of &#163;40 million, and a rather larger sum in the years after that. Cumulatively, we are therefore talking about significant sums, and this is an important contribution that is needed for the fiscal consolidation that we require.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o137"><a name="90513-0008.htm_para14"><a name="09051352000352">As I have said, we need to make some amendments, including in the light of perfectly fair points made in this debate.</p>

 There is a natural preoccupation that systems should be robust, but it has always struck me that systems can be as robust, detailed and complicated as we like, but they are only as good as the people who operate them. It is good that this complementarity has been introduced. Systems must be robust, but in order to make sure that they work properly, the first officer responsible has to see to it that the sanction and responsibility put on them will achieve just that end.</p>

 I am not convinced by the Financial Secretary&#146;s response to the debate. He talks about what we are considering being an appropriate measure of fiscal consolidation that will raise &#163;40 million in the first year. This is in the context, of course, of a budget deficit of &#163;175 billion. I asked him about the monetary amount of the systems error that he prayed in aid in respect of this measure, but he did not know how much that was going to be. I worked out, not in a systematic way but on the back of a notional fag packet, that the amount involved per business covered by this measure would be &#163;30,000 to &#163;40,000, which is not a material sum. I am just not persuaded yet that the Financial Secretary has made a case as to why we should impose this legislation on large businesses, notwithstanding the welcome concession that he has made in restricting the number of businesses to which it will apply. Why would this measure be imposed without any real work having been done by the Government on the costs that businesses will incur as a consequence of its introduction?</p>

The Financial Secretary has accepted that there will be amendments in Committee, and I welcome that. However, there are examples of legislation that has been rammed through quickly and which we have had to come back to in successive years to get right, and I just do not think that the Government have taken sufficient care over this measure to warrant its introduction when this Bill receives its Royal Assent some time in July. More work needs to be done by the Government to get this right, and to understand issues associated with materiality, who the senior accounting officer will be and the application of this measure. It is right to delay implementation by a year, so that the Government get it right and do not impose an unnecessary cost on business without a firm grip on the benefits that this is due to bring.

<p><a name="st_o178"><a name="09051352000809"><a name="90513-0009.htm_spnew0"><a name="09051352002057"><b>Mr. David Gauke (South-West Hertfordshire) (Con):</b>
 I do not know whether it is appropriate to say so in these circumstances, but it is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, Mr. Atkinson.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o143"><a name="90513-0009.htm_para2"><a name="09051352000810">Vehicle excise duty was one of the stories of last year&#146;s Finance Bill and the 2008 Budget. I will be relatively brief&#151;and I can assure the Exchequer Secretary that this issue will not keep her here until the early hours of the morning&#151;but it may be useful to return to the proposals in that Budget. In particular, I wish to take the opportunity to pay tribute to the tenacious work of my hon. Friend the Member for Putney (Justine Greening) in examining and unravelling the Government&#146;s case.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o144"><a name="90513-0009.htm_para3"><a name="09051352000811">The Committee will recall that in the 2008 Budget the Chancellor of the Exchequer set out his proposals to reform vehicle excise duty, which included introducing a greater range of gradations in bands on the basis of CO2 emissions. He told the House that that was a sensible green measure, saying that</p>
<a name="90513-0009.htm_brev0"><a name="09051352001395"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;the road tax system should do more to support the use of more carbon-efficiency...There will be an incentive to encourage drivers to choose the least polluting car.&#148;&#151;[<i> Official Report</i>, 12 March 2008; Vol. 473, c. 297.]</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o145"><a name="90513-0009.htm_para4"><a name="09051352000812">My hon. Friend started to examine the details of that policy and several points emerged.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o146"><a name="90513-0009.htm_para5"><a name="09051352000813">First, the Chancellor claimed that the proposal was a green measure, but it clearly sought to raise revenue. Of course, the proposals on vehicle excise duty in this Finance Bill have been largely shaped by the arguments and the analysis of last summer. Thanks to my hon. Friend&#146;s work, it emerged that the original proposals would reduce motor vehicle emissions by 160,000 tonnes a year by 2020. To put that in context, that is a fraction of 1 per cent. of total transport CO2 emissions, which in 2006 amounted to 120 million tonnes. We can see immediately that the proposals&#146; green credentials were somewhat weakened, and I would be grateful if the Exchequer Secretary gave her assessment of the green benefits of the original proposals and of the proposals in clause 14.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o147"><a name="90513-0009.htm_para6"><a name="09051352000814">Another green argument needs to be addressed. It was persuasively argued that a number of older cars would essentially become unsaleable and have to be scrapped as a consequence of the new VED scheme, which would have an environmental impact. I do not wish to deviate from the subject of VED, but that point throws up the issue of the environmental impact of the car scrappage schemes. It would be helpful if the Minister said a word or two on the environmental pluses and minuses of scrapping older cars. Clearly, newer cars are more efficient and, by and large, have lower CO2 emissions,  <br>

but quite a lot of carbon is involved in car manufacture. I ask that purely to inquire about the Government&#146;s analysis.</p>

 May I inquire, purely to seek information, whether the hon. Gentleman can confirm that his party stands by its commitments on green issues, particularly on green taxation?</p>

 Yes, we do. I shall come back to that point&#151;that was a perfectly fair question. I suspect that quite a bit of this afternoon will be devoted to green taxation of one sort or another. After this debate, we will debate fuel duties and I want to say quite a bit more on the subject at that point.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o148"><a name="90513-0009.htm_para7"><a name="09051352000817">My second point is to ask whether the VED proposals in the last year&#146;s Budget and those in this Finance Bill are retrospective. I have already praised my hon. Friend the Member for Putney, but a word should also be said about the hon. Member for Blyth Valley (Mr. Campbell), who tabled an early-day motion and secured considerable support from both sides of the House&#151;</p>

<p><a name="st_o181"><a name="09051352000818"><a name="90513-0009.htm_spnew3"><a name="09051352002060"><b>Mr. Jeremy Browne:</b>

 Indeed, it would be a great omission not to mention him.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o149"><a name="90513-0009.htm_para8"><a name="09051352000820">Is the measure retrospective? If someone has bought a car that was made or registered after 2001, and subsequently found that they will pay more VED in future years, they are committed to that car. They are stuck with it and are faced with a tax bill that they did not anticipate. People argued whether the provision was retrospective&#151;I think that it is &#151;and I would be grateful if the Minister confirmed her view. On 14 May 2008, in column 1495 of <i> Hansard</i>, she referred to page 121, paragraph A.97 of the Red Book, which, she said, contained details of the retrospective element. It seems to me that there is a retrospective element, and that point applies to this clause, albeit that the effects are less dramatic than perhaps was originally envisaged last year. Will the Minister confirm her interpretation of that point?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o150"><a name="90513-0009.htm_para9"><a name="09051352000821">That raises the issue of unfairness and of who will be hit by the provisions. The hon. Members for Blyth Valley and for Wolverhampton, South-West asked who would be affected by the change in VED. Let me put that in the context of the clause, although that question could still be asked of the original proposals. It would appear that some 1.2 million drivers will experience rises of more than &#163;200, and that many others will be affected. They would say that it is very difficult to change their behaviour when they have already acquired the cars, which comes back to the green taxation point I was making a moment or so ago.</p>

VED this year of no more than &#163;5 per car and increases of no more than &#163;30 next year?</p>

<p><a name="st_o186"><a name="09051352000825"><a name="90513-0009.htm_spnew7"><a name="09051352002065"><b>Mr. Gauke:</b>
 I do. In the pre-Budget report, the Government changed their position, and many of my remarks praise those who were able to persuade the Government to do so. I am asking the Minister to explain what persuaded them to change their position. Was it the argument that it was not a green tax? Was it the argument that it was retrospective? Was it the argument that those who were going to be affected were not just rich executives driving around in gas guzzlers but those across the income distribution scale? What persuaded the Government to move from the position we were in this time last year to the position we are in now, where, as the Minister says, the increase will be no more than &#163;5 this coming year and no more than &#163;30 next year? I am trying to understand the Government&#146;s position.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o151"><a name="90513-0009.htm_para10"><a name="09051352000826">There is continuity in what we had last year and what we have this year. In both the Budget and the pre-Budget report, which essentially set out what we have now, the Government stated that the majority of drivers will be better off or no worse off under the proposals. That is right, in my understanding. However, it is right in relation to the original proposals only if one includes those drivers who are not paying graduated VED at all. Let me quote the figures from last year&#151;I am sure that the Minister will update the Committee on the figures for this year. The vast majority of the 15.5 million motorists who paid graduated VED would pay more. I would be grateful if the Minister said that that figure no longer applies.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o152"><a name="90513-0009.htm_para11"><a name="09051352000827">I want to make it clear that we are not just talking about the larger models. The duty would also apply to people who drive Ford Mondeos. I should declare an interest as a driver of a Ford Mondeo estate&#151;</p>

 Larger is all relative. We are not talking about sport utility vehicles or Humvees. Renault M&#233;ganes and even some Nissan Micras were affected. Where do we stand now? By 2010-11, how many people will be paying more? Who is affected? What is the breakdown?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o153"><a name="90513-0009.htm_para12"><a name="09051352000830">This year, VED is not the big controversial policy it was. That is largely due to the efforts of hon. Members of all parties, and we are grateful that the Government listened to the case made by my hon. Friend the Member for Putney and others. They said that the policy announced in last year&#146;s Budget was misguided and retrospective, that it was ineffective as a green policy and that it would affect people of all incomes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o154"><a name="90513-0009.htm_para13"><a name="09051352000831">Progress has been made, but I look forward to the Minister explaining precisely which arguments the Government found so persuasive that they were prepared to back down.</p>

The Minister is, of course, my very, very hon.

However, it would help our constituents to understand that the Government are thinking carefully about any future tax increases that they may have to make. It would also help to convince them that taxation on motorists will be underpinned by a distributional analysis to ensure that the poorest motorists are better protected than the richer ones.</p>

proposals on VED were no more retrospective than the example that I have just given because, if that example was seen as retrospective, whole areas of the Finance Bill would be deemed to be unacceptable.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o157"><a name="90513-0009.htm_para16"><a name="09051352000842">I was not entirely sympathetic to that argument. I understood it, but I felt that any attempt to effect behavioural change by using VED differentials meant that the tax change also had to impact on people buying cars for the first time. They had to be in a position to make important decisions about such a purchase and so they had to know the VED rates that they would face.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o158"><a name="90513-0009.htm_para17"><a name="09051352000843">It is important that we examine these matters in detail, but the danger is that we lose sight of the big principle, about which all parties are essentially in accord. We may differ on the degree, but we accept that there must be some differential between the lowest polluting cars and the highest, and that that differential should be graded. My party argued for that differential before the Government introduced it in 2001. We had made the case forcefully for many years before then, and I remember that we were sometimes criticised for doing so. However, the notion of having a differential seems now to have become the accepted wisdom.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o159"><a name="90513-0009.htm_para18"><a name="09051352000844">Why is a differential deemed to be a good idea? Transport clearly contributes to CO2 emissions and pollution. It is only one contributor among many, but it is significant, so encouraging people to use more fuel-efficient models of car is deemed to be in our collective environmental interest.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o160"><a name="90513-0009.htm_para19"><a name="09051352000845">It is also worth noting in passing that the principle is being applied more widely. London&#146;s congestion charge may be rather inaccurately titled now, but it contains an element of the principle. Interestingly, residents&#146; parking in the Taunton Deane borough council area in my constituency will be free for people whose cars are in the lowest category of emissions, and half price for those whose cars are in the second lowest category. Instead of disincentivising people with high-emitting cars, the scheme incentivises people with very low-emitting cars, and that is a sensible and practical change.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o161"><a name="90513-0009.htm_para20"><a name="09051352000846">My point may be slightly off the beaten track, but incorporating a component in VED that attempts to affect people&#146;s environmental behaviour is widely accepted to have merit. If it is not retrospective, one would hope that the impact would be of even greater benefit to the environment, and that the population at large would deem the tax to be fairer.</p>

 People who live in remote rural areas often find it essential to have a larger, more fuel-inefficient vehicle, thanks to the nature of the climate, the need to drive on winter roads, and so on. Also, their vehicles often have to have a dual purpose: they have to be family vehicles and they also have to be able to cope with work, be it on farms or in the forestry or tourism industries. People in remote areas do not have the same choices as people in urban areas.</p>

 My hon. Friend makes a perfectly valid point. People in extremely remote areas, and not just those who live outside the big cities, have two practical considerations. The first is that their need to drive is much greater, because there is little or no public transport where they live. The second consideration is the one that my hon. Friend described, which is that they may need to drive a vehicle with higher emissions because of off-road requirements and so on. That issue is worth exploring, but the clause does not do so and I shall therefore not dwell on it any further.</p>

 The right hon. Gentleman makes an interesting suggestion, but I do not agree with his central premise for two reasons. First, there would be a significant revenue shortfall&#151;I assume that that is why he was not able to get his amendment selected for our consideration. That is a serious point when we have an annual budget deficit of &#163;175 billion. Presumably, the Government&#146;s measures are intended simultaneously to effect behavioural change and to raise revenue, which is not impossible. The Government raise revenue and try to effect behavioural change through tobacco duty, for example. There is a trade-off of sorts, but it is possible to pursue both objectives simultaneously.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman is of course right to say that it is possible to raise revenue and effect behavioural change at the same time. Although I would not put them in precisely the same category, VED and tobacco duties are examples of that phenomenon. However, I assume he agrees with me that if one is really successful in changing behaviour, the revenue-raising aspect of the tax tends to diminish.</p>

Tobacco taxation, for example, has a disproportionately large impact on people in the lower income deciles, because they have a greater propensity to smoke. That is one of the reasons why, in percentage terms, the total tax burden on people on lower incomes is in many cases greater than the burden on people on higher incomes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o165"><a name="90513-0010.htm_para1"><a name="09051352000858">There is a serious social question to be asked about some of the behavioural taxes, but it applies less to VED because many people in the lowest two or three income deciles cannot afford to drive&#151;although I take the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine (Sir Robert Smith) that that is more true in urban areas than in rural areas: some people in rural areas on very low incomes have to drive. However, large numbers of people, particularly in cities, on low incomes do not have cars, and those on relatively low incomes who do have cars tend to pick models with smaller engines, although not exclusively, of course. My point is that the social impact of VED differentials is less pronounced than that of other forms of behavioural taxation.</p>

 Perhaps the Minister will deal with that in her response. I recognise, as I am sure all hon. Members do, that there are practical considerations for people on low incomes who wish to work and for whom motoring represents quite a large proportion of their overall expenditure. That is particularly true in rural areas, where the need to drive and to drive longer distances is greater. However, I do not accept that that alone makes the case against VED differentials. In fact, one could argue that it would be more appropriate to have more pronounced differentials, so that people with low-emission cars are incentivised to an even greater degree compared with people who have high-emission vehicles.</p>

The so-called scrappage scheme is to be introduced, which seems to be designed to encourage people to buy new vehicles, whereas some might interpret the VED measures as a fairly strong inducement to stick with their existing vehicles, as doing so means that they will not incur the additional higher VED rate in year one. I am interested to know whether the Minister believes that the measure will stimulate the sales of new cars, as some MPs, especially those representing west midlands constituencies and parts of the country with a motor manufacturing tradition, want. Are the Government trying to stimulate sales through the Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform, but trying to restrict them through the Department of Energy and Climate Change and the Treasury?

It raises a question about the concept of being open to discussion and public debate and the tendency in the UK body politic to decry changes of position by Government or Opposition parties as U-turns, when such changes are often the result of productive discussions, informed by fresh information. That is what my Government did in relation to the VED proposals made last year, which were withdrawn and have been reintroduced, in a very much reworked form, in clause 14.

I would caution that if we moved away from the proposal in clause 14 to grade VED according to emissions to one based on engine size, that could present difficulties for diesel engines, for example. The car I drive has a diesel engine of approximately 1400 cc and it produces a much lower rate of CO2 emissions per kilometre than a 1300 cc model of the same car with a petrol engine, so one has to be a little careful. I know that there are concerns about diesel engines and particulates, but I am told that such concerns are sometimes overstated.</p>

I similarly salute what the last Conservative Government did, following the efforts of the Campaign for Lead-free Air of which I was a member, to encourage motorists through a tax mechanism to switch from leaded to unleaded petrol.

Government to keep the matter under review with the aim of lowering the exemption threshold from, say, 130 g to 120 g. The European Union has been striving against backward-looking motor manufacturers&#151;those manufacturers are now, sadly, reaping the whirlwind, as are their workers&#151;to get the average for each manufacturer&#146;s fleet production down to 130 g.

 I share the hon. Gentleman&#146;s instincts. However, I am always a little cautious about exempting only such small cars because that makes the person in the street think it is just a ruse to provide the appearance of environmentalism, given it is so hard to find models that actually qualify for the exemption. Surely there may be some benefit in exempting some reasonably popular models of cars; they may not be right at the end of the emissions scale, but they are nevertheless near it.

 I take the hon. Gentleman&#146;s point. I am not an expert, but I understand that there are some relatively large cars coming in at an emissions rate of 130 g or below. In order to drive the motor industry by means of a taxation mechanism and to drive consumer behaviour&#151;to use an appropriate verb&#151;we need to keep the grading under review and push it further in the future. It is no coincidence that the European Union manufacturer with the lowest fleet average&#151;from memory, I believe it is about 136 g per kilometre driven for all the new cars sold last year&#151;is the one that is quite likely to take over Chrysler and Opel-Vauxhall: namely, Fiat. Relative to many other motor manufacturers, Fiat is thriving at the moment. Of course, all these things are relative, but I suspect that has happened because Fiat had the foresight to concentrate on smaller and lower-polluting vehicles. The two do not always go together. It is possible to buy some pretty polluting cars that have small external dimensions, just as it is possible to buy some relatively low-polluting cars that have quite large external dimensions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o179"><a name="90513-0010.htm_para15"><a name="09051352000877">Turning to table 2, in clause 14, I note an element of retrospection in paragraph (a) relating to higher-polluting cars. For those cars with emissions between, say, 225 g and 250 g, for which the standard rate of vehicle excise duty would be &#163;425 per year, for those registered before 23 March 2006 that rate will be &#163;235. Such cars would now be three years old, but given the number of years for which society has imposed tax penalties for more polluting vehicles, I welcome and am content with that relatively minor level of retrospection. Similarly, for those cars registered before the 23 March 2006 cut-off date that produce more than 255 g in emissions, the standard rate of VED will be &#163;245 per year rather than &#163;435.</p>

 Given the hon.

If so, will that stimulate demand and weaken the environmental message that the Government seek to send?</p>

 As is the hon. Gentlemen&#146;s wont, he jumps ahead of me. I was referring to table 2, which relates to vehicles after the first-year loading. I am about to refer to table 1 and vehicles in the first year. I think the small element of retrospection is acceptable. Those vehicles with emissions of 255 g registered after 23 March 2006 will not get the discount from &#163;435 to &#163;245 that those registered before that date will get.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o180"><a name="90513-0010.htm_para16"><a name="09051352000880">Turning to table 1, to which the hon. Gentleman referred in his speech and intervention, there is a risk in relation to shifting cars in the showroom. As far as I know, almost everyone who buys a new car does so with the vehicle excise duty paid&#151;it is shown on the invoice. Just as we see advertisements for &#147;No VAT&#148;, which are not technically accurate as a discount is being given equivalent to the VAT chargeable on a list price, we may see such sales techniques creep into advertisements with regard to VED&#151;for example, &#147;No VED loading on a brand new car.&#148;</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o181"><a name="90513-0010.htm_para17"><a name="09051352000881">VED loading simply on a first-year basis is not the way to go. As the hon. Gentleman put it, it would be a variation on a showroom tax. Company cars constitute quite a high proportion of the UK car market. Three years ago, the Liberal Democrats commendably picked up my proposal of about four years ago for swingeing vehicle excise duty on new cars bought after an announced change in the taxation regime had taken effect. That would be not merely a first-year loading. For example, under table 1, a car that emits 255 g or more of CO2 emissions would pay &#163;950 at the standard rate in its first year, dropping to &#163;435. For that kind of vehicle, swingeing vehicle excise duty is needed every year, not only to dissuade people from buying it, but to make them bear in mind the resale of the car. Such swingeing vehicle excise duty, as I proposed one year, although I put the grams per km threshold higher, would affect resale massively, and cause company as well as private buyers to think about whether they would buy such a polluting vehicle. They might be able to afford to run such a car year to year, but they would not be able to afford the hit on the resale price.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o182"><a name="90513-0010.htm_para18"><a name="09051352000882">Previously, I have had complaints from the public, who misunderstand the proposal. It is not an attack on 4x4 drivers. The last time I looked, nine out of the 10 most polluting cars on sale in the UK were not 4x4s. The one 4x4 in that top 10 was a Land Rover, which is produced in the United Kingdom. The others in the top 10 were sports cars and top-of-the-range cars such as Bentleys, which have huge engines and are huge vehicles. I urge the Government to consider again an ongoing&#151;not retrospective&#151;swingeing rate of vehicle excise duty for the most polluting vehicles. That would discourage people from buying such vehicles, not only because of their running costs but because of the adverse affect on their resale price. I hope the Minister will assure me that the Government will consider that in future years.</p>

 I hope that I can deal with some of the points raised by Opposition Members and by my hon. Friends on clause 14. As has been pointed out, the clause makes changes to vehicle excise duty rates for cars and vans, and those changes take effect from 1 April 2010. The clause introduces first year rates of VED for brand-new cars, as was, I think, mentioned by all who spoke. First year rates will be chargeable on the  <br>

<p><a name="stpa_o183"><a name="90513-0010.htm_para19"><a name="09051352000884">The introduction of first year rates means that cars emitting up to 130 g of carbon dioxide per kilometre will pay no duty on their first vehicle licence. Cars emitting between 131 and 165 g per kilometre will pay the same amount for their first year rate as they will for all subsequent licences. For cars emitting more than 165 g per kilometre, first year rates will be higher than the standard rates applicable on all subsequent licences. Only those new cars with the very highest emissions will pay the top rate of &#163;950.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o184"><a name="90513-0010.htm_para20"><a name="09051352000885">My hon. Friend the Member for Wolverhampton, South-West (Rob Marris), the hon. Members for Taunton (Mr. Browne) and for South-West Hertfordshire (Mr. Gauke), and to a lesser extent my right hon. Friend the Member for Birkenhead (Mr. Field)&#151;the latter talked about the distributional effect of the measure, and I will deal with that point separately, if he will allow me to&#151;all pointed out that tax measures try to change behaviour, certainly when they are based on trying to incentivise activities that have a smaller carbon footprint. That is a clear way of trying to change behaviour. As my hon. Friend the Member for Wolverhampton, South-West and the hon. Member for Taunton pointed out, the measures are also revenue raisers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o185"><a name="90513-0010.htm_para21"><a name="09051352000886">Revenue raising is an important aspect of the part of the Budget documents that we are discussing. The remainder of our debates today are about duties that raise a certain amount of revenue. We must not forget, or lose sight of, the fact that it is perfectly reasonable for Governments to raise revenue with which to finance the things that they do with public money. I often have that discussion with the many people who come to tell me that we should reduce all the taxes that are levied, but who never tell me where we can find the extra revenue that they wish to see spent on whatever is in their interest; in the context of vehicle excise duty, that is often on roads or other infrastructure. I can see the hon. Member for South-West Hertfordshire wriggling in his place; I am happy to let him intervene.</p>

<p><a name="st_o213"><a name="09051352000887"><a name="90513-0010.htm_spnew8"><a name="09051352002092"><b>Mr. Gauke:</b>
 I am far from wriggling. I wish to thank the Minister; she is being very clear, and the Committee appreciates that. The clause is about changes to vehicle excise duty, and that is about raising revenue. Governments have to raise revenue, but does she accept that when the policy&#151;or rather, last year&#146;s policy&#151;was announced, it was very much presented as an environmental policy? However, the Government&#146;s figures suggest that the environmental impact will be very limited.</p>

<p><a name="st_o214"><a name="09051352000888"><a name="90513-0010.htm_spnew9"><a name="09051352002093"><b>Angela Eagle:</b>
 I hoped that I was saying that there are some taxes through which one hopes to change behaviour, but which also have a revenue-raising element to them. Vehicle excise duty is one of those. Obviously, we wish to change behaviour, and I will talk about that later. We wish to incentivise people to buy cars with a smaller carbon footprint and lower CO2 emissions than those that were on the road in the past.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o186"><a name="90513-0010.htm_para22"><a name="09051352000889">That is a clear aim, but another aim is to raise revenue. We can do both. As was said earlier, there can  <br>

be a balance. If a Government are very successful at changing behaviour, they may have to find other ways to raise revenue, because the more successful they are at changing behaviour by giving signals through taxes, the less their tax take will be. As they need to finance public services and everything that our constituents want the public services to provide, such as health and education, other ways must be found to finance them. That balance exists, and is accepted in all parts of the House.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o187"><a name="90513-0010.htm_para23"><a name="09051352000890">Tax measures are only one means of changing behaviour. Another is regulation, which applies particularly in this instance, as was pointed out by my hon. Friend the Member for Wolverhampton, South-West, with his knowledge of these matters. He mentioned the European Union regulation governing car emissions. We have successfully negotiated increasingly tight limits on emissions to be set for manufacturers. In answer to his question whether 130 g was the correct point at which to allow an effective exemption from first year rates, our judgment is that it is correct at present, but as we always do after every Budget, we will keep an eye on the development of engine technology. We want the incentive to remain taut. As engines become much more efficient, we will review that rate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o188"><a name="90513-0010.htm_para24"><a name="09051352000891">The other main way of driving behavioural change and driving down CO2 emissions is through new technologies. The Government have made some significant announcements about how we wish to support the car industry through its short-term difficulties, and incentivise it to be at the forefront of the dash to innovation in energy efficiency and carbon efficiency in engine design and the design of transport generally. Despite the significant progress that has been made in engine efficiency&#151;new cars are 30 per cent. more efficient than 10-year-old cars because of innovation and change&#151;we must recognise that road transport still accounts for 20 per cent. of all UK emissions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o189"><a name="90513-0010.htm_para25"><a name="09051352000892">Given that the House passed the Climate Change Act 2008&#151;this year&#146;s Budget contains the first three carbon budgets&#151;we have a legal duty to achieve the huge reduction in carbon emissions that Parliament set us in that legislation. One of the ways in which we must approach that is by dealing with the 20 per cent. of emissions that come from road transport. That means that we must incentivise technological change and innovation, as well as behavioural change.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o190"><a name="90513-0010.htm_para26"><a name="09051352000893">The changes in the Budget, which my hon. Friend the Member for Wolverhampton, South-West spoke about, form a coherent package to achieve that aim. It includes, as he pointed out, the changes to the tax on company cars, with lower tax for lower-carbon cars, lower rates in capital allowances for the business car regime for lower-carbon cars, and the differential rates of VED that we are discussing. Outwith the Budget process, but of equal importance, there is the &#163;250 million of support to provide incentives for ultra-low-carbon cars, too.</p>

That is why it is time-limited&#151;it ends in March next year&#151;and its cost is capped at &#163;300 million.

Therefore, by definition, if an older car is scrapped and replaced with a new, more efficient car, there will be some minor gains. However, I shall not stand at this Dispatch Box and argue that the scrappage scheme is primarily an environmental measure, because it is not designed in that way.</p>

 Again, I am grateful to the Exchequer Secretary; she has been very clear with the Committee, which will appreciate the point that she makes. Taking her pointers to the environmental benefit of the scrappage scheme, I should be grateful to know whether there has been any assessment of its environmental downside, in that more cars will be bought. I appreciate that the Government have not presented the measure as principally environmental, but will she examine the environmental minuses as well as the pluses?</p>

 We may be able to discuss scrappage in more detail at another stage of the Bill. To answer the hon. Gentleman&#146;s question, however, the point of the scrappage scheme is that to qualify, a car must be scrapped, so we are talking about replacing existing cars with newer, more energy-efficient cars. Clearly, on the issue of whole-life costs, there would have to be an assessment of whether we save on the environmental costs of making new cars, and some work is being done in that area. However, I would not want the hon. Gentleman to run away with the idea that the primary aim of the scheme is anything other than to try to give a temporary, and I think much-needed, boost to a great British manufacturing sector that is in great need of support. That is the point of scrappage.</p>

His argument was hung on an amendment that has not been selected, so we shall not talk about that, except to say that it would definitely be retrospective to try to go back to engine size rather than CO2 emissions as a basis for VED. We were the first country to base vehicle excise duties on CO2 emissions, and six more European countries now do so. We have achieved major reductions in emissions from our car fleet as a result&#151;partially, at least&#151;of that change. It sends good signals to consumers, but we need to improve on and even increase those signals if we are to hit our very demanding targets for averting dangerous climate change. Clearly, that is something in which we all have a direct interest.</p>

We have some data that hint at connections, but not in the sort of detail that he would like. Some data suggest that low-income households are more likely to own cars with smaller engines.

<p><a name="stpa_o196"><a name="90513-0011.htm_para5"><a name="09051352000901">We also have data to suggest that the majority of the cars that emit the most carbon are owned by higher-income households.

I am happy to talk to him to ascertain whether we can analyse the distributional impact of the shift from high to low CO2 emitting cars on the engine pool, and particularly on his constituents and many of mine, who are not always known for going to the latest car showroom and getting the latest model.</p>

 I shall take up the Exchequer Secretary&#146;s offer and her suggestion about others with whom I might make contact.

We hope that we will not have a Government who are not green-minded, as my hon. Friend describes this Government to be.</p>

 We try to bear the big picture in mind throughout the budgeting process. We do not consider vehicle excise duties in isolation, but alongside other duties. We then examine their distributional impact, so I hope that we can make my right hon. Friend pleased with our fair approach.</p>

Clearly, over time, the number of cars in that pool diminishes. Although engine size can act as a proxy for emissions, my hon.

 The arguments that I want to present have been reprised over many years. Indeed, I have the <i> Hansards </i>of all the debates going back to 2005 and will refer to some of them. On a number of occasions when I have tried to introduce a similar measure, there have been rather different circumstances, with modest, and sometimes significant, price spiking, the consequence of which we have seen.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o202"><a name="90513-0011.htm_para11"><a name="09051352000912">In 2005, when I first attempted to introduce a similar measure, I pointed out that the price of a litre of unleaded petrol had risen by 6p over six months, to 86p a litre. By the time that we debated the issue in 2008, the price of fuel had gone up to between &#163;1.10 and &#163;1.30 a litre, and on some of the islands, as well as in the more remote rural areas, it was significantly more. Today the price is relatively stable at about 95p a litre and $50 a barrel. Just for hon. Members&#146; information, in 2008 the price crashed through the $140 a barrel level.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o203"><a name="90513-0011.htm_para12"><a name="09051352000913">However, there is no certainty that prices will remain relatively low or relatively stable. Indeed, as the world comes out of recession, they might well rise. If India and China regain some of their impetus, there will be increased demand and inflationary pressures. If there is a cold European or north American winter, there will be demand on hydrocarbons and inflationary pressures. There might be supply-side shocks if there is war or terrorism in an oil-producing region, thereby causing the barrel price to rise.

The same article confirmed that a 20-vehicle haulage business would have to make &#163;30,000 more simply to meet its increased costs, and that was on top of the &#163;30,000 that it had to find for increased fuel costs in the previous year.

 May I pick up the hon. Gentleman&#146;s point about hauliers? A number of them have introduced a fuel surcharge and, rather like the airlines, they now add that surcharge to their normal bills. However, the surcharge has not always come down in line with the price of fuel. Has that been drawn to his attention?</p>

 It has. The price might not always come down in line with the price of fuel, but I must point out to the hon. Gentleman that many of the surcharges were put in place when the price rises were expected to be modest. They were also capped, and as the cap could not be exceeded, when the price spiked dramatically, hauliers that I know of&#151;I name no names&#151;made a loss.</p>

Ramage went bust, as did many others, and fuel costs were cited as a contributory factor. We know from previous debates that hauliers in Campbeltown were selling trucks and laying off drivers. The Freight Transport Association, citing figures released by the Office for National Statistics, tells us that the number of people seeking work as a heavy goods vehicle driver has risen from 3,280 in March 2008 to 15,000 this year. I suspect that that is because of the number of drivers who have been made redundant, rather than because a huge number are training to become hauliers at this very difficult time.</p>

We cannot mitigate all the price rises, because they occur for all kinds of reasons, including because of costs of sale and delivery, but we need to militate against the worst rises, particularly when they are driven by the barrel price of oil. I therefore propose, as I have done before, a simple measure that would oblige the Government to lay out their forecasts and to introduce a statutory instrument to reduce the duty when the price rises. The reduction would be the equivalent of the amount of extra VAT that would be gained due to the increased price at the pump. That amount could come from the VAT windfall or the North sea windfall, because it would be directly related to the price of oil.</p>

Having stepped on and then off the fuel escalator, there have been times when the Government have announced a fuel duty increase only then to postpone its implementation.

In a period during which the oil price rises, there is a distinct risk that the strength of public opinion will lead to any Government feeling under great pressure to abandon the fuel escalator.

I take on board his point, however.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman is talking about smoothing out bumps, which I am always in favour of doing, especially when I am doing my ironing. Will he tell us a bit about where he would set the baseline, because that is important? If one is smoothing out the bumps, one has to have a place where one thinks the price is reasonable, and that is a very difficult area of this entire debate. We all have to remember that we are dealing with a very volatile commodity price.</p>

 The Exchequer Secretary makes a good point; one of things that we have asked in our consultation is where and how one sets that baseline. It is possible to find a baseline that recognises where the burden falls on the motorist and what an acceptable level is. That is not an insuperable difficulty.</p>

 I agree that it is not insuperable. Once the baseline is identified, the real key is the ability to reset it at regular intervals. One of our suggestions was that at the Budget and the pre-Budget report the ticker could be reset, so that if we found that there was a structural increase, the baseline would be reset, whereas if we found just a cyclical change or a spike, it might not need to be reset. The timing is as important as the baseline figure.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman makes a good point. I agree that there needs to be flexibility on the baseline and that it needs to be reviewed regularly, but that in no way undermines the stability that could be brought to fuel prices. The stabiliser has a number of advantages. Leaving aside the big advantage that it protects the public from spikes in oil price, it helps price stability as a whole. Fuel prices can contribute to inflation significantly, so the stabiliser would assist the Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of England in ensuring that its attempts to target inflation were not affected by volatile international markets.</p>

that the Government benefit from increased VAT when oil prices increase and that that windfall can be used to reduce fuel duty. I am sure that the Exchequer Secretary will make the point&#151;that, in itself, does not make it wrong&#151;that consumers then spend less on other things. With an increase in the VAT revenue obtained from fuel, there tends to be a decrease in revenue from other areas. However, there is a link with North sea oil production and the revenue that comes from it. When oil prices fall there is a shortfall in that duty, but when they rise there is an increase in that duty, as the numbers for the past couple of years show. In 2008-09, the revenue from North sea oil increased by 66 per cent. when oil prices were increasing, whereas the revenue will halve for 2009-10&#151;at least that is the Treasury&#146;s estimate&#151;as oil prices fall. That is what happens when fuel prices move in opposite directions. Thus, we believe that over a cycle&#151;over a reasonably long period&#151;this proposal would be revenue neutral, and that we can do things in a more cautious way. The proposal would provide stability to not only personal finances, but the public finances.</p>

As far as our carbon emission target is concerned, it would be beneficial to have a mechanism ensuring that we were not quite so dependent on volatile international oil markets.</p>

To some extent, the Government are reacting to fuel prices and pursuing a fuel stabiliser policy almost by default&#151;when fuel prices fall, they are bolder in their increases, but when fuel costs rise they hesitate to raise duty.

He made a good attempt to argue for it. He said that the Government arrangements were ad hoc and haphazard, but that is called the free market.

A huge increase in the price of milk or bread has an impact on the bottom line of a catering business, so I look forward to the Conservatives&#146; fair food stabiliser. What about the effect on businesses when energy prices vary or when gas or electricity prices go up? That will have an impact on nearly all businesses, but it will have a profound impact on those that are particularly energy intensive. When will the Conservatives introduce their fair energy stabiliser? The truth is that they regard those matters as less politically sensitive and, as a result, they do not have stabilisers. That is not because of intellectual coherence, but because they think that it is not electorally expedient.</p>

In fact, such a mechanism would destabilise the public finances&#151;the opposite of the intended effect&#151;by producing wild swings in duty rates, and pose significant administrative problems to both the Government and fuel producers.</p>

 First, I will deal with the point about the so-called windfalls, which do not exist. Secondly, the hon. Gentleman&#146;s mechanism is about VAT, but the other mechanisms under discussion are, as far as we can tell, about the income we purportedly get from North sea oil when prices rise.</p>

 I will explain why that is not the case, and why the proposal will produce perverse results. When oil prices rise, the premise is that the Government receive a windfall from either increased North sea tax revenues or greater revenues from VAT on fuel. As I argued last year, however, that is not the case. Although high oil prices might push up revenues from North sea oil taxes, there is no automatic link, as the significant increase in costs for oil companies that accompanied the last price spike showed. The impact of high oil prices on the wider economy means that the increase in North sea revenue is offset by falling revenues elsewhere for the Government. Lower GDP growth and higher energy costs reduce the yield from income and corporation taxes, while higher fuel prices lead to lower fuel consumption and lower revenues from fuel duty. For example, in 2008-09, when oil prices reached record highs in the summer, fuel duty receipts were &#163;300 million below their 2007-08 level. In that sense, there is no windfall. <i> [Interruption.] </i>It is easy for Opposition parties to spend windfalls, but they do not exist as net windfalls for Government revenues, as I have just demonstrated.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o253"><a name="90513-0013.htm_para15"><a name="09051352001010">Turning to VAT and the alleged windfalls that form the basis of the Scottish National party&#146;s regulator mechanism, high fuel prices at the pump do not produce an overall increase in VAT receipts. When consumers have to pay more for fuel, they tend to buy less of other goods, thereby paying less VAT elsewhere. To prove that, in 2008-09, when crude oil prices and fuel prices reached record levels, total VAT receipts were almost &#163;2 billion below their 2007-08 levels. Again, Opposition parties are trying to spend windfalls that do not exist in net form for Government receipts. They are trying to attach automatic mechanisms that would oblige us to spend windfalls that we do not have. Such distortionary effects on public spending would do great damage and achieve the opposite of stability&#151;volatility, with large, sudden holes in public finances, which could be avoided without such mechanisms.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o254"><a name="90513-0013.htm_para16"><a name="09051352001011">As well as that fundamental objection to the principle of the fuel duty regulator, there are also serious practical problems with its implementation. Under the proposed Scottish National party mechanism, the Chancellor would produce at each Budget an oil price forecast for the coming year, which would act as what is described as a baseline price. Fuel duty rates would be reduced when oil prices rose above that baseline, and would rise when oil prices fell below it. We should take a bit of time to focus on how important the baseline&#151;and the amount at which it was set&#151;would be. It would have a real effect on tax duties, yet it would be very subjective.</p>

<p><a name="st_o268"><a name="09051352001012"><a name="90513-0013.htm_spnew13"><a name="09051352002147"><b>Mr. Jeremy Browne:</b>
 I am fascinated by the process by which the Minister thinks that the baseline would be arrived at. Is it something about which Lord Hattersley, or other people with expertise in Government intervention from the 1970s, would be able to advise the Conservative party?</p>

<p><a name="st_o269"><a name="09051352001013"><a name="90513-0013.htm_spnew14"><a name="09051352002148"><b>Angela Eagle:</b>
 I suspect that Gazprom, or some of the more centralised old Soviet planners, might be able to take a view on the correct baseline for oil. I must confess that I do not know how one could set that baseline, other than very subjectively. What would be a fair baseline price? The process of determining the baseline would be likely to be highly arbitrary, and therefore open to frequent challenge. The Government would have a constant incentive to set the baseline higher, and motorists and other organisations would call for it to be lower, because that would have an effect on whether prices went up or down.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o255"><a name="90513-0013.htm_para17"><a name="09051352001014">Last summer, the Opposition appeared to suggest that the Budget forecast should be used as a baseline, but as is well known, oil prices can be volatile and difficult to predict. I suspect that if the Conservative party had predicted oil prices, and had known what was to come, it would not have released its press release and developed its so-called fuel duty stabiliser. It is certainly indisputable that in recent years, forecasts of the price of oil have been subject to wide margins of error. In Budget 2008, the average of independent forecasts, which is what we use for the Red Book, was just below $84 a barrel, yet within four months of last year&#146;s Budget, oil prices had reached a record peak of just over $146 a barrel. Another four months later, by the time of the 2008 pre-Budget report, oil prices had fallen by more than 60 per cent. to below $50 a barrel. After further fluctuations in the first few months of this year, on Budget day 2009, the Brent crude price closed at $49.81 a barrel.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o256"><a name="90513-0013.htm_para18"><a name="09051352001015">According to information from the Conservatives outlining the policy for their so-called stabiliser mechanism, a $6 per barrel shift in the crude oil price would result in a 1p per litre adjustment to the fuel duty rate, yet as my right hon. Friend the Chief Secretary pointed out on the subject last year&#151;she is here, listening to the debate with great interest&#151;crude oil prices frequently moved by more than $6 a barrel in a single day. In the past year, the oil price moved by more than $12 a barrel on five occasions in the course of a week.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o257"><a name="90513-0013.htm_para19"><a name="09051352001016">Instead of a change being triggered by a $6 difference in the oil price, one could, I suppose, adjust fuel duty at certain set points throughout the year, as the Conservatives originally suggested, but there would then be a significant risk of a market distortion. If the crude oil price were to be regularly compared against the baseline price, it could offer oil traders incentives to bid up the oil price before each assessment date, in the hope of artificially engineering a lower fuel duty rate. Gaming takes place when there are such things to predict and bet against, as I am sure the hon. Member for South-West Hertfordshire (Mr. Gauke) knows.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o258"><a name="90513-0013.htm_para20"><a name="09051352001017">Speculation that the duty rate was about to change as the assessment date approached could encourage forestalling activity to avoid duty, producing yet further instability.

 I am interested in this point, because amendment 11 asks the Chancellor to undertake research. As the Minister rightly said, the report from the official Opposition has been suppressed, and it is now the task of the Treasury to try to undertake that research. Can she give me an assessment of the cost of undertaking that research, and tell me what the administrative burdens will be on retailers, specifically petrol retailers, who might find it impractical if the price is adjusted every single day as a consequence of the stabiliser? Such retailers may also find that the system has a detrimental impact on employment.</p>

 Depending on how the so-called stabiliser was applied, those would clearly be important issues. I look forward to seeing the results of the Opposition&#146;s consultation, where they will no doubt set out these issues out in great detail so that we can make an even more detailed judgment of their policy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o259"><a name="90513-0013.htm_para21"><a name="09051352001020">Fuel prices do not immediately alter following adjustments in the oil price. If fuel duty were altered on a monthly or bi-monthly basis, it would be highly unlikely to result in a constant fuel price, as oil prices often rise and fall at very short notice. If the stabiliser were to alter on a six-monthly basis, it might not respond to oil spikes at all.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o260"><a name="90513-0013.htm_para22"><a name="09051352001021">For example, imagine that in 2008 the Budget oil price forecast of $84 a barrel had been used as a baseline, but the fuel duty rate was adjusted only every six months, on 1 April and 1 October, say. On 1 April 2008 the Brent price was $100 a barrel, but on 1 October 2008 the Brent price was $95 a barrel, so had a stabiliser been operating on a six-monthly basis, it would barely have changed, yet we would have had the huge spike in the middle, with no response to it whatsoever. That is a funny definition of stability, or lack of bumps, so to speak.</p>

A close reading of pages 3 and 4 of their consultation document, which they put out last July, suggests that their so-called stabiliser might be based on fuel prices rather than oil prices, which is another odd way of doing it. If we were to interpret the Opposition&#146;s proposal in this way, today&#146;s average petrol price figures quoted from the same source as they used, PetrolPrices.com, would mean that the fuel duty stabiliser would put an immediate 5.5p on the price of unleaded fuel.

Members will notice that this amendment is similar to amendments that have been tabled by hon. Friends on the Liberal Democrat Benches in previous years, and I make no apology for returning to the subject this year. The aim of the amendment is to tackle the continuing unfairness of the fuel premium that drivers have to pay in remote rural areas. This serious problem has a severe impact on the economy of those areas on the mainland and on all our islands.</p>

<p><a name="st_o282"><a name="09051375000011"><a name="90513-0014.htm_spnew9"><a name="09051375002748"><b>Mr. Angus MacNeil (Na h-Eileanan an Iar) (SNP):</b>
 The hon. Gentleman will be aware that, in constituencies such as mine and his own, we pay more tax per litre of fuel than in any other part of the United Kingdom. That anomaly should not continue, and a fuel duty regulator is urgently needed by our island communities so that our taxes can be fair, equal and level across the country.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman is absolutely right to say that his constituents and mine pay more tax on our fuel than people in the rest of the country. The way to tackle that is through the proposal in our amendment for a rural fuel discount.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o269"><a name="90513-0014.htm_para8"><a name="09051375000013">People who live in remote rural areas suffer a triple whammy on their fuel. First, by necessity, they have to travel long distances. Secondly, the price of fuel is higher than in urban areas. Thirdly, there is a complete lack of public transport. The premium that people in remote areas have to pay for their fuel varies. I will give some examples that compare the prices in my own constituency with those charged in Glasgow. Close to the eastern boundary of my constituency, which is closer to Glasgow, the price tends to be 1p or 2p a litre higher than it is in the city. Moving to the furthest part of the mainland from Glasgow, the price differential around Campbeltown, down at the tip of the Kintyre peninsula, was 6p a litre more than in Glasgow the last time I checked. The price tends to be even higher at some of the small filling stations in the more rural parts of the mainland.</p>

That is bad enough, but the price differential becomes far larger on the Atlantic islands. On the larger islands such as Mull and Islay, the price of fuel is usually about 15p a litre higher than in Glasgow, and as much as 30p higher on smaller islands such as Coll and Colonsay. That price differential, which has to be paid by local  <br>

 I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for giving way again; he is most kind. When I first raised this issue with the Treasury three years ago, I was told that if a fuel duty regulator such as that proposed in the amendment was brought in for the islands, people would travel from places such as Glasgow to buy fuel in Stornoway, Benbecula or Barra. That was clearly nonsense, and the hon. Gentleman&#146;s proposal represents at least a step towards the kind of parity that is sadly lacking at the moment, as we can see from his figures.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman is absolutely right. The Treasury has certainly used that argument in relation to the mainland, although even Treasury Ministers have not tried to argue that that would be the case for the islands. I will describe later how that supposed pitfall can be overcome on the mainland. Clearly, no one would pay the extortionate fares charged by Caledonian MacBrayne to go to the islands in my constituency.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman is tempting me, but he knows perfectly well that the Scottish Government treat my constituency much less fairly than his. However, I shall return to the subject of the debate before you intervene, Sir Michael.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o271"><a name="90513-0014.htm_para10"><a name="09051375000019">In remote areas, the car is an essential, not a luxury. Let us consider the purpose of the high fuel duty. One argument that the Government put forward is that it is designed to encourage people to change their behaviour and to use public transport instead of their cars. However, that fails completely in remote rural areas because of the complete lack of public transport alternatives. No environmental purpose would be served by local councils in remote areas subsidising more buses, because they would be running with only one or two passengers, and a couple of passengers on a bus are clearly a great deal less environmentally friendly than people using a car.</p>

<p><a name="st_o288"><a name="09051375000020"><a name="90513-0014.htm_spnew15"><a name="09051375002754"><b>John Thurso:</b>
 Is my hon. Friend aware that Royal Mail, in its pre-privatisation mode, has slashed post bus services in many of our constituencies? As a result, there are now no post buses, and no bus services of any kind, on the north coast of Scotland.</p>

 Royal Mail is also removing two post bus services in my constituency, on the islands of Colonsay and Lismore, thus causing more difficulties for local people and visitors alike.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o272"><a name="90513-0014.htm_para11"><a name="09051375000022">To add insult to injury, as well as paying a higher price for their fuel, people pay more to the Exchequer in tax because the higher price means that VAT is higher as well. A basic principle of taxation is that it should be equitable, but it is clearly not equitable for an area to pay more VAT than is paid in other parts of the country. What makes the position even more perverse is that fuel costs are lower in areas with public transport alternatives than in areas with none.</p>

 My hon. Friend is making a strong case. As he has pointed out, a key element of the problem is that it is harder to run businesses and other services in some rural areas. Although some may view such areas as prosperous, wages are often very low, and the economy is under threat for all sorts of other reasons.</p>

<p><a name="st_o291"><a name="09051375000024"><a name="90513-0014.htm_spnew18"><a name="09051375002757"><b>Mr. Reid:</b>
 I am not sure whether my hon. Friend has been reading my speech over my shoulder, but I was about to make that very point. In the highlands and islands, incomes are much lower than in the rest of the country, but the Treasury is asking people there to spend far more on fuel and to pay more tax on it. Fuel represents a greater share of disposable income in the highlands and islands in the first place.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o273"><a name="90513-0014.htm_para12"><a name="09051375000025">The purpose of amendment 5 is to identify a workable solution to the problem: reducing the premium that people are paying for their fuel in remote rural areas. On previous occasions, the Chancellor and other Treasury Ministers, including the Exchequer Secretary, have expressed sympathy and a desire to look at the evidence. As a result, my hon. Friend the Member for Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross (John Thurso) produced a paper, a copy of which I have with me. My hon. Friend circulated the paper, sending it to, among others, the Chancellor, and the amendment is based on it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o274"><a name="90513-0014.htm_para13"><a name="09051375000026">Scottish national statistics include what is described as the eightfold urban-rural classification, which is shown on a map in my hon. Friend&#146;s paper along with the definitions. I understand that similar definitions exist in other parts of the United Kingdom. The Treasury could use various classifications depending on exactly where it wanted to target the scheme, but in Scotland I should prefer it to include all the islands as well as two of the mainland classifications: very remote rural areas with a population of under 3,000 and more than a 60-minute travel time to a settlement with a population of over 10,000, and very remote small towns with a population of between 3,000 and 10,000 and more than a 60-minute travel time to a settlement with a population of over 10,000. Other definitions could be used, however, and the amendment allows the Treasury to define the area to be covered by the scheme in regulations.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o275"><a name="90513-0014.htm_para14"><a name="09051375000027">So it is perfectly possible to define the area to be covered by the scheme, but we also need&#151;and the amendment provides for&#151;a simple method of passing the tax rebate through the system. To do that, we need only designate the retail filling stations. Different filling stations would be eligible for different levels of discount depending on where they were situated. Obviously, a far higher discount would apply on islands than on remote parts of the mainland.</p>

The scheme works for all of them. If we agree that retail petrol stations are to be designated, all that will then be required is a robust system with an audit trail to ensure that the rebate is passed to the consumer and is accounted for in a way that ensures that there is no fraud. My hon. Friend&#146;s paper uses the VAT system to ensure that. There are details in the paper. I will not go through them all today but that paper has been made available to the Treasury and was circulated to any hon.  <br>

Member who was interested. The paper provides for a robust audit to ensure that the rebate arrives at the pump and benefits the motorist at the pump.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o277"><a name="90513-0015.htm_para1"><a name="09051375000029">In previous discussions the major criticism that Treasury Ministers have always made of the scheme is on the issue of cross-border exploitation.

 I think that the point about borders needs to be nailed down. In my case, if someone is to cross the border to get to Shetland, it is going to require a 12-hour ride on a ferry from Aberdeen, and the petrol would probably still be more expensive than in Aberdeen. How many people does my hon. Friend think are likely to cross that border?</p>

 The answer is zero. No one is going to take the ferry from Aberdeen to Orkney or Shetland to benefit from cheaper fuel. The same would clearly apply to any ferry journey. Even with the cheap ferry fares to the Western isles that people can pay now, it would not make sense for anyone to travel there for that reason, and certainly not in the case of the extortionate ferry fares that the Scottish Government charge to my constituency.</p>

<p><a name="st_o296"><a name="09051375000035"><a name="90513-0015.htm_spnew4"><a name="09051375002762"><b>Sir Robert Smith:</b>
 If the amendment were passed, at least the tourists who travelled to that area would face the same costs as they would if they chose to be a tourist elsewhere in the country. It would be fairer for the economy of the area in developing its potential as a tourist destination.</p>

<p><a name="st_o297"><a name="09051375000036"><a name="90513-0015.htm_spnew5"><a name="09051375002763"><b>Mr. Reid:</b>
 My hon. Friend makes an important point. At the moment, tourists are often put off returning to remote rural areas. When they get there, often they express outrage at the cost of fuel and say that they will not come back, despite the beautiful scenery. As for the islands, there is no argument that the scheme could be defrauded.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman is making a good point. Does he accept that one of the problems for those of us who represent rural areas is that petrol companies already offer a highly differentiated system of charging to individual garages or petrol stations. I would want some assurance that those petrol companies would operate with total transparency, so that we then knew what they expected motorists to pay. In my area I have one garage, which just happens to be within the area of Cheltenham, that is able to offer fuel at a much lower cost than that charged by every other local garage, and that cannot be fair.</p>

Friend the Member for Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross has written goes into such charging in detail and makes it clear that there must be a detailed audit trail to make sure that the discount is passed on to the motorist at the pump.</p>

The important point about our scheme is that the fuel discount would be set at such a level to reduce the extra costs that motorists are paying at the pump compared with urban areas, but it would not eliminate them entirely. Therefore, the price of fuel would still be slightly higher in remote parts of the mainland than in urban areas but the current obscenely large differentials would cease to exist. As a result, there would be no point in a motorist travelling a long distance&#151;from Glasgow up into the highlands, for instance&#151;to buy fuel, because it would still cost them more in the highlands than in Glasgow. However, those travelling to remote areas would benefit in any case, and tourists would be more likely to return rather than being put off from doing so by the current high fuel prices.</p>

 I am grateful to the hon. Member for Argyll and Bute (Mr. Reid) for tabling this amendment. Such discussions are, it is fair to say, a regular event for those of us who have dealt with a few Finance Bills; indeed, I sometimes wonder whether it is a constitutional obligation that we debate a remote rural fuel discount scheme during our deliberations on the Finance Bill. Such debates provide a good opportunity for some Members to highlight what is clearly an important issue for the areas that they represent&#151;the higher fuel prices that their constituents experience. I also recognise that in many remote rural areas public transport is very limited. Some people work in areas where using their own vehicles is a necessity&#151;and they are very often vehicles that are not as efficient as others, because they are dual-purpose.

 The hon. Gentleman will have heard my earlier intervention. The problem in rural areas is that this is not an argument about a discount; it is an argument about a premium that monopolistic petrol companies can exact, not only in isolated rural areas but in all rural areas. There is no competition, because those companies set whatever price they set, and people can do nothing about it. I have talked to countless proprietors of petrol stations and they tell me that there is no negotiation and no competition, because they are set a target and that is what they have to face.

 The hon.

 The argument here is about equitable taxation. There are two parts to the taxation on a litre of fuel&#151;duty and VAT.

This matter affects rural communities across the country, albeit in different ways, although it is demonstrated in its most extreme form in the sort of communities represented by my hon.

It is quite impossible for people in my Somerset constituency to use public transport to get to work because there is simply no system that allows them to do so. In my village, there is one bus a week. A person cannot ask their employer if they can attend only once a week, on the day that the bus runs, and expect to hold down a job. That shows the difficulty for people in my area. Of course, most couples and even families have to go to several destinations, because there is not one place that is a convenient provider of employment to which people can drive from a village or a very rural area. That means that some families need several cars&#151;certainly two, and sometimes more&#151;to allow their members to get to work or school, or to carry out all aspects of their normal lives.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o286"><a name="90513-0016.htm_para0"><a name="09051360000029">As income in rural areas is low, the price of fuel makes up a much higher proportion of weekly outgoings. People are therefore hit by an additional burden every time fuel duties or prices go up. Such rises have a disproportionate effect on the rural population and on the way in which people in rural areas carry out their business. There is also an indirect effect: it costs more to send delivery vans to local shops and stores. In every way, there is an economic disadvantage that has the price of fuel as a major determinant. The amendment, to which I am a cosignatory, is an attempt to address that basic economic injustice.</p>

I think that we all strongly support the idea that, to help to tackle climate change, we must try to reduce our reliance on cars and our use of fuel. We understand that, but the principle that that can be achieved by adding to the cost of fuel works only if there is a viable alternative. In rural areas, there is no elasticity in the system, because there is no alternative, so raising fuel prices does not encourage people to use their cars less. Instead, it merely encourages them to use more of their wages to carry on as before, which is entirely the opposite of what happens in conurbations and areas with public transport. I strongly believe that we should use fiscal means to discourage car use in areas in which an alternative is available, but it is essential that we accept that such a policy cannot and will not work in rural areas where that alternative is not available.</p>

That was the argument then. Now, the argument is that if the aim is to achieve environmental goods, there are ways to do that, but if a measure does not achieve an environmental good, it simply becomes yet another form of taxation affecting a part of our community that can least afford it&#151;the poorly paid people in rural areas whom we represent.</p>

Arriving at some of the definitions will be quite difficult, especially for an area such as mine, where the population distribution and density are very different from those found in the highlands and islands of Scotland.

I am sure that others will do the same, perhaps with more humour, but let me have a go. He said at the start of his speech that this subject comes up every year&#151;that it is a hardy perennial. There is a good reason for that: it is a matter of great importance, especially to those of us who represent a part of the country that is in many ways very different from the rest of the country. If he wants the debate to cease, he could assist by encouraging his hon. Friends to vote in the right direction and helping us to persuade the Minister to accept our proposal. If the scheme were allowed on to the statute book, there would be no need to have this debate next year and in subsequent years.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman is being uncharacteristically tetchy. As I acknowledged, we have this debate regularly because of the genuine concerns shared by a number of Members. However, every year the Liberal Democrats offer proposals that are pretty sketchy, and they cannot convince many other hon. Members of their case.</p>

 Our proposal is not sketchy. It is well thought through and carefully analysed. Although I do not want to steal his thunder, I may say that it was set out in the paper that my hon.

 Indeed, Members of other parties have made proposals. The intervention from the hon. Member for South-West Hertfordshire suggests a complete absence of desire on the part of the Conservatives to produce a measure of their own. It also suggests that they are out of touch with the reality in constituencies such as mine, which those of us who come from the north of Scotland&#151;and, I am sure, those from other rural areas&#151;see as characteristic of his party.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o290"><a name="90513-0016.htm_para4"><a name="09051360000044">My hon. Friend the Member for Argyll and Bute (Mr. Reid) has eloquently set out the problem that this measure is intended to address, if not fully resolve. Let me add to his evidence some perspective from my own constituency. First, it is worth setting the amendment in context, and an important aspect is that the cost of fuel has clearly been rising even over the last three or four months. The figures given in the AA&#146;s fuel prices report show that since January this year, the average price of a litre of petrol has risen in Scotland by 8.6p in comparison with 8.4p across the UK.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o291"><a name="90513-0016.htm_para5"><a name="09051360000045">These increases have a much more dramatic effect in constituencies such as mine and those of other Members who have spoken in the debate. For example, in Dalwhinnie in my constituency, a litre of diesel&#151;for the benefit of the hon. Member for South-West Hertfordshire, I am afraid I do not have the figures for a pint of beer&#151;is 109.9p, compared with 99.9p in Edinburgh. A litre of petrol is 101.9p in Fort Augustus, compared with 92.9p in Edinburgh. In Carrbridge, also in my constituency, a litre of petrol is 102.9p, which is 10p more than the equivalent price in Edinburgh. Members representing island constituencies have rightly stressed that the differentials are even more severe in the island areas, but the point I want to emphasise through these examples is that there are severe differentials in mainland areas of the highlands, too.</p>

<p><a name="st_o335"><a name="09051360000046"><a name="90513-0016.htm_spnew11"><a name="09051360000110"><b>Mr. MacNeil:</b>
 On a point of information, I add that in Stornoway today, the price for a litre of petrol is &#163;1.03, and diesel is &#163;1.13. I hope that that provides further context for the prices that the hon. Gentleman mentioned.</p>

<p><a name="st_o336"><a name="09051360000047"><a name="90513-0016.htm_spnew12"><a name="09051360000111"><b>Danny Alexander:</b>
 I am grateful for that intervention, as that evidence reinforces my case. I could provide further examples from my constituency, but I believe that I have already made the point.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o292"><a name="90513-0016.htm_para6"><a name="09051360000048">Alongside the higher costs, we need to consider the impact of not only fuel duty, but VAT. The fact that the price is higher means that, as well as paying more for their fuel, people are paying more VAT. It is not just that the individual faces higher costs; the Treasury is then reaping more benefit from the misfortune of the people who have no choice but to pay these higher prices. That provides yet another reason for those on the Treasury Bench to look positively on these proposals.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o293"><a name="90513-0016.htm_para7"><a name="09051360000049">Apart from the cost of fuel, this problem is highly burdensome to my constituents. As a matter of course, people living in the highlands and islands and other rural parts of the country have much longer distances to travel. I mentioned Dalwhinnie; someone living there who chooses to commute to work in Inverness faces a daily round trip of about 120 miles&#151;a substantial fuel cost by any measure. It is also worth saying that anyone  <br>

living in Dalwhinnie who wants to go to a supermarket faces a 60-mile round trip. Just obtaining the basic necessities of life, quite outside the work environment, necessitates a long journey, and in other constituencies the distances can sometimes be even greater. Many tens of thousands of miles can be involved for people just to commute back and forth to work and to go about their daily business&#151;it is not in any way unusual.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o294"><a name="90513-0016.htm_para8"><a name="09051360000050">My hon. Friend the Member for Somerton and Frome eloquently addressed the third element of the triple whammy of additional costs and pressures in relation to fuel for those who live in remote, rural areas: the availability of public transport. For those who live in Dalwhinnie, there is no local bus service&#151;there is an occasional Citylink coach service, but that requires a two-mile walk on to the main A9 roadway. My hon. Friends who have driven up and down that way from time to time will know that walking from the village to the motorway in any conditions other than the most clement is not ideal. In Carrbridge, there is no local bus service, and in places such as Fort Augustus and Drumnadrochit, a bus every two hours would be regarded as a high-frequency service.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o295"><a name="90513-0016.htm_para9"><a name="09051360000051">Such frequency or availability of public transport provides people with no realistic alternative to car use for necessary journeys. That is why I said in an intervention that in places such as the highlands and islands, using a car and filling it with fuel is not a luxury but a necessity; it is the only way people can go about their usual business. As my hon. Friend the Member for Argyll and Bute observed, environmental incentives in fuel duty can apply only when a genuine choice or alternative is on offer, and for many of my constituents that is simply not the case. For such people, the environmental incentive argument for fuel duty is not right.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o296"><a name="90513-0016.htm_para10"><a name="09051360000052">The case for the measure that we propose is accentuated by the current economic situation. We have seen a 75 per cent. increase in unemployment in the Highland council area, and many costs are increasing. For example, on price differentials, the latest rural Scotland price survey showed that food was 11 per cent. more expensive in rural areas covered by Highlands and Islands Enterprise than in urban Scotland. <i> [Interruption.] </i>As my hon. Friend the Member for Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross rightly observes from a sedentary position, part of the reason for those excess costs is the impact of the fuel price on transporting those goods to village shops and individuals. People are affected not just by the cost of journeys, but by the cost of goods and services.</p>

 Is there not another corollary: many businesses based in rural areas face higher costs in getting their goods to market? That has a knock-on effect on businesses in rural areas and the attempt to keep employment there.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman is absolutely right and makes an important point. The issue affects more or less every business in my constituency and, I am sure, in his. The disproportionate cost of fuel has a knock-on effect on businesses and customers. I will not stray from the matter under discussion to talk about the effect on parcel delivery charges, for example, but that is another bone of contention&#151;a hardy perennial perhaps. People rightly feel strongly that the excessive parcel charges they must pay are not justified by the fuel price,  <br>

and that that does not begin to cover the differential. Hon. Members will be aware that research by Highlands and Islands Enterprise shows that fuel accounts for 18 per cent. of the costs of people living in the highlands and islands, compared with 13 per cent. across the country as a whole. That goes some way to show the substantially greater economic burden on the rural communities that I and others represent.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o297"><a name="90513-0016.htm_para11"><a name="09051360000055">The merits of our proposal are many, and I will not develop all of them at length, although I am sure that the paper written by my hon. Friend the Member for Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross could be read into the record if that was felt necessary. First, the proposal offers a clear route forward to applying the principle that we are trying to set out. The Scottish Executive&#146;s eightfold urban-rural classification scheme provides a ready, well worked out, carefully thought-through basis on which to apply a discount. English MPs will know that Natural England has produced a similar&#151;it is not precisely the same&#151;classification for England.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o298"><a name="90513-0016.htm_para12"><a name="09051360000056">I differ slightly with my hon. Friend the Member for Argyll and Bute in that I think that the discount could usefully be applied to three of the categories. I would add to the two that he mentioned the category of remote rural&#151;areas with a population of fewer than 3,000 people, within a 30 to 60-minute drive of a settlement with a population of 10,000 or more. Even if those three groups in the classification were included within the scope of the application of the proposal, it would still mean that areas lived in by roughly only 3 per cent. of the population of Scotland would benefit from it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o299"><a name="90513-0016.htm_para13"><a name="09051360000057">It is worth placing it on record that although the scheme would benefit many of the rural areas in my constituency, the large city of Inverness, which has slightly higher prices than other parts of the country, would not be a direct beneficiary. Last year, I was involved in protracted but successful negotiations with Tesco to persuade it to reduce its petrol price in the city of Inverness, so Inverness has benefited in other ways from Liberal Democrat Members&#146; efforts to reduce the cost of fuel. The scheme would not directly benefit the city of Inverness, but it certainly would benefit the rest of the rural highlands and islands. There is some merit in the suggestion made by my hon. Friend the Member for Argyll and Bute, that starting the scheme in island areas would be a good way to establish the principle and check for fraud and so on&#151;issues that he rightly addressed, but on which I do not intend to focus. That would be a good way of starting the ball rolling.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o300"><a name="90513-0016.htm_para14"><a name="09051360000058">There are established international precedents for our proposal. Indeed, a derogation from the European Union&#146;s energy products directive explicitly allows member states to have differential levels of fuel duty. That power is already exercised by the Governments of France, Greece and Portugal. Each of them has chosen to use the measure to benefit geographically remote, sparsely populated areas that they consider sufficiently important to merit use of the power for their benefit. There is no legal barrier to the United Kingdom Government using the same power&#151;</p>

 There is just a political one, as my hon. Friend says. Indeed, I understand that UK Ministers supported the power to vary fuel duty in the Council of Ministers. I fail to see why, having done so, our Ministers cannot find a way to apply that power in the UK for the benefit of the remote and rural communities of this country. The derogation in the directive allows a maximum differential of 3.54 euro cents on a litre of petrol. Those who follow exchange rates carefully will know that that currently amounts to about 3p per litre. That would make a difference, although perhaps not enough of a difference in many areas. There is a strong case for lobbying, and working within, the European Union to increase the size of the differential allowed. None the less, a differential is allowed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o301"><a name="90513-0016.htm_para15"><a name="09051360000061">The measure is fair because the benefit is targeted at a small but important group of people who suffer as a result of a particular unfairness under the current system. The hon. Member for South-West Hertfordshire implied that anyone interested in government would not support the proposal; I think that anyone interested in governing the country fairly would support it, and that is why Liberal Democrat Members&#151;<i> [Interruption</i><i> ]</i>&#151;and the whole country support it. Liberal Democrats from not just the north of Scotland, but across the whole United Kingdom, support it. It is proposed not just on sectional, regional grounds, but on the basis of fairness; we think that the measure is the right thing to do for the country as a whole.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o302"><a name="90513-0016.htm_para16"><a name="09051360000062">Of course, the current economic circumstances reinforce the reason why the measure is important for the country as a whole. It would support an economic stimulus in the highlands and islands. The point has been made that it is not just local people who would benefit from the reduction proposed in the amendment, but tourists visiting the area. Tourism is an important part of the economy in parts of my constituency. In areas such as Badenoch and Strathspey, it is thought to be about 80 per cent. of the economy. Clearly, the measure would help to reduce tourists&#146; costs, and would also help to increase tourism spend in what is already a very popular tourist destination&#151;</p>

 The hon. Gentleman indulges in economic forecasting. There is reason to believe that the measure would bring some benefit by increasing economic activity, reducing the burden on small businesses, putting more money in people&#146;s pockets that they could then spend on other things, and supporting the tourism industry. All those things are potentially revenue generators that would help to defray, if not completely offset, the cost of the measure.</p>

When I travel on the train from London to Montrose, I can get a bus from Montrose to Brechin, where I live. That is relatively easy. Recently, my trusty old Honda&#151;that should be rusty old Honda now; I shall certainly go for the Government&#146;s scrappage scheme&#151;was in the garage, and I found myself having to get from my home to my offices, which I found difficult.</p>

He cannot get in for 9 am, despite those being two of the larger towns in the county. He has to go via Montrose on the bus to Angus college because that is the only public transport available. It is extremely difficult for people to travel around by public transport, even within the main towns. Outwith the main towns, up in glens of Angus&#151;I am sure it is the same elsewhere&#151;there is little or no bus service. Even the intercity buses that travel between the cities will not stop in many of these areas, so one has to make several connections to get to, say, Dundee or Aberdeen. There is a real problem with the few alternatives to public transport, which is why cars are so important in rural areas.</p>

In Brechin, there is now only one petrol station, which is attached to a small Tesco store. On the main road that runs from Dundee to Aberdeen, there is another petrol station, but its prices are astronomical because it has a captive audience, so to speak. The map that the hon.

Very little of my constituency&#151;only the remoter glens&#151;falls into that area, but that in turn produces another problem. People living in those glens require the benefit of the proposed scheme, but there are no petrol stations.</p>

People have to get in their cars not only to go to supermarkets and to commute to work, but to find a petrol station, because they simply do not exist in many areas any more. Many small, independent rural petrol stations have gone&#151;effectively driven out of business by the majors. In my constituency, one will be lucky to find a petrol station that is not run either by Shell or Esso. I believe that there is one Mobil station left, but that is it; the independents have gone.

I understand that point, and papers may be available elsewhere, but I have a horrible memory of serving on the Committee that scrutinised what became the Energy Act 2004. In it, there was a wonderful power defining the area where it would be possible to cap charges for renewable energy. Everybody assumed that that area was the highlands and islands of Scotland and gaily passed the legislation, but we then found that it was not; it was only some of the islands of Scotland. That has been a source of contention ever since, so there is a danger in not defining exactly what one means by &#147;remote rural areas&#148;.</p>

Defining &#147;qualifying retail outlets&#148; would also be a problem because of the lack of such outlets in the remote rural areas that form part of my constituency. The outlets that people use are not in remote areas but in the more populated, coastal area, because that is the only place where one can get petrol in Angus. There are difficulties with the amendment, but that does not mean that we will not support it, because we will.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o310"><a name="90513-0017.htm_para7"><a name="09051375000049">We have heard a lot about how the situation affects individuals and families, and goods going into the area, and it is true, because the lack of an alternative to road transport means that the price of fuel feeds through to the price of everything. Everything in rural areas costs more because it costs more to transport it there, but, when intervening on the hon. Member for Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey (Danny Alexander), I made the point that it also affects businesses that are based in, and try to transport goods out of, rural areas. Many are food-based, farming or food-processing businesses, and their products have a relatively short shelf life, so they have to move them quickly and pay the costs of doing so. The situation impacts on people&#146;s ability to set up, run and maintain rural businesses, which are important in this period of recession, as employment in rural areas is under considerable pressure. We must maintain that employment, so anything that creates greater costs and increased pressure for such businesses is wrong. It is wrong that they face the discriminatory fuel cost before us. For all those reasons, we will support the amendment.</p>

for road-equivalent transport, which is doing great things for the western isles. The hon. Member for Argyll and Bute (Mr. Reid) was a bit sniffy about it, but I should remind him that while his party and the Labour party were in power for eight years in Scotland, there was no road-equivalent tariff and no attempt to do anything for any island.

 When I came into the Chamber to support my hon. Friend the Member for Argyll and Bute (Mr. Reid), I did not intend to speak about the amendment, but I am brought to my feet partly by the comments of the hon. Member for South-West Hertfordshire (Mr. Gauke), and also to say what has happened to my paper since last year.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o313"><a name="90513-0017.htm_para10"><a name="09051375000053">Let me pick up two points that the hon. Member for Angus (Mr. Weir) made. First, I want to comment on the definition of the area. The map in my paper and the area chosen are used for the Scottish Executive&#146;s definition and are available on their website. They are also used for a variety of Government definitions. If the amendment progressed to Committee, it is an accepted convention of the House that Members can work on the assumption that any paper supporting secondary legislation broadly outlines the scheme. That happens when the Government publish notes to secondary legislation that might be introduced. By producing a detailed paper, which can say far more than the limited wording of an amendment, I hoped that there would be sufficient detail to satisfy hon. Members who took an interest in those points.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o314"><a name="90513-0017.htm_para11"><a name="09051375000054">The second point was the availability of rural filling stations, about which the hon. Gentleman is right. If one drives along the coast of Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross, one sees many abandoned filling stations, which no longer serve fuel for many reasons. However, I deliberately chose a tight area to exclude any accusation that petrol stations that did not charge the premium might be included. I therefore acknowledge that the remedy for the injustice to those who suffer from a premium will apply only to the remoter areas. Other areas on boundaries will not benefit. I make no apology for that because I would rather get something for those most in need than try to satisfy everybody.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o315"><a name="90513-0017.htm_para12"><a name="09051375000055">The hon. Member for South-West Hertfordshire and I served together on the Treasury Committee&#151;indeed, I also served with the Exchequer Secretary. Both are reasonable Members and I will therefore try a reasoned approach. The hon. Gentleman said that our amendment was sketchy. Last year, when I wrote the paper before tabling an amendment, which was similar to the one that my hon. Friend the Member for Argyll and Bute has tabled today, I circulated it to Conservative Front Benchers, wrote to the Chancellor and raised the matter in Committee and elsewhere. The paper was deliberately framed to answer questions that had been asked on many previous occasions about lack of detail. The amendment would enable Ministers to take the appropriate action and the paper proposes a reasoned scheme for achieving that. The paper defines the area and the number of people, and touches on cost. Our paper  <br>

cannot, therefore, be accused of being sketchy. Perhaps the research of the hon. Member for South-West Hertfordshire was a little sketchy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o316"><a name="90513-0017.htm_para13"><a name="09051375000056">I was grateful for the sympathy with which the Exchequer Secretary and her colleagues received my entreaties and for our interchange. Unfortunately, it resulted in the Treasury&#146;s saying no&#151;not a wholly unexpected result. Nevertheless, I am grateful for the progress of having a good discussion. The Treasury said no for two reasons: the cross-border issue and the complexity of the administration. I believe that my hon. Friends have already addressed the cross-border issue. We are talking about reducing a premium. However, the premium will always exist; therefore, it will never make sense for anybody to drive into an area where there is a premium and pay more for their petrol. No one will be encouraged to do that. The situation is quite different in Northern Ireland, where there are two wholly separate prices. I would ask the Exchequer Secretary&#146;s officials to look into that point.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o317"><a name="90513-0017.htm_para14"><a name="09051375000057">The other point is about the administration of the scheme. I believe that, without having written an entire financial accounting system, I have put forward a relatively straightforward scheme, in which the VAT system could be used to operate our proposal to ensure that any rebate given, via the wholesaler to the petrol station, would have to go to the individual motorist. I still believe that to be a sensible and viable way forward and, frankly, no more complex than many schemes run by the Government in other areas.</p>

recently by my hon. Friend the Member for Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross (John Thurso), but let us take it at face value. We hear that accusation year in year out from the Conservatives; and year in year out, that is their only contribution to this debate. The conclusion that I draw, as will many of my constituents and many across the highlands and islands, is that the Conservatives make that contribution because they cannot be bothered to do anything more.</p>

As a consequence of the increased costs, we see the continuation of population drift&#151;and if there is a single threat to my communities that is greater and more immediate than the high cost of fuel, it is a declining population.</p>

flesh on the bones, so I do not think it is fair for either Conservative Front Benchers or Treasury Ministers to claim, as they do, I am afraid, that this is an empty amendment. It inevitably provides a framework, because that is the way these proposals are often tabled, but behind it is a large amount of work that we have happily volunteered and are continuing to volunteer to the Treasury.

 We have had a passionate debate, and it is right that I should begin by acknowledging the genuine issues surrounding the fact that cars are a necessity in remote rural areas. No one in their right mind could think otherwise. Some rural areas are not served by regular bus routes, so having a vehicle, and having access to petrol with which to run it, can be seen as a necessity. I also acknowledge the worries that have been expressed about higher fuel prices, to which all the Members who have spoken in the debate clearly respond, as it comes up regularly in their contacts with their constituents. I would have expected that to be the case; the fact that I do not represent glens or remote rural areas does not mean that I do not understand that such issues come up in Members&#146; meetings with their constituents. They rightly receive those representations and reflect in this House the frustration and anger, and worry and sense of unfairness felt by their constituents.

rural areas have presented to us before over the years. As the process has gone on, we have had debates about that measure. As well as hearing from Members from Scotland and its remote rural areas or islands, we have heard from Northern Irish Members, and the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome (Mr. Heath), who has his own rural areas to represent. I acknowledge the cost issues for those who live in rural areas, but I think that other Members&#151;particularly opposition Members&#151;ought also to acknowledge that their solution to this is not an easy one and that it is not without its own difficulties. In a grown-up debate on the issue, I would acknowledge the problems related to the higher fuel prices and other Members would acknowledge that the solution that they are pushing is not without its problems. If we were to do that, we might have the chance of a reasonable discussion.</p>

 I am grateful to the Minister for giving way. Will she acknowledge that the highest fuel prices mentioned in the debate are up in Stornoway, where petrol costs &#163;1.03 and diesel costs &#163;1.13? Will she therefore acknowledge that people living on the islands of Scotland are paying more tax per litre of fuel in duty and VAT than those living anywhere else in the country? The argument is about tax fairness. The tax the Exchequer gets from a litre of petrol in Stornoway should be the same as it gets from a litre of petrol in London.</p>

 By definition, that can be the case only if fuel prices are exactly the same everywhere in the country&#151;that is the logical response to the hon. Gentleman&#146;s point. Nobody is arguing that there is a direct 100 per cent. connection between the rate of fuel duty and the price. I do not know whether he is suggesting any opposite or different approach, but in the UK we leave petrol producers to decide on the price. The Government levy a duty, but there is not always an easy connection between the level of duty and the price at the pump. When there is more competition the price at the pump can be driven lower than it is when there is no competition, as has been said by several opposition Members. That much is true, but this is about whether they are arguing that we should maintain one set level of petrol price&#151;it is almost like the universal service obligation for the post. Setting a commodity price, albeit an important one, at the UK level represents a very different approach from the one to which we have become used over the years.</p>

 The fact is that the people who need petrol the most pay the most and can afford it least, whereas those who need it the least pay the least and can afford it most&#151;that is the basic equation.

would, without our setting an actual price for petrol. We have never done that in the UK and it may well not be legal. The amendment assumes that predictability. Nobody on the opposition Benches has questioned that, but there are big question marks around it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o341"><a name="90513-0018.htm_para11"><a name="09051375000104">It is also not necessarily the case that those who are least able to afford it pay the highest prices in all cases, because great variation in price exists across the country and sometimes from one petrol station to another. The difference in prices on the various websites demonstrates that variation. It is greater in the highlands and islands than anywhere else, but there is a lot of variation and there is no obvious logic to the prices that one pays at the pump, despite the fact that fuel duty is the same across the country. That needs to be acknowledged and it might point to the fact that trying to manipulate the fuel duty is not the answer.</p>

 I accept the point that the Exchequer Secretary made&#151;solving this problem is not without its difficulties&#151;and I, for one, am entirely ready to engage in a process with her. If her officials have read the paper that I sent them last year, they will know that every one of the points that she just made is answered. The premium is pretty constant in the north and the price varies. This proposal deals with a reduction in the premium, but the price continues to vary. The mechanism that I set out, through the supply chain, means that the money is guaranteed to go to the motorist&#151;it cannot do anything but. May I suggest to the officials who briefed her, perhaps this evening, that they need to liaise with the officials who read the notes I submitted?</p>

 The hon. Gentleman&#146;s paper has been much prayed in aid and I pay tribute to the work that he has done to try to solve some of the practical problems. His eightfold classification would produce many tiny little pockets scattered all over Scotland, especially south Scotland, where the duty differential would apply. Not all of those areas experience higher fuel prices than the norm, within a reasonable fluctuation. Not all of them have similar prices either, as there is a wide variation. Some of that variation has to do with the normal workings of the petrol market and the fact that we do not mandate a single price for petrol across the country. Some of it may well have to do with rurality, but that is difficult to distinguish. Drawing boundaries on that basis would create many tiny little areas where fuel duty was lower than in other areas.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o342"><a name="90513-0018.htm_para12"><a name="09051375000107">Another aspect of the plan produced by Opposition Members is to move the duty point from petrol distribution networks and oil companies to individual petrol stations, but that would be very difficult to achieve administratively and is not something that I would wish to do unless I could see major benefits accruing from the change. I do not believe that major benefits would accrue from that change, and that is another practical and administrative difficulty with the solution that hon. Members have produced.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o343"><a name="90513-0018.htm_para13"><a name="09051375000108">I recognise the difficulties, but I remain unconvinced that these proposals are the right way to tackle them. Therefore I ask the Committee to vote against amendment 5.</p>

 The amendment seeks to introduce fair taxation for bingo, in the light of the increase in bingo duty from 15 to 22 per cent. For the gaming or gambling industry, that means that whereas online bingo, casino and poker, online sports betting, sports betting in a betting shop, football pools and betting exchanges are all taxed at 15 per cent., licensed bingo clubs, almost uniquely, are taxed at 22 per cent. I say &#147;almost uniquely&#148; because casino gaming duty is levied on a sliding scale between 15 and 50 per cent., but I will return to that subject later.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o358"><a name="90513-0020.htm_para3"><a name="09051375001356">As many hon. Members will know&#151;although there are almost no Members here on the Labour Benches, apart from the long-suffering Minister and a Whip&#151;there has been an ongoing campaign for fair taxation on bingo, in order to remove the double taxation of VAT and bingo duty. What at first glance appeared to be a success, with the removal of VAT, now seems to have been merely a sleight of hand by the Government. With one hand they have given, by removing VAT, but as the industry claims&#151;and I believe that the numbers stand up&#151;they have taken away a great deal more by raising bingo duty to 22 per cent.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o359"><a name="90513-0020.htm_para4"><a name="09051375001357">As I understand it, the Government claim that the changes will benefit the industry to the tune of some &#163;15 million a year. My argument is that that calculation is rather flawed. That flaw is rooted in the Treasury&#146;s shortcoming in being unable to identify the VAT charged on games of bingo. As I understand it, the net effect of the changes is that Mecca Bingo alone, which represents about one third of the sector by value, will pay an extra &#163;6 million a year to the Exchequer, with about &#163;18 million paid across the whole industry. That is in the context of a sector that last year made an operating profit of &#163;41.8 million.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o360"><a name="90513-0020.htm_para5"><a name="09051375001358">It would be instructive to take a look at the background to the changes proposed in the Budget and the Finance Bill. In May 2008 the VAT and duties tribunal ruled that the application of VAT to interval bingo in Mecca bingo clubs was in breach of the EU principle of fiscal neutrality, which states that similar services should be taxed equally. As a consequence, Mecca Bingo and other bingo operators ceased to pay VAT on interval bingo. The benefit of the VAT abolition therefore applies only to main-stage bingo, which represents only about one third of all bingo by value. The increase in bingo duty affects all bingo, whereas the reduction in VAT benefited only one third of the revenue.</p>

 I shall talk about the social costs and benefits of what was the iniquity of double taxation, and what remains the unfairness of this particular tax. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman will be able to speak to his constituents in his own way to describe how unfair these proposals are.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman referred earlier to the Government&#146;s claim that there would be a &#163;15 million benefit to the industry. Anyone who has studied page 153 of the Red Book will see that the abolition of VAT on participation fees would save the industry &#163;50 million. He has rightly pointed out that VAT is no longer charged on interval bingo. Will he ask the Minister to intervene to tell us whether the &#163;50 million included that change in respect of interval bingo? That is the key issue.</p>

<p><a name="st_o398"><a name="09051375001362"><a name="90513-0020.htm_spnew5"><a name="09051375004015"><b>Stewart Hosie:</b>
 That is a very important question. The fundamental point is that there has been an inability to count the VAT; it has been assessed, or calculated. The industry advises us that the Treasury has overestimated the historic levels of VAT, but if the Minister would like to clarify that point, I would be delighted to give way to her.</p>

 I can clarify the costings in the Red Book: they work from the law as it stands prior to the changes in the Budget. The law refers to the status quo of having VAT on participation fees, notwithstanding the results of the tribunal, which are still due as the considerations are ongoing. I hope that that makes it clear that the costings relate to the status quo prior to the Budget.</p>

Licensed bingo clubs should therefore be taxed at 15 per cent., which is comparable to the rate applied to the other forms of gaming that I described earlier.

I am sure the Minister will correct me if I am wrong, but the previous argument was that if someone who worked in a bingo club lost their job, they were likely to be absorbed into the work force elsewhere. However, at that time there were perhaps 600,000 or 700,000 vacancies on the books. Now that unemployment stands at more than 2 million and the number of vacancies on the books is shrinking, I am not convinced that that argument still holds water.</p>

 Timing is not the only issue. The tax is pernicious because it is a tax on elderly and frail people. The only time that my elderly mother got out of her house to meet other people during the week was when she went down to the bingo hall in Halifax, where she enjoyed a social life. That kept her in her own community, safe, off social service benefits and out of the NHS. The tax will cost the Government money in the round; it will not save them any money.</p>

 I hear what the hon. Gentleman says. I am trying to make the fiscal case, and I hope he has not overstated his position, but I have made the point that bingo clubs are vital in many communities, particularly to women. In certain communities they provide an afternoon as well as a night-time economy. They are extraordinarily important.</p>

We have seen 31 bingo halls close recently. I think that one closed very recently in Montrose, in the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for Angus (Mr. Weir). That was a loss, and it involved a loss of jobs. We have seen 4,000 jobs go from the sector in the last six years, and in many cases it was argued that that was a result of the double taxation. Goodness knows what would happen now, with this unfair taxation. We do not want any more jobs to go&#151;certainly on that scale&#151;in the middle of a recession. There are many, many arguments for ensuring that the tax regime is fair, and that bingo clubs stay open to provide social life, community cohesion and employment.</p>

I understand that even if bingo were taxed on that basis, all clubs would pay tax at 15 per cent. I am sure that if there were a super-club making huge amounts of money the levies would be high, but it strikes me that, given that all online betting and betting shop gaming is taxed at 15 per cent., given that even if bingo were taxed on the same basis as casino duty it would be taxed at 15 per  <br>

He will probably recall that last year there were meetings between Members and the Prime Minister, the Chancellor and my hon.

Therefore, it is not fair to criticise the Government on the grounds that there was no Treasury involvement; there were detailed meetings with Treasury Ministers at the time of that delegation.

Many of the people who use bingo clubs are women; they are often younger women who want to go into a safe place where they can gamble a bit and have a drink in a protected environment.

give a helping hand to bingo clubs at this time. The impression is that what the Government have given away with one hand they have recovered with the other, because the bingo clubs say categorically that they are paying more tax now than before the Budget and that they are going to pay much more tax; I have a brief to hand from the Gala Coral Group.</p>

It seems strange that after all the pressure applied in campaigning against double taxation, we have been hit with this increase in the gross profits tax, and the bingo clubs are worse off.

I was told a few weeks ago&#151;I will not mention any names&#151;that the daily turnover of one of these online gaming organisations is &#163;50 million.

 First, may I serve notice that we hope to have the opportunity to put our amendment 15 to the vote? We will also vote for the Scottish National party&#146;s amendment, although our reasoning is different; we seek a postponement of any changes to the duty regimes, as I shall outline.</p>

I ought to make it clear at the outset that if our amendment is carried, we will also seek to delay the removal of VAT. We have no wish to widen the gaping hole in the public finances.

As we know, the industry as a whole has long argued that the so-called &#147;double taxation&#148; of duty and VAT was unfair. The tribunal found that it was also, at least in part, unlawful. As we know, Rank has not paid a penny in VAT on these games since, and Her Majesty&#146;s Revenue and Customs had to return more than &#163;59 million in previous payments last November.

altered their payment of VAT. As a result&#151;this has been mentioned&#151;nobody believes the estimates of VAT receipts from bingo that appear in the Red Book. Because operators have not been paying VAT on substantial parts of their business, they each believe that they will pay more if bingo duty increases. One operator, Top Ten, is not paying any VAT at all at the moment, Gala says that it will pay more tax as a result of the changes, and Rank had to issue a profits warning the day after the Budget as a direct result of the changes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o382"><a name="90513-0021.htm_para12"><a name="09051375001401">The basis for the Government&#146;s figures appears even more curious when one examines recent parliamentary answers. Perhaps there is some credible explanation for why the Exchequer Secretary estimates that &#163;65 million was raised from VAT on bingo participation fees in 2008-09 but only &#163;50 million would be lost by its removal in 2009-10. When VAT receipts are projected for 2010-11, with VAT back at 17.5 per cent. throughout, they are estimated at only &#163;55 million. These estimates are all over the place; they have gone from &#163;65 million down to &#163;50 million and back up to &#163;55 million. Bingo clubs have been closing, so unless the Exchequer Secretary anticipates a new wave of bingo clubs opening, how does she explain the fact that the 2011-12 figure goes up to &#163;60 million? To make one&#146;s puzzlement complete, the estimated boost to revenue from raising duty is given as a static &#163;35 million in each of those years, so we have severe doubts about the figures being used by the Government.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o383"><a name="90513-0021.htm_para13"><a name="09051375001402">While I hope for answers on those points, the Government should at least say whether those are estimates of what the industry is actually paying or what the Government think it should pay. Those are two very different things, but the Exchequer Secretary appears to have said the latter.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o384"><a name="90513-0021.htm_para14"><a name="09051375001403">The Government&#146;s measures could take on a very different complexion, depending on the outcome of the High Court appeal. As I have said, we want the court to determine the merits of the case that it has only just heard. Surely the Government can see that their proposals can be properly evaluated only after the Court&#146;s decision? I fear that the Government know that all too well. The changes in the Bill have all the hallmarks of a pre-emptive strike by the Treasury. If the Government were in any doubt about the outcome of the appeal, in revenue terms it is now heads the Government win, tails bingo loses. Given our overall position of awaiting the ruling of the High Court, we will support both amendments 14 and 9 if they are pressed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o385"><a name="90513-0021.htm_para15"><a name="09051375001404">The effect of amendment 15 would be to allow Ministers the opportunity to think again in the light of the High Court&#146;s verdict and take whatever action seems reasonable in that context at the time. Ironically, the Red Book figures suggest that the Exchequer would be better off while it waited. The industry wants to wait and, until we have the Court&#146;s ruling, the fairness of the Government&#146;s proposals must stand in question.</p>

hon. Member for Hammersmith and Fulham (Mr. Hands), and we would support it too. Amendment 9 is much broader and it may not be necessary to press it, but it is helpful to have the opportunity to contribute to a debate that justifiably arouses strong feelings in my constituents and those of every other right hon. and hon. Member.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o386"><a name="90513-0021.htm_para16"><a name="09051375001406">It is worth briefly touching on the history of our deliberations. Bingo used to be subject to double taxation, which cost the industry some &#163;85 million a year, because VAT was payable at 17.5 per cent. and gross profits tax at 15 per cent. Last year, I tabled a new clause to the Finance Bill to remove that double taxation and another to require the Government to report on the negative impact that double taxation was having on bingo. I am pleased that that point has been taken to heart by the Government and that the anomaly of bingo being subject to double taxation when other forms of gambling were not has been resolved. However, as the hon. Member for Barnsley, Central (Mr. Illsley) said, the problem is that while the Government have made a concession to the bingo industry with one hand, they have taken it back with the other.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o387"><a name="90513-0021.htm_para17"><a name="09051375001407">The Treasury estimates that the cost will be &#163;50 million in 2009-10 and &#163;55 million in 2011-12, but we know that those figures are heavily disputed. Clause 20 would increase the rate of bingo duty from 15 per cent. to 22 per cent. and the hon. Member for Dundee, East (Stewart Hosie) drew effective comparisons between bingo in a club being taxed at 22 per cent. and bingo online or in a casino being taxed at 15 per cent. Sports betting online and in a betting shop is taxed at 15 per cent., as are the football pools. There is a clear anomaly. When the bingo companies won their campaign and double taxation ended, they thought that they would be treated on the same footing as other forms of betting and did not expect that concession to be offset with an increase in the gambling tax that they were required to pay.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o388"><a name="90513-0021.htm_para18"><a name="09051375001408">Mecca, which is the organisation that I suspect most people will be familiar with, generates about &#163;150 million of profit a year. It will pay &#163;10 million more because of this increase than would have been the case. Let me briefly explain the impact that that will have on individual communities. I am told that each Mecca club pays an average of &#163;900,000 a year in taxes, national insurance contributions and local rates and that 70 per cent. of Mecca revenues come from interval bingo, which was never subject to VAT in the first place. The punishment, in effect, is all the more profound in those circumstances.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o389"><a name="90513-0021.htm_para19"><a name="09051375001409">I am also told that 31 bingo clubs closed last year&#151;I think that that number was mentioned by the hon. Member for Dundee, East&#151;so the effect is real, with an impact on the type of people who particularly enjoy bingo. People of all backgrounds enjoy bingo, but that enjoyment is particularly concentrated among some groups of people. For example, the point was made that women in particular participate in bingo much more than they participate in other forms of gambling. There are people within the communities that we represent in the House who are particularly adversely affected by the treatment of bingo.</p>

amount of time we have spent on this Bill&#151;I have received 109 letters from constituents who enjoy visiting Mecca bingo in Taunton up to three times a week and want to know why the Government are penalising club bingo. As the hon. Member for Northampton, South (Mr. Binley) pointed out, there are many social aspects that go with bingo. It is not just about the gambling itself, which takes a fairly modest and harmless form, but it is about the food and the social interaction, too.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o391"><a name="90513-0021.htm_para21"><a name="09051375001411">Constituents who have written to me on this subject include Edith Garland, Philip Horton, Kim Lee, Mike Hill, Margaret Grundy, Clare Povey, Sandra Loveridge and others. It is also notable how many married couples and families attend bingo together. That has been my experience when I have had the good fortune to visit Mecca bingo in Taunton. I have noticed how many people enjoy going with family members or with their spouses or friends. It is a regular social activity and one that they would be very upset to lose. Of course, bingo is also played in more informal settings across my constituency and across the country.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o392"><a name="90513-0021.htm_para22"><a name="09051375001412">I am pleased that the double taxation anomaly has been resolved, but I am upset on behalf of my constituents and the hundreds and thousands, if not millions, of people who enjoy bingo across the country that that has been offset by the increase in taxation that means that bingo is still penalised compared with other forms of gambling. My colleagues and I will support all three of the amendments if and when they are pressed to a Division to try to get the Government to think again on this very important matter.</p>

 May I endorse the clear and strong arguments that have been articulated by Members from all parties on this issue? It is clear that the issue touches the many communities that we represent, and that is reflected in the fact that every party represented in the Chamber this evening has had a representative who has clearly articulated the view that the Government&#146;s current position is untenable and unfair and needs to be reconsidered.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o393"><a name="90513-0021.htm_para23"><a name="09051375001414">I should like to declare an interest of sorts, Mrs. Heal, in that I am a member of my local Mecca bingo club in Crewe. I confess that I am a fairly new convert to the game, but my wife and I have had an exceptionally enjoyable evening there, along with many others on that occasion. The hon. Member for Barnsley, Central (Mr. Illsley) said that his local bingo club had 26,000 members. I can tell the Committee that the one in Crewe has 20,000&#151;which amounts to almost one in four of the local residents&#151;and that it contributes hugely to the social life of a great many people.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o394"><a name="90513-0021.htm_para24"><a name="09051375001415">Before I deal with the social impact of the Government&#146;s proposals in a little more detail, I want to say something about their economic impact. We have heard that the proposals in the Red Book will lead to the Rank and Mecca organisations paying an extra &#163;9 million in tax per year. My hon. Friend the Member for Hammersmith and Fulham (Mr. Hands) said that the Red Book makes it clear that the Treasury&#146;s estimate of the effects of the change will depend on the outcome of the High Court appeal. I therefore believe that the Government should let the legal process take its course before they consider its effect on their proposal. Only when they can see the full facts in the cold light of day will they be able to see what the industry&#146;s future is likely to be.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o395"><a name="90513-0022.htm_para0"><a name="09051375001416">Although the loss of VAT on interval games has been of some benefit to bingo halls, one industry representative said that the fact that they have had to deal almost at the same time with the rise of almost 50 per cent. in bingo duty has meant that it has been something of a pyrrhic victory. Bingo halls have had a very short stay of execution in their attempt to sort out their finances and ensure a long-term future.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o396"><a name="90513-0022.htm_para1"><a name="09051375001417">As we have heard, the rise in duty affects all bingo, whether it takes place in the interval or on the main stage. Both forms of the game, and especially interval bingo, will play a pivotal part in the bingo industry&#146;s future. Very many of our constituents enjoy bingo on an extremely regular basis, and for them it is often their primary leisure activity. It satisfies their need for social interaction and belonging, as one can clearly see when one goes to a bingo hall to enjoy a game.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o397"><a name="90513-0022.htm_para2"><a name="09051375001418">Bingo crosses all sorts of boundaries, and it is played by young and old alike. I think that I am right in saying that an increasing number of younger people enjoy bingo on a regular basis. We need to ensure that they, and those members of the older generation with a long history of enjoying bingo, are able to enjoy the game for many years to come. The Henley Centre published a research paper entitled &#147;Unlucky for Some: The Social Impact of Bingo Club Closures&#148;. It said that the closures are both a manifestation of, and a catalyst for, the wider breakdown of local communities, with a negative impact on society.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o398"><a name="90513-0022.htm_para3"><a name="09051375001419">Bingo halls are essentially clubs for people. They love going to them and spending time with their friends. We should not deny them that opportunity in an attempt to claw back what is a minuscule amount compared to the overall deficit in the Government&#146;s finances. It is time that the Government thought again, because the bingo industry feels exasperated and betrayed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o399"><a name="90513-0022.htm_para4"><a name="09051375001420">I urge the Government to wait for legal certainty. They can then think again and ensure that the bingo industry has the future that it deserves.</p>

 Other hon. Members have pointed out the vital importance to many local communities of the soft form of gambling entertainment that is available in our bingo clubs. I particularly congratulate the hon. Member for Crewe and Nantwich (Mr. Timpson) in that regard. It has been noted as well that the clubs also provide an opportunity for people to come together and enjoy cheap food and so on.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o400"><a name="90513-0022.htm_para5"><a name="09051375001422">It is therefore especially disappointing to hear that more than 30 bingo clubs have closed in the past year, and that more than twice as many have closed since the start of 2007. The result is that many communities have been deprived of a much-loved form of entertainment. The hon. Member for Barnsley, Central (Mr. Illsley) highlighted their importance by referring to the 26,000 members of one club in his area.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o401"><a name="90513-0022.htm_para6"><a name="09051375001423">Many of us, knowing that the closures are happening, have campaigned to deal with some of the issues that we believe have caused some of the closures. The hon. Gentleman rightly said that levels of taxation were not the only problem; other factors, such as the smoking ban, have had an effect. It is worth remembering that the Bingo Association supported the smoking ban, even though it recognised that it would cause a problem for its members. I admire the association for making that decision.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o402"><a name="90513-0022.htm_para7"><a name="09051375001424">Many of us knew that the real cause of concern was double taxation. Before this year&#146;s Budget was announced, the Treasury acknowledged that bingo, one of the softest forms of gambling, was also one of the most highly taxed. I pay tribute to the Government for deciding to end double taxation. As my hon. Friend the Member for Taunton (Mr. Browne) says, the Government took the right decision and they deserve credit for ending VAT on participation fees.</p>

<p><a name="st_o419"><a name="09051375001425"><a name="90513-0022.htm_spnew1"><a name="09051375004036"><b>Angela Eagle:</b>

 The Minister makes a fair point, and I shall come to it shortly, but before she starts criticising me, I wish to praise her further. The Government also deserve praise for assisting the bingo industry by agreeing to an increase in the number of gaming machines allowed on premises, which will be an important source of additional revenue for clubs. I welcome that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o403"><a name="90513-0022.htm_para8"><a name="09051375001427">Given that those good moves have been made, many of us are extremely surprised that the Government are persisting in, as others have put it, giving with one hand and taking with the other, and pressing forward with a policy that leads to one of the softest forms of gambling being one of the most highly taxed. That strikes many of us as unfair and is likely to lead to problems, particularly if the Government&#146;s figures in the Red Book prove to be incorrect&#151;if the High Court judgment goes against them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o404"><a name="90513-0022.htm_para9"><a name="09051375001428">The Minister asks why we might support the Conservative amendment. In one sense, she is right: the amendment, which was well explained by the hon. Member for Hammersmith and Fulham (Mr. Hands), is a delaying tactic, tabled in the hope that the High Court will rule in favour of the bingo industry and not of the Government. Although I think that the hon. Gentleman is right to take a punt on that, our preferred option is to support the SNP amendment, which was eloquently explained by the hon. Member for Dundee, East (Stewart Hosie)&#151;I like to give him credit occasionally. That amendment makes it clear that the bingo industry would be subject to a fair level of taxation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o405"><a name="90513-0022.htm_para10"><a name="09051375001429">The Minister could, rightly, say that it is easy to propose a reduction in Government income, just to garner cheap popularity with bingo clubs. It is therefore incumbent on anyone making such a proposal to make direct suggestions on how the Government could recoup the loss, and I have two or three suggestions to make, which I hope the hon. Lady will consider seriously. I alluded to the basic principle of one of them when I intervened on the hon. Member for Barnsley, Central. I genuinely believe that we ought to shift to a system where the harder forms of gambling are more highly taxed than the softer forms.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o406"><a name="90513-0022.htm_para11"><a name="09051375001430">It is bizarre that the duty imposed on a gaming machine on which the maximum bet is &#163;1 is exactly the same as the duty imposed on a gaming machine that has a &#163;100 maximum bet. I genuinely believe that the Government should consider setting differential duties, especially in the light of the Gambling Commission&#146;s prevalence studies showing that those higher-stake machines have a higher level of prevalence&#151;in other words, they are more addictive&#151;than lower-stake machines.</p>

 I am delighted to note that the Minister is proposing that, although we have not yet got there and I am suggesting one way of dealing with the problem. I shall come back to gross profits tax at the end of my remarks, but for now let me stick with higher levels of gambling.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o407"><a name="90513-0022.htm_para12"><a name="09051375001433">If we look into the higher end of gambling addiction problems, many of us know that online gambling is a particular cause for concern. The Minister will be well aware that there are about 6,500 internet gambling sites worldwide, which generate about &#163;12.5 billion that is placed by the punters. Sadly, only about 1,000 of those internet gambling sites are regulated anywhere in the world, but it is at least pleasing to know that about 80 per cent. of all the money spent on internet gambling sites is on those regulated ones. Such gambling is extremely addictive, so it is particularly bizarre that we allow a number of internet gambling sites that are regulated outside the UK&#151;whether they be in jurisdictions that we deem to be white-listed or in other European economic area countries&#151;to advertise in this country. We are meant to spend money to check that their regulatory regime is fine. To date, we have made no charge on them whatever; and neither do we insist that they contribute to research, education and treatment in respect of problem gambling. I am delighted that, at long last, the Minister has given me an assurance that the Government are going to look further at this issue; it does provide another potential source of income.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o408"><a name="90513-0022.htm_para13"><a name="09051375001434">The Minister also made reference to gross profits tax. Let me tell her that there is a simple way of ensuring that the Treasury recoup any loss that I may be proposing by supporting the amendments this evening&#151;it is by using gross profits tax as the standard way of taxing gambling, and applying it to the national lottery. If such a tax were introduced in the national lottery, as many of us have advocated for many years, it would accrue significant additional income to the Treasury, but, more importantly, it would provide the additional benefit of giving significant extra funds to the lottery good causes, which have recently lost money to pay for the black hole in the Olympic budget.</p>

strongly against the super-casinos, which loomed large for a long time, but have now been dispensed with, I am glad to say. Bingo is a very modest form of gambling: it is easily contained; it is not addictive; people do not lose large sums of money. Furthermore, there are even health benefits, as many people who play bingo are middle-aged and might otherwise sit at home; going out and mixing with people is beneficial to health, particularly psychologically, but probably physically as well. It is the same argument that we hear about free travel on buses, as getting people out and about is beneficial to health. The issue is not just about being fair to people, as improving the health of the nation is also relevant. I say that especially since smoking in public places has been banned, which has really made a difference.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o411"><a name="90513-0022.htm_para16"><a name="09051375001438">I am afraid that the provisions have the hallmark of Treasury officials all over them. I am not blaming the Exchequer Secretary, but Treasury officials, having been forced to get rid of double taxation, are getting in their little revenge by raising levels of tax in order to get their own back. But we are talking about tiny sums of money&#151;&#163;30 million or &#163;40 million&#151;compared with the &#163;12 billion cost of reducing VAT, the &#163;4 billion we lose as a result of tobacco smuggling, and the &#163;37 billion we lose as a result of tax avoidance. If the Treasury wants to raise more money, as we undoubtedly need to do to pay the vast bills that have arisen from the banking crisis, it should look at those much larger sources of income, rather than adding relatively small amounts in taxation on bingo, which will have a disproportionate effect on those on modest and low incomes. I urge my hon. Friends on the Front Bench to consider more productive areas that will raise large amounts of revenue.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o412"><a name="90513-0022.htm_para17"><a name="09051375001439">I am slightly worried about the presence in bingo clubs of fruit machines, which are addictive. However, bingo itself has every kind of benefit, including social, and it is not addictive as far as one can see. Habitual playing of bingo is a bit of fun every week, and is not serious gambling in the same sense as other activities. If we can encourage more people to play bingo, and fewer people to stay at home gambling online, a lot of people would be saved from addictive gambling, losing money and pain. There is everything to be said for encouraging bingo through lower taxation, and discouraging other forms of gambling through higher taxation and more regulation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o413"><a name="90513-0022.htm_para18"><a name="09051375001440">The overall tax gap between the tax that should be paid and that which is actually paid could be as large as &#163;100 billion. If we addressed that, we could raise a lot more revenue. If we could make a 10 per cent. inroad into that, we would have &#163;10 billion a year extra&#151;hundreds of times more than the small amount that would be raised from taxing bingo disproportionately and unfairly. I hope that my few points register with my hon. Friend the Exchequer Secretary.</p>

<p><a name="st_o428"><a name="09051375001446"><a name="90513-0022.htm_spnew10"><a name="09051375004045"><b>Angela Eagle:</b>
 No. Prior to the Budget, the effective tax rate was calculated&#151;and widely acknowledged&#151;to be between 24 and 25 per cent. The Bingo Association acknowledged that. Our assessment was that it was between 24 and 25 per cent., and it might be sensible to remind hon. Members at this juncture that the effective tax rate had come down from 35 per cent. in 2003, so there has been a steady decline in the effective rate of taxation on bingo. It went down from 35 per cent. in 2003 to between 24 and 25 per cent. prior to the Budget, and when the Budget is put into effect, the rate will go down to 22 per cent. Those are facts, acknowledged widely in the industry and featured in the Bingo Association&#146;s Budget representations.</p>

<p><a name="st_o429"><a name="09051375001447"><a name="90513-0022.htm_spnew11"><a name="09051375004046"><b>Mr. Hands:</b>
 Again, I thank the Minister for giving way; she is being most generous. Why, then, is every single bingo operator, as far as I am aware, saying that as a result of the changes, they will be paying more tax? Why have various City analysts issued profit warnings for the sector, due to the negative impact of the overall package of changes? She still seems to be saying that the changes are welcome overall, when the industry is saying precisely the opposite.</p>

<p><a name="st_o430"><a name="09051375001448"><a name="90513-0022.htm_spnew12"><a name="09051375004047"><b>Angela Eagle:</b>
 The industry can have any opinion that it likes about the taxation system that applies to it. I am not responsible for the opinions of the bingo industry; it can welcome the measures or not. What I am talking about is the effective tax rate. Prior to the changes that we are suggesting in the Finance Bill, the effective tax rate for bingo consisted of VAT participation fees at 17.5 per cent. and the bingo duty of 15 per cent. Removing VAT fees and increasing bingo duty to 22 per cent. means that the effective tax rate is 22 per cent., not the 24 to 25 per cent. figure that was acknowledged by all sides prior to the Budget, and that featured in the Bingo Association&#146;s Budget submission. In fact, the hon. Member for Dundee, East, quoted a 28 per cent. figure last year, but those of us who were involved with the Finance Bill last year will remember that there was widespread acknowledgement that the effective tax rate for bingo, taking the factors that I mentioned into account, was between 24 and 25 per cent.</p>

<p><a name="st_o431"><a name="09051375001449"><a name="90513-0022.htm_spnew13"><a name="09051375004048"><b>Mr. Don Foster:</b>
 The Minister is making heavy weather of the point. Most of us entirely agree with her analysis, on the assumption that the Government win the High Court case. The effective overall level of taxation that the industry would now suggest is different, because of course it has stopped paying VAT on interval betting. Surely that is the difference. Could we perhaps move on?</p>

<p><a name="st_o432"><a name="09051375001450"><a name="90513-0022.htm_spnew14"><a name="09051375004049"><b>Angela Eagle:</b>
 I was responding to the questions that I was asked by the hon. Member for Hammersmith and Fulham (Mr. Hands); I was attempting to be helpful. The hon. Member for Bath (Mr. Foster) is right that when there is a VAT tribunal in progress, and there is an interim judgment, it applies only to the case in question, not broadly across the piece. Any other companies that have somehow decided that they ought not to be liable for VAT on participation fees because of the prospect of a judgment that has not yet been made are not exactly being up front about the circumstances. Her Majesty&#146;s Revenue and Customs makes it quite clear in all VAT tribunal judgments that the judgments apply only to the case before the tribunal, and that if there is any read- across, the issue of the VAT liability of other companies is still expected to be set aside until the tribunal is fully over&#151;and it could carry on for some time yet.</p>

<p><a name="st_o433"><a name="09051375001451"><a name="90513-0022.htm_spnew15"><a name="09051375004050"><b>Mr. Hands:</b>
 I thank the Minister again for giving way. In the Westminster Hall debate in February&#151;that was the last time everybody had the opportunity to debate the issues&#151;she said:</p>
<a name="90513-0022.htm_brev0"><a name="09051375002724"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;The fact that the dispute is ongoing means that it is inappropriate for me to discuss in detail issues relating to fiscal neutrality.&#148;&#151;[<i> Official Report, </i>27 February 2009; Vol. 488, c. 132WH.]</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o415"><a name="90513-0022.htm_para20"><a name="09051375001452">Surely there has been a complete volte-face since she gave that opinion in February.</p>

 I do not understand why the hon. Gentleman thinks that. Budgets are an opportunity to examine tax rates and arrangements in all areas, and announcements on these issues are always made at Budgets. They are certainly not made in the middle of Westminster Hall debates, when the work leading up to the Budget is still ongoing.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o416"><a name="90513-0022.htm_para21"><a name="09051375001454">Our principal aim in the Budget with respect to gambling taxation has been to simplify the tax regime and bring increased clarity to the sector. Clause 20 is part of that package of reforms to gambling taxation. It has two elements. First, it increases the rate of bingo duty to 22 per cent., as has been pointed out. Secondly, it increases the money prize limit to &#163;70, as the hon. Member for Bath was generous enough to point out, for duty-exempt small-scale bingo conducted on certain premises. The increase in the rate is part of a package of measures that includes making bingo participation fees exempt from VAT, which will be debated upstairs on clause 112. The principal aim has been to simplify bingo taxation, as the industry had requested.</p>


<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090513/debtext/90513-0023.htm"/>



<p><a name="stpa_o417"><a name="90513-0023.htm_para0"><a name="09051375001455">The three amendments to clause 20 have different objectives, but they all relate primarily to the aspect of the clause that amends the bingo duty rate. Amendment 9 seeks to commit the Government to publish a report on the impact of changes made at the Budget. We always keep taxes under review and we take decisions at the Budget. Gambling taxes are no different, and we will continue to engage with the industry about the state of the industry and the impact of taxation and potential   <br>

taxation measures. There is therefore no need for the Government to publish a report on the impact of increases in bingo duty later this year.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o418"><a name="90513-0023.htm_para1"><a name="09051375001456">Amendment 14 seeks to retain bingo duty at 15 per cent. Amendment 15 seeks to delay the increase in bingo duty until after court proceedings have concluded and Parliament has again debated the taxation of the bingo industry. The hon. Member for Hammersmith and Fulham has been up front with the Committee today and said that the official Opposition will vote against clause 112 when we come to that debate, to remove participation fees from bingo as part of that package. I look forward to having that debate with him when the time comes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o419"><a name="90513-0023.htm_para2"><a name="09051375001457">Both those amendments would cost money&#151;&#163;35 million, on the basis of figures in the Red Book. The effective tax rate on bingo is now 22 per cent., as I said earlier, comparable to the average rates of tax on casinos, gaming machines and the lottery. It is not clear why the Government should await the conclusion of a court case before deciding on an appropriate rate of tax for the bingo industry. I therefore ask hon. Members to withdraw their amendments.</p>

<p><a name="st_o435"><a name="09051375001458"><a name="90513-0023.htm_spnew0"><a name="09051375004052"><b>Stewart Hosie:</b>
 We are pleased with the debate. The hon. Member for Barnsley, Central (Mr. Illsley) is a champion for the sector and I am delighted that he brought his experience to the debate. The hon. Member for Hammersmith and Fulham (Mr. Hands) focused on the VAT case and explained his party&#146;s anger at the Government&#146;s attitude towards it. The hon. Member for Taunton (Mr. Browne) spoke to his amendment 9, but I am delighted that he could bring his party to support my amendment 14 as well.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o420"><a name="90513-0023.htm_para3"><a name="09051375001459">The hon. Member for Crewe and Nantwich (Mr. Timpson) described the current position as untenable and unfair, and described the 20,000 members of his local bingo club, which is almost a third of the entire population of the town of Crewe. That is quite phenomenal. He called on the Government to wait for legal certainty. The hon. Member for Bath (Mr. Foster) focused on the social benefits. The hon. Member for Luton, North (Kelvin Hopkins) spoke about the health benefits of socialising and also said that the clause had the hallmark of the Treasury officials all over it. I shall not comment. Perhaps he knows these things better than I do.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o421"><a name="90513-0023.htm_para4"><a name="09051375001460">The Minister began by describing this as a boutique debate. The reality is rather less elegant than that sounds, but it was still a good debate. She then spoiled the mood by trying to justify the Government&#146;s position, which is still 22 per cent. against 15 per cent.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o422"><a name="90513-0023.htm_para5"><a name="09051375001461">Members in every party, and every speaker apart from the Minister, want to see the unfairness removed from bingo. It is simple. The tax on online bingo is 15 per cent., on online poker and casino 15 per cent., on sports betting in a betting shop 15 per cent., on betting exchanges 15 per cent. and on football pools 15 per cent. The Government want good licensed bingo clubs to pay tax at 22 per cent. I think 15 per cent. will do, and I ask the Committee to support the amendment.</p>

<p><a name="st_o436"><a name="09051375002201"><a name="90513-0024.htm_spnew0"><a name="09051375004773"><b>Mr. Crispin Blunt (Reigate) (Con):</b>
 I am grateful for the opportunity to highlight concerns about the human papilloma virus vaccine Cervarix, which, contrary to Government assurances even yesterday, appears to be causing adverse reactions in a number of teenage girls, and to raise concerns about the cost-benefit analysis process that has led to that vaccination programme, the manner in which it is being delivered and the yellow card warning system.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o432"><a name="90513-0024.htm_para0"><a name="09051375002202">I only became concerned about the possible side effects of the Cervarix vaccine&#151;and, I confess, aware of the vaccine itself&#151;when the experience of one of my constituents, Rebecca Ramagge, was brought to my attention. Rebecca's mother came to see me at my surgery 12 days ago and told me how her daughter had fallen ill shortly after her first injection with Cervarix. Over the full course of the injections, she has gone from being a healthy sports-loving teenager who was a high achiever at school and a tournament-level tennis player, to being crippled by chronic fatigue syndrome, unable to attend school regularly and in need of help with basic tasks such as walking and eating because of the exhaustion and the muscular and joint pain from which she is now suffering.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o433"><a name="90513-0024.htm_para1"><a name="09051375002203">Despite experiencing serious joint pain and illness shortly after the initial injection in September 2008, Rebecca went on to receive the two follow-up jabs as the vaccinations were administered at school. Her family doctor was therefore unaware of the listed side effects of the drug and unable to link Rebecca's deteriorating condition to the vaccine. It was only after Rebecca was referred to a consultant paediatrician at East Surrey hospital, Dr. Jawad, that her symptoms were identified as highly consistent with a reaction to the vaccine.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o434"><a name="90513-0024.htm_para2"><a name="09051375002204">The consultant in question was astonished that nurses had administered the third injection to Rebecca when she was complaining of a recognised side effect listed in the product information as a common side effect of the vaccine. That raises the wider question that I will come to shortly, of whether school is an appropriate environment in which to vaccinate children.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o435"><a name="90513-0024.htm_para3"><a name="09051375002205">Rebecca's case is not an isolated one. Similar stories of severe reactions resulting in partial paralysis, seizures and chronic fatigue have been well featured in the national press. The vaccine support group JABS&#151;Justice Awareness and Basic Support&#151;has nine girls registered as suffering from severe adverse reactions to Cervarix. A solicitor who specialises in representing vaccine victims is representing six girls who are suing the makers of the vaccine, GlaxoSmithKline, under the Consumer Protection Act 1987. Yesterday however, the Minister gave me a parliamentary answer that included the following:</p>
<a name="90513-0024.htm_brev0"><a name="09051375002726"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;To date almost one million doses of Cervarix have been given in the UK and there is no evidence to suggest that Cervarix vaccine has caused chronic fatigue syndrome, paralytic disorders or any other serious or long-term side effects.&#148;&#151;[<i> Official Report</i>, 12 May 2009; Vol. 492, c. 706W.]</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o436"><a name="90513-0024.htm_para4"><a name="09051375002206">For any vaccine, it is always probable that there will be a small number of people who have an adverse reaction. However, there are serious questions to be raised about  <br>


<meta name="Date" content="13 May 2009">

<notus-date day="13" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>13 May 2009 : Column 988</b><br>
this vaccine and its administration, the quality of the information available about its risks, and how it has been promoted by the Government.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o437"><a name="90513-0024.htm_para5"><a name="09051375002207">First, it is notoriously difficult to establish firm medical proof of a causal link between a vaccine and severe medical conditions previously unrecognised as side effects, but when a group of healthy teenagers suddenly begins to exhibit similar debilitating symptoms shortly after receiving the same vaccine, it is surely only sensible provisionally to conclude, even in the absence of concrete proof, that the common factor in all the cases&#151;the vaccine&#151;is the likely cause.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o438"><a name="90513-0024.htm_para6"><a name="09051375002208">I was particularly disturbed to hear from the hon. Member for Bootle (Mr. Benton) about the case of a girl who collapsed in pain hours after having the Cervarix jab in school. She has been in hospital ever since. The hospital has carried out a number of tests, but has so far been unable to establish the cause of her condition. Instead of exhausting the tests available to it by carrying out the hair trace test requested by the girl&#146;s family&#151;who have been told they will have to pay for it privately&#151;it has concluded that the condition is all in the girl&#146;s mind, a result of mental abuse by her mother who, convinced that her daughter has reacted badly to the vaccine, is projecting her conviction on to her daughter. I am told that it is now proposing to take this girl into care, but, in light of Rebecca Ramagge&#146;s experience, I am concerned that medical professionals have resorted to accusing members of this family of suffering from psychiatric disorders while not being prepared to test their thesis exhaustively.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o439"><a name="90513-0024.htm_para7"><a name="09051375002209">There is also the case referred to me by my hon. Friend the Member for Newark (Patrick Mercer) regarding his 18-year-old constituent who since having the HPV vaccination has started to suffer from frequent seizures&#151;40 in the last nine weeks&#151;that have left her unable to drive or to continue with her college course. Again, doctors are having difficulty diagnosing exactly what is wrong with her, and have started to hint that her problem may be mental rather than physical. There is also the case in Honiton&#151;and my hon. Friend the Member for Tiverton and Honiton (Angela Browning) is present to listen to this debate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o440"><a name="90513-0024.htm_para8"><a name="09051375002210">I hope my constituent&#146;s experience will provoke a reassessment of these and other cases. Unless further proof emerges of another common factor between the affected girls that could have caused their condition, surely the only responsible course of action is to admit that the vaccine may have undesirable side effects for some girls, and to ensure that the public are aware of the risk, however small, they are taking when choosing to have the vaccine. In summary, the Government&#146;s current understanding&#151;given to me yesterday by the Minister, I am quite sure in good faith&#151;is flat wrong.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o441"><a name="90513-0024.htm_para9"><a name="09051375002211">Secondly, it is my assessment that the public have not been provided with clear and accurate information about the risks associated with the Cervarix vaccine. GlaxoSmithKline&#146;s product information gives a full list of undesirable effects that the vaccine might cause. Among those listed are serious conditions such as myalgia&#151;listed as being very common&#151;arthralgia and paraesthesia. Legal representatives of Cervarix victims point out that in many of the cases in which they are representing them, paraesthesia is so severe that the effect should be more accurately described as partial paralysis.</p>
<br>


<meta name="Date" content="13 May 2009">

<notus-date day="13" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>13 May 2009 : Column 989</b><br>

<p><a name="stpa_o442"><a name="90513-0024.htm_para10"><a name="09051375002212">The information provided to patients by the NHS, however, is much briefer and far more reassuring in tone. The NHS immunisation website lists the most common side effects as mild to moderate swelling, redness and pain at the site where the injection is given. It also lists symptoms such as slightly raised temperature, sickness, dizziness, diarrhoea and muscle aches as other mild side effects that have been reported. Without repeating the full details, I can tell the House that nowhere within this NHS information is there any indication that symptoms reported as suspected side effects have in some cases been both serious and persistent&#151;for example, the chronic debilitating muscle and joint pain experienced by my constituent&#151;nor does it give a full list of the symptoms. It misses out headache&#151;although that is listed as a very common side effect&#151;upper respiratory tract infection and paraesthesia, which are all included in the literature from GSK.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o443"><a name="90513-0024.htm_para11"><a name="09051375002213">This is not just about patients and their families; general practitioners, too, rely on the NHS&#146;s information, but they are not being directed to GSK&#146;s more comprehensive data and they are therefore not looking for reactions. I know of GPs who, on the back of Rebecca&#146;s experience, have called staff meetings to alert their colleagues, and even in the past week those GPs now believe that they too are recognising symptoms. I am told that NHS Direct has no drop-down box to guide operators to ask, in the event of these symptoms being reported, whether the patient has recently had the Cervarix vaccine.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o444"><a name="90513-0024.htm_para12"><a name="09051375002214">The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency&#146;s latest figures show that they have received 1,602 reports of suspected reactions, including 161 recipients complaining about &#147;pain in extremity&#148; at the injection site. As I will explain, that is likely to be a serious understatement. In the light of this and the severe nature of some of the adverse reactions reported, I ask the Minister to consider as a matter of urgency changing the information that the Government provide GPs, families and NHS Direct, not only so that families and patients may make the informed choice to which they are entitled, but so that the potential symptoms are properly identified and linked. Failure to do that will open the Government to the charge of being simplistic at best and irresponsible at worst.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o445"><a name="90513-0024.htm_para13"><a name="09051375002215">Thirdly, I am concerned about the Government&#146;s blanket promotion of this vaccine as a silver bullet against cervical cancer. Reservations have also been expressed by some medical professionals about the thoroughness of the clinical trials, which they have claimed were too short and did not include enough girls under the age of 16, who have been the first age group to receive this vaccine as part of the Government&#146;s national programme. Gynaecological experts such as Diane Harper, director of the gynaecologic cancer prevention research group at Dartmouth medical school, have urged for the introduction of the vaccine to be delayed, so that any future side effects have time to manifest themselves.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o446"><a name="90513-0024.htm_para14"><a name="09051375002216">The Government have refused to produce any open data on the cost-benefit analysis they undertook in choosing Cervarix. Sexual health charities, such as the Terrence Higgins Trust and the Brook Advisory Service, have expressed dismay that the Government have not followed the example of nearly every other western country in choosing the rival vaccine, Gardasil, which  <br>

protects against a greater variety of pre-cancerous lesions than Cervarix, and genital warts as well. The Government&#146;s only public response has been that they made their decision according to &#147;pre-agreed criteria&#148;, which they apparently will not disclose.</p>

<p><a name="st_o437"><a name="09051375002217"><a name="90513-0024.htm_spmin0"><a name="09051375004774"><b>The Minister of State, Department of Health (Dawn Primarolo):</b>
 That is not true.</p>

<p><a name="st_o438"><a name="09051375002218"><a name="90513-0024.htm_spnew1"><a name="09051375004775"><b>Mr. Blunt:</b>
 The Minister says that that is not true. I do not know whether it is, which is why I used the word &#147;apparently&#148;. She will have the opportunity to reply and make that position clear. I want to make it clear that I am entirely new to this matter and have had two weeks to learn and understand it, but in that period I have grown very concerned, which is why we are having this Adjournment debate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o447"><a name="90513-0024.htm_para15"><a name="09051375002219">It is open to question whether the Government have factored in to their cost-benefit analysis the savings that they might make on the cost of treatment for genital warts. It is also unclear whether there was an adequate analysis of the costs that might be incurred through compensating the victims of adverse reactions; that would apply in respect of Gardasil as well.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o448"><a name="90513-0024.htm_para16"><a name="09051375002220">Another issue that I would like the Minister to address is the actual delivery of the vaccination. A school that had a number of pupils take part in the original trials of Cervarix, St. Monica&#146;s Roman Catholic high school in Manchester, has decided not to opt in to the nationwide vaccination programme, citing concerns about the effectiveness of the drug and the side effects it caused in a number of its pupils who underwent the trial. It also cited its opinion that school was not an appropriate environment in which to vaccinate children.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o449"><a name="90513-0024.htm_para17"><a name="09051375002221">There will always be a handful of adverse reactions, some serious and some involving symptoms previously unrecognised as side effects. It would surely be much safer if vaccines were administered in an appropriate medical environment by a professional who had ready access to the recipient&#146;s medical history and where the potential risks and side effects had been properly evaluated and discussed. That would enable the recipient and their family to have a full understanding of the potential costs and benefits of the vaccine being offered to them. I therefore ask the Government to review their current policy of administering nationwide vaccination programmes in schools. Had such an approach been the norm, it is unlikely that my constituent would ever have been given the third dose of the vaccine, which exacerbated the side effects.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o450"><a name="90513-0024.htm_para18"><a name="09051375002222">HPV is most commonly spread through sexual contact and, while I am aware that a proportion of girls are sexually active from a very young age, many are not, and some parents may feel that it is unnecessary for girls to receive this vaccine so early in their teens when they are still growing quickly and experiencing rapid hormonal change. Educating girls about the dangers of HPV, how it spreads and the measures that they can take to protect themselves against it, such as using contraception, should also play a part in combating HPV. Parents should be able to access this debate to make informed choices.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o451"><a name="90513-0024.htm_para19"><a name="09051375002223">If I had more time, I would wish to raise the more general point of compensation for victims of adverse reactions. There is no doubt that vaccination brings great benefits to society at large, but it also carries an  <br>

inherent risk of serious reactions that will affect a minority. The UK&#146;s compensation scheme has been described as &#147;hopelessly flawed&#148; by legal experts and leaves many with no option but to sue pharmaceutical companies under consumer protection legislation. This is an expensive and exhausting process for claimants and it sparks widespread and sometimes unfounded fears about the safety of vaccination programmes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o452"><a name="90513-0024.htm_para20"><a name="09051375002224">On the basis of what I know now, I suggest that we examine the US vaccine compensation scheme, which awards damages to successful claimants according to the severity of their injuries and the costs they are likely to incur as a result. That does away with both an arbitrary and insufficient award and an artificial extent of injury qualification.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o453"><a name="90513-0024.htm_para21"><a name="09051375002225">I would like to finish by highlighting the inadequacies of our system for reporting adverse reactions to vaccines. The yellow card system operated by the MHRA is not mandatory so there is no obligation on medical staff to report reactions. Furthermore, the scheme has such a low public profile that many who suffer from a reaction after a vaccination are not aware that there is a system for reporting their experience. Indeed, I spoke to a school nurse today at random and she was unaware of the scheme. The yellow card scheme was described to me by a managing director of a pharmaceutical research company yesterday as</p>
<a name="90513-0024.htm_brev1"><a name="09051375002727"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;one of the weakest in Europe&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o454"><a name="90513-0024.htm_para22"><a name="09051375002226">Do the Government have any plans to strengthen the current system and make it fit for purpose?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o455"><a name="90513-0024.htm_para23"><a name="09051375002227">The Government have so far been determined to push on with this blanket vaccination programme while paying little heed to the serious concerns raised about the safety of the vaccine, the quality of information readily available to those considering the treatment and the possibility that promoting alternative preventive measures may be a more suitable and less risky path for some girls. I would be grateful to hear from the Minister that the Government will not continue down this incautious path based on the alarming and inaccurate information given in the parliamentary answer to me yesterday, but will take account of the experiences of my constituent and those of other hon. Members.</p>

When we debate sensitive issues such as this, it is important to deal with the science, not the supposition, and with the evidence, not the hearsay or opinion. We should not be swayed by the lurid way in which HPV and its vaccine are sometimes portrayed in the media. We have played this game before with the MMR scare and many areas are now paying the price in an explosion in measles and mumps cases because not enough families have taken up the vaccine. I want to take this opportunity to address head on the suggestions that the HPV vaccine is not safe.</p>

<notus-date day="13" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>13 May 2009 : Column 992</b><br>

<p><a name="stpa_o457"><a name="90513-0024.htm_para25"><a name="09051375002230">Before licensing, Cervarix was rigorously tested and found to have minimal side effects. Scientists conducted large-scale clinical trials, involving thousands of girls and young women, to assess its safety. Since then, several million doses of vaccine have been given around the world&#151;including the best part of 1 million in the UK, as the hon. Gentleman said&#151;with no new risks emerging.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o458"><a name="90513-0024.htm_para26"><a name="09051375002231">There are, of course, side effects associated with Cervarix, as there are with all vaccines, but it is important to stress that most people do not experience any side effects whatsoever. The most common known effects from Cervarix are injection site reactions, dizziness, headache, muscle pain, nausea and upset stomach. They are normally mild and last for no more than a few days. I accept that those reactions can be unpleasant, but they are nothing compared with the symptoms of advanced cervical cancer and are a price worth paying, in my view, to save 400 lives a year.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o459"><a name="90513-0024.htm_para27"><a name="09051375002232">There is a clear need to keep a watching brief, and we are continually monitoring safety so that we can quickly identify any new side-effects that might emerge. I completely reject the hon. Gentleman&#146;s proposition that somehow our regulatory and monitoring system is weak or substandard&#151;it is one of the best. Every week, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency publishes online analysis of all suspected side effects reported through its yellow card scheme. We know that almost 1,700 suspected side effects have been reported since the immunisation programme was first introduced, but those figures come with a caveat. That is not my personal view as an individual; it is based on the scientific evidence and advice we are given.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o460"><a name="90513-0024.htm_para28"><a name="09051375002233">The figures do not necessarily mean that the vaccine caused the medical condition, only that the reporter suspected it might have. On investigation, we find that 90 per cent. of those reports&#151;to put it into perspective, that is about 1,500 reported cases out of 1 million, or 0.0015 per cent. of total vaccines administered&#151;either relate to the known side effects that I have already mentioned, or they were psychogenic events: that is, symptoms linked to a fear or anticipation of the needle injection. Those psychogenic events cover a number of girls who fainted after the injection, which is a known response to all needle-based vaccinations and is running at a rate that is in line with what experts would expect.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o461"><a name="90513-0024.htm_para29"><a name="09051375002234">In the remaining 10 per cent. of cases&#151;let us remember that we are talking about 0.00017 per cent. of the total vaccines&#151;there is good reason to think that the reported symptoms were associated with an underlying condition or illness that the person was suffering from at the time they had their vaccination. That, in fact, appears to be the most likely interpretation for the cases reported in the media recently, including the cases in the <i> Daily Express</i> and <i> Daily Mail</i> of the young girls who were reported as suffering from partial paralysis, chronic fatigue syndrome and fits since having their vaccination. The MHRA is fully aware of those cases, several of which were reported via the yellow card scheme, and is investigating them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o462"><a name="90513-0024.htm_para30"><a name="09051375002235">As we vaccinated such a large cohort of young people, it was inevitable that a few cases would come forward where other conditions were reported as suspected side-effects even if the vaccine played no part. Indeed, the MHRA&#146;s statistical analysis of paralytic disorders and chronic fatigue syndrome shows that the reported frequency  <br>

of such cases is no more than&#151;or should I say the same as&#151;would have been expected among a similar cohort of unvaccinated teenagers. In addition, the Government&#146;s independent advisory body, the Commission on Human Medicines, looked into the reports not just in the UK, but across the world and concluded that there are no new safety issues associated with the vaccine.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o463"><a name="90513-0024.htm_para31"><a name="09051375002236">I realise that that is no consolation or comfort to the girls to whom the hon. Gentleman has drawn attention. Equally, however, it is no reason to condemn a programme that has seen more than a million teenagers receive injections with little or no reported effect.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o464"><a name="90513-0024.htm_para32"><a name="09051375002237">The Government are committed to transparency and the hon. Member for Reigate can be assured that any emerging information on the possible side effects will be fully evaluated. We will take appropriate action promptly when any true side effects are detected but, alongside that transparency, we need to maintain public trust and confidence. The facts speak for themselves, and they remind us why we introduced the vaccine in the first place.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o465"><a name="90513-0024.htm_para33"><a name="09051375002238">We know that at least half of all sexually active women will be infected by a strain of HPV in their lifetime. We know that the viruses are responsible for causing more than 99 per cent. of cervical cancer cases, and a range of other cancers. There are nearly 3,000 cases of cervical cancer each year, a third of which will prove fatal within five years, and we know that the HPV vaccine is effective in protecting young women against two HPV strains that are responsible for around 70 per cent. of those cancer cases. As a result, the vaccine could eventually prevent up to 400 deaths due to cervical cancer every year.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o466"><a name="90513-0024.htm_para34"><a name="09051375002239">So the facts tell us that the Cervarix vaccine is a major breakthrough in public health, and the first vaccine that can directly prevent cancer. It would be a travesty if women were denied the potential that it offers because of scaremongering and supposition. The weight of evidence says that the vaccine is safe, effective and capable of saving thousands of lives in the years ahead.</p>

<p><a name="st_o440"><a name="09051375002242"><a name="90513-0025.htm_spnew0"><a name="09051375004777"><b>Mr. Blunt:</b>
 I have heard the Minister&#146;s answer. On one level, I understand the requirement for an uncompromising public health message on the need for a vaccination programme, and I am not suggesting that there is a wider case against the vaccine. What I was hoping to hear from the right hon. Lady was that, as symptoms start to emerge and based on the evidence that I have presented this evening, the Government would start to think about whether those who are administering the vaccine are looking for reactions properly, because they have not been alerted to them. Any vaccination programme has a number of reactions associated with it, and the body of evidence emerges as more people are vaccinated. I have to say that I was disappointed by the tone the Minister took and the apparent lack of open-mindedness to the new evidence emerging.</p>

 I, too, saw the e-mail the hon. Gentleman sent to all Members of Parliament, asking for details of any cases. However, his case tonight is based on some conversations that he has had and some discussion with someone in a school about whether they were aware of something. Based on that, he has tried to advance the case that all the science, all the evidence and all the information that the Government have are not true. His central question to me, which I have answered, is why I believe that the vaccine is safe and why I believe it is appropriate to give that vaccine. I agree absolutely with the hon. Gentleman that any Government, regardless of their confidence now, would stay vigilant and look at all the reports on the vaccine&#151;as we do monthly.</p>
