 Formal inter-party talks based on Sir Hayden&#146;s recommendations ended on 30 October 2007 without agreement. However, Sir Hayden&#146;s reports have made an important contribution to debates and discussions ever since, in the House and outside. The Political Parties and Elections Bill, as amended in this place, received broad support, and is now proceeding in the other place.</p>

 How can the British people have confidence in our political system when, despite many of Sir Hayden&#146;s recommendations, the wealthy can still buy influence in our politics with massive donations, and parties can still spend without limit at local level to buy votes? Will the Secretary of State, even at this late stage, amend his Bill in the other place to take account of Sir Hayden&#146;s recommendations and ensure that the big money is taken out of politics&#151;or is this another issue on which the Government have thrown away their moral compass?</p>

 The hon. Gentleman had to keep consulting his notes in order to read that question out&#151;and it did not have much force behind it. The answer is this: I believe that, on the issue of party funding above all else, it is extremely important for us not to proceed without a broad consensus between the parties. Otherwise we would end up with the position that obtains in Canada, where so-called &#147;great reforms&#148; in party funding&#151;including state funding&#151;have become partisan tools in the hands of the Government of the day. We have one of the cleanest systems of party funding and party operation in the world, as the recent Electoral Commission report made clear.</p>

 All parties seek to operate within the limits set by the law. At some stages, the Labour party funded candidates well when it was in opposition. That is now a matter for the Conservative party. Although the hon. Gentleman is in a small minority in the House in terms of the party that he represents, let me say to him that we have enough problems in terms of the reputation of party politics, without turning the issue of party funding into another partisan political football.</p>

 Does the Secretary of State agree that there is a huge conundrum when it comes to party political funding? The public want democracy, but it is expensive. They do not want to pay for it with their own taxes, and they do not want other people to pay for it with their hard-earned cash.</p>

 The hon. Lady has put the dilemma very acutely. She will know that one of Sir Hayden&#146;s key recommendations was that in return for donation limits there should be very extensive state funding. I think it is now recognised, not least given the state of the British economy, that the British people would not take kindly to that proposition. In Canada, where there had been state funding, the Government of Mr. Stephen Harper suddenly decided to withdraw it as an economy measure, causing a fundamental crisis in Canadian politics. That, I suggest, is another reason not to introduce comprehensive state funding.</p>

 The Secretary of State&#146;s answers have been largely disappointing, apart from his answer to his hon. Friend the Member for Southampton, Test (Dr. Whitehead). I considered that answer encouraging, and urge him to go further. He referred to the political context&#151;but it is a context in which public faith in politics is plummeting, and the McBride affair and discussion of our allowances just make matters worse. Does he not accept that the Political Parties and Elections Bill gives the Government an opportunity to do something now&#151;something generous, something principled and something non-partisan? It is up to him to make proposals in that regard.</p>

He will also know that the contract for that prison is coming to an end and that, in the light of the Justice Secretary&#146;s statement of 27 April, we will be putting the contract out to competition again. Both the public and the private sector&#151;and, indeed, the voluntary sector&#151;can compete for that contract, and I have no doubt that we will ultimately choose whoever can provide the best service to continue the good work that has been done to date at Buckley Hall prison.</p>

Let us look at what the Labour Government have done to date. In the last 12 years, we have commissioned and built RAF Coltishall in Norfolk, which will be opening shortly as a public sector prison, and we have also opened HMP Kennet in Maghull on Merseyside as a public sector prison.

to the public sector being considered after that, because there is a need for an appropriate mix. The public sector does a good job, and the private sector can do a good job too; what we are interested in is the cost and efficiency of the prison service, and I believe that both sectors have their role to play. My hon. Friend will know, however, that the public sector overwhelmingly remains the major provider of prison services in England and Wales, and will continue to be so.</p>

 But does the Minister accept that reoffending rates are frighteningly high in both privatised prisons and public sector prisons? When he listens to further representations about prisons, will he concentrate his mind very much on what kind of prison provides the best resettlement programmes, enabling people leaving prison&#151;who are often youngsters&#151;to go into a home and a job and back into the community with a proper resettlement programme, as that is the best way to stop reoffending?</p>

 The hon. Gentleman makes extremely valid points. He will know that what happens in prison and how we re-enter people into society when they leave prison are the two key determinants as to whether reoffending behaviour occurs. I am deeply committed to trying to develop regimes in private and public sector prisons that achieve maximum outputs for both. To do that, we must not just look at prisons in isolation, but also look at them as transitional places from where people return to the community. That is why the hon. Gentleman&#146;s points about housing, employment and skills development are the key issues that we need to continue to work on. I believe we have been doing some good work to date, but there is always more to do, and I hope we can focus on that, regardless of who happens to run the prisons in the future.</p>

I introduced one of those changes 11 years ago, as Home Secretary&#151;a change that my predecessor, the right hon. and learned Member for Folkestone and Hythe (Mr. Howard), had sat on and refused to implement because he thought that it would send up the crime figures even further than they had already gone up under the Conservatives. Contrary to what the hon. Member for Bournemouth, East (Mr. Ellwood) says, we have good and declining reoffending rates, and I do not know where he got his data about other European countries.

 Given what the Secretary of State has just said, what would he advise me to tell the people who work in the probation service in the north-east? How are they supposed to improve reoffending rates if, because of deficit cuts, they lose &#163;1.6 million this year and &#163;4.2 million in 2012, and do not employ the 24 trainee probation officers who have been trained over the last three years, at a cost of &#163;2.5 million to the public purse? Surely that cannot be correct?</p>

<p><a name="st_o31"><a name="0905052000061"><a name="90505-0002.htm_spnew1"><a name="0905052000266"><b>Mr. Straw:</b>
 My colleagues and I are always happy to see my hon. Friend&#151;and, if necessary, a delegation from Northumbria probation service&#151;about their concerns. The probation service has had a 70 per cent. real-terms increase in funding in the last 12 years, compared with an increase of just over 50 per cent. in its case load, so it has had substantial additional resources. We are seeking to end the situation in which some of those resources have gone on unnecessary layers of middle management. Given the overall levels of funding, we are in no doubt that front-line delivery of probation services can be continued at its current level.</p>

<p><a name="st_o32"><a name="0905052000062"><a name="90505-0002.htm_spnew2"><a name="0905052000267"><b>Mr. Dominic Grieve (Beaconsfield) (Con):</b>
 There is one figure on which we can agree, and that is that more than 50,000 offenders have been released early by this Government, including people convicted of terrorist, violent and sexual offences. It is bad enough that the Government have recklessly failed to build enough prison places, but can the Secretary of State now confirm that the &#163;30 million in planned cuts to local probation services must mean even less protection of the public from serious offenders after their release?</p>

<p><a name="st_o33"><a name="0905052000063"><a name="90505-0002.htm_spnew3"><a name="0905052000268"><b>Mr. Straw:</b>
 I do not accept that. The nominal reduction in spending is belied by the fact that for the year that finished at the end of March&#151;just over five weeks ago&#151;the probation service underspent by &#163;23 million. Interestingly, and somewhat to our surprise, given the concerns expressed by the probation service, there is no reason why probation services should not be able to manage within their budgets. What would the hon. and learned Gentleman do? After all, his policy is for much larger cuts than anything that we are contemplating.</p>

 I wonder whether the Justice Secretary has actually read his own guidance to probation trusts. In 2007, probation officers were required to provide a report every three months on those sentenced to life imprisonment and subject to close monitoring on release. Last month, probation officers were told to report every six months instead, because of the resources available. Can he confirm that that is indeed the guidance? Does he now accept that these cuts in front-line probation services must put the public at greater risk?</p>

<p><a name="st_o35"><a name="0905052000065"><a name="90505-0002.htm_spnew5"><a name="0905052000270"><b>Mr. Straw:</b>
 I am sorry, but I do not accept the basis of the hon. and learned Gentleman&#146;s point at all. We have significantly increased real-terms resources to the probation service, so it is much better resourced than it ever was under his party&#146;s administration. At any time, of course, adjustments may be made for different levels of offender. We want to see&#151;and the public want to see&#151;probation resources concentrated on the most serious offenders, especially when they are released from jail. That is precisely what we are doing.</p>

 I accept entirely what my hon. Friend says about the very low level of skills of the majority of prisoners. We are transforming the situation for the education and training of prisoners. The amount spent on offender learning just since 2001 has increased by three times, and has now risen to more than &#163;175 million. There are 21,000 prisoners achieving skills for life qualifications and 70,000 achieving vocational qualifications. That is a dramatic change in the provision of education and training in our prisons.</p>

We are very concerned that when we bring in a system of individual registration&#151;we are placing such measures before Parliament as we speak&#151;there will not be a fall in the number of those who are registered to vote.

 Of course I share the concerns raised about fraud by the hon. Member for South-West Bedfordshire (Andrew Selous). However, the issue of under-registration is worrying, too.

 I am grateful to my hon. Friend for bringing the subject up again. It is absolutely crucial to the health of our democracy that everyone who is eligible to vote is registered, and can therefore vote. At the moment, our best estimate is that something like 3 million people in this country who are eligible to vote cannot do so, because they are not registered. That is a disgrace to our democracy, and we have to do everything possible to make sure that we do not let that situation continue. I think that the whole House agrees that a system of individual registration is desirable, both in principle and in practice. It has a lot of benefits associated with it, but there is a risk as well, to which my hon. Friend referred:  <br>

when we move to such a system, there is a real risk&#151;we saw this happen in Northern Ireland&#151;that many of those who are eligible to vote will simply not be registered. That is why the legislation that we are putting before Parliament says that before we move definitively to a system of compulsory individual registration, the Electoral Commission must be satisfied that the register is comprehensive and accurate. That is why we put that provision in. I hope that that will provide some reassurance to my hon. Friend.</p>

 As the Minister knows, we enthusiastically welcome the steps that he and his colleagues are taking to bring in individual voter registration, for which we have called for over five years. We Opposition Members are never complacent about electoral fraud; this House derives its legitimacy from the integrity of the ballot. Individual voter registration is only part of the solution. Does the Minister agree that the integrity of the ballot will only be really secure when a potential voter is required to produce evidence of their identity when they go into the polling station to get a ballot paper? The Minister knows that that works in Northern Ireland. When will he take steps to introduce the system in the rest of the United Kingdom?</p>

Members: &#147;No.&#148;] I simply say that the hon. Lady needs to be careful about which policy prescription she comes forward with. On her first point, she has advocated individual registration for some considerable time, but throughout that period she was silent on the need for the register to be comprehensive as well as accurate. I have to say that until this Government brought forward proposals that combine measures to complete the accuracy of the register and measures to ensure its comprehensive nature, individual registration carried as many risks as benefits.

 My right hon. Friend the Minister is absolutely right to insist on that twin track, because while none of us would approve of fraud by people who actively seek to pervert the electoral process, the biggest fraud in this country at the moment relates to the 3 million people who are not registered, and whose voices are not heard. We know that the Conservative party is not keen on doing anything about that, because it believes&#151;rightly, I think&#151;that it would be electorally disadvantaged by such a process.

 Individuals with mental illnesses are regularly transferred from prisons. Every year, approximately 900 people who meet the criteria under the Mental Health Act 1983 are transferred. We are trying to speed up the availability of beds for those individuals. In 2007, some 40 individuals waited longer than 12 weeks for a bed. By March 2008, the number of such individuals had been reduced to 24. We have a target of 14 days, instead of 12 weeks, and I am confident that we will meet that target. I believe that we can make better use of community orders and suspended sentences.

 On the basis of those figures we can safely extrapolate that tens of thousands of people who should be in prison are out on the streets committing offences, and presumably tens of thousands more are committing offences but are not caught and do not show up in those figures. Does this not show the scandal of all forms of early release? Will the Minister undertake to ensure that people are not let out of their sentences less than halfway through as a result of a few bleeding-hearted social workers, and that they serve their sentences in full, as given by judges?</p>

 As ever, the hon.

He will know that I am concerned, as are all Labour Members, about reoffending rates. They remain too high, and we have to get them down. The work that we are doing on employment, housing and skill development is about reducing reoffending. I would much rather follow the line of attack of the hon.

Park homes provide a useful addition to the supply of housing and would have even greater potential if we could improve that balance.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o12"><a name="90505-0003.htm_para7"><a name="0905052000142">First, I emphasise that the points that I shall make are directed at a minority of park home site owners. There are excellent, well-managed park home sites in my constituency, and I do not wish to suggest that all site owners engage in bad practices. That is far from the case. However, there is one particular site in my constituency, the Silent Woman park near Wareham, where residents have had cause to raise many issues with me over the years. It is in an idyllic setting and residents should be able to live there without constant worries.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o13"><a name="90505-0003.htm_para8"><a name="0905052000143">The Bill would prevent unjustified interference by a site owner when residents sell their park home. A park home site owner might quite reasonably wish to meet a prospective buyer or at least have some references supplied, but an interview without the seller or an independent witness present can provide opportunities for rogue site owners to make misleading or untrue statements. Examples of such statements from across the country include: &#147;The home is in poor condition&#148;; &#147;The home is not worth the price you&#146;re paying&#148;; &#147;The home will have to be moved to another pitch next year&#148;; &#147;I have a right to ask the court to let me take the home off in five years&#148;; and &#147;The park is being developed and the home will have to be moved.&#148; Alternatively, the prospective buyer might simply be intimidated by real or implied threats and not want to be involved with the site owner in any way. The prospective buyer might understandably decide that he or she does not want to live on a park run in such a way, and/or by such an unpleasant person, and the sale will fall through. After that has been repeated a few times, the seller eventually sells the home to the park owner for a token sum.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o14"><a name="90505-0004.htm_para0"><a name="0905052000144">In each case there are no witnesses and the prospective buyer is usually unwilling to give a witness statement. He or she simply wants to get away from the park. The seller does not usually go to court because there is no witness statement and the buyer is lost anyway. The incentive for the park owner is to buy the home for a small sum, remove it from the park, site a new and possibly bigger home on the pitch and sell it, thereby making a clear profit of perhaps &#163;100,000. Rogue site owners currently have the ability to sabotage sales and  <br>

can rely on the fact that many people who move to park homes are frail, vulnerable, elderly and easily intimidated. It seems perfectly reasonable for a site owner to be able to check out a prospective buyer, but how can we stop the abuse and possible fraud currently taking place? My Bill suggests that there should be an independent witness present at such meetings.</p>

The residents believe that she was told that she had to be over 50, that the owner had the right to move the home, that if he did so it would fall apart, and that he would not be responsible for putting it back together again, and that he wanted to replace it with another home that could be sold for &#163;150,000-plus. If that was not true, the site owner, too, would be protected under my proposal that an independent witness should be present during any meetings between a prospective purchaser and the site owner. That might be a solicitor, but the important point would be to have an independent witness; further consideration would obviously need to be given to communication by phone.</p>

council decided not to enforce the removal of extensions on resale. The site owner wanted the council to enforce such removals and indicated great displeasure to me after the council made its decision. There are a number of extensions on the site that technically breach the 6 m rule. They were allowed over many years by default, with no action by the local authority or the site owner. Many owners purchase their homes with the extensions already in place, and have no knowledge of any problems relating to them. The site ownership has been with the same family for many years.</p>

There were enormous difficulties involved in getting the police to accept that this was not just a civil matter. The case was eventually taken up, but perhaps not in a wholehearted manner, and, in any event, it was not pursued by the Crown Prosecution Service. The all-party group on the welfare of park home owners recently had a useful meeting with the Minister responsible for policing. He was very responsive, and agreed to talk to the police about the need for existing legislation to be available to park home owners. Witnesses are needed, however, and on many occasions prospective buyers will just want to walk away and forget an unpleasant experience.</p>

 New clause 14 inserts new chapter 5A into part X of the Education Act 1996. It further strengthens the provisions in the previous clause, particularly for young people with special educational needs, and with regard to information sharing. The new chapter 5A continues to place a duty on the child&#146;s or young person&#146;s home local authority to take steps to promote the fulfilment of the person&#146;s learning potential while they are in juvenile custody and on their release. The new clause is an important mechanism for ensuring that one local authority&#151;the home local authority&#151;remains involved in the person&#146;s education and training, regardless of where they are in the system, and can promote continuity and consistency of learning for the child or young person.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o36"><a name="90505-0005.htm_para3"><a name="0905052000170">For persons in juvenile custody with special educational needs, the new clause provides a framework of duties that significantly strengthens requirements and that will, we believe, provide the most practical of arrangements to ensure their needs are met in custody and on their release. If a person had a statement of special educational needs prior to their detention, new section 562C requires the host LEA to use its best endeavours to secure that appropriate special educational provision is made for the detained person.</p>

 Taking the idea of &#147;best endeavours&#148; further, is it not the case that such endeavours will count only when the local authority has the budget to deliver ongoing support and education for a young offender in custody? Does the Minister welcome the Youth Justice Board&#146;s moves to provide full information on budgetary costs of the custody of young offenders in the home authority? Would not the next step be to look at devolving those custodial costs so that the home authority has a sufficient budget to be able to deliver when offenders are out of custody, in custody and after custody?</p>

 Under the Bill, the budget currently held by the Ministry of Justice, which is responsible for education in custody at the moment, will be transferred to local authorities, and detailed guidance will be issued on how it will work in practice.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o38"><a name="90505-0005.htm_para5"><a name="0905052000176">Section 562C also requires the authority that was maintaining the statement to keep a copy of it while the person is detained. Clause 51, which amends part 4 of the Education Act 1996, makes provision for the statement of special educational needs that was maintained before the person&#146;s detention to be revived and reviewed on release. The new clause also strengthens requirements in relation to the transfer of information about a person&#146;s education so that that relevant parties can exchange relevant educational information to help to ensure that education and training in juvenile custody can be tailored to meet the person&#146;s needs.</p>

 The provisions may well be in the new clauses, but it has been a particular problem with young people in the secure estate that if they are moved, their educational records can take so long to catch up with them that they end up having to start all over again. If that happens twice&#151;given that most of them have short sentences&#151;they end up completing their sentence when they have had three first bites at the cherry but have never been able to complete a course, even though they would have had time to do so if the records had followed them promptly from one institution to another.</p>

 Information sharing is going to be particularly important. Because of a previous split in responsibility between the Ministry of Justice and local authorities, which applied before a young person went into custody and after, there was far more likelihood of what my hon. Friend referred to happening. We hope that under the new provisions, that process will be speeded up and will form part of the guidance that develops as we go forward. The guidance will include expectations of how LEAs should support the special educational needs of children and young people in juvenile custody, and we will use the guidance to be clear about the respective roles of the different local authorities involved in order to assure clarity of roles and expectations.</p>

It would be impractical to require local education authorities to commission specific provision to meet every need of every young person while they are in custody, because it  <br>

<notus-date day="5" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>5 May 2009 : Column 31</b><br>
would take time to commission that, and would be difficult within the context of delivering complex custodial regimes for an ever changing population. However, we consider the provisions in the Bill a significant step forward.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o40"><a name="90505-0005.htm_para7"><a name="0905052000180">Our requirements for and approach to education and training for children and young people in custody will result in real improvements and better outcomes. This is the first time that requirements for education in custody will be set out in primary legislation, which will allow us to be clear about roles and expectations in statutory guidance. It will mean clear duties on a young person&#146;s home local authority to maintain involvement in the person&#146;s education and training, which we believe will promote greater consistency in young person&#146;s learning and the support that they receive to help them to engage, progress and achieve.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o41"><a name="90505-0005.htm_para8"><a name="0905052000181">With regard to young people with statements of special educational need, there are significant constraints to continuing SEN statements in custody, which outweigh the potential benefits. The SEN statement is a legally binding document that sets out the specific special educational provision that the young person must receive. The statement would be likely to include the name of the school the young person must attend and details of all the special educational provision the young person must receive. Therefore, if the statements were to be continued when a young person entered custody, the statement would have to be reviewed and reissued upon the child&#146;s entering the custodial establishment and again on the young person&#146;s release.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o42"><a name="90505-0005.htm_para9"><a name="0905052000182">As I said, the average time spent in custody for young people is three to four months, which means that by the time the SEN statement had been reviewed and appropriate provision commissioned and provided, the majority of young people would be leaving the secure estate and the SEN statement would need to be reviewed yet again.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o43"><a name="90505-0005.htm_para10"><a name="0905052000183">There are significant constraints on host LEAs being required to conduct SEN assessments for young people entering custody without a statement, if they consider an assessment might be needed. Again, that is because young people generally spend a short time in custody and may also move establishments mid-sentence, as was pointed out by my hon. Friend the Member for Wolverhampton, South-West (Rob Marris).</p>

<p><a name="st_o100"><a name="0905052000184"><a name="90505-0005.htm_spnew8"><a name="0905052000349"><b>Mr. Burrowes:</b>
 Does the Minister share the concern about constraints for home authorities in relation to the increasing distance between the home authority and the locations in which young people are housed in custodial establishments? Will she consider how the Bill squares with the decision of the Youth Justice Board to remove contracts in relation to secure children&#146;s homes, which often house some of the most vulnerable young people? Indeed, in London there will be no secure children&#146;s home; the nearest is in Southampton.</p>

 Again, information sharing between home and host local authorities will be really important. I still maintain that bringing the education system back under the local authority so that it, as a body, rather than the Ministry of Justice, bears the responsibility between a child&#146;s entering and leaving custody, means that that continuity is much more likely to be maintained.</p>

There is no pre-existing legislative provision requiring a youth offending team to be notified when a young person is detained in custody pursuant to a court order. However, youth offending teams have a pivotal role in the youth justice system, and in particular in arranging the placement of a young person who is sentenced or remanded in custody. In practice, a custodial placement could not be arranged without the youth offending team&#146;s involvement.</p>

Therefore, in practice a young person could not be placed in custody without the youth offending team being aware of it.</p>

Why is the Minister moving exactly the same new clauses that she argued for in Committee? She is doing so because the management of the Committee stage by the four Ministers charged with that responsibility was not handled with the deftness of touch that might have been expected; it was a case of too many Ministers spoiling the broth, and an example of the chaos that can occur on considering a joint Bill when there is no clear sense of who is responsible.</p>

New clauses 14 and 15 were meant to replace clauses 49 and 50, which meant that the Government Members of the Committee should have voted against their own clauses in Committee, but instead they inadvertently voted for them. However, a very kind Chairman of the Committee realised the Minister&#146;s oversight and gave the Committee a second chance to vote; but, alas, those Members again voted the wrong way and voted for their own clauses. So, here we are repeating the Committee stage and voting on whether to undo the errors of wayward Ministers&#151;and we will have to do that again later this evening as the Government try to reverse three defeats incurred in Committee on three technical Government amendments. Those defeats were caused by the fact that a number of Labour Members failed to turn up in time for a 9 am start.</p>

Act 1996, which new clause 14 would insert. Proposed new section 562B would introduce a duty on the home local authority of the young person in custody to ensure that both during the period of detention and on release it took steps to promote that young person&#146;s educational potential. Subsection (3) would provide that the home authority must make arrangements for the provision of education or training for the young person when they are released, but includes the words</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o58"><a name="90505-0006.htm_para9"><a name="0905059000013">I want the Minister to answer the following question. Given the importance of education to young offenders in ensuring that they do not continue on the road to a life of crime, when might it not be &#147;appropriate&#148; for that young person&#146;s home authority to make arrangements for the provision of education or training on that person&#146;s release from detention? Is not the danger that the phrasing will provide a get-out clause that will allow indolent local authorities not to bother?</p>

 I do not accept that. Given the statistics that I have just read out, we need to put more effort into ensuring that prisoners who leave custody have those basic skills to enable them to get a job and to have a decent life. Local authorities should not be given an easy get-out from providing that education to those people.</p>

 I, too, am interested by the use of the term &#147;over compulsory school age&#148;. I thought that &#147;compulsory school age&#148; was a historical concept and that what we now have is compulsory education to the age of 18.

The provision says that the local authority where the young person is detained must use its &#147;best endeavours&#148; to secure special educational provision for that person while they are in custody. Again, it is the phrase &#147;must use its best endeavours&#148; that concerns us. Is not that another get-out clause for a local authority that does not want to incur the expense of ensuring that the youth custody facilities in its area provide that type of quality education?</p>

Indeed, one might be forgiven for making a connection between poor policy making, the Warnock conclusions about inclusion and the fact that we are now discussing educational provision for young people in custody with special educational needs. Given the strong correlation between poor educational achievement and prison, it is not difficult to come to the conclusion that poor special education provision is having a similar consequence for some young people who have special educational needs.</p>

This Bill follows through that aim very positively. One of the problems that sometimes occurs when we legislate is that the different Departments do not always get their act together.

 I, too, hope that our considerations today proceed smoothly and without a hitch. On the subject of these new clauses, it is really important to identify the roles of the home and host authorities.

I have some knowledge of this subject from relatives who have been teachers. Local authorities have been reluctant to statement young people, because it then costs money to do something about it.

 I thank the hon. Gentleman for his intervention. I shall come on to make the point that there is always a resource implication of such actions. The resource constraint sometimes deters local authorities from doing things that they ought to do. I have had cases in my constituency of people who really should have been in residential educational care, or whatever one likes to call it, at an earlier stage in life. The local authority resists, usually arguing that it is better to have the principle of inclusion to the fore, when the real concern is about the cost. If central Government were prepared to fund local authorities to provide that very expensive special provision for certain young people, local authorities would be much more enthusiastic about pursuing that option.

<p><a name="stpa_o72"><a name="90505-0007.htm_para0"><a name="0905059000038">I have argued on many occasions that there ought to be more residential provision for those with certain sorts of special educational needs, and particularly for those with serious behavioural needs that are difficult to accommodate in school. The young people concerned have difficulty coping with school. I am not suggesting that every time anybody misbehaves, they should be sent off to a boarding school, but some people&#146;s behavioural difficulties are so serious that they really need a calmer experience in a residential setting, with specialist provision. I know that schools and colleges of that kind do exist. Some of them are private, and some are very expensive. If local authorities, in regional consortiums, made that  <br>

sort of provision for those with special educational needs at an early stage&#151;if intervention were quick and early&#151;it would make an enormous difference to whether those people finished up in a custodial environment, and then went on to a criminal life, which would be wholly regrettable. Early intervention is absolutely crucial in such cases, as it is in the case of so many special educational needs. If we invested more in such special educational provision when people were very young, we would finish up with fewer people in custodial situations, and fewer people leading a life of crime.</p>

<p><a name="st_o130"><a name="0905059000039"><a name="90505-0007.htm_spnew0"><a name="0905059000250"><b>Mr. Graham Stuart:</b>
 It is a great pleasure to follow the hon. Member for Luton, North (Kelvin Hopkins). Uniquely, I found myself agreeing with almost everything that he said, particularly on early intervention. If one wants to look at the matter in purely financial terms, from the state&#146;s point of view, early intervention and investment in young people who are clearly coming off the rails, as they are when in custody, will pay back. It will pay back handsomely if we can provide the educational opportunity to allow at least a decent percentage of those young people to get on to the straight and narrow, increase their confidence and so on.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o73"><a name="90505-0007.htm_para1"><a name="0905059000040">I also agree with what the hon. Member for Mid-Dorset and North Poole (Annette Brooke) said about the need for visibility on performance. We need transparency. Young people who go into custody often move between institutions. Sometimes they are moved far away from their home authority, and they are out of sight, out of mind. That is why the fact that the Government are today making an effort to improve the education of those young people is to be welcomed, but it is also why so many Members from all parts of the House have concerns about whether the measures that the Government are taking are strong enough.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o74"><a name="90505-0007.htm_para2"><a name="0905059000041">I have already raised issues about the wording. The home authority must</p>

</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o75"><a name="90505-0007.htm_para3"><a name="0905059000042">and the host authority &#147;must use best endeavours&#148;. To say that an authority has failed in such a statutory duty is pretty hard to do. I therefore urge Ministers to consider tightening up that wording, even if, for now, it appears only in guidance. If we are to ensure that those young people receive education where it is practical to deliver it, perhaps we need a stronger commitment. That also picks up on another important point, in addition to transparency, about money; this is often a question of resources. Given plentiful quantities of money, host, home and custody authorities would be only too happy to provide more educational support for young people and, if they had the resources, perhaps they would be able to ensure a more settled time in custody, the better to provide them with education. I am concerned about the way in which the host authorities will access the money. I understand from the Minister that money will be transferred to local authorities, but will transparency apply to requests from host authorities to home authorities and to the responses that they receive? I should be grateful if the Minister explained to the House and to me exactly how the host authority may claim funding to ensure that the person it has assessed receives the education that that authority thinks is right.</p>

 It is important that we look at added value. People often start at a low base when they enter into the care of those education authorities, so we need to look at that component.

 My hon. Friend has made a very good point.

No longer will they be party to any reviews or appeals: they will be cut out of the process of SEN provision for their child while he or she is in custody.

 My hon. Friend is quite right, and he has picked up a point made by the hon. Member for Wolverhampton, South-West (Rob Marris). It is ironic that we should consider these new clauses, which make no mention whatsoever of parents, on the very day on which the Prime Minister has declared that parent power should be the driving force to raise educational standards. That irony will not be lost on the Secretary of State who, in this particular regard, has failed his master. Perhaps he is about to catch up, and fall into step with him, and we will hear about that from the Minister at the Dispatch Box.</p>

The specific referrals that will come about as a result of the new clause will further back up that commitment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o81"><a name="90505-0007.htm_para9"><a name="0905059000053">However, I am concerned that we still cannot identify the number of children or young people detained in juvenile custody who have an SEN, what that SEN is&#151;I have campaigned long and hard on this, as Ministers know&#151;or the number of those who are later given a statement. Although I accept that there is a duty on local authorities to monitor and provide for children for whom they are responsible, it is a cause for concern that yet again there is a deficit of information in an area in which a problem clearly exists. I wholeheartedly support the amendment, which places a duty on a host local authority.</p>

 I know that the hon. Lady feels passionately about these subjects, as do I. Would she acknowledge that one of the key aspects of that information is the specificity and quantification of the provision that is put in place to meet the statemented need?

 I agree. As hon. Members know, I introduced a private Member&#146;s Bill on special educational needs and the collection of information. The problem exists not only for children in custody, but for children as they move around the country, even when their parents are totally responsible for them. Often the information is not passed on from one local authority to another with regard to the specific needs of that child. I have had personal experience of starting again, in effect, when one moves to a new local authority. The amendment is welcome because, when a child or young person moves into a local authority area it will help inform the authority that they may need an SEN assessment or a statement.</p>

a tiny minority of children with very severe emotional and behavioural difficulties who are put in secure accommodation not necessarily because of criminal acts of any sort, but because they are so disturbed that they need a very high level of support, to the extent that it is residential and often geographically outside the home local authority area. For example, Wolverhampton used to send children to somewhere in Devon. It is debatable whether that is good for the child. For most of them, it is better that they remain nearer where they live, although not in every case if they have a very disruptive family.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o84"><a name="90505-0007.htm_para12"><a name="0905059000059">I would not want anyone to think that these are exact figures, but for purposes of comparison let me give the figures, very roughly, from a few years ago. For a child from Wolverhampton who was placed in such secure residential accommodation because of their emotional and behavioural difficulties, the average cost was &#163;150,000 a year. For some, however, the cost was &#163;250,000 a year, meaning that, if a child went into such an institution for four years, they could cost &#163;1 million. It drained a huge proportion of the health budget and the local authority budget, albeit for children with very severe difficulties. Those were extreme figures.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o85"><a name="90505-0007.htm_para13"><a name="0905059000060">The approximate spending per capita per year&#151;I am talking about five years ago&#151;on an average child in a secondary school was &#163;4,000 a year. That was for a child who went to school for roughly six hours a day, five days a week, 39 weeks a year. By contrast, the figure for a young person in the secure estate was lower; it was in the low &#163;3,000s.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o86"><a name="90505-0007.htm_para14"><a name="0905059000061">It was difficult to form an idea of the figures, because, frankly, the Government did not keep them and one had to try to work them out as best one could. It was a bit of a back-of-an-envelope calculation, because the figures that the Government started with involved taking the number of places in an institution, such as Pucklehurst where Stephen Fry was as a teenager, and dividing that by the budget. Then one had the per capita figure, but of course that included accommodation&#151;food, heating, lighting, security and so on.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o87"><a name="90505-0007.htm_para15"><a name="0905059000062">The comparative figure was just over &#163;3,000 a year, as far as I could tell, for a young person in a secure estate, as opposed to someone in a regular secondary school, who cost about &#163;4,000 a year. That struck me as absolutely potty, given that, as I understand it, a large plurality, if not a majority, of young people in the secure estate have severe difficulties with basic learning&#151;with the three R&#146;s. It is one of the factors that can become an indicator of someone&#146;s being in the secure estate. I must stress that I do not suggest that a young person aged 13 or 14 who is not functionally literate will necessarily end up in the secure estate, but a disproportionate number of young people who are not functionally literate do.</p>

 I am sure that my hon. Friend saw a recent documentary about young people being taught to read, and the transformation in the behaviour of one young person who had caused massive problems in school. They were successfully taught to read, and they were transformed as a person. They became happy and well integrated, and they led a productive life at school and beyond.</p>

The Government have taken the issue in hand over the past five years, because of pressure from all parts of the House, and they have done much better on education for young people in the secure estate. However, I want reassurance from the Minister&#151;perhaps not today, because it can be difficult to unravel such figures&#151;that, per capita per annum, spending on the education of young people in the secure estate is more than what is spent on children in a regular state secondary school.</p>

<p><a name="st_o141"><a name="0905059000066"><a name="90505-0007.htm_spnew11"><a name="0905059000261"><b>Sarah McCarthy-Fry:</b>
 That was an interesting debate. There were some very good contributions by Members on both sides of the House. It shows the great interest that Members have in the issue. On the specific points, I turn first to the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton (Mr. Gibb). He asked when it would not be appropriate for the local authority to make arrangements for persons released from detention. That would be when the young person or their parents had already made arrangements for their continuing education and training. In that case, the local authority would not have to step in.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o89"><a name="90505-0007.htm_para17"><a name="0905059000067">There was another question about compulsory school age education and training. Obviously, there is compulsory schooling up to 16. Post-16, there is education or training, so, as the issue moves with the recommended participation age, the relevant provisions will apply.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o90"><a name="90505-0007.htm_para18"><a name="0905059000068">Many of the other points come back to the answers that I gave before, in response to interventions. The issue is about getting the balance right between what can practically be achieved within the secure estate and our wanting the best for young people. As I said, in many cases, practical difficulties mean that it would not be possible to replicate the exact provision that young people enjoyed outside the secure estate. A special educational needs statement often includes a particular school that a young person should attend; obviously, that would not be possible in respect of a young person in the secure estate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o91"><a name="90505-0007.htm_para19"><a name="0905059000069">Another point, which came up time and again, was about monitoring and inspection. Ofsted will be responsible for the inspection of educational standards and the education that young people receive in the secure estate. On young people coming out of the secure estate, I should say that there will be a national indicator for local authorities to ensure that young people supervised by youth offending teams are in education or employment at the end of their sentences. A lot of that will be put together in the guidance.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o95"><a name="90505-0008.htm_para0"><a name="0905059000079">Two questions were asked about funding. Funding will go to the Young People&#146;s Learning Agency and then to the host authorities. We are considering how best we can ensure that the funding designated for education in custody is spent on that and how we get equality of spend across the system. We will work closely with all the partners to agree a model for how we can make that happen. In England, the funding will flow from central Government to the YPLA to the host LEAs, which will then use it to secure education and training for juveniles in custody. In Wales, it will be slightly different&#151;the funding will be re-routed from the Youth Justice Board&#146;s budget to the Welsh Assembly Government and then distributed to host LEAs, which will receive additional funding to carry out their new responsibilities of securing education and training in juvenile custody.</p>

 I am trying to understand this process. I thought that the home authority was going to play a role, but obviously not&#151;the money will flow between the YPLA and the host authority. Will the allocation to the host authority be based on a standard assessment of need, and to what extent can that be constrained by the budgetary position of the YPLA?</p>

 We are looking forward to agreeing that model as we bring it forward. The home LEA is involved because the Bill proposes that host LEAs should be able to recoup the cost of SEN provision from home authorities, because they are not providing it while the young person is in custody. We need to get the model right and ensure that all the partners are involved.</p>

 Can my hon. Friend assure me that the YPLA, which will be the funding body for the host authority, will have sufficient funds? Will it be charged with the responsibility of providing a higher per capita annualised figure for the education of a young person in the secure estate than the average figure for what one might broadly term a regular secondary school student, so that extra moneys will go into the education of young people in the secure estate, many of whom, although they do not have statemented special educational needs, have what we might call, in lay terms, particular educational needs, often in catching up with the basic three R&#146;s?</p>

 I cannot give my hon. Friend an assurance on whether that average is right without having the figures in front of me. It is certainly something that we are looking into. We expect that host LEAs will receive additional funding to carry out these responsibilities. I cannot comment on the figures that he quoted, which are from five years ago. I undertake to write to him with the information. <i> [</i><i> Interruption.</i><i> ]</i> I have just seen that the amount of funding that the Government give to local authorities for the education and training of young people in custody will be based on a per-bed price that is agreed centrally by national partners at the start of the commissioning process. Funding for special educational needs is relative to the child, which is why we have to get the model right to ensure that they get the appropriate amount.</p>

Of course, there is a national role in the setting of those targets, but the vital thing is for local agencies to be consulted on those targets and then to ensure that they are properly driven forward locally. That is why they must take account of local performance and circumstance and why we expect local authorities to consult all local agencies and to propose challenging targets to us. We will bring forward secondary legislation to address the details of how those targets will be set, alongside the review of the range of safeguarding targets, and will publish a new framework in the autumn.</p>

 In preparing his report, which I asked him to begin in December, Lord Laming held a wide range of meetings all round the country with practitioners and professionals. It was on that basis that he recommended the proposed statutory targets. We have obviously consulted our key partners, as well as Opposition Members and Departments, on the fact that we intend to implement that recommendation. When Lord Laming issued his report in March, I said that we would implement his recommendation, and today we are taking the power to do so. The detail of how we will do that&#151;that is, both the content of the secondary legislation and, importantly, the detailed statutory targets&#151;is something on which we will consult over the coming months and in the autumn. There will therefore be a full consultation on how we enact those powers, but the fact that we are enacting them is a consequence of Lord Laming&#146;s consultation and his report.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o117"><a name="90505-0008.htm_para22"><a name="0905059000110">Government new clause 23 amends the Children Act 2004 to require local authorities to open up the child protection system to greater public scrutiny by ensuring that two members of the general public are appointed to every local safeguarding children board in the country. An important part of our response to Lord Laming&#146;s report was to say that we needed greater transparency and public involvement, not least because safeguarding children is the responsibility of us all, not just professionals. Government new clause 23 will allow best practice to become common practice and will ensure that we can implement that recommendation in a sensible manner.</p>

 The reports will be public reports, issued by the safeguarding children board. All the experts who are involved in overseeing safeguarding arrangements in an area are on the safeguarding children board. They will report to the children&#146;s trust, which is responsible for ensuring that those responsible in every local area for leading individual agencies&#151;whether the local authority, the police, health services or other agencies more widely&#151;are putting in place both the senior management time and the resourcing to ensure that the challenge of safeguarding is being properly implemented. That allows the children&#146;s trust to ensure that safeguarding is being done properly and it allows the safeguarding board to ensure that individual agencies are playing their proper role. That must happen in public. An important part of our proposed new clauses is opening up the process to proper scrutiny.</p>

 The recommendations in Lord Laming&#146;s report challenge us to do just that. The combination of the new national safeguarding unit and the strengthened inspection regime through Ofsted is important. In the end, however, the issue is about ensuring that we have proper leadership, resourcing and scrutiny, both locally, in every one of the 158 areas where safeguarding is co-ordinated, and across a range of different agencies. Our challenge is to make best practice universal, across all parts of the country. As I have said, we will revise our new guidance on safeguarding to each area to reflect not only the changes in the law, but the wider  <br>

recommendations in Lord Laming&#146;s report. It is vital that we have clear direction from the centre, but far more important will be the quality and commitment of leadership at local level, and that is where we must ensure that we have proper and effective scrutiny. That is why the new clause&#146;s proposals to open up accountability at local area level, through lay members and annual reports, is as important as the setting of statutory targets and guidance, for which the Bill also makes provision.</p>

On the basis of the debate so far today, I regret that very much indeed. I understand that there was agreement among hon. Members on both sides of the Committee on the need for local employers to work together with local colleges. That is obviously vital in the current climate, and we are expanding the number of apprenticeships and getting more skills into the adult work force as well.</p>

The Under-Secretary of State for Innovation, Universities and Skills, my hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Erdington (Mr. Simon), said in that debate that we were fully committed to employer engagement, and that we would look at that matter further. Rather than imposing the duty to co-operate as a funding condition, we have decided instead, through new clause 21 and the consequential amendments, to place a duty on colleges to follow statutory guidance from the Secretary of State on co-operation, including with employers, alongside the new duty in the Bill to promote economic and social well-being in the local area. I hope that that will provide greater clarity and flexibility, and that the provisions make it clear in a way that all hon.

That makes it even more urgent to acknowledge that the measures that we all bring in&#151;not just the Government, but all the other agencies involved&#151;are very necessary. We can always clamp down, but we can never eliminate altogether those people who are intent on doing evil things to children. However, the duty of all of us is to make that as difficult as possible for them by eliminating as many opportunities as possible, and to keep a strong watching eye on the people who are minded to do these horrendous things to children.</p>

My problem, therefore, is how many of the 58 further recommendations being made in Laming 2 will add yet further to the bureaucracy, with Herbert Laming having himself acknowledged how too much bureaucracy has grown up in child protection and is becoming, in some cases, self-defeating.</p>

they can get on with their job of protecting children and vulnerable families and meeting them face to face rather than being shackled to their computers and assessment forms. That is what Laming, Unison and all other dispassionate observers say is now happening.

<p><a name="stpa_o150"><a name="90505-0009.htm_para31"><a name="0905059000158">Other recommendations underlying the new clauses include the following: that there should be statutory targets for safeguarding and protection, alongside the existing statutory attainment and early-years targets, to be produced as quickly as possible; that the Department of Health must clarify and strengthen the responsibilities of strategic health authorities; that directors of children&#146;s services and primary care trusts must regularly review all points of referral; and that all directors of children&#146;s services must appoint a senior manager within their team with the necessary skills and experience, and organise regular training and needs assessments. Therefore, a lot of extra bureaucracy will be added to the child protection procedures as a result of following the recommendations of Laming 2, if that is what the Secretary of State is going to do&#151;and given that he has already committed himself to accepting all those recommendations in practice and that we have the first few of them here, it appears that that is the route down which he will go.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman asks for transparency. As I want to respond clearly to his remarks, I must say to him that so far his comments have been obfuscatory and very unclear. He began by praising Lord Laming, but his subsequent remarks have left me very confused, and I need to know the following so that I can respond clearly. Lord Laming has made a series of recommendations, and I said in a statement to the House a few weeks ago that I accepted those recommendations and would implement them. Lord Laming recommended the following: that there should be an annual report to the children&#146;s trust and the local safeguarding board; that there should be a national delivery unit reporting to the Sub-Committee; and that there should be new statutory targets. I am implementing Lord Laming&#146;s recommendations&#151;some of them through this Bill&#151;because I support them. Do the hon. Gentleman and his party support Lord Laming&#146;s recommendations&#151;yes or no? I ask that because what the hon. Gentleman has so far said has been very confusing indeed.</p>

 The simple answer is no. If the Secretary of State had listened, he would know that I absolutely respect the job Lord Laming has done and the objectives he is trying to achieve, but I absolutely question whether these 58 recommendations in full will make the system  <br>

less bureaucratic and achieve what Lord Laming and I&#151;and, I am sure, the Secretary of State&#151;want to achieve. Many of these recommendations are good, and we will certainly support them. Taken as a whole however, I wonder whether they will add to bureaucracy, which would be counter-productive.

 Lord Laming makes it absolutely clear in his report that he sees the national delivery unit as central to ensuring that children are safe. He sees its reporting to the Sub-Committee as central to keeping children safe, too. He also sees the serious case review full report being kept confidential, and the establishment of ContactPoint and new statutory targets, as central to keeping children safe. On each of these recommendations, we have heard from the hon. Gentleman that he and his party do not support what Lord Laming says are necessary actions to keep children safe. On this basis, it is clear that the Conservative party does not support the body of recommendations to keep children safe that are in Lord Laming&#146;s report. There is no point in coming along with warm words. Lord Laming has produced a report. We are implementing his recommendations. The Conservative party does not support all the key central recommendations of the Laming report, and it is essential for public scrutiny that that point is laid clearly before us.</p>

 I think that I have made it absolutely clear that we do not support one of Lord Laming&#146;s central recommendations: that there should be a national safeguarding delivery unit. We have said that right from the beginning, so our position should not cause any shock or horror. We just think that that is the wrong way to go about things. Lord Laming does not say that ContactPoint is essential for child protection&#151;he has never said that. If the Secretary of State were to reread the Climbi&#233; report, he would find that Lord Laming does not say that ContactPoint is an essential component of child protection; Lord Laming is a supporter of ContactPoint for reasons other than the idea that it is an essential part of child protection.</p>

do so. The relevant point that I am trying to make on the three new clauses that we are discussing is that we risk adding to the bureaucracy that has been the biggest enemy of effective social work practice for too many years. We have to get that system right.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o151"><a name="90505-0010.htm_para0"><a name="0905059000167">We already have numerous performance indicators, to which these new clauses, in particular new clause 22, will add targets. One such indicator is that initial assessments for children&#146;s social care are to be carried out within seven working days of referral. That is a good proposal, but the trouble is that in practice what has happened in certain authorities is that in order to meet that performance indicator, certain departments have written an assessment that includes the name and address of the child only&#151;the rest of the assessment is blank, yet that counts as an assessment to meet the performance indicator. The Secretary of State seems to be shaking his head, but that is happening and it is not what he and I want to achieve. He and I do not want to achieve that target if in our doing so the target becomes meaningless.</p>

 That is exactly why Lord Laming proposes that all these targets be reviewed and we come forward with new statutory targets&#151;that is a central recommendation of the Laming review, which the Conservative party does not support. There is no point in the Conservatives coming along with warm words about their support for Lord Laming when it turns out that they do not support any of the key central recommendations, including those in respect of the provisions in this Bill. People will see the difference between the parties on the priority that they put on making the essential reforms to back social workers and make children safe.

 The Secretary of State does not make his point any clearer by simply repeating himself. What does not help us is his coming along today with new clauses in primary legislation that contain no detail. We are expected to pass a new clause that will impose new targets, on top of flawed performance indicators, without knowing the details. I am even more worried now, because he clearly has not been reading the report by the author whom he commissioned. If he were to do so, he would find out that this is additional bureaucracy, not replacement bureaucracy, in too many cases. I could go through a list of performance indicators, most of which he appears to be blissfully aware of; the important thing is that we should not have bland and vacuous targets, which could have unforeseen consequences, one of which I have mentioned.</p>

 In other words, the Secretary of State does not know whether there will be a target for the number of children taken into care. Presumably, he also does not know whether there will be a target for the number of children who have avoided being taken into care because of the preventive work done with the families.

If we are to be asked to give him wide-ranging additional powers to set targets&#151;which social workers at the sharp end tell us prevent them from doing their job, distort their job priorities and make them spend more time with their computers and paperwork than with the vulnerable families and children that they went into the profession to help&#151;it is reasonable for us to ask those questions at this stage. The Secretary of State has been unable to give us any details of a single target that is likely to be introduced under the new clause that he is asking the House to accept today, and that is very worrying.

 Surely it would depend on the nature of the people who were appointed.

If we put on strong-minded people who are capable of speaking up, surely they could be quite effective.

 The NSPCC has been mooted as a partner on the LSCBs. Other children&#146;s protection charities have an equal claim to be on the boards. I am in favour of lay members on the LSCBs, but I am trying to put into perspective the role that the Secretary of State expects them to achieve. We are trying to address the loss of authority that the LSCBs have suffered as a result of their role in Haringey and other local authorities where there have been tragedies such as that of baby Peter, which have resulted in the commissioning of serious case reviews that can then not be published&#151; 41 per cent. of which Ofsted has deemed to be unsatisfactory. We need to open up the LSCBs much more. It will probably take more than just the appointment of two laypersons among a cast of thousands to do that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o161"><a name="90505-0010.htm_para10"><a name="0905059000186">Absolutely key to opening up those local safeguarding children boards is the publication in full of serious case reviews&#151;a move of which the Secretary of State seems to have a pathological dislike. The body of evidence, and the amount of support, for such publication is growing. The publication of serious case reviews, duly anonymised and redacted, where it would not compromise the welfare of a surviving child or his or her siblings, would do more to give credibility to the work of those local safeguarding children boards, and to the idea that things are being looked at, investigated and rectified properly, than anything else. It would certainly do more than just the appointment of two lay members. I do not understand why the Government have an absolute, blinkered hatred for the idea.</p>

 I would ask the Secretary of State to withdraw the comment that he has just made. We do not oppose all the measures that the Government are taking to make children safe. We never have done, we certainly would not, and we are not doing so now. Perhaps he would like to withdraw that comment, because it does not do him any credit to suggest such a thing. Will he withdraw it?</p>

 We have had a litany of criticisms from the Conservative party of all the different recommendations in Lord Laming&#146;s report on the confidentiality of serious case reviews, on the national safeguarding unit, and on reporting to the Cabinet Sub-Committee. It is true to say that the hon. Gentleman seems to be supporting our proposal on lay members, but even then he is casting doubt on it. I have heard no support so far for the measures that we are taking in this debate, but if he would like to tell us which recommendations he supports, I will then withdraw.</p>

 The Secretary of State really does himself no credit. Some of us have worked for rather longer than he has been in the House on child protection measures post Victoria Climbi&#233;. We have supported every single piece of child protection legislation that his Government have introduced, but we did not do that by failing to question the efficacy of some of it. What we are doing today is questioning the efficacy of some of the legislative proposals for which he is seeking our support. I have made it absolutely clear to him that although I fully support Lord Laming&#146;s dedication and the passion, we just disagree with him on some&#151;not all&#151;of his recommendations, including some of the key ones which, we think, are absolutely flawed. Certainly, in the case of SCRs, the Secretary of State has not been able to tell us why he is against their publication&#151;he just cited Herbert Laming, with whom we disagree. His role is to scrutinise and question those people who give him advice, not blindly to accept everything.</p>

If that is what we have, and if the Secretary of State can show that it will improve qualitative outcomes rather than just add to the body of legislation, of which we have had rather a lot, we will support him. So far, he has not done anything. I support the new clause&#151; <i> [</i><i> Interruption.</i><i> ]</i> The Secretary of State is the one who has been playing politics, by making some very wild and unhelpful remarks, on the child protection issue. I have no problem with allowing lay members to be added to local safeguarding children boards&#151;I support that&#151;but what I am questioning is how much it will add in the greater scheme of things. There is one thing that he could do here and now: issue guidance about the full publication of serious case reviews, which would do much more to make those LSCBs fully transparent and accountable.</p>

There may be areas in which it is appropriate to try to put dividing lines between the Conservatives and Labour for political purposes, but may I put it to the Secretary of State that this is not one of them, and it brings us all into disrepute to pursue this? He should take the opportunity now to apologise.</p>

 Order. This debate is becoming somewhat fractious, and I suggest that although there is certainly reference to the serious case reviews in the new clauses, it is not just or entirely about that. There are many other aspects to the new clauses, and it may well be appropriate for us to move on and discuss them.</p>

 Absolutely, Madam Deputy Speaker. I was about to conclude, and I shall finish briefly with new clause 24, which requires LSCBs to produce an annual report. Again, I have no problem with that&#151;it is a good thing if it adds to transparency. But again, I would like to know from the Secretary of State what he thinks that will achieve. The publication of 150 brochures by LSCBs throughout the country&#151;what will that include and what is it intended to achieve?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o166"><a name="90505-0011.htm_para1"><a name="0905059000204">The exercise must be about restoring confidence in the child protection system. LSCBs are the guardians of the efficacy of the child protection system around the country, yet we are unable to see their full deliberations when that child protection system goes wrong, as has been shown by the debate that we have just had on the publication of serious case reviews. All I have tried to do is get some details about some very vague new clauses, which on the face of it give wide powers to the Secretary of State to add bureaucracy to the bureaucracy that already exists in the child protection system. I shall finish where I came in. I think that is the biggest enemy of social workers being able to get on with their job. We have been exceedingly supportive of social workers being able to get on with their job. We have made a series of recommendations through &#147;No More Blame Game&#148; and the submission that the commission on social workers made to the Laming inquiry in February, which is about peeling back the bureaucracy from social workers. My fear about the amendments is that unintentionally they may add to it. If the Government and the Secretary of State can show that they will add to the bureaucracy but that that will add to the quality of the outcomes, we will support them.</p>

boards to have regard to the need to implement the UNCRC when preparing children and young people&#146;s plans, and in our report we suggested an amendment to achieve this, which is the amendment that I tabled for today&#146;s debate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o176"><a name="90505-0011.htm_para11"><a name="09050519000016">This is, in effect, a more specific version of the duty that now appears in clause 1 of the Equality Bill. It requires the strategic decision-making authorities for children&#151;the children&#146;s trust boards&#151;to have regard to the need to implement the UNCRC when drawing up strategic plans for children. The UNCRC includes a duty to realise progressively various social and economic rights&#151;for example, the right to an adequate standard of living, access to health, education and so on&#151;as interpreted by the UN committee. Both the Committee on the Rights of the Child and the Committee on Economic and Social Rights want states to adopt strategic plans for the implementation of the rights, particularly the social and economic rights, in the UNCRC and in the international covenant on economic, social and cultural rights.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o177"><a name="90505-0011.htm_para12"><a name="09050519000017">The point of our amendment is to require the strategic decision-making authorities for children to have regard to the need to implement the UN convention, including by progressively realising their right to an adequate income and so on, when drawing up strategic children&#146;s plans. Like the Equality Bill clause 1 duty, it could be judicially reviewable if the children&#146;s trust board does not have regard to the UNCRC when drawing up its plans. This is a way of ensuring that the CRC, which protects children&#146;s social and economic rights, is more firmly embedded in strategic decision making about children. That is what the amendment seeks to achieve. It is regrettable that the Government have not accepted it so far, and I hope they will now reconsider, in the light of our amendment.</p>

On that occasion, my hon. Friend the Member for Yeovil (Mr. Laws) outlined most eloquently why we feel that its provisions are necessary. The new clause would introduce a statutory duty to ensure that the investigating or key worker saw the child separately from his or her parent or carer.</p>

However, it is vital that we think about what happened in two infamous cases. We know that nobody spoke to Victoria Climbi&#233;, yet she died in shocking conditions. We know also that baby Peter had his face smeared with chocolate to conceal the bruising and injuries to him. How can we&#151;anybody&#151;suggest that it is not important for a key worker to have time alone with a vulnerable child to talk to them, where appropriate, and to communicate with them in all sorts of ways? It is accepted that the child&#146;s views must be presented, but I suggest that we need to go one stage further: will we really be able to hold our heads up if we have yet another case in which a baby or young child is severely abused or even killed and the social worker has not had any meaningful and direct communication with them?</p>

Basically, she said that the requirement to see the child separately is already embedded in statutory guidance. Although the guidance, entitled &#147;Working Together to Safeguard Children&#148;, makes strong statements about the principle of listening to the child, about the parents&#146; needs being subordinate to the child&#146;s and so on, it does not require the key social worker to see the child separately from the parents and carers when visiting the home. One would like to think that, if a key worker visited a home and, time after time, was  <br>

told that the child was asleep or out, alarms would start to ring, and that is what the new clause is all about&#151;ensuring that the alarms ring.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o194"><a name="90505-0012.htm_para1"><a name="09050519000037">The guidance says that section 47&#151;of the Children Act 1989&#151;inquiries should include separate interviews with the child, but those interviews are conducted to discover whether suspicions of significant harm can be substantiated. A section 47 inquiry can run for several weeks, even if the time limits in &#147;Working Together&#148; are adhered to&#151;and in practice, not surprisingly, they may not be. The key worker will probably make a number of home visits during that period, having already conducted the separate interview with the child, as the guidance requires.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o195"><a name="90505-0012.htm_para2"><a name="09050519000038">Regularly seeing the child separately is about not just trying to detect the risk of harm, but developing the key worker&#146;s relationship with the child as the client and primary focus of attention. The only time Victoria Climbi&#233; was seen alone was in two awkward section 47 interviews, both of which failed to establish the truth. That issue was highlighted by Lord Laming in his post-Climbi&#233; report.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o196"><a name="90505-0012.htm_para3"><a name="09050519000039">Helpfully, the Minister stated that the Government are planning to revise &#147;Working Together&#148; and may include in the rewrite the issue of seeing the child separately. However, the matter should be put into statute because it is as central to effective child protection as information sharing, which is in statute. Furthermore, in many cases social workers appear to be neglecting to see the child separately. There are many&#151;often understandable&#151;reasons why that may happen, so social workers need a reminder that is more compelling than a new mention in a lengthy piece of guidance that covers many other issues.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o197"><a name="90505-0012.htm_para4"><a name="09050519000040">The Minister emphasised the powers that local authorities have at their disposal if parents refuse to give the social worker access to the child. That does not affect the need for new clause 20, however; the question of using the powers arises only if the social worker has been blocked from seeing the child separately, and that would not happen unless they had tried to see the child separately. I therefore contend that that new clause is more important than some that are being rushed through today. It would highlight to social workers the key priority of building a genuine relationship with the child, to get a whole understanding. We have all heard about the closeness of relationships that can develop between the parent, carer and social worker. The relationship that I am discussing is all-important. I hope that the Secretary of State will consider the issue.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o198"><a name="90505-0012.htm_para5"><a name="09050519000041">I turn briefly to the other amendments in this group. Personally, I support amendment 15. During consideration of almost all the children&#146;s Bills with which I have been involved, I have argued that the United Nations convention on the rights of the child should be embedded in legislation. It would be inconsistent of me not to support the amendment. The issue is so important. As a nation we have signed up to the convention, but we do not fully implement it.</p>

That is absolutely first class. I am sympathetic with the inclusion of some of the bodies mentioned in the amendment, including  <br>

<p><a name="stpa_o200"><a name="90505-0012.htm_para7"><a name="09050519000043">That looks like a bit of careless cutting and pasting. If the phrase had been expressed a little better, it might have fitted into an amendment on children&#146;s trust boards. When people criticise amendments that I have written, they usually suggest that they are technically deficient, so it gives me great pleasure to point out that I believe amendment 54 to be technically deficient.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o201"><a name="90505-0012.htm_para8"><a name="09050519000044">I turn to amendment 67; the Secretary of State will no doubt point out that it is technically deficient, as I wrote it. There are to be lots of players on the children&#146;s trust boards and everybody will have lots to say. However, where will the buck stop? I fear that there is no clarity on that in the Bill. The amendment suggests that the children&#146;s and young people&#146;s plan should have sections clearly identified as the responsibility of particular agencies. When there is a joint responsibility, I suggest that a lead agency should be nominated.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o202"><a name="90505-0012.htm_para9"><a name="09050519000045">I appreciate that the amendment may not express those ideas in the best way, but I really think that the legislation is deficient. It is not clear that, whatever happens, the director of children&#146;s services will be ultimately responsible. Why should they be? As far as I can see, they have only one seat on the board. As the legislation stands, why should it all come back to the director of children&#146;s services? The Government need to consider amendments that relate to that issue.</p>

 My comments on this cluster of amendments will focus primarily on the role and make-up of the local safeguarding children boards and the children&#146;s trust boards. In Committee, I mentioned one or two concerns specifically about consultation. I am not sure that I received any answers, so I hope that I will today. The Local Government Association has been keen to state the case for ongoing consultation within the role of children&#146;s trust boards. It recognises that it was consulted prior to the Bill&#146;s drafting, but it is concerned about ongoing consultation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o203"><a name="90505-0012.htm_para10"><a name="09050519000047">Local authorities will have responsibility for a range of commissioning arrangements and accountabilities across a number of aspects of planning and delivery. If local authorities are to fulfil their accountabilities effectively and ensure that young people get the best education, training and support, the Bill must contain provisions for explicit liaison and consultation between local authorities, the Secretary of State, the Young People&#146;s Learning Agency and the Skills Funding Agency, and for the avoidance of any micro-management.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o204"><a name="90505-0012.htm_para11"><a name="09050519000048">I hope that the Minister feels that that point has been reached. It is fair to say that the directors of children&#146;s services will be responsible for the setting up of children&#146;s trust boards. From that point of view, we can be clear that local authorities will have a key role as a consultative partner and in steering delivery. However, these new bodies have to be as democratically accountable as possible. New clause 23 will include lay members, and that is welcome. However, the ongoing inclusion of local authorities will also help.</p>

 I join other Members in paying tribute to Lord Laming and his enormous interest in and dedication to child protection. Only recently, he gave evidence to the Children, Schools and Families Committee, on which I sit. Even though he said that this would be his last report, it was clear that he remains committed to child protection. Only yesterday, he was commenting on the future of that issue when he said that social services still needed to act more quickly and decisively to protect youngsters on the at-risk register. He also said that</p>
<a name="90505-0012.htm_brev1"><a name="09050519000109"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Drift is the enemy of good practice&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o205"><a name="90505-0012.htm_para12"><a name="09050519000050">That tells us that Lord Laming, as he also made plain in his report, remains exasperated with the lack of progress since the Victoria Climbi&#233; case. Although that case ushered in a number of major reforms such as the child protection system, it failed to deal with the problem on the front line of child protection.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o206"><a name="90505-0012.htm_para13"><a name="09050519000051">Since that report, far too much time has been spent on organisational changes and not enough has been spent on the social work force, on whom we rely so heavily for the protection of vulnerable children. The service has remained underfunded, under-resourced and, unfortunately, unable to cope with the demands placed on it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o207"><a name="90505-0012.htm_para14"><a name="09050519000052">Although it is important that we try to find ways to improve the structure of our child protection system, I have concerns about new clause 22 and how we are going about those changes. The Secretary of State has put his weight behind the statutory targets as a way forward, but I share the view of my hon. Friend the Member for East Worthing and Shoreham (Tim Loughton). The Secretary of State supports the statutory targets, which he believes to be right to protect children, but unless we have some idea of what they may be, it is difficult, particularly for Conservative Members, to fall in step with the new clause.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o208"><a name="90505-0012.htm_para15"><a name="09050519000053">Although my instinct is that targets will not necessarily solve the problem, we can see that some would be beneficial to the child protection system&#151;for instance, on the quality and consistency of social work care, the timeliness of protective measures for vulnerable children and, most importantly, the outcomes for children who have some contact with the child protection system. If we are to have targets, those are the sort that I would have expected the Secretary of State to mention in response to my hon. Friend.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o209"><a name="90505-0012.htm_para16"><a name="09050519000054">Another difficulty is to do with the training, recruitment and retention of social workers. In some local authorities, almost 50 per cent. of front-line child protection staff have less than two years&#146; experience in their job. I have seen that for myself in the work that I have done in the family courts representing local authorities, children and their parents. On far too regular a basis, a social worker, or even a team manager, working for the local authority has made the application to take a child into care but their experience is woefully short for the extreme complexity of the case that is facing them. That is not their fault: it is the fault of all of us in failing to ensure that measures to improve the status of social workers, to invest in the social work profession and to train social workers better have come to fruition.</p>

that we received in the Select Committee, I conducted a survey of 79 universities around the country and found that although they believed that placements, where they are provided&#151;by local authorities, in the main&#151;are generally good, there is a chronic shortage of training places and that, in a minority of cases, some social workers go through their entire training without ever being supervised by a trained social worker. The Secretary of State needs to do something about that.</p>

<p><a name="st_o208"><a name="09050519000056"><a name="90505-0012.htm_spnew3"><a name="09050519000127"><b>Mr. Timpson:</b>
 I am grateful to my hon. Friend, who makes the case clearly. Unless we ensure that social workers have not only sufficient training but experience through their training and the work that they do on the front line, they will not be able to do the job that we are asking them to do, which is one of extreme importance in our society&#151;the protection of our children. We need to ensure that training is at the forefront of our minds when we look at what we are asking social workers to do.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o210"><a name="90505-0012.htm_para17"><a name="09050519000057">One of the remaining problems that the new clause does not address fully, as the hon. Member for Mid-Dorset and North Poole (Annette Brooke) eloquently told us, is that, although the introduction of children&#146;s trusts was a commendable idea in trying to involve the whole community in dealing with child protection and to ensure that there is an exchange of information about issues that that community faces, it has not&#151;as the Audit Commission said in its report, &#147;Are we there yet?&#148;&#151;resulted in an improvement in child protection. That goes back to the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for East Worthing and Shoreham about bureaucracy. One of the reasons why children&#146;s trusts have failed to make the impact that we hoped for is that the complex bureaucratic systems that have been set up to control child protection engender a culture of trying to comply with the bureaucracy and targets, instead of helping social workers and those involved in child protection to see the wood from the trees and to commit to children&#146;s needs, as they are supposed to.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o211"><a name="90505-0012.htm_para18"><a name="09050519000058">I hope that the targets that the Secretary of State is asking social workers to comply with do not exacerbate the situation that they already face, and that they will be allowed to be free to get on with the job that we all want them to do&#151;spending time looking after children to ensure that they are safe and have a happy and prosperous future. That should be achieved through good practice and a universally sound and robust child protection system that protects all our children, not just some of them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o212"><a name="90505-0012.htm_para19"><a name="09050519000059">I want briefly to mention new clause 23 and put in a plea to the Secretary of State. Although it has been drafted quite widely as regards who could be the lay representatives on trust boards, those who are involved in foster care, particularly foster carers themselves, could play an important role in ensuring that their views and experience, which are often left to one side, are taken seriously and make a positive contribution to child protection in their community.</p>

knew him well; he is a very good man. He said that, in the past 30 years, there has been very little change in the rate of deaths of children who have been abused. That is an appalling record bearing in mind that we have moved on in so many ways. He said that if things do not change radically, we will have the same death rates over the next 30 years as well. That must not be allowed to happen. I hope that the changes that my hon. Friends on the Front Bench propose&#151;and that we will, I hope, support&#151;will make a real difference.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o213"><a name="90505-0012.htm_para20"><a name="09050519000061">Another worrying factor is that these days in social services in general, and in the health service, there is so much emphasis on budgeting, with officers being rewarded for running a tight ship financially. One wonders whether that underlies some of the problems that have arisen. In the baby P case, it was also apparent that nobody wanted to take final responsibility. The local authority, social services and the police were involved, and the national health service saw the injuries to the child on a number of occasions, yet it seemed that no one wanted to say, &#147;This child must not be allowed to go back home, where it is clearly being abused.&#148; I do not want to prejudice any statement that may come out at a later stage, but that is appalling. If I had been in that situation, I would simply have said, &#147;This child must not go back into that home; it is clearly being abused.&#148;</p>

Another worrying aspect that emerged from the programme&#151;I think that finance was a factor in this respect too&#151;is the so-called optimistic future strategy: the idea that people should hope that somehow the family could look after the child in future and look forward to that instead of looking at what was happening in the present. Focusing on a point in the future meant that what was happening to the child at the time was missed or, indeed, ignored. I am concerned that that strategy is yet another attempt to disguise what people are really about, which is trying to keep the child in the family to avoid the expense of taking it into care. The pressures on local authorities not to do that must be financial at root. In future, whatever happens, we should provide the resources to ensure that children are not kept in dangerous families when they should be taken into care. I hope that my remarks have been helpful to my right hon. and hon. Friends on the Front Bench.</p>

With that in mind, and because of my determination to have ready this year, if at all possible, a revision of &#147;Working Together&#148;, the guidance for all areas on safeguarding, I went to Opposition Members a week or so ago to ask their permission to introduce these new clauses at this stage. I am pleased to say that the hon. Member for Yeovil (Mr. Laws) gave his, subject to agreement that there would be further discussion on the contents of the targets in new clause 22. I commit to those discussions happening in future. I was pleased also to have the agreement of the hon. Member for Surrey Heath (Michael Gove) to the introduction of the new clauses, which was confirmed to my office. Because these issues are vital, I hope, as I always have, that we can move forward consensually.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o216"><a name="90505-0012.htm_para23"><a name="09050519000067">I shall come to the points made about new clauses 22, 23 and 24 at the end of my comments, but first I shall respond to the detailed points made by Members of all parties about the other amendments. On new clause 29, we are absolutely committed to independence in the chairing of local safeguarding children boards. There has been debate about Lord Laming&#146;s consultation process, because there are some concerns in the children&#146;s world about whether we will have independent people of sufficient quality. We believe, as Lord Laming does, that that concern can be overcome. There will therefore be full independence. I believe that that needs to be independence from all agencies involved in safeguarding children, but we are not putting that in primary legislation because we believe that statutory guidance will provide more flexibility. It will give some areas time to find the type of high-quality, trained, independent person we will need. On that basis, and with our clear commitment to independence, I hope that the hon. Member for Mid-Dorset and North Poole will not press the new clause.</p>

We believe that current legislation makes clear the need for accountability in the role of director of children&#146;s services, and the Bill will make it clear in the case of children&#146;s trust boards. It will also make clear the importance of the children and young people&#146;s plan being owned by all agencies in a children&#146;s trust. The new targets will be duties on the local authority, but they will be owned by the whole trust. It is important that the individual agencies that are part of a trust are also accountable individually for playing their proper role in it. That is why we do not believe that we need to change legislation in the way suggested in amendment 67. The way in which we have designed the responsibility for the plan within children&#146;s trusts meets the hon. Lady&#146;s concerns. We will ensure that the regulations under section 17 of the 2004 Act about how that plan is drawn up make it clear where the responsibility for individual actions should lie. We will be able to discuss that with her in the coming months.</p>

Our belief is that, aside from the odd drafting issue about the exact role of the key worker, which we do not need to go into today, the existing statutory law and guidance in the Children Acts 1989 and 2004 achieves the objectives that she sets out. The statutory guidance is clear that section 47 of the 1989 Act should always involve a social worker undertaking separate interviews with the child wherever appropriate. It is also clear that seeing the child alone is not enough, and that the child must be observed interacting with their family and, if appropriate, with other adults or care givers. We will revise that statutory guidance later in the year to make it absolutely clear that if at any point the parents refuse to allow the child to be seen alone, the local authority has powers under that Act to apply for an emergency protection order to require parents to comply with any request to produce the child. The Act authorises the removal of a child in those circumstances if necessary. Current statute therefore provides the powers that the hon. Lady seeks in the new clause.</p>

We believe that in the Bill, and more generally through the children&#146;s plan, we are meeting our obligations under the convention on the rights of the child. We appreciate the scrutiny and proposals of the Joint Committee. I would not want a piecemeal approach that applied the convention to children&#146;s trusts differently from the way in which we approach the obligations of schools, local safeguarding children boards, children&#146;s centres and GPs. We need wider discussion on the Green Paper on rights and responsibilities, which is coming up shortly, but I do not believe that pursuing the amendment would be the right thing to do at the moment.</p>

It proposes that a series of groups should join, the first of which is short stay schools. Such schools have a management committee, which takes on some accountability and responsibility separate from that of the local authority, and I am happy to repeat the commitment made by the Under-Secretary of State for Children, Schools and Families, my hon. Friend the Member for Portsmouth, North (Sarah McCarthy-Fry), that we will add the management committee of short stay schools to the list of relevant partners in the guidance that is coming shortly.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o221"><a name="90505-0013.htm_para3"><a name="09050519000072">Sure Start children&#146;s centres do not have governance arrangements separate from the local authority, like those of a school. They are more places where a range of services are brought together. We therefore think it more appropriate for the local authority to be the representative body on the children&#146;s trust rather than individual Sure Start children&#146;s centres. In the case of extended schools, the situation depends on how the private and voluntary sectors and schools provide the services in question. It would be hard to define which body other than the local authority should represent extended services on a children&#146;s trust.</p>

Our view, and that of the Secretary of State for Health, is that extending the duty to co-operate to GPs at this stage would weaken rather than strengthen our ability to ensure health engagement. The primary care trust, as commissioner, should play that role. I hope that I have covered the points that have been made about Opposition new clauses and amendments, so I shall return to the new clauses that I have tabled.</p>

 May I take the Secretary of State back to the survey that I conducted recently on social care placements? The good news is that 86 per cent. of the universities that I surveyed thought that placements were good or excellent. The bad news is that only 24 per cent. thought that they were sufficient in number. They attributed that to a lack of reward for social workers and local authorities for taking on placements and, critically, to the fact that the Government have stopped making it necessary for local authorities to report how many placements they provide. May I ask the Secretary of State to respond to those points?</p>

 I am not sure whether that quite fits into the new clauses and amendments that we are debating, but in our statement a few weeks ago we said clearly that we accepted Lord Laming&#146;s recommendations. Tomorrow we will give some more detail&#151;not new policy&#151;about how we will take them forward. The reform of social worker training is being considered by the social work taskforce, and I have made clear commitments about it. If the hon. Gentleman writes to me, I will ensure that his survey of placements goes into the taskforce&#146;s work. I thank him very much for his contribution to the debate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o223"><a name="90505-0013.htm_para5"><a name="09050519000076">I turn to new clause 22. Lord Laming recommended that the Government should</p>

The National Indicator Set should be revised with new national indicators for safeguarding and child protection developed for inclusion in Local Area Agreements&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o224"><a name="90505-0013.htm_para6"><a name="09050519000077">We are taking powers in the Bill to meet that recommendation. We shall not bring forward any detailed proposals on new statutory targets or which indicators should change until we have had much greater and lengthier consultation with local authorities, social workers and the social work taskforce. I am happy to consult Members of all parties as part of those discussions. However, if we did not take the power set out in new clause 22, we would have to postpone taking that action for many months and also postpone our revisions to &#147;Working Together&#148;. That is why we have decided to bring forward the enabling power now, but it must be followed by debate, consultation and secondary legislation, which will follow in the autumn.</p>

important task. For me to come along today and give details of what the end point will be before we have even had those consultations would be wrong. We want to deliver Lord Laming&#146;s report on such matters, and the enabling power allows us to do so in due course.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o226"><a name="90505-0013.htm_para8"><a name="09050519000079">The same goes for the role of lay members. The opening up of safeguarding children boards is vital. The power gives us the ability to consult over the next six to nine months on the revisions to &#147;Working Together&#148;, which will include much more detail about how we encourage, bring in, reward and support lay members. Again, the power enables us to take that forward this year, rather than postponing it for perhaps 18 months or longer. As part of openness and transparency, the power in Government new clause 24 for the safeguarding children board to issue an annual report to the children&#146;s trust will be welcomed by experts and professionals, as well as by the wider public, as it will allow them to scrutinise what is being done in their local areas.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o227"><a name="90505-0013.htm_para9"><a name="09050519000080">As I have said, I am keen to move forward consultatively and consensually, as far as possible. I do not want to dwell for too long on the final points that I have to make, but I want to clear up a couple of confusions. On ContactPoint, Lord Laming said in his report:</p>
<a name="90505-0013.htm_brev1"><a name="09050519000111"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;The new ContactPoint system will have particular advantages in reducing the possibility of children for whom there are concerns going unnoticed.&#148;</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o229"><a name="90505-0013.htm_para11"><a name="09050519000082">Similarly, Lord Laming is clear in his recommendations about the importance of keeping serious case reviews confidential. He said in his letter to me&#151;and repeated in his report&#151;that</p>
<a name="90505-0013.htm_brev2"><a name="09050519000112"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;there must be produced an Executive Summary for publication that in every respect is a fair summary of the report. However, and I attach great importance to this point, the main report must remain confidential not only to protect vulnerable people, especially the children, but also because all Serious Case Reviews depend upon the willing cooperation of important witnesses often in a highly charged situation.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o230"><a name="90505-0013.htm_para12"><a name="09050519000083">The deputy Children&#146;s Commissioner wrote to me on 3 February to say:</p>

I believe that a confidential process which enables agencies to thoroughly and effectively examine all relevant facts is crucial to securing this goal, supported by a comprehensive executive summary which makes public the key issues and recommendations for change.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o231"><a name="90505-0013.htm_para13"><a name="09050519000084">On 15 March, the NSPCC said in a statement that full reports should not be made public, as sensitive information must be kept confidential to protect vulnerable children, but that local safeguarding children boards must publish comprehensive summaries of serious case reviews. I agree. I also agree with Birmingham city council, which also made its position absolutely clear.</p>

 Before the Secretary of State moves on, can he point out to me where Lord Laming says that the primary purpose of ContactPoint is child protection? That is not what he has said, but it is what the Secretary of State asserted. Also, can he tell me why he has not given the same reasons for being against the full publication of mental health reports in homicide cases as he is now applying to serious case reviews? Why are the two different?</p>

 Well, I did take rather a lot of interventions from the Secretary of State. He has not answered my question. Lord Laming sees ContactPoint and the database that was envisaged in the Children Act 2004 as a way of keeping track of children who fall out of the education, health or other systems. He has never asserted that its primary objective is child protection, and the quotation that the Secretary of State has given from his report does not say that.</p>

FE colleges play a crucial role in delivering apprenticeships, and their facilities and resources are central to that purpose. A fundamental part of any apprenticeship framework is the training provided off site, which frequently takes place at an FE college. The 361 FE colleges in England  <br>

do an incredibly important job. It is perhaps appropriate at this point to pay tribute to them and to the people who work in them because they make such a big difference to so many lives. They educate and train more than 3 million young and older learners each year, including about 750,000 16 to 18-year-olds. That is more than school sixth forms, private schools and training providers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o243"><a name="90505-0014.htm_para1"><a name="09050547000011">The new clauses are relevant to the transfer of responsibilities resulting from the division of the Learning and Skills Council into three new bodies: the Skills Funding Agency, the Young People&#146;s Learning Agency and the National Apprenticeship Service. Some people have described the Bill as a &#147;bureaucratic muddle&#148;. The British Chambers of Commerce made that very remark during the witness sessions that we enjoyed before the Committee stage of the Bill. Others have described it as &#147;opaque&#148;, &#147;obtuse&#148;, &#147;obscure&#148; and a &#147;missed opportunity&#148;. These new clauses attempt to go some way towards improving a very imperfect product.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o244"><a name="90505-0014.htm_para2"><a name="09050547000012">New clause 1 would place a duty on the Secretary of State to commission a report on the FE college buildings and facilities that are so vital to delivering the training necessary to build the skills that we need. New clause 11 would place a duty on the chief executive of Skills Funding to provide a report on the progress of applications by FE colleges for capital projects.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o245"><a name="90505-0014.htm_para3"><a name="09050547000013">The reasons for the new clauses have become all too clear recently as a result of the gross mismanagement of the FE capital programme. I do not entirely blame the Under-Secretary of State for Innovation, Universities and Skills, the hon. Member for Birmingham, Erdington (Mr. Simon), for that. I still regard him as a young man of promise, although many in the House regard him as merely a young man of promises. As he knows, I have defended him, on the Floor of the House and elsewhere, against some of the assaults that have been made on him from all quarters, not least the FE sector itself when it found it was facing disappointment and disillusion resulting from the freeze on FE capital projects.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o246"><a name="90505-0014.htm_para4"><a name="09050547000014">After many months of uncertainty, the Government announced in March that they would be freezing the approval process for 144 college building projects. Seventy-nine of the frozen colleges had already received agreement in principle and were awaiting approval in detail, which is the final stage of the approval process. To be considered for approval in detail, the colleges would already have had to secure planning permission and put together a full project brief. That involves not only the college staff but many other agencies, including those involved in designing the buildings, putting together the necessary infrastructure plans and project managing the process. Many others have been affected detrimentally by this cruel freeze. The colleges have therefore incurred considerable costs in order to reach that stage of development.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o247"><a name="90505-0014.htm_para5"><a name="09050547000015">The other 65 frozen colleges are waiting for approval in principle. Some have already assembled a project team and put money towards preparing their bid. In my area, Boston college is in just that situation. It provides an outstanding service to many young people and adults from my constituency. In the areas neighbouring my constituency on the south side, Peterborough regional college and Stamford college are also both affected by the freeze. The new clauses would go some way towards  <br>

 My hon. Friend knows of the anger that exists in places such as Hull and Beverley as a result of what is happening to our FE colleges. Unemployment is rising fast in Hull and the surrounding area; I think that it has doubled in the East Riding in the past two years. The colleges there could have made more modest investments if they had been guided to do so, but Ministers allowed their expectations to be raised beyond the finances that were available. Hull college, which does not have permission in principle, is therefore just sitting and waiting, and two years on from getting approval in principle, the East Riding college in Beverley is sitting there&#151;with the centre of Beverley looking like a bomb site at the moment&#151;not knowing whether it will be able to proceed.</p>

 I will not give way again until I have made a little progress. As well as that commitment, I hope we have extracted an ongoing commitment that, as new cases emerge, they will be dealt with appropriately. I say to the Minister, and I do not say it lightly, that many of the colleges at a much earlier stage of the process have well-established bids. A number of colleges with which we have been in discussions as a result of their fears about these matters have made it clear that although they have not secured approval in principle&#151;still less approval in detail&#151;they have been planning a capital project for a very considerable time with the knowledge, approval and encouragement of the Learning and Skills Council. If the Minister has a better idea of the scale here&#151;both the breadth and depth of his problem&#151;and is prepared to underwrite the necessary capital commitment here and now, I will happily give way to him again.

 We have heard that once already, Mr. Deputy Speaker. What I was actually asking the Minister for was a further assurance that those colleges that have gone a long way down the road towards putting capital bids and projects together will receive the sort of support they need. If these new clauses were in place and the Government had agreed to their addition to the Bill, we would not, frankly, be in the present position with me having to extract these promises from the Minister, because a report would have been made in good time, anticipating much of the problem that we are now dealing with.

 I have to explain to the hon. Gentleman that he has not &#147;extracted&#148; anything, as all this information is clearly on the record. The problem is that there is a greater expectation of funding out there than can possibly be met. We obviously cannot commit to funding the unfundable commitments of the LSC; what we have committed to, however, is that no college will go bust as a result of the LSC&#146;s mismanagement.</p>

 We will talk a little bit more about how the Government prioritise funding and how they intend to allocate the money that has been announced. I repeat for the benefit of the House&#151;and, in particular, for the Minister&#151;that many projects that have not received agreement in principle, still less in detail, despite being well worked up, critically important in a regenerative sense to the community and having received encouragement, advice and guidance from the LSC, will not, I suspect, receive any degree of Government help now. That is because they do not fall into the category that the Minister will conveniently identify as deserving cases. I simply do not buy the idea that the Government will get the criteria or the support right or that they will not disappoint a very large number of colleges and learners up and down the country.</p>

 I am extremely grateful to my hon. Friend and I welcome the Minister&#146;s apology to the House today. Does my hon.

 I cannot really answer that in my all too brief contribution. I know that Members will want me to go on and on and on, but the House will understand that others may wish to speak. That point does matter, however, particularly in respect of the new clauses that I am supporting, to which I shall now turn my attention in more detail.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o249"><a name="90505-0014.htm_para7"><a name="09050547000041">If the new clauses formed part of this Bill, we would know, for example, how much money had been committed in preparing capital bids. The Association of Colleges estimates that colleges have incurred costs of &#163;170 million in planning capital bids&#151;and that is just the colleges we know about. As I have already said, many have fallen between the cracks, as it were. Some &#163;300 million was announced in the budget for FE capital funding, but that is not nearly enough to fund the projects that are now in limbo. We are yet to have clarity from the Government about the criteria that will determine which projects go forward. It is clear that where colleges were in the approval process tells us only so much; we need a much fuller picture of the economic value of individual projects, how far advanced in practice they are and how much colleges and other bodies stand to lose if their bid is not approved.</p>

It is a crisis entirely of the Government&#146;s own making. The Government commissioned Sir Andrew Foster, a distinguished commentator, writer and thinker on these subjects, to write a review. It was he, after all who, at the behest of the Government, wrote &#147;Realising the Potential: A Review of the Future of Further Education Colleges&#148; in 2005. Sir Andrew Foster concluded that</p>

 Order. I want to assure the hon.

 I am grateful, as ever, for your guidance, Mr. Deputy Speaker, and I can assure you that I had noticed the new clauses. Indeed, they are highly pertinent to the exchanges taking place across the Chamber because they tie Ministers to an empirical assessment of where bids are, where they have come from and how much they are going to cost. That contrasts with what has happened over recent weeks and months, where the link between Ministers and those things has been opaque, obscure and obtuse. That is simply not good enough.</p>

Under the Bill, it will be abolished and replaced, as I said, with three quangos. Perhaps it is not surprising that the LSC took its eye off the ball. The Government are, of course, now keen to attribute blame to the LSC; we hold no candle for that body, but because legislation of the kind we propose in the new clauses was not in place, it is perhaps not surprising that Ministers lost control, were unable to anticipate these matters and were unaware of some of the facts.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o256"><a name="90505-0014.htm_para14"><a name="09050547000050">Indeed, Ministers now claim that they did not know what was going on. They must claim that, must they not? If they did know what was going on, they would take full responsibility rather than partial responsibility for the mess we are in. The projection of costs seems to me to be a pretty fundamental part of managing capital budgets. How can we possibly not know how much we have planned to spend against how much we have got&#151;surely this is bread-and-butter stuff? To be told, in the Minister&#146;s words, that the Government could not possibly meet the ambitions of colleges is extraordinary when those ambitions were fuelled and fostered by the very body charged with that purpose&#151;a body that was, in the end, answerable to Ministers.</p>

large investments that, clearly, the Government now are not in a position to make available. However, it is not entirely true that Ministers knew nothing until very recently, because an examination of the LSC minutes makes it perfectly clear that, as early as February 2008, doubts were raised about the capital funding of FE colleges.

One such college is Star college, which works with adult disabled people. I have visited Star college. It is in the Cotswolds and has been mentioned on several occasions by my hon.

Friend the Member for Brent, East (Sarah Teather) tells me that the bid made by the college of North West London in her constituency is essential for the regeneration of Wembley. My hon. Friend the Member for Colchester (Bob Russell) has two such colleges in his constituency&#151;Colchester institute and Colchester sixth-form college&#151;and I should also refer to Plumpton college, in the constituency of my hon.

It appears from the letter sent by the Secretary of State for Innovation, Universities and Skills to vice-chancellors and college principals on 22 April that, as well as the &#163;300 million for the current financial year, 2009-10, there will be a planning assumption of a further &#163;300 million a year from 2011-12 to 2013-14. That totals &#163;1.2 billion and rather implies that the capital budget for 2010-11, which is the next financial year&#151;I know that I am mentioning many years&#151;has been raided to bail the Government out in this financial year. Perhaps the Under-Secretary will confirm whether that is the case, because the &#163;1.2 billion over five years clearly does not correspond to &#163;300 million for each year. One year must be missing, and it appears to be 2010-11, which of course is the year straight after the next general election.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman has put his finger on an important point. In many areas, the Government appear to have adopted a scorched-earth policy. They are raiding future budgets in order to bolster their current popularity as they approach a general election which, as they are increasingly aware, they are likely to lose.</p>

<p><a name="st_o254"><a name="09050547000067"><a name="90505-0015.htm_spnew4"><a name="09050547000737"><b>Stephen Williams:</b>
 That is an excellent point. It is indeed a political scorched-earth policy. Not only are the Government producing money from budgets allocated for the period after April 2010, but many tax rises are due to be introduced immediately after the next general election.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o269"><a name="90505-0015.htm_para9"><a name="09050547000068">When the Minister replies, he should bear in mind that what the sector needs is more certainty about how the extra &#163;300 million for the current financial year will be spent. A rationing exercise will clearly be necessary. Not all the bids currently lodged with the LSC can possibly be funded from that &#163;300 million. Many bidders, indeed most, will miss out, and the sooner they know that, the better. All of them will have incurred bidding costs and planning fees, and will have commissioned architects to help them to draw up their proposals and submit them to the LSC&#146;s capital board.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o270"><a name="90505-0015.htm_para10"><a name="09050547000069">Following a survey of its membership, the Association of Colleges calculated that 30 of its colleges had spent at least a quarter of a million pounds on bids, and 18 had spent more than &#163;5 million. All that expenditure may be in vain if the capital programme does not go ahead. Many of the bidders will want to know whether their costs will be met by the LSC. The irony is that those costs, not only for the colleges at either end of the range but for the 100 or so in between, will probably be close to the &#163;300 million allocated in the budget. There is an urgent need for an assessment of what is required by the further education sector&#151;which is the purpose of the new clauses&#151;and for clarity from the Government on the funding criteria that they will apply in future, through the LSC.</p>

Member for South Holland and The Deepings began by observing that further education was crucial to our economy, and I shall end my speech in much the same way. The FE college system is essential to helping people to negotiate their way through the current recession, and even more essential to ensuring that we emerge from the other side of it with a world-class, well-skilled work force. We must meet not only the industrial demands that we will face in the future, but the demands of climate change. We shall need skilled engineers to meet the 2020 targets on which consensus has been reached. There is no point in setting such targets if we do not have the engineers and technicians to meet them. The FE sector has a crucial role in bringing those skills to the workplace and the design board, and it deserves rather better than the ineptitude that it has suffered from the Government so far.</p>

 I want to highlight the problems that the freezing of the college building programme has caused on the Isle of Wight, although I believe that there should be regulated annual audits in all areas to establish what capital is spent.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o272"><a name="90505-0015.htm_para12"><a name="09050547000072">The Isle of Wight College is the only further education institution on the island. For many islanders, it represents the only opportunity to receive further education before entering the workplace. Employers value colleges as a source of training, especially during a recession. As the island has relatively high unemployment, taking a college course can make a real difference to someone&#146;s prospects, but all that is now in jeopardy. The freezing of funds promised to the council has not only indefinitely delayed vital renovation work, but cost the college more than &#163;2.3 million in development fees alone. It would have cost a great deal more had the college not benefited from the common sense and prudence of its principal, Debbie Lavin&#151;common sense and prudence that the Government and the LSC evidently lack.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o273"><a name="90505-0015.htm_para13"><a name="09050547000073">The Government are guilty on a number of fronts. There is evidence that the Department for Innovation, Universities and Skills and the LSC knew about a possible overspend as early as February 2008. Mrs. Lavin says that the college was encouraged to continue with the building project until as late as December 2008. DIUS and the LSC were too slow to respond, having had a good eight or 10 months in which to flag up a problem. During that period, colleges&#151;blissfully unaware of the impending crisis, and egged on by the national LSC&#151;spent money, made plans and, in some cases, tore down old facilities. Fortunately, that did not happen on the Isle of Wight. If the colleges had known then what the LSC and DIUS knew back in April&#151;or February&#151;2008, they would not have been so hasty. DIUS Ministers and the LSC should not have encouraged colleges to go ahead if they did not have the money to see the projects through. Colleges throughout the country are now paying the price for the delay. Temporary cabins are being hired in which to teach students, and fees for retaining contractors and professional advisers continue to be paid.</p>

As part of the capital investment programme, almost all further education colleges&#151;some 98 per cent.&#151;are already participating in an existing property benchmarking programme called eMandate overseen by the LSC, and that programme will continue under the chief executive of skills funding.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o279"><a name="90505-0015.htm_para19"><a name="09050547000083">The eMandate programme captures data on an annual basis from all participating colleges in the FE sector. Those data include information on the quality of their estate and their estate management costs. Participation in the eMandate programme is open to all FE colleges and is compulsory for any college that wants to apply for public capital funding for building. We simply do not need the kind of stocktake described in new clause 1, because precisely that process already exists, and because nobody has suggested that a lack of that kind of information caused the problems with the FE capital programme.</p>

 So the hon. Gentleman is saying that, in almost all cases, we know the state of college buildings, yet there was no relationship between that information&#151;which presumably came to the Department and Ministers&#151;and the business of encouraging capital bids. That is inconceivable, is it not?</p>

 It is not inconceivable at all. The problems with the colleges were to do with financial management, not with a lack of information about the state of the estate, or with the quality or the cost management of the builds themselves. The Foster report came to the explicit and clear conclusion that this was a good policy let down by poor implementation, and the manner of that implementation was not at all of the sort described&#151;or apparently rectified&#151;by new clause 1.</p>

 I simply do not understand that reply. Surely there should have been a needs-based assessment of what needed to happen to the buildings in the FE sector. How else could anyone properly approach this? Without that, it is not possible to assign priorities or to ensure that there is the most prudent use of public money. That is what perhaps most irritates my constituents. They realise that the Government have simply wasted millions of pounds on unnecessary projects, and that now tens of millions of pounds will be wasted on consultants&#146; fees for projects that will never proceed.</p>

 As the hon. Gentleman said, one of the key conclusions of the Foster report is that the programme should have been much more needs-based, and it is clear that it must be more needs-based in future. The reason why it was not needs-based was not because good information did not exist about the state of the FE estate; that information was being collected. The problem was that it was not used effectively. New clause 1  <br>

 It seems to me that that form of methodology applied to that level of spend is a strategic issue.

 I shall move on to new clause 11. The new clause also raises the question of parliamentary scrutiny, but it is also superfluous because its measures already exist in the Bill. Paragraph 7 of schedule 4 requires the chief executive of Skills Funding to publish an annual report and accounts covering expenditure on all areas, including capital. That report will be laid before Parliament. I hope that that, together with the commitment of my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State to return to the House with a statement in due course, will give Members some reassurance about the level of parliamentary scrutiny. If the hon. Member for South Holland and The Deepings (Mr. Hayes) wants to have a debate in Government time, he will, as he knows, need to come back on a Thursday and talk to the Leader of the House rather than me&#151;my pay grade is considerably beneath considering such matters.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o281"><a name="90505-0016.htm_para0"><a name="09050547000093">Let me turn to the general points that Members have made. The hon. Members for South Holland and The Deepings and for Bristol, West (Stephen Williams) raised the question of colleges that have not received, but have applied for, approval in principle. There are currently 79 colleges that have received approval in principle and 65 that have applied for it and have not received it. The points they make about the great amount of work&#151;and potentially of expenditure, as well as of investment of time and energy&#151;that will have gone into reaching the stage of submitting the application, which is itself a huge, thick pile of documents, are very well understood. We have been very clear in our discussions with the new  <br>

leadership of the LSC that the colleges in that position will be treated broadly in a single pool with the colleges that have already received approval in principle. All of them will be deemed to have a difficulty which the LSC, under its new leadership, needs to help them to deal with.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o282"><a name="90505-0016.htm_para1"><a name="09050547000094">Several Members&#151;the hon. Members for Bristol, West and for Isle of Wight come to mind&#151;mentioned the &#163;300 million of new cash that was announced in this financial year to enable us to put through some of the most urgent and high-priority cases. The hon. Member for Isle of Wight said that it glossed over the entire issue&#151;I believe that the rich phrase he used was that it was a &#147;sticking plaster on a disembowelment&#148;&#151;whereas the hon. Member for Bristol, West said that it was a political scorched-earth policy. Naturally, I cannot accept any of those colourful descriptions. None the less I am clear about the fact that &#163;300 million will not solve this problem, whose magnitude is much greater. I am not attempting to gloss over the entire issue, and I do not pretend to have solved the problem or put the matter to bed with &#163;300 million. What the &#163;300 million will enable us to do is to put forward, this year, in decisions that will be made in a few weeks&#146; time&#151;in the early summer&#151;the most urgent and high-priority cases across the country. That will still leave many colleges needing certainty and clarity about their future.</p>

<p><a name="st_o268"><a name="09050547000095"><a name="90505-0016.htm_spnew0"><a name="09050547000751"><b>Mr. Hayes:</b>
 Interestingly, the Minister, at last, gives us some detail about this matter, for which I am grateful. We should have been given more detail sooner, but I understand the reasons why he has not been in a position to do that; as he says, this is not at his pay grade level. Will he tell us whether those high-priority cases will be drawn from colleges that have already received agreement in principle and colleges that are at an earlier stage of development? If not, what criteria will be used?</p>

<p><a name="st_o269"><a name="09050547000096"><a name="90505-0016.htm_spnew1"><a name="09050547000752"><b>Mr. Simon:</b>
 As ever in this evening&#146;s debate, the hon. Gentleman congratulates himself on having extracted from me something that has been clear and on the record for weeks, if not months, and that I have said dozens, if not hundreds, of times. As I just said, the colleges that have received approval in principle and those that have applied for it but not necessarily received it will all be viewed in the same group when consideration is given to both the urgent and high-priority funding and the later down the line funding. It is probable that colleges that have applied earlier and secured approval in principle are more likely to be further down the road, and I would be surprised if more of them were not more urgent and high-priority immediate cases when compared with those that have yet to receive approval in principle. However, it is clear, and has been for some time, that both those categories will be eligible to be considered for the urgent and high-priority immediate funding, and to go into the second pool of cases that will go through the same process of prioritisation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o283"><a name="90505-0016.htm_para2"><a name="09050547000097">As for how those priorities were drawn up, as I am sure the hon. Gentleman knows&#151;I am loth to say this, because I know that he will intervene in any moment to rejoice at having dragged this out of me, although it has also been clear for some time&#151;the LSC, in partnership with the Association of Colleges, set up a reference panel and, between them, they have agreed, or are in the  <br>

process of finalising within the next week or two, a set of criteria and processes that are to be open and transparent, and that I hope the whole sector can buy into, by which the prioritisations will be decided. The first criteria will be readiness, urgency and whether the case is high priority. In the second round, the same criteria will apply, but without the criterion of readiness.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o284"><a name="90505-0016.htm_para3"><a name="09050547000098">Hon. Members have also mentioned the amount of money already committed in preparing bids. That is a problem for colleges and it is an issue about which college principals and corporation leaders feel worried and exposed. I am sensitive to that, and we have made it clear to the LSC that it will need to be sensitive to the difficulties in which its mismanagement of this programme has put college leaderships. It has retained an independent firm of property consultants, who are currently consulting all the affected colleges with a view to reporting back to them what level of support they could individually expect; again, that will take place within the next few weeks.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o285"><a name="90505-0016.htm_para4"><a name="09050547000099">I could go on talking about these matters indefinitely, but I am conscious of the fact that other hon. Members wish to discuss this new clause and others, and that the hon. Member for South Holland and The Deepings has to follow me so this matter is by no means close to conclusion. I am sympathetic to the desires of hon. Members to have a wide-ranging debate about this matter and I have tried to address some of the main issues in the time available, but I do not think it is appropriate for me to go on talking indefinitely. I am sympathetic to the intentions of new clauses 1 and 11, but both of them are dealt with in the Bill or within existing practice and are, therefore, superfluous. On that basis, I know that the hon. Gentleman, with his customary sagacity and courtesy, will be inclined not to press the new clauses to a Division.</p>

<p><a name="st_o270"><a name="09050547000100"><a name="90505-0016.htm_spnew2"><a name="09050547000753"><b>Mr. Hayes:</b>
 The Minister has done his best to deal both with these new clauses and with the crisis that is not entirely of his making, given that he is a newcomer to his Department. He will understand why Conservative Members and, indeed, Members from across the House, are so exercised about this capital funding crisis. Joseph Conrad said that &#147;reality beats fiction out of sight&#148;, and nobody could have made this up, could they? This is stranger than fiction. The Minister first says that colleges might be allowed to go bankrupt and then says that they will not be able to do so.</p>

 I hate to interrupt the hon. Gentleman&#146;s peroration, but I should say that I never said that colleges might be allowed to go bankrupt&#151;not on the &#147;Today&#148; programme or anywhere else.</p>

<p><a name="st_o274"><a name="09050547000104"><a name="90505-0016.htm_spnew6"><a name="09050547000757"><b>Mr. Hayes:</b>
 What the hon. Gentleman said on the &#147;Today&#148; programme, on blogs and on Twitter is probably not worth dwelling on now because to do so would not be in his interests or those of the House. We certainly know that Sir Andrew Foster, who was asked by the  <br>

Government to look into these matters because they were so concerned about where things had got to, concluded in his report on the crisis that it had been &#147;predictable and probably avoidable&#148;. We know that 79 of the colleges that have had their capital bids frozen had already received agreement in principle and were simply awaiting agreement in detail, and we know that the &#163;300 million that the Government have committed will not do the job.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o286"><a name="90505-0016.htm_para5"><a name="09050547000105">These new clauses are as clear as crystal. They would help a Government to ensure that the circumstances in which this Government find themselves would be most unlikely to occur&#151;I shall not say impossible, because incompetence can reign regardless of law. However, law must at least be in place to mitigate the results of the sort of incompetence, miscommunication, failure to act and lack of accountability that lay at the heart of this crisis.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o287"><a name="90505-0016.htm_para6"><a name="09050547000106">We propose in our amendments that the House receive reports, with properly collected information from across the country, that match the state of the college estate to the bids for capital funding. It is remarkable that the Minister says that that information is already collected. He says that the Government have all the knowledge that they need about the state of FE colleges and the level of resources they enjoy. My goodness, if they have all that information but do not match it to bids for capital funding, what sort of organisation is the Learning and Skills Council and what sort of Ministers have we had who have not held that body to account? After all, it is a Government agency and there must be some sort of line of report, even if the Minister was not himself in office at the time.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o288"><a name="90505-0016.htm_para7"><a name="09050547000107">It is essential for the good of our colleges that we avoid similar crises in the future. It is essential for good governance that we have the right information, and it is certainly essential for the further education and training needs and skills that our people deserve that we have better Ministers. I wish to press new clause 1 to a Division because I want to test the House&#146;s opinion on whether this sort of thing is excusable or whether it thinks, as I do, that it is unforgivable.</p>

 The Opposition support the establishment of an independent regulator of qualifications and examinations. It was, after all, my right hon. Friend the Member for Witney (Mr. Cameron) who, when he was shadow Education Secretary&#151;as the position was then known, before the word &#147;Education&#148; was eliminated from the name of the Department&#151;said:</p>
<a name="90505-0017.htm_brev0"><a name="09050547000674"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;It is not acceptable that the QCA, the guardian of our exams, is not independent of the Government.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o312"><a name="90505-0017.htm_para12"><a name="09050547000597">By government, we mean the government machine&#151; that is, all those elements of government charged with the responsibility of providing education, training teachers, determining the direction of education policy and the style of pedagogy; all those who determine whether, for example, primary education should be child centred; those who determine whether classes should be mixed ability or set by ability; the independent panels of advisers who advised the Government to remove translation from English into French from the secondary modern foreign languages curriculum; or those who advised that the primary curriculum should no longer teach the multiplication or addition of fractions. The exam regulator needs to be independent of all those groups and of anyone who has a vested interest in demonstrating that educational standards have improved.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o313"><a name="90505-0017.htm_para13"><a name="09050547000598">Ofqual particularly needs to be independent of civil servants in the education world, both departmental and at local authority level. As Sir Michael Barber points out in his book &#147;Instruction to Deliver&#148;:</p>
<a name="90505-0017.htm_brev1"><a name="09050547000675"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;While the civil service was not party political, it was heavily influenced by the various lobby groups who competed for influence in the Department which thus tended to see issues from the producer angle...Moreover, the lack of ambition which characterised the education service as a whole inevitably affected the Department too.&#148;</p>

<notus-date day="5" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>5 May 2009 : Column 103</b><br>

<p><a name="stpa_o314"><a name="90505-0017.htm_para14"><a name="09050547000599">It is keeping Ofqual independent from that lack of ambition that is so crucial, as well as keeping it independent of the producer angle.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o315"><a name="90505-0017.htm_para15"><a name="09050547000600">That lack of ambition was exemplified by almost the very first act of the newly created Ofqual. In October last year, in response to reports that one of the exam boards, Edexcel, was awarding C grades in its new science GCSE to pupils achieving just 20 per cent., Ofqual was asked to adjudicate after the three exam boards failed to reach an agreement over grade boundaries. Instead of making the three boards rise to the standard of the most demanding, which was AQA, it ordered AQA to lower its grade boundaries to those of the other two&#151;levelling down rather than levelling up. The director general of AQA, Dr. Mike Cresswell, said that he did so under protest and wrote:</p>
<a name="90505-0017.htm_brev2"><a name="09050547000676"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;AQA is extremely reluctant to adopt a standard for GCSE Science which is less comparable with the past than it needs to be.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o316"><a name="90505-0017.htm_para16"><a name="09050547000601">Ofqual spectacularly failed, therefore, in its first test.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o317"><a name="90505-0017.htm_para17"><a name="09050547000602">That all goes to the root of the contradictions that lie at the heart of this policy. On the one hand, the Government are saying that standards have been rigorously maintained over the years and between different exams. On the other hand, they say that an independent regulator needs to be created to boost public confidence. In a letter of September 2007, in which the DCSF set out the new model of regulation of qualifications, the Department states:</p>
<a name="90505-0017.htm_brev3"><a name="09050547000677"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Over the last ten years, the Qualifications and Curriculum Authority...has shown robust independence in its work as a regulator and has developed a system for assuring standards which is recognised internationally for its quality and reliability...The hard work of the QCA, and its fellow regulators, means that we can be confident that standards have been maintained.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o318"><a name="90505-0017.htm_para18"><a name="09050547000603">If things are so good and rosy, why do we need reform? The document goes on to say:</p>
<a name="90505-0017.htm_brev4"><a name="09050547000678"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Yet once again, this summer, we had a public debate about standards in qualifications and tests&#151;even as the QCA provided reassurance that standards had been maintained&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o319"><a name="90505-0017.htm_para19"><a name="09050547000604">In other words, how dare the public have a debate about standards when the QCA has &#147;provided reassurance&#148;. The reforms are not about ensuring that standards are maintained, but about finding a better way to try to convince the public that standards are being maintained.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o320"><a name="90505-0017.htm_para20"><a name="09050547000605">Kathleen Tattersall, the new chairman and chief regulator at Ofqual, said in her evidence to the Public Bill Committee:</p>
<a name="90505-0017.htm_brev5"><a name="09050547000679"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Ofqual has been set up...to ensure that there is a better...understanding of the issues and to assure public confidence.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o321"><a name="90505-0017.htm_para21"><a name="09050547000606">What Ofqual should be concerned about is maintaining standards&#151;something that its predecessor regulator, the Qualifications and Curriculum Authority, singularly failed to do. That is why, in amendment 61, we propose adding a specific requirement to maintain standards to Ofqual&#146;s list of objectives.</p>

 Does it not strike my hon. Friend as odd that the chairman of Ofqual should talk about improving understanding of the issues?

Is not &#147;understanding the issues&#148; code for &#147;Let us explain to people why they should think differently from the way that they do.&#148;?</p>

 My right hon. Friend has summarised brilliantly the argument that I was trying to make. It is a huge concern, because as he hints, a huge amount of independent academic research carried out in recent years points to the decline in exam standards over time. To take just one example, Peter Tymms at the Centre for Evaluation and Monitoring at the university of Durham has shown that a student who got an E in A-level maths in 1998 would have been awarded a B in 2004. Professor Peter Williams, appointed by this Government, said in <i> The Observer</i> newspaper:</p>
<a name="90505-0017.htm_brev6"><a name="09050547000680"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Over 20 or 30 years I don&#146;t think there is any doubt whatsoever that absolute A-level standards have fallen.</p>
</ul><a name="90505-0017.htm_brev7"><a name="09050547000681"><ul><p class="tabletext">They have edged south, continuously over a long period of time.</p>
</ul><a name="90505-0017.htm_brev8"><a name="09050547000682"><ul><p class="tabletext">I think all university academics and a good proportion of sixth-form teachers would agree with my assertion.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o322"><a name="90505-0017.htm_para22"><a name="09050547000609">That and other evidence has been available for several years now, but what concerns us is the attitude to such evidence expressed by Ofqual&#146;s chief regulator in her evidence to the Public Bill Committee. When asked by my hon. Friend the Member for Broxbourne (Mr. Walker),</p>
<a name="90505-0017.htm_brev9"><a name="09050547000683"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Does Ofqual believe that there is grade inflation in A-levels and GCSEs?&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o323"><a name="90505-0017.htm_para23"><a name="09050547000610">she replied:</p>
<a name="90505-0017.htm_brev10"><a name="09050547000684"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Ofqual will take the evidence that it has and that comes to its attention to make any pronouncement, one way or the other, on issues of that kind. That is something that we have not particularly explored and I do not think that it would be appropriate for me to come to a view without full consideration of the evidence.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o324"><a name="90505-0017.htm_para24"><a name="09050547000611">Why is the matter one that Ofqual has &#147;not particularly explored&#148;? When my hon. Friend asked whether Ofqual would explore the issue in future, he received another odd answer from the chief regulator:</p>
<a name="90505-0017.htm_brev11"><a name="09050547000685"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;What we will be doing as a regulator is looking at the evidence, particularly where there are any issues of public concern. If that issue is a matter of public concern, clearly we will be seeking evidence on it, but there are a range of other issues where our starting point would always be to look at the evidence and to come to a considered judgment on the evidence.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o325"><a name="90505-0017.htm_para25"><a name="09050547000612">Why have the QCA and Ofqual not been looking at the evidence, including that of Peter Williams and the Durham evidence? What did the chief regulator mean when she said:</p>
<a name="90505-0017.htm_brev12"><a name="09050547000686"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;If that issue is a matter of public concern&#148;?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o326"><a name="90505-0017.htm_para26"><a name="09050547000613">What did she mean by &#147;if&#148;? As my right hon. Friend the Member for Suffolk, Coastal (Mr. Gummer) suggests, of course it is an issue of public concern. We read about it in the newspapers the whole time.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o327"><a name="90505-0017.htm_para27"><a name="09050547000614">When challenged by my hon. Friend the Member for Basingstoke (Mrs. Miller), the chief regulator&#146;s response was:</p>
<a name="90505-0017.htm_brev13"><a name="09050547000687"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Ofqual has been set up to regulate the system, to get better public accountability for the system, to ensure that there is a better public understanding of the issues and to assure public confidence.

I do not think that it has been set up to address any specific concerns, such as the one that was just mentioned&#148;<i> &#151;&#151;</i>[<i> Official Report, Apprenticeships, Skills, Children and Learning Public Bill Committee, </i>3 March 2009; c. 70, Q182 to Q184.]&#151;</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o338"><a name="90505-0018.htm_para0"><a name="09050547000630">There are further criticisms in paragraph 171 about the difficulties of reaching a conclusive view on the issue of grade inflation and thus what we should conclude about what has happened to educational standards over the past 10 or 20 years.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o339"><a name="90505-0018.htm_para1"><a name="09050547000631">That is of fundamental importance because the Government&#146;s view, and their gloss on the statistics, is that there has been a staggering improvement in educational standards over the past 10 years, and perhaps even longer. In some parts of the country, the improvement in, for example, GCSE scores is quite breathtaking on paper. If it is true that there has been an improvement in standards of that magnitude, it is extremely important, and it has all sorts of implications for policy. However, if the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton is correct in saying that we cannot rely on those statistics, and if the Select Committee is right in its criticisms, we are in a difficult, and very different, position, which is presumably why, in paragraph 186, the Select Committee recommends that there should be a greater use of sample or cohort testing to establish what has truly happened to educational standards over time, and to make those judgments invariant to changes in the structure of qualifications, and thus to restore public confidence in standards.</p>

 The hon.

<p><a name="stpa_o342"><a name="90505-0018.htm_para4"><a name="09050547000635">That is powerful evidence that the Government cannot be trusted on standards.</p>

 It is indeed an important warning of the risk that arises from the manner in which the Government have established Ofqual, the degree of independence that Ofqual will, or will not, have, and in its tightly defined remit, which are designed effectively to stop it making the judgments about standards that it needs to make. Although the Minister herself, in giving evidence to the Public Bill Committee, suggested that it would be possible for Ofqual to use sample testing, she later qualified that by indicating that that could be used only in the context of the specific objectives in the Bill, which prevent such testing from being used to make judgments about educational standards and changes in those standards over time.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o343"><a name="90505-0018.htm_para5"><a name="09050547000637">That is why we tabled a large number of amendments, both in Committee and on Report. Amendment 90 requires comparable international assessments to be made by Ofqual in a way that is similar to what new clause 3, which was introduced by the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton, would do. Amendments 72, 74 and 75 deal with the need to establish a proper educational standards objective in place of the long list of objectives that the Government have designated for Ofqual, none of which addresses the fundamental issue of standards, and judgments about standards over time. Amendment 71 seeks to address the soon-to-be-topical issue of the introduction of the modular GCSE, and the impact that it is likely to have on results. We heard some interesting evidence from the Minister and others in Committee about the effect that the introduction of modular GCSEs is likely to have. Many of us suspect that when they are introduced, there will be a rise in GCSE results, even though there will not be an improvement in underlying GCSE standards. We heard ambiguous evidence from the Minister about whether a rise in apparent standards as a consequence of changing to modular GCSEs should essentially be suppressed by ensuring that similar-ability cohorts of children end up with similar GCSE results, or whether in fact the modular GCSE will allow the results to rise in a fairly predictable way that, no doubt, will be used by the Government, if they are still in power, to claim that standards have risen.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o344"><a name="90505-0018.htm_para6"><a name="09050547000638">Amendment 73 deals with the need for standardised sample testing, in relation not only to the existing Ofqual objectives, but to the wider standards objective that we believe there should be. Amendment 91 deals with the issue of coherence <i> v.</i> choice in qualifications, a subject that we touched on in Committee.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o345"><a name="90505-0018.htm_para7"><a name="09050547000639">Another fundamental debate is hidden away in the amendments and new clauses before us. That is in relation to what was, when we were debating the Bill in Committee, the famous clause 138, which, under the reordering in the new Bill, becomes clause 139. This is the clause that gives the Secretary of State the ability to determine the minimum requirements in respect of skills, knowledge or understanding that someone must be able to demonstrate to gain a particular qualification or type of qualification.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o346"><a name="90505-0018.htm_para8"><a name="09050547000640">That is a very significant power. It allows a Secretary of State to prescribe, potentially in great detail, what should be in each and every regulated qualification. The example that the Minister gave during our Committee hearing was that particular authors might be considered to have a status that would justify a Minister insisting that they ought to be covered by, for example, a GCSE  <br>

In her letter to my hon. Friend on 14 March, the Minister confirmed that at present there is no explicit statutory power to determine such matters. In other words, this is a new power being taken by the Secretary of State to prescribe in a potentially very detailed way what should be in particular qualifications.</p>

competitors, how good our qualification and examination system is. I should have thought that anybody running a business, a charity or any organisation would want to know whether the process by which they measured their success was, first, constant in the sense that it was comparable with previous measurements, and secondly, whether it was comparable with the measurements used by other people. It seems very peculiar to refuse to do either thing, and I do not understand why the Government find it so difficult, unless they are too afraid that they might have to say sorry. Is it another example of the Government fearing that an objective measurement might mean that they would have to admit that all their statements about standards having not fallen turned out to be untrue?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o352"><a name="90505-0018.htm_para14"><a name="09050547000649">The Minister represents a normal, run-of-the-mill constituency, and I am sure that if she talked to people there she would find that a large number think that standards have fallen. There is no way of reassuring them, except through independent assessment. The Government have recognised that, so they have set up an organisation that, they claim, will be independent. However, they have then proceeded to give to that organisation a series of remits that limit to an unacceptable degree its ability to be independent. Both the Minister&#146;s responses to previous, Committee debates, which I have had the pleasure of reading, and her letters show that she has no intention whatever of enabling the body to set up an independent measurement of the success or failure of a particular means of testing and assessment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o353"><a name="90505-0018.htm_para15"><a name="09050547000650">If we live in a society in which more and more employers say, &#147;I take no notice of GCSE results and A-level results,&#148; it is a society that properly should address that worry. As an employer, I find it difficult to see any continuity of standards in the conduct of those examinations, so I beg the Minister to take seriously the amendments. They are intended neither to criticise the Government, nor to upset the convenience of her Department; they are designed to ensure that people have confidence in the standards attained. She has admitted that people do not have such confidence, and one does not solve that problem unless one is prepared to enable people independently to measure our present system against what happens in the rest of Europe, with which, after all, we compete, and to see how far it has changed over the past 20 years. I should be perfectly happy to make it a 20-year period, so that it covered the life of another Government, too, and I am sure that my hon.

If it is true that there is widespread concern about the standards of examination and the standards that young people are now expected to reach, there is even more widespread concern about Government interference in how the education system works. One cannot ignore that, and anybody with a constituency anywhere in the country knows perfectly well that people are worried. If the Department and the Minister want to do something about that concern, they must take seriously the amendments that the Liberal Democrats have put forward.</p>

 No doubt if the hon. Gentleman listens to what I have to say, he will be able to make an assessment of what I think about the matter. I must say that his amendments do not go far enough, however, because I do not see any occasion on which the advantage to the society in which we live of the Government being able to detail those arrangements is sufficiently great to overcome the disadvantage that I see. I have a very strong view that Governments should keep their fingers out of what is taught in the classroom&#151;apart from the general principle of ensuring a broad approach that covers the range of history, geography and the like.

 It is all very well for the Minister to shake his head. He is one of the very few in this Government whom I would trust with anything; that compliment, of course, will do him no good in his party. Do not let him encourage me to be more complimentary, because that would be bad for his future&#151;limited though it may be in a Government whose future is limited.

Lastly, they are a Government who will not listen to the public. I am thinking not only of the Gurkhas, but of everybody in Britain to whom I ever talk on these subjects and who wants to know. If we are wrong and if it is not true that standards have fallen, the Government should be honest and prove it.

 I am grateful to have caught your eye at the last minute, Mr. Deputy Speaker. I had not intended to participate in this debate, but I have been prompted to do so by the words of my right hon. Friend the Member for Suffolk, Coastal (Mr. Gummer), who made a powerful argument about the Government&#146;s actions and intentions as regards education. The amount of money allocated to the education budget has doubled, but we have to ask whether we are getting value for money. My right hon. Friend has put his finger on the issue. Have there been any improvements to our education system that are worthy of the amount of money that has gone into it? <i> [</i><i> Interruption.</i><i> ]</i> The Minister says yes, but when we speak to employers, teachers and parents and ask them their views about what has happened to A-levels or GCSEs, they will say, without any prompting, that there has been a degradation in standards, with grade inflation. The Minister shakes his head, but that is what people out there are saying. It therefore defies logic that this Government, so late in the day in their tenure and in this parliamentary season, still refuse to listen to what the public are asking for, employers are calling for, and we are suggesting here today.</p>

pass? There is something fundamentally wrong with that. If someone gets more things wrong than right, they should be heading towards a fail, not a pass, and they should not get a certain number of marks simply for turning up. My right hon. Friend made a valid point: unless we have such a comparison, how can we tell how we are doing in comparison with the people against whom we are competing? There are other yardsticks of measurement to say how we are doing in that competitive sphere, in the sense of who is taking our jobs&#151;who is coming to work in the UK.</p>

 This is about qualifications, but within the QCDA it is also about the national assessments of the curriculum. I was talking broadly about Ofqual and the QCDA.</p>

Fundamental to that credibility is the independence that is enshrined in the Bill, which I shall explain.</p>

 I find it very sad that the hon. Gentleman cannot accept the possibility that the abilities of our young people and the quality of teaching have enabled standards to rise.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o368"><a name="90505-0019.htm_para7"><a name="0905066000083">I was pleased to hear that the setting up of a strong and independent regulator has received widespread support. Most hon. Members in the Chamber would agree that that is needed, but there are inevitably some differences of opinion about exactly what Ofqual&#146;s role should be. Two themes in particular attracted debate in Committee, and they are again the subject of amendments today: first, what Ofqual&#146;s role as a standards watchdog means&#151;there seems to be some confusion about what is meant by the standards that Ofqual must maintain&#151;and secondly, what &#147;independence&#148; means. Ofqual must be free to take the decisions that it needs to take to maintain standards. It will report to Parliament on how it does so. However, that does not mean that Ofqual should operate without reference to matters that are at the heart of Government education policy, such as the content of GCSEs or the purpose of national curriculum assessments.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o369"><a name="90505-0019.htm_para8"><a name="0905066000084">Let me take standards of qualifications first. We spent a good deal of time on that in Committee, and quite rightly so. Protecting standards is the key driver for the establishment of Ofqual. It is essential that we have&#151;I am drawing on the wording of the Bill now&#151;qualifications and assessments that give a reliable indication of knowledge, skills and understanding, and that indicate a consistent level of attainment, including over time. That needs an expert, independent regulator with the powers to ensure that qualification standards are maintained and the credibility so that people trust it when it provides that assurance.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o370"><a name="90505-0019.htm_para9"><a name="0905066000085">The Bill has a range of provisions that are all about delivering on that, including objectives for Ofqual in respect of safeguarding the standards of qualifications and assessments; a power for Ofqual to set conditions that are binding on awarding bodies, so that Ofqual can have all the leverage that it needs to safeguard standards, coupled with a strong set of enforcement powers if an awarding body steps out of line; strong powers to regulate assessments; a reporting line to Parliament, not Ministers; and separation from the organisation that develops the curriculum and delivers and develops related qualifications or tests, the Qualifications and Curriculum Development Agency.</p>

Ofqual is not being told how to achieve its objectives. The starting  <br>

point is that we need to trust Ofqual to get on with the job that it is given and leave it to choose the right tools for doing just that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o372"><a name="90505-0019.htm_para11"><a name="0905066000087">We would certainly expect Ofqual to publish evidence underpinning its conclusions on the maintenance of standards and&#151;to pick up the point in new clause 2&#151;to consider lessons from other countries. Ofqual will be accountable to Parliament for the way it pursues its objectives, but we will not prejudge the best way for it to gather or present its evidence on qualification standards, or what it should publish and when. That should be Ofqual&#146;s call. Parliament, not least through the Select Committee on Children, Schools and Families, will look to Ofqual for the definitive word on the quality of qualifications in this country. That is what the Bill enables. The Bill gives Ofqual all the powers that it needs to monitor those standards and pronounce its judgments on what it finds without fear or favour.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o373"><a name="90505-0019.htm_para12"><a name="0905066000088">That is why I do not support amendments 61 to 63, 71 and 74 and new clause 2, which relate to standards. I agree with what I take to be the underlying sentiment of some of those amendments&#151;that standards of qualifications need to be as high as ever they were&#151;but we do not need amendments to the Bill to deliver on that. The Bill already gives all the safeguards that we need.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o374"><a name="90505-0019.htm_para13"><a name="0905066000089">Given the time, I shall deal with Ofqual&#146;s independence, on which our message is clear. To be an effective regulator, Ofqual must be fully independent. The acid test is whether Ofqual has the powers that it needs to meet its objectives, the freedom to exercise those powers and the responsibility to report to Parliament and the public on its performance against those objectives. The Bill meets that test in every respect. It has to; there would be no point in establishing Ofqual without making it fully and clearly independent. Being independent, Ofqual might sometimes say things that will be uncomfortable for the Government and others, as we found when it reported on science GCSEs a few weeks ago. Home truths&#151;</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o424"><a name="90505-0021.htm_para14"><a name="0905066000938">The high quality of debate so far this afternoon reflects that which has been sustained throughout the passage of the Bill. The contributions of hon. Members from both sides of the House have been productive and professional, by and large, throughout the exhaustive and, at times, exhausting sittings that we enjoyed. The Bill is long and complex, but it is also important. Proper consideration and scrutiny have been essential, so I thank everyone who has contributed both this afternoon and throughout the earlier stages.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o425"><a name="90505-0021.htm_para15"><a name="0905066000939">In November, we achieved Royal Assent for the Education and Skills Act 2008, which took the bold and historic step of raising the participation age in education, employment or training to 18 from 2015, because nothing could be more important than ensuring that young people have the opportunities to get the skills that they need to succeed. Those opportunities must, of course, be open to all learners, not just the fortunate few, so we supported the raising of the participation age, with a broader range of options at 14 to 19. Those diplomas are introducing new areas of study and new methods of study through a combination of theoretical and applied learning. We have also strengthened existing qualifications at 14 to 19. Now, every learner can find something that captures their interest and plays to their strengths. This is a moral cause and an economic one.</p>

<p><a name="st_o313"><a name="0905066000940"><a name="90505-0021.htm_spnew1"><a name="0905066001908"><b>Mr. Barry Sheerman (Huddersfield) (Lab/Co-op):</b>
 I wonder whether my right hon. Friend will be surprised to learn that I agree that this is an economic and a moral cause. Is there any possibility of bringing this work forward, given the current economic situation?</p>

<p><a name="st_o314"><a name="0905066000941"><a name="90505-0021.htm_spnew2"><a name="0905066001909"><b>Jim Knight:</b>
 Tempting as it may be, given the compelling case for raising the participation age, I am sure that my hon. Friend, as Chair of the Select Committee on Children, Schools and Families, would not wish me to rush ahead of the ability of the system to deliver. It is important that we get the information, advice and guidance right, that the qualifications consistently work across the country and that we have the work force ready to deliver. I do not think that an accelerated timetable would allow us to do that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o426"><a name="90505-0021.htm_para16"><a name="0905066000942">As we face the current economic challenges, this is the time to invest in skills and training that will build a strong work force and a strong economy, and that will secure Britain&#146;s place at the forefront of global competition, innovation and productivity. Therefore, in spite of the economic difficulties we face&#151;indeed because of them&#151;this is education&#146;s moment. This Bill not only seeks to put in place the infrastructure that will ensure that the system can deliver the historic changes we have made, but supports the moral and economic ambitions of the 2008 Act. It will open up more learning routes to more people and support fairer access to that learning, through an expansion of apprenticeship places and a new right for adults to request time to train to help them to overcome constraints to their learning and develop the skills they need to progress. It will rationalise the national infrastructure, with lighter-touch bodies that will support local delivery, promote excellence and represent the choices and aspirations of learners.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o427"><a name="90505-0021.htm_para17"><a name="0905066000943">In particular, the Young People&#146;s Learning Agency will be created to support local authorities in their new 16-to-18 funding role, Ofqual as an independent regulator of qualifications and assessment, the Qualifications  <br>

and Curriculum Development Agency to take on the Qualifications and Curriculum Authority&#146;s non-regulatory functions, and the Skills Funding Agency as part of a new demand-led system of post-19 education and training.</p>

<p><a name="st_o315"><a name="0905066000944"><a name="90505-0021.htm_spnew3"><a name="0905066001910"><b>Mr. Graham Stuart:</b>
 I enjoyed the Second Reading of the Bill and sat through Committee, but I am none the wiser about how the right to an apprenticeship place will be guaranteed, given that that requires an employer. How will the new National Apprenticeship Service be able to guarantee that employers come forward, especially at this time of recession? We should be careful not to make promises that we cannot keep. Perhaps the Minister can put my mind at rest.</p>

<p><a name="st_o316"><a name="0905066000945"><a name="90505-0021.htm_spnew4"><a name="0905066001911"><b>Jim Knight:</b>
 It is Labour which is guaranteeing the funding and putting in place the infrastructure, through the National Apprenticeship Service, so that we can properly mobilise employers, who&#151;as demonstrated by the support of employer organisations such as the CBI&#151;want to see the expansion of apprenticeships. Certainly, we in the public sector will play our part in expanding apprenticeship provision.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o428"><a name="90505-0021.htm_para18"><a name="0905066000946">The Bill will secure more scope for local provision to be tailored to local need. Local authorities will become the single point of accountability for all children&#146;s services from 0 to 19 and children&#146;s trusts will be strengthened to provide a stronger base for partnership working and to better support children&#146;s wider well-being and development, especially those children with additional needs.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o429"><a name="90505-0021.htm_para19"><a name="0905066000947">As my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State outlined earlier, the Bill will also implement recommendations made by Lord Laming to strengthen practice in safeguarding and child protection.</p>

<p><a name="st_o317"><a name="0905066000948"><a name="90505-0021.htm_spnew5"><a name="0905066001912"><b>Mr. Hayes:</b>
 If employer organisations are so in concert with the Government&#146;s ambitions, why did they describe this Bill in the witness sessions as a &#147;bureaucratic muddle&#148; and a &#147;wasted opportunity&#148;? That does not suggest great faith in the infrastructure that the Minister now advocates with such energy.</p>

<p><a name="st_o318"><a name="0905066000949"><a name="90505-0021.htm_spnew6"><a name="0905066001913"><b>Jim Knight:</b>
 We can all pull out quotes from the evidence sessions from people who supported or opposed aspects of the Bill. I was referring to the support from organisations such as the CBI for our policy of raising the participation age and for our expansion of the apprenticeship programme. I do not think that the hon. Gentleman would argue with that support.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o430"><a name="90505-0021.htm_para20"><a name="0905066000950">The Bill will help to drive up standards across all schools by strengthening powers to intervene in those schools that are underperforming, creating a lighter-touch inspection framework for those that are performing really well and creating a more straightforward and open complaints system for parents. Fair access, a strong, streamlined infrastructure, more power at local level and a relentless focus on standards are the ambitions at the heart of the Bill, and they are fundamental to delivering a world-class education system, building a strong economy and ensuring that every learner has the opportunity to pursue their talents, realise their ambitions and secure for themselves a successful future. I am pleased to commend the Bill to the House. I am also pleased that it will go to the other place, subject to the vote on Third Reading, in a form that is sure to meet with its approval.</p>

 It must come as a welcome relief to the Minister, after all the chaos of the Bill&#146;s passage through Committee, that we have at last come to the Third reading of the Apprenticeship, Skills, Children and Learning Bill. It is such an appropriately named Bill given that three of the four Ministers responsible for taking it through Committee appear to have been released from their ministerial apprenticeships prematurely&#151;too soon, it seems, to manage the complex responsibility of ensuring that the Committee voted the right way on clause 49. The fourth Minister, the Minister for Schools and Learners, though experienced, appears not to have the skills to ensure that he did not lose four successive votes on the trot. And as for children, that role was amply filled by the Government&#146;s Deputy Chief Whip, whose petulance after losing those votes resulted in his looming presence in the Public Gallery and unnecessarily and expensively running the Committee through the night, finishing the Bill despite there being a full day left in the programme. What about the learning? Well, perhaps Labour Back Benchers on the Committee need to learn that Thursday Committee sittings start at 9 am and that they should get out of bed a little earlier.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o431"><a name="90505-0021.htm_para21"><a name="0905066000952">I want to thank my hon. Friends the Members for Broxbourne (Mr. Walker) and for Beverly Hills&#151;<i> [</i><i> Laughter.</i><i> ]</i> I apologise; I mean for Beverley and Holderness (Mr. Stuart).

Friend the Member for South Holland and The Deepings (Mr. Hayes) for his scrutiny of the DIUS elements of the Bill and for his charm and eloquence, of which all members of the Committee have grown so fond.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o432"><a name="90505-0021.htm_para22"><a name="0905066000953">A Government who were elected on the threefold promise of education will bequeath an education system in which 40 per cent. of children leave primary school still struggling with the basics of reading, writing and maths; in which half the children who qualify for free school meals fail to achieve a single GCSE above a grade D; and in which the number of young people who have left education without a job or a place on a training scheme to go to has soared to a record 860,000. It is an education system about which academics such as Professor Tymms of Durham university have repeatedly provided evidence that literacy tests and GCSEs no longer provide robust evidence of standards, and where a student achieving an E in A-level maths in 1998 would now be awarded a B. Over the past few years, that education system has been beset by poor administration: the SATs marking fiasco, the non-payment of education maintenance allowances, the halting of the further education college building programme and, most recently, the sixth-form funding chaos, when the Learning and Skills Council sent out different letters to schools confirming a different level of funding.</p>

the Learning and Skills Council. It is never his fault, or the Department&#146;s fault. Perhaps his focus has been on trying to become Chancellor, or Home Secretary, or on partisan politics, or on becoming leader of the Labour party after the general election. It is always the quangos&#146; fault, which is why it is odd that the Bill creates a host of new quangos&#151;the Young People&#146;s Learning Agency, the chief executive of skills funding, and the National Apprenticeship Service. As my hon. Friend the Member for Havant (Mr. Willetts) said on Second Reading, this Bill</p>
<a name="90505-0021.htm_brev2"><a name="0905066001062"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;reveals the besetting problem of a decaying Government coming to the end of their term: when in doubt, reorganise...Even worse than that, they are now reorganising their own reorganisations, and changing the institutions that they themselves created earlier.&#148;&#151;[<i> Official Report</i>, 23 February 2009; Vol. 488, c. 115.]</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o434"><a name="90505-0021.htm_para24"><a name="0905066000955">The Government claim that creating three quangos from one will slim down bureaucracy but in Committee, Ministers refused to guarantee that staffing numbers employed by these new quangos would not exceed the numbers currently employed by the LSC. However, we certainly welcome the Government&#146;s commitment to increasing the number of apprenticeships. My hon. Friend the Member for South Holland and The Deepings is well known and respected for his advocacy of genuine apprenticeships and, along with our hon. Friend the Member for Havant, he has developed a policy that will mean 100,000 more work-based apprenticeships.</p>

She has been, and remains, a firm advocate of Sure Start, but she wants to ensure, as we all do, that its services reach the most disadvantaged and hard-to-reach families in our society&#151;something that the National Audit Office tells us that Sure Start all too often fails to do.</p>

Those measures were originally suggested by my right hon. Friend the Member for Witney (Mr. Cameron) when he was the shadow Secretary of State for Education and Skills. A raft of evidence points to falling standards in the rigour and quality of examinations&#151;not in the rigour or quality of the students or teachers, but in the exams. I have already quoted Professor Peter Williams, who said in<i>  The Observer </i>in July 2007:</p>

I would have hoped that the approach would have been to instruct the other boards to raise theirs.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o440"><a name="90505-0022.htm_para3"><a name="0905066000963">We welcome measures in the Bill to tackle poor standards in schools, particularly those that relate to behaviour. Ofsted reports that 43 per cent. of secondary schools are not good enough, which is a staggeringly high proportion. We know from answers to parliamentary questions that 344 children are suspended from schools in England every day for violence against other pupils. We know that more than 4,000 children under the age of six were suspended from primary school last year. We know that in 2006-07, some 980 three and four-year-olds were suspended for physical assaults against other pupils and teachers. We know that the number of children suspended 10 times or more in a year has tripled over the past four years to nearly 900, and we also know that police have been called into schools 7,000 times to deal with violence. Some of those cases relate to incidents outside the school gates, and some to cases involving disruptive parents, but some cases dealt with incidents inside the school.</p>

The new powers for teachers to search for weapons, drugs and alcohol require the search to be carried out by a teacher of the same sex as the pupil being searched, in the presence of another teacher of the same sex. That requirement for two teachers could be a problem for a very small primary school where there are no male teachers, or indeed in any primary school that has fewer than two male teachers. It could also be a problem in circumstances such as school trips, where there might be just one male teacher. The response that the Under-Secretary of State for Children, Schools and Families, the hon.

 On Friday I visited Hornsea Burton primary school in Hornsea in my constituency&#151;a lovely school of 90 pupils.

 My hon. Friend makes the point better than I could by citing a specific example from his constituency of Beverley and Holderness. Raising standards of behaviour in schools is key to raising academic standards. Giving teachers the power and protection that they need is key to raising standards of behaviour. While we support the Bill&#146;s new powers for teachers to search pupils, it does not go far enough to tackle the endemic problem of persistent low-level disruption in our schools.</p>

Regis and Littlehampton (Mr. Gibb) said, gave the Opposition a great deal of amusement on the morning of 26 March as they tripped over a number of their own new clauses and parts of the Bill.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o446"><a name="90505-0022.htm_para9"><a name="0905066000972">I would particularly like to thank all the staff and others in the House, including the departmental staff who stayed for our very long sitting on 26 March, which lasted overnight into 27 March. They could not go home for a few hours in the early morning to clean up, but had to stay in the House because of the rather odd behaviour of the usual channels on the Government side. We very much appreciate the fact that they did so. I am grateful to my hon. Friends the Members for Bristol, West (Stephen Williams) and for Mid-Dorset and North Poole (Annette Brooke) for their support and for their proactive approach throughout proceedings on the Bill, although they had the good sense to leave before the overnight sitting on 26 and 27 March; they did not, I think, anticipate the length of that sitting.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o447"><a name="90505-0022.htm_para10"><a name="0905066000973">I should like to make three points in conclusion. First, there was a rather bad-tempered debate earlier on child protection and child well-being. It was a pity that it was so intemperate on both sides, because it is an extremely important issue, which we ought to deal with in the mature way in which my hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Dorset and North Poole dealt with it. We were surprised when we heard that the Government were going to introduce three new clauses at short notice. Two of those new clauses do not cause us particular concern, but new clause 22, which introduces a new targets regime, is very significant indeed. Although we did not oppose it today, we want to find out a lot more about it before deciding whether to support it in another place. I am grateful to the Secretary of State for Children, Schools and Families for saying that he is happy for my hon. Friend and others to sit down with his departmental officials and perhaps Ministers to discuss the measure before it goes to another place, as it is important that we deal with the concerns that my hon. Friend set out very clearly.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o448"><a name="90505-0022.htm_para11"><a name="0905066000974">On the issue of child protection, I am disappointed by the insistence of the Secretary of State on keeping the substance of the serious case review secret. He knows that no Liberal Democrat Member has any problem with the notion that certain parts of serious case reviews should not be published. I can think of one page of the baby P serious case review that I certainly would not want to put in the public domain. When he kindly invited a number of us to look at that serious case review, I made notes on what I considered to be the significant parts of it. When I passed those notes to his departmental officials to find out how much was already in the public domain, or how much was not in the public domain, so I could not use it, all the points that I considered to be significant concerning the way the baby P case was handled, were, according to the officials, not in the published version of the serious case review, and not in the public domain. I therefore question whether on the basis of the selective information that is published we can understand fully what happened in such cases. I believe that there is a middle way whereby the bulk of the reports can be published and small portions excluded. None of the bodies cited by the Secretary of State has commented on that issue.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o449"><a name="90505-0022.htm_para12"><a name="0905066000975">Secondly, I wish to make an observation on the Bill, which includes, particularly in the parts relevant to the Department for Children, Schools and Families, a ragbag of measures, which suggests a lack of direction, particularly in the DCSF education portfolio. I am genuinely disappointed that on the subject of Ofqual, although the Secretary of State has taken a welcome step by introducing this new organisation, the Government have not gone much further in setting up what would be an objective standards regulator, rather than a body that will simply seek to regulate existing qualifications.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o450"><a name="90505-0022.htm_para13"><a name="0905066000976">The Secretary of State must know that if the intention behind the establishment of the body is to end the annual debate where the Schools Minister and others have to pop up on TV in the middle of August to comment on standards of GCSEs and A-levels, it will not work. It will not work because the Government have set up Ofqual in a very limited form and not given it the ability to comment on educational standards in a way that could allow all those interested in the education debate in this country to understand what has happened to educational standards over time. Without that basic understanding, we have little chance of having policy that is informed by fact, rather than dogma.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o451"><a name="90505-0022.htm_para14"><a name="0905066000977">Although we were not able to debate it today, there is an awful lot in the Bill on the children, schools and families side which adds to the bureaucracy of schools. The Secretary of State must know that individuals whom he greatly respects, such as John Dunford of the Association of School and College Leaders, have been highly critical of much that is in the Bill on the new complaints procedures, the regulations surrounding the use of force, and the search powers. All those bring in extraordinary bureaucratic burdens which head teachers object to and which will make their job in schools much more difficult.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o452"><a name="90505-0022.htm_para15"><a name="0905066000978">I ask the Secretary of State to reflect on how those proposals and the impact that they will have on schools square with what the Prime Minister talked of today in his rather drab education speech, in which he spoke about a White Paper that will contain proposals to reduce the burdens on schools, and about rationalising the statutory duties, correspondence and guidance that schools receive. The effect of much that is in the Bill in the children, schools and families area will be to impose new bureaucratic burdens on schools. Issues such as the use of force could make the job of head teachers and teachers more difficult, potentially even making them less willing to intervene in circumstances where the use of force is necessary.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o453"><a name="90505-0022.htm_para16"><a name="0905066000979">Finally, an aspect of the Bill that showed up the incoherence of Government thinking in terms of accountability&#151;I hope this will be dealt with in the White Paper that is to come&#151;is that of school oversight. We were told that the Young People&#146;s Learning Agency was being established to cover the academies programme because, in a nutshell, the Government do not have confidence in the ability of local authorities as commissioners and standard setters at a high level.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o454"><a name="90505-0022.htm_para17"><a name="0905066000980">In the west country there will be a tiny number of academies which, owing to the Government&#146;s lack of confidence in the oversight of local authorities, will have to be monitored by some regional quango because the Government do not trust the local authority commissioning and oversight process.

extraordinarily wasteful, but a terrible indictment of the existing regime that we ought to depend on for the oversight of 23,500 schools in the country.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o455"><a name="90505-0022.htm_para18"><a name="0905066000981">If we cannot trust local authorities to do their job of overseeing schools and as the first tier to hold those schools to account for the standards that they deliver, we have a real problem, not only with the average schools and the better than average schools but with the many schools in this country which are in challenging circumstances and which are performing badly, but which are not academies at present.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o456"><a name="90505-0022.htm_para19"><a name="0905066000982">My final comment is about the context of the debate in education. There is a feeling about the Government that they may be coming to their final months in office. Many of us can remember when the Government started the process of public service reform&#151;the attempt to improve public services in 1997. They started with no cash because they were tied into the spending limits that the Conservative Government set. They started with no reform agenda. Indeed, the early mantra was standards, not structures.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o457"><a name="90505-0022.htm_para20"><a name="0905066000983">After a while the money started to flow, as the Conservative spending plans were dumped. That led to some improvements, particularly in terms of the capital stock and the staffing in schools. Eventually, there was a change in policy by the Prime Minister, who acknowledged the importance of structures, rather than standards.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o458"><a name="90505-0022.htm_para21"><a name="0905066000984">Over the past couple of years, we seem to have gone backwards. The Secretary of State, in his first speech, turned on its head the Prime Minister&#146;s comment about the importance of structures rather than just standards. The whole reform agenda has clearly run into the sand, as confirmed by the Schools Minister&#146;s extraordinary comments the other day on the proposals to extend the academies programme to primary schools. He described the proposals as sending</p>

</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o460"><a name="90505-0022.htm_para23"><a name="0905066000986">I should have thought that Lord Adonis would have felt shivers down his spine at that description of what is, after all, merely an extension of the existing academies programme. There could be no clearer indication that the reform programme in education has come to an end.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o461"><a name="90505-0022.htm_para24"><a name="0905066000987">Although the Prime Minister claimed today that he wants to be on the side of spending more and continuing to invest in education, as opposed to being on the side of austerity, we know that the Government&#146;s spending plans after 2011 deliver real reductions in total expenditure year on year, and that there will be cuts in capital expenditure of 17.5 per cent. in real terms each and every year beyond 2011. We are almost back to where we started in 1997, returning to an era of austerity in public services, including education, and no reform programme. If we are to see standards continue to improve, and the gap between youngsters from deprived backgrounds and those from more affluent backgrounds continue to narrow, we will require an awful lot more in policy terms than what is now on offer from this Government.</p>

Does the Secretary of State for Children, Schools and Families lie awake at night fretting about next year&#146;s constituency league table and what it might mean for his future? Has Labour&#146;s educational curriculum been distorted and narrowed by the test ahead? I fear that this Bill&#151;this flimsy, incoherent Bill&#151;provides evidence that it has. The Secretary of State has introduced it not to improve education but to fulfil the aspiration that he notoriously described to the <i> New Statesman </i>back in March 2006, when he said that he aspired to create political dividing lines, to show up the Conservatives and to score political points. This Bill was the educational equivalent of the 50p tax rate&#151;another example of the vicious, paranoid, clan-based politics that he and his master have used to claw their way to the top.</p>

But the game is up. People are not fooled anymore; they have had enough of Labour. So I appeal to the Secretary of State to accept his fate, recognise that defeat is inevitable and use the time he has left to try to do something constructive. He should work with Opposition Members not to create dividing lines but to do constructive things, such as introducing the apprenticeships that we would all like as a result of the Bill, because time and again Ministers have failed to show how they will make those apprenticeships a reality. They have made the promise, but they have not put forward the mechanisms with which to deliver it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o472"><a name="90505-0023.htm_para1"><a name="0905066000999">On Second Reading, it was the will of the House that the Autism Bill should be discussed in Committee. The Bill, introduced by the hon. Member for Chesham and Amersham (Mrs. Gillan), will have expenditure implications for the public purse. At the first sitting of the Committee last week, the Chairman confirmed that those implications are significant for certain clauses of the Bill. Therefore, approval for a money resolution is needed before the Committee can engage fully in those discussions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o473"><a name="90505-0023.htm_para2"><a name="0905066001000">I want to stress that the Government, and I personally, share the hon. Lady&#146;s wish to improve services for people with autism, whether children or adults. Indeed, with the Under-Secretary of State for Children, Schools and Families, my hon. Friend the Member for Portsmouth, North (Sarah McCarthy-Fry), I have made clear commitments to take forward a range of work that will achieve all the objectives claimed to be behind the Bill. We will take it forward in a way that is cost-effective and focused on improved outcomes for people with autism. Our determination to deliver real and lasting change for people with the condition is rock solid.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o474"><a name="90505-0023.htm_para3"><a name="0905066001001">Although there was a common aim on Second Reading, I was duty bound to make clear to the House the Government&#146;s view that the Bill, as currently drafted, is not the most effective way to achieve the improvements that we all want, and my view on that has not changed. Nevertheless, the establishment of the Committee to consider the Bill gives us a timely opportunity to discuss all the important issues that it raises. I am looking forward to doing so, confident that the hon. Member for Chesham and Amersham and I will be able to move forward together in a true spirit of mutual interest and collaboration.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o475"><a name="90505-0023.htm_para4"><a name="0905066001002">To do that, however, we need to deal with the money resolution, without which the Committee will not be able to have a detailed discussion of the key clauses of the Bill. On that basis and no other, I commend the resolution to the House.</p>

 I am pleased to speak to the Government&#146;s money resolution on the Autism Bill. I thank them and the Minister for tabling the resolution at this stage. As the Minister acknowledged in his brief contribution, it is necessary to progress discussions of the Bill against the background of the House&#146;s having passed the money resolution.</p>

little give and take on both sides, we may reach agreement on legislation which will give the help that the Minister and I wish to bring to people with autism and their families. Some cost to the public purse is associated with the legislation, and I have been looking at the costs with the National Autistic Society.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o477"><a name="90505-0023.htm_para6"><a name="0905066001005">However, it is becoming more apparent that, in this case, a stitch in time will save nine. That is what the Bill is all about. Expenditure at an early stage, enabling better interventions and better assistance to be given to people with autism, can often help prevent such people from deteriorating into a crisis phase. It is the costs of people in crisis that are often so high, to say nothing of the savings that we may be able to find in terms of the pain and misery that a crisis usually causes the individual and their family.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o478"><a name="90505-0023.htm_para7"><a name="0905066001006">The Minister will be familiar with the Knapp report, which clearly laid out the economic consequences of autism; it certainly makes sobering reading. The aggregate national costs of supporting children with autistic spectrum disorder were estimated to be about &#163;2.7 billion per year, most of which was accounted for by the services used. For adults, the aggregate costs amount to &#163;25 billion each year. Of that, services account for 60 per cent. and lost employment and family expenses account for the remainder.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o479"><a name="90505-0023.htm_para8"><a name="0905066001007">With an annual cost to the economy of about &#163;28 billion, we must be looking for ways to ensure that the best outcomes are achieved for people with ASD and that the money is well spent. Early interventions can help with behaviour patterns, and increased investment at the right time could reduce the high support costs in adulthood. The report points to the reality that greater availability of early interventions will reduce the impact of ASD on the UK economy&#151;but most importantly, it could improve the quality of life for people with ASD and their families. In addition, we will shortly have the National Audit Office report, which will give us a more detailed analysis of the effectiveness of expenditure. I am sure that that will add to the knowledge of what Government need in order to ensure that we improve the quality of outcomes. We need to know how best to spend these resources, and I hope that the Bill will act as a pointer and a general framework for that background.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o480"><a name="90505-0023.htm_para9"><a name="0905066001008">On the clauses relating to children, registration of children with autism on the local authority registers should not present significant cost implications. The cost of an administration assistant to receive the register and manage it totals &#163;210,600 on the last Government-prepared estimate, but as the registers already exist in some form, the additional costs should be marginal. The effective implementation of clause 2 would result in an increase in service provision, but it is also clear that there are significant medium-term and long-term savings to be made by providing the appropriate services at the right time to children with autism.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o481"><a name="90505-0023.htm_para10"><a name="0905066001009">On clause 3, there is existing funding to deliver support for transition through the Aiming High for Disabled Children transition support programme, but there is a low baseline in many authorities, and the &#163;17 million that is already in the budget can only achieve so much. However, as the funding exists, it does not necessarily form any great amount in extra costs under the Bill.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o482"><a name="90505-0023.htm_para11"><a name="0905066001010">On the remainder of the clauses, much of the cost has already been committed by the Department through the announcements that the Minister has made. We are in  <br>

the process of negotiating amendments to the Bill so that it can reflect the generous offer made by the Government to fulfil some of those promises.

<p><a name="stpa_o489"><a name="90505-0023.htm_para18"><a name="0905066001018"><i> Motion made, and Question proposed, </i>That this House do now adjourn.<i> &#151;(Ms Diana R. Johnson.)</i></p>
<a name="ordayhd_32"><a name="90505-0023.htm_ordayhd4"><a name="0905066001097"><h5 align="left">10.11 pm</h5>
<p><a name="st_o331"><a name="0905066001019"><a name="90505-0023.htm_spnew3"><a name="0905066001926"><b>Norman Baker (Lewes) (LD):</b>
 I wish to raise a constituency matter relating to rail services to my constituency, and in particular the impact of the new timetable introduced on 14 December last year. It is fair to say that in the years leading up to last December, my constituents were seeing an improved railway service. We had got over the disaster of the existence of Railtrack and seen new rolling stock introduced and the replacement of Connex with Southern. The number of complaints that I was receiving about rail services was reducing, although of course there were still one or two.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o490"><a name="90505-0023.htm_para19"><a name="0905066001020">All that was good, but there has been an avalanche of complaints from my constituents since the new timetable was brought in on 14 December. The reason for that is that it is fragile by its very nature and disadvantages my constituents in Lewes, Polegate, Seaford, Newhaven, Plumpton and elsewhere. Part of the discussion that took place before the new timetable came in was about what should happen to the Gatwick Express service. A common view&#151;the majority view&#151;was that the dedicated Gatwick Express service should cease, as it occupied platforms with stationary trains at Gatwick, blocking the lines. That was the view of Southern, the current train operating company. The view that it put forward, to which I subscribe, was that the replacement of that dedicated service with trains running through to Brighton or elsewhere would have led to a much more robust and better timetable.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o491"><a name="90505-0023.htm_para20"><a name="0905066001021">The Government were in a difficult position, but I am sorry to say that they appeared to take the side of the aviation industry. They allowed the dedicated Gatwick Express service to continue, albeit in modified form with certain trains routed through to Brighton. The consequence has been that the timetable has been thrown into disarray, with grave consequences for my constituents. Notably, there are now trains running through to Brighton that are lightly loaded, while trains running through to Lewes and Eastbourne are heavily overcrowded. The 18.45 dedicated service to Gatwick from Victoria, for example, has a load of less than 40 per cent., whereas the 18.47 train from Victoria to Lewes and on to Eastbourne has standing room only to Lewes, not least because the number of carriages has been reduced from eight to four on that service. What we have seen overall&#151;Southern has confirmed the figures for me&#151;is four fewer carriages in the rush hour running through to Lewes and Eastbourne than there were before the timetable changes were introduced.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o492"><a name="90505-0023.htm_para21"><a name="0905066001022">I should like to cite one or two examples from constituents for the Minister. I have received a large number of complaints from constituents. It is not possible to do justice to them all this evening, but it is possible to refer to some of them. Southern also appears to have been inundated with complaints, because I am now receiving complaints about its failure to respond to complaints. I did not receive such complaints before, so clearly Southern is overwhelmed with correspondence as well.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o493"><a name="90505-0023.htm_para22"><a name="0905066001023">Here is a typical e-mail from one of my constituents in Seaford:</p>

on a daily basis. And this at a time when fares have also been increased by well over the rate of inflation.</p>
</ul><a name="90505-0023.htm_brev13"><a name="0905066001085"><ul><p class="tabletext">As a disabled person, the overcrowding is not just difficult but can some days make it impossible for me to travel and I have to get off the train again due to the severe pain and discomfort. This in turn has a serious impact on my work as I have had to miss several important meetings because of this over the past few months. In view of that I have recently resorted to travelling first class&#151;at considerable extra cost of around &#163;75 per week&#151;but even then I am still unable to get a seat on some days. For example, on the 17.23 from London Bridge on 13th March, the guard announced that &#145;Due to overcrowding I have decided to decommission the 1st Class Carriages and now any standard class passenger can use this space.&#146; This was the second time this had happened in a week...again on 8th April, all first class seats were taken and there was severe overcrowding in all parts of the train, with the result that I had to stand all the way to Gatwick&#151;at which point I had to give up and get off and get a taxi home instead because I was in such discomfort.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o494"><a name="90505-0023.htm_para23"><a name="0905066001024">A further complaint by a local pressure group draws attention to the following: short formation as a matter of policy on the 16.17 service from Victoria to Eastbourne, which has now been reduced to four carriages; short formation on the 16.57 service, the following train from Victoria to Eastbourne; the removal of the 17.17 London Victoria-to-Seaford and Ore service; serious overcrowding on the 17.23 service from London Bridge, which is the service to which the other constituent whom I have quoted referred; people standing to Haywards Heath or beyond; and the constant late running of the 18.06 service from Victoria to Eastbourne, which is described by the group as a &#147;systematic failing&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o495"><a name="90505-0023.htm_para24"><a name="0905066001025">My third example is from a constituent who says:</p>

</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o496"><a name="90505-0023.htm_para25"><a name="0905066001026">He makes the following suggestion:</p>
<a name="90505-0023.htm_brev15"><a name="0905066001087"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Why not convert at least one of the early evening extended Gatwick Express services from serving Brighton to serving Lewes/Eastbourne instead?&#148;</p>

Perhaps naturally, blame has been levelled at the rail company, which is not entirely without blame for how it has handled the matter. However, the crude political reality is that the company is bidding again for its franchise, as are its three competitors, and is therefore not going to tell the Government, &#147;Your timetable has caused most of these problems.&#148; However, my honest assessment as a local Member of Parliament is that the changes to the timetable that were imposed on Southern, not the timetable that Southern wanted, have caused most of the problems.</p>

I hope he will accept that there is an imbalance between the services to Brighton and those to Lewes. I hope he will also accept, as a matter of fact, that one of the problems with the Gatwick service, to which I have referred, is that the Government have now imposed a requirement on Southern to run trains through from Brighton to Gatwick, and then on to Victoria without stopping. The consequence is that many of the people from Brighton also feel aggrieved because they want to access East Croydon and Clapham Junction but now have fewer direct trains that will allow them to do that. That leads to more pressure being put on the Brighton trains&#151;and trains from other destinations, including Littlehampton and Eastbourne&#151;that do stop at East Croydon and Clapham Junction. People are encouraged to use those trains, which leads to overcrowding on those services.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o500"><a name="90505-0024.htm_para1"><a name="0905066001030">Does the Minister have any figures, from Southern or elsewhere, relating to the overcrowding on particular services? Does he see it as his job to get those figures and then to decide that the timetable should be recast, or does he take the view that this is a matter for Southern to sort out with the rolling stock that it has? I hope that he does not take that latter view, although he could doubtless say that Members on both sides of the House accuse the Department for Transport of micro-management. On this occasion, however, I might welcome some micro-management from the Department.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o501"><a name="90505-0024.htm_para2"><a name="0905066001031">There is also a problem with the rolling stock. I do not mean with the type of rolling stock, which is adequate. The problem is that there is not enough of it. A new timetable was brought in when there was insufficient rolling stock to operate it, because the rolling stock that had been promised simply had not materialised. Southern was also required to operate extra bits round the edges which had not been part of the original franchise, such as the line to Tonbridge and services previously run by South West Trains that had been abandoned and that Southern had picked up. No extra rolling stock was provided to form those services, yet Southern has been leant on by the Department for Transport to hand rolling stock over to Thameslink and First Capital Connect in order that they can run their services.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o502"><a name="90505-0024.htm_para3"><a name="0905066001032">There is an absolute shortage of rolling stock in the south central area. Will the Minister tell me when that shortage will be corrected? I would also like an assurance that when the rolling stock imbalance is corrected, the reduction in the number of carriages running to Lewes, Eastbourne and Polegate in the evening peak will be corrected, and that he will at the very least restore the number of carriages running to Lewes in the evening peak, rather than leaving us four down, as is presently the case.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o503"><a name="90505-0024.htm_para4"><a name="0905066001033">This all comes down to a wider problem, albeit one that the Government inherited. The timetable on which the south central franchise is presently operating is essentially the one that was run by British Rail many decades ago. It has been built on in a higgledy-piggledy fashion, with various changes, ever since. The timetable is, to use a well worn clich&#233;, no longer fit for purpose.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o504"><a name="90505-0024.htm_para5"><a name="0905066001034">There is a desperate need to rewrite the timetable entirely for the south central region, not simply to eliminate the problems that I have identified tonight, and not simply to get more efficiency in the timetable to prevent the delays that are now occurring. Incidentally, the punctuality targets have been woefully missed by  <br>

Southern since the new timetable came in; they have been way below 75 per cent. on many occasions. If the Government envisage passenger numbers growing&#151;I think that they do, and I support them in that objective&#151;where will the capacity on the south central franchise come from, 10 years down the track? Under the present signalling arrangements, there are now trains at every train path in the rush hour, but there are no plans for extra tracks. There are also no plans to reconfigure East Croydon, which needs to be done if we are to get more capacity on the line. There are not even any plans to reopen the line between Lewes and Uckfield, which would provide an alternative northbound route from the south coast to Victoria, assuming that we could get the East Croydon bottleneck sorted out as part of the process.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o505"><a name="90505-0024.htm_para6"><a name="0905066001035">I suggest to the Minister that one of the cheaper options&#151;I do not pretend that it is without problems, or that it could be done overnight&#151;would be to reconfigure the timetable entirely, starting with a blank piece of paper. We need to forget the house of cards that was built into the British Rail timetables of the 1960s and 1970s, and to draw up a timetable that meets people&#146;s needs. The existing one has been designed to fit in with whatever space is available, with all the problems that that creates. A new timetable would also have the benefit of creating passenger incentives. A further benefit would be an end to timetable padding and the unnecessarily long journey times between Lewes, Polegate, Seaford and London.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o506"><a name="90505-0024.htm_para7"><a name="0905066001036">When I was a researcher in the House in the late 1980s, the shortest train journey time from Lewes to Victoria was 49 minutes on a slam-door mark 1 stock train. That rolling stock has been replaced by much faster Electrostar trains, yet the shortest journey time between Lewes and Victoria today is 63 minutes&#151; 14 minutes longer than it was 20 years ago. I emphasise that that is the shortest journey it is possible to make; many journeys are considerably longer within the allowed timetabling. For the reasons I have given, part of the problem is that the Government, Network Rail and the train operating companies have built a timetable on shifting sands&#151;an unsafe and insecure base on which to build a timetable. It is also the case that this problem muddies the waters and lets train companies pad timetables and allow themselves extra time to reach destinations in order to meet their punctuality targets.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o507"><a name="90505-0024.htm_para8"><a name="0905066001037">How can it be, for example, that the normal time allowed to get from Clapham Junction to London Victoria on my service is nine minutes, yet the journey time back from London Victoria to Clapham Junction is six minutes? I am not aware of any particularly severe gradient on that journey; it is simply the rail company building in three minutes of spare capacity to give itself time to get there and meet its punctuality targets. While punctuality was a problem, as it certainly was four or five years ago, perhaps that made some sense, but we should now concentrate on journey times, particularly in commuter land.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o508"><a name="90505-0024.htm_para9"><a name="0905066001038">Outside commuter areas&#151;this applies to the west coast main line, for example&#151;there is competition from air travel and, in a sense, that incentivises a train company to get journey times down, but there is no such incentive on commuter lines, so the Government and the Office  <br>

of Rail Regulation should intervene to ensure that journey times are not absurdly long simply to enable train companies to meet their punctuality targets. As I say, the poor timetable itself is what allows that particular problem to be masked in a way that it should not be.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o509"><a name="90505-0024.htm_para10"><a name="0905066001039">There are other changes that a new timetable should bring along with it&#151;including, for example, an hourly service to Plumpton. Over the years, I have managed, working with others, incrementally to increase the number of trains to Plumpton station. They used to be for rush hours only, but now they run by and large throughout the day, but still with a three-hour gap in the middle. Why is that gap not filled? Why cannot we simply have one train an hour; even the faulty timetable we have at the moment would allow that, yet we have seen no progress from Southern on that matter.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o510"><a name="90505-0024.htm_para11"><a name="0905066001040">Worryingly, the new franchise arrangements specify the old timetable rather than the improved one to Plumpton, so that raises the possibility of further cuts to, rather than an improvement in, services to that station. Will the Minister specifically look at the situation in Plumpton and see what he can do to ensure an hourly service for my constituents? I appreciate that the Minister may not be able to answer this particular point and one or two others I have raised tonight, but if so, I hope that either he or his noble Friend Lord Adonis will drop me a line with answers to any specific questions not addressed tonight.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o511"><a name="90505-0024.htm_para12"><a name="0905066001041">Lastly, let me say that I am a supporter of the railways. I believe in getting people on the trains for environmental and social reasons. I also by and large welcome the direction of travel in which the Government are engaged; it is something that I mostly support. I believe that the Rail Minister, Lord Adonis, is doing a particularly good job, and I am happy to say so in public, on the record and in the House. Over the years I have been MP for Lewes, I have seen a steady improvement in the quality of rail services to my constituency, but that improvement came to an end in December in a sort of own goal by the rail industry and the Government, so I am now asking the Government to recognise the problem and to try to correct it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o512"><a name="90505-0024.htm_para13"><a name="0905066001042">As a minimum, we need an increased number of carriages to Lewes in the rush hour&#151;at the very least, back to the number there were before the timetable changed in December. We need more rolling stock on the 18.47 in particular, as it is standing room only all the way to Lewes on some occasions. We need to redress the balance of carriages between Lewes and Brighton, and we need a commitment, either from the Government or from Network Rail or the ORR&#151;I do not mind who it comes from&#151;that when the timetable is rewritten for December, these matters will be taken on board. There should also be an overall commitment to a complete rewrite of the timetable for the south central region; the Sussex route utilisation strategy now under way provides the opportunity to do that. I say to the Government that they have made some real improvements to rail transport, so it is such a shame to have gone backwards now, as we have as a result of the December timetable. I look to the Minister for his help and support in correcting that.</p>

debate about rail services on the Brighton main line and the effect of the timetable changes on his Lewes constituents.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o513"><a name="90505-0024.htm_para14"><a name="0905066001044">The hon. Gentleman acknowledged the substantial investment that has benefited many towns in Sussex, where, 10 years ago, there was a shabby service provided by the 40-year-old, slam-door rolling stock to which he referred. How they rattled and bumped around the county, providing a poor service. Over these past 10 years, however, we have seen improved services and better rolling stock, as he recognised.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o514"><a name="90505-0024.htm_para15"><a name="0905066001045">Many of the services operating in Sussex use some of the 744 new vehicles that have been on the Southern network since 2003. They are modern, air conditioned and fit for purpose for 21st-century travelling. However, I equally recognise the issue that the hon. Gentleman refers to as timetable padding. I acknowledge that issue as one he has followed up on a number of occasions&#151;indeed recently, in a letter to my noble Friend the Minister of State.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o515"><a name="90505-0024.htm_para16"><a name="0905066001046">The hon. Gentleman referred in his letter, as he did in the debate, to the time taken to complete journeys, saying that</p>
<a name="90505-0024.htm_brev0"><a name="0905066001088"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;new...rolling-stock...ought, all other things being equal, to have reduced journey times.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o516"><a name="90505-0024.htm_para17"><a name="0905066001047">But of course, all other things are not equal, because there are more trains, more passengers, greater demand and additional services for his constituents. Indeed, between 1998 and 2007, patronage in the Sussex route utilisation strategy area increased by some 45 per cent. That is a great success story for the Government policy of investing in what is fundamental in our national rail system, as well as the provision to make it safer, more effective and more efficient&#151;additional resources and seats on those trains to meet the requirements of the travelling public. However, work has to be undertaken to manage that demand, which brings with it certain issues.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o517"><a name="90505-0024.htm_para18"><a name="0905066001048">I believe that the travelling public would prefer a timetable that tells them a reliable time for their arrival at the destination they want, rather than shaving two or three minutes off their journey. They want reliability and affordability. For evidence of that, I look to the major overhaul undertaken by South West Trains in December 2004, which introduced extended, not shortened, journey times, as well as features such as regular repeating service patterns. That timetable change achieved a significant improvement in punctuality, accompanied by a sharp rise in passenger satisfaction ratings.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o518"><a name="90505-0024.htm_para19"><a name="0905066001049">A consultation exercise was undertaken to establish what stakeholders wished to see in the new south central franchise, which is due to commence in September. Few respondents placed importance on journey time reductions. The majority commented on the things that matter to them&#151;capacity, service reliability and passenger information&#151;as the most important issues. They want to know that trains will arrive on time, as laid out in the timetable.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o519"><a name="90505-0024.htm_para20"><a name="0905066001050">I appreciate what the hon. Gentleman said about the timetable. There are many competing demands. The good residents of Eastbourne demand faster trains to London with fewer stops, and, as he said, there is a demand for better services for a number of stations in his constituency. There must be a balance that can meet those requirements.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o520"><a name="90505-0024.htm_para21"><a name="0905066001051">Many of the characteristics of today&#146;s railway timetables are a feature of railway history. Large towns such as Bexhill are an example. Bexhill is located on a line that was originally built as a local route to connect the coastal towns of Kent and East Sussex, rather than as a fast route to London. As a result, it takes some 110 minutes to travel from Bexhill to Victoria. Battle, which is a much smaller town in relative terms and is barely five miles away, is located on a direct line to London Bridge, and the journey time is just 70 minutes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o521"><a name="90505-0024.htm_para22"><a name="0905066001052">One of the main problems associated with the specification of faster journey times is the negative impact that they have on the network capacity. Capacity is most effectively used when all trains on the route have identical performance characteristics. Unfortunately, that does not happen, because, as I have said, there are many competing demands. The Brighton main line is a perfect example, because it is used to satisfy many requirements. There is a strong demand for express trains to such places as Gatwick airport and Brighton, but there is also a requirement to serve quieter stations such as Balcombe and Wivelsfield and the various divergent routes: East Grinstead, Redhill, Arun Valley, and the east and west coastways. All those use different rolling stock with their own particular characteristics. The combination means that no trains, even Gatwick Express trains, can be timetabled in a way that will exploit the full potential of modern high-performance rolling stock.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o522"><a name="90505-0024.htm_para23"><a name="0905066001053">Looking at the timetable that exists today, I think it remarkable that such great achievements have been made. I recognise that problems have been caused by the introduction of the 14 December timetable, about which I shall say more later. However, let me list some of the problems with which the train planners must grapple. There is the dedicated use of the Gatwick Express trains on platforms 13 and 14 at Victoria. There is the restrictive layout of approaches to London Bridge. There are the conflicting moves at the various flat junctions such as Battersea Park, Streatham Common and Gloucester Road, and the convergence of multiple suburban routes in the Croydon area. There is also the two-track railway between Three Bridges and Brighton.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o523"><a name="90505-0024.htm_para24"><a name="0905066001054">The new timetable is fragile and vulnerable. While I recognise that its introduction on 14 December led to a further deterioration in the performance measurement that we normally use, that was partly due to failures in infrastructure. Rolling stock was also a problem, as was severe weather in one of the periods, as I am sure the hon. Gentleman will remember. But the public performance measure for March was 91 per cent., and the April figure was 94 per cent. I do not think that that indicates a failing timetable.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o524"><a name="90505-0024.htm_para25"><a name="0905066001055">The timetable that has been introduced was consulted on for three years. It was not imposed. Overall, there has been a 10 per cent. increase in the number of seats available during the peak period between Victoria and Brighton. As I think the hon. Gentleman recognised, a compromise had to be reached in terms of the non-stop Gatwick Express to the capital, but also in the introduction of more seats for commuters on the Brighton main line. As for the number of complaints received by Southern trains, according to figures from the company, the number of complaints about timetable issues has been only about 5 per cent. of the total number.</p>
