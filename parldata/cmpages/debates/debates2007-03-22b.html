 My hon. Friend&#146;s final suggestion is a matter for the Prime Minister, but let me respond to his earlier points. He is right to say that we have done a great deal to help families on low incomes who face rising fuel bills. Among the measures we announced yesterday were those to help improve the insulation and energy efficiency of homes, which will assist people to cut their fuel bills. My hon.

 Actually, the press releases were issued at the same time, and deliberately so. As the hon. Lady knows, there have been problems with the grants, because the current arrangement is unsatisfactory: at the beginning of each month we make grants available and they run out almost immediately. We have also found that about &#163;5 million of claimed grants have not been spent. The industry knows that there are problems, and we do too. I am glad that the hon. Lady acknowledges that additional money is being made available, and I would like us to take the necessary time to get the scheme right so that we do not repeat past mistakes. Up until yesterday evening, the industry itself had said that we needed to have discussions with it to make sure that the scheme works satisfactorily. It is important that we get the revised scheme up and running. It is also important that the scheme should be time limited to encourage people to do what they can to make their homes more energy efficient and also less dependent on carbon sources of energy generation. The scheme will be in place, but it is better to get it right than again to rush into doing something and to repeat the mistakes that were made in the past.</p>

 As part of the Government&#146;s energy policy, my right hon. Friend is rightly looking into renewable forms of energy and, increasingly, into offshore wind farms. What liaison is he having with the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs so that the voice of the fishermen is heard as more wind farms are licensed, and what liaison is he having with the Department for Transport so that ferry routes are protected, because our seas are not empty and when wind farms are erected that has an impact on other industries?</p>

 That is true up to a point, but it is perfectly possible to set up offshore wind farms and at the same time meet fishermen&#146;s concerns and make sure that those wind farms are not put in sea lanes. We have been doing that satisfactorily across the piece. Let me say, however, that especially at a time when we are concerned to get greener sources of energy, we need more renewables. It is all very well for people to say, &#147;Yes, we agree with that,&#148; but not if they then come along and object to every planning consent that is sought whether onshore or offshore&#151;in other words, if they are in favour of measures, but not in their backyard. We cannot proceed on that basis. If we do so, we will not get more renewable forms of energy.

 The Secretary of State has had eight months since the energy review in which to prepare the White Paper. He tells us today that it will be published in May with the same certainty that he told us on an earlier occasion that it would be published in March. If he carries on like this, his Department will have been abolished before it gets to be published. Does he not understand that those postponements are delaying vital investment decisions in future generating capacity while investors wait for details about a cap-and-trade system, the future of renewable obligation certificates or ROCs, feed-in tariffs, the role of Ofgem and the whole future of the planning system? He cannot just blame that on the judicial decision to require better consultation, as there are many other outstanding issues.

 That is a bit rich coming from a party that does not have a coherent energy policy. The hon. Gentleman will recall that following the judicial review I said that it was likely that the White Paper would be published in May, but that if I could publish it before Easter, I would. As there is precisely one week between now and the Easter recess, it is perhaps a statement of the obvious that it will not be possible to publish it next week, so I thought it helpful to tell the House that it will definitely be published in May.</p>

Gentleman&#146;s substantive points, yes, I know that the industry wants a degree of certainty, but it is not possible to publish an energy White Paper without the consultation paper on nuclear alongside it, because nuclear is an important part of that consideration. I want to make sure that we get the nuclear consultation right, and I do not have the slightest doubt that there are those who will want a judicial review whatever we decide; some people are implacably against nuclear, come what may. However, I want to get these things right, and the overwhelming view in the industry is that it is important that we publish the two papers together, which I will certainly do.</p>

Since 1997, we have halved the previous gap in UK output per worker compared with France, and closed the gap in output per worker compared with Germany. The Department of Trade and Industry has played its part in stimulating competition and enterprise, enhancing flexibility, and promoting science, innovation and skills. We have provided the first-class stewardship of the economy that has helped to raise productivity rates, and that is something that only a Labour Government can do.</p>

I agree entirely that we must continue to work to provide the basic skills, because it is high skills that will enhance our productivity rates.

 I suspected that the hon. Gentleman would raise that point&#151;and I am worried that there have been only two applications. The difficulty is that in order to qualify for the grant a project has to have been operating in the sea for three months.

There are other grants around, however, to help with development at a far earlier stage. I am reluctant to reopen this matter, because it is important that we encourage projects that have a real chance of success. If it appears that no projects have reached that stage, however, perhaps we ought to look at some other form of assistance. The hon.

In addition, &#163;35.9 million has been invested jointly with the Department for Education and Skills under the two rounds of the science research investment fund to update and renew university research infrastructure, and &#163;7.8 million has been invested under the higher education innovation fund and its predecessors to facilitate knowledge transfer from science research.</p>

 I warmly welcome yesterday&#146;s Budget announcement that funding for science will increase by 25 per cent. by 2010&#151;an additional &#163;1,300 million pounds. My hon.

Will those proposals benefit from some of the additional funding for science, and will the Government consider the proposals and respond?</p>

 We had some discussion about that earlier this morning. I am proud of the record of this Labour Government and I would be pleased on another occasion to compare it with the lamentable record of previous Administrations on climate change and renewables. The Government are reforming the renewables obligation, have targets for renewable energy, and have introduced the low carbon buildings programme&#151;with &#163;80 million of funds&#151;not only for householders, but for voluntary organisations and public sector buildings. That is important. There has been a huge demand for householder grants. That is why yesterday it was announced that an additional &#163;6 million for householder capital grants will be available from the Budget, bringing the total funds for householders up to &#163;18 million. We are now having a quick look at that, so that we can announce a new programme. That is why there is a brief suspension of grants during the April period.

The Government have set what I would contend is the most ambitious target ever for a democracy: to reduce carbon emissions by 60 per cent. from what they were in 1990, by the middle of this century&#151;2050.

 My hon. Friend is absolutely right to draw the attention of the House to the impact of caring on women&#146;s ability to build up pension entitlements for the future. One of the key aspects of the Pensions Bill that is going through Parliament is the fact that it puts as much emphasis on caring as it does on paid work. By 2010, as a result of that Bill, about 70 per cent. of all women will be able to build up a full basic state pension, compared with 30 per cent. now. Of course, more will be able to save as well, through the new personal accounts. Although I am, of course, attracted by her proposal of introducing this earlier&#151;I hesitate, perhaps, to say&#151;I think that we have a package that is both affordable and sustainable in the long term. We will bring in the proposals as soon as is practically possible.</p>

state pension entitlement. It is right that as we do that and reduce from 39 to 30 the number of years&#146; contributions for women, we provide a system that is fair and, most importantly, that values care not only for young children up to the age of 12, but for the severely disabled, because many of such people&#146;s carers do not have the opportunity to work and pay the national insurance contributions that others do.</p>

 I very much welcome what the Minister has said so far about help for women pensioners under the new proposals. However, is she aware that some 600,000 women in the UK today are low-paid, part-time workers, often with more than one job, who will not benefit because they fall below the threshold in each of their jobs? The Government say that that cannot be tackled because it is administratively difficult. Does the Minister agree that that, like so many of the hidden messages in  the Chancellor&#146;s Budget yesterday, is simply unfair? In the end, because of that administrative difficulty, it is the poorest, lowest-paid workers in our society who suffer the most under the Chancellor&#146;s policies.</p>

 Of course the House will realise that it is the poorest, lowest-paid pensioners who gain the most from the Budget proposals announced in the House yesterday, and from the successive measures that we Labour Members have taken to boost pensioners&#146; incomes, to tackle pensioner poverty and to make sure that women who care and who have dependent relatives are able to build up pension entitlements. The hon. Lady draws attention to an important point: what about those women who earn less than the lower earnings limit? It is right that we think about them, too, but our pension proposals are a package, and many of those women will benefit from other reforms in the system. For example, if they are spending only a short time outside the labour market on a low income, and have perhaps one or two jobs that leave them below the earnings limit, they will benefit significantly from the reduction in the number of years that they have to contribute. They will also benefit from other measures that take them out of having to pay tax in retirement. Overall, the pension deal clearly benefits women, particularly low-paid women.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o13"><a name="70322-0004.htm_para2"><a name="07032282000164">This week the Treasury&#146;s ex-permanent secretary said that the Chancellor has a</p>
<a name="70322-0004.htm_brev2"><a name="07032282000927"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;very cynical view of mankind and his colleagues&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o14"><a name="70322-0004.htm_para3"><a name="07032282000165">That is not just name-calling; it has serious consequences for Government policy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o15"><a name="70322-0004.htm_para4"><a name="07032282000166">Perhaps it was the Chancellor&#146;s cynical view of mankind that made him think that he would get away with presenting yesterday&#146;s tax con as a tax cut. According to the Institute for Fiscal Studies, 3.5 million families will be worse off. It is a con because when the Chancellor says that he is cutting income tax, people opening their pay packets will realise that his so-called tax cut is cancelled out by stealth taxes elsewhere; it is a con because when he says he is cutting business taxes, small businesses will know that their corporation tax is going up; and it is a con because the changes to income tax will not even come into effect for another year. Will the Leader of the House confirm that when we vote next Tuesday, we will be voting for the existing income tax system&#151;a 10p starting rate and a 22p basic rate?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o16"><a name="70322-0004.htm_para5"><a name="07032282000167">Given his smoke and mirrors performance, it is perhaps no wonder that the Chancellor went quiet on the Lyons review&#151;another tax bombshell waiting to hit hard-working families. Given his reluctance to talk about council tax, may we have a debate on the Lyons review?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o17"><a name="70322-0004.htm_para6"><a name="07032282000168">When he is hitting hard-working families, the Chancellor likes to talk about his tax credits, but Sarah Walker, his director of benefits and credits, says that officials do not expect claimants to understand their tax credit</p>
<a name="70322-0004.htm_brev3"><a name="07032282000928"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;because it can be quite complicated&#148;.</p>

May we have a debate about the chaos of the tax credit system?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o19"><a name="70322-0004.htm_para8"><a name="07032282000170">Before the Budget, the Chancellor and the Prime Minister gave keynote speeches on increasing choice in the NHS, but it is the Chancellor&#146;s Stalinist desire for central state control that has caused the cuts in NHS services. Last weekend, 12,000 doctors turned out on the streets of London to protest against the Government. On Monday, the Secretary of State for Health refused to apologise to them. Yesterday in his Budget speech, the Chancellor referred to himself  96 times, yet he mentioned the NHS just once, and that was to re-announce what he said three years ago. May we have a debate on the crisis in the NHS?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o20"><a name="70322-0004.htm_para9"><a name="07032282000171">I am sure that, like Macavity, the Chancellor and the Leader of the House will have an alibi or two to spare, but to describe yesterday&#146;s Budget as a tax-cutting Budget was worthy of propaganda from Stalin&#146;s Politburo. Was not yesterday&#146;s tax cut yet another tax con for Britain&#146;s hard-working families?</p>

Mugabe. One figure tells it all: life expectancy has shifted in recent years from the age of 60 to 34.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o22"><a name="70322-0004.htm_para11"><a name="07032282000174">I am glad that the right hon. Lady welcomes the statement on Northern Ireland, too. Let me make it clear again, as I did last Thursday, that the choice for the Northern Ireland parties on 26 March&#151;next Monday&#151;is either devolution or dissolution. There can and will be no legislation to alter that date. Her Majesty&#146;s Government believe that the people of Northern Ireland want to see the institutions restored and very much hope that the parties will seize the opportunity of restoration on 26 March.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o23"><a name="70322-0004.htm_para12"><a name="07032282000175">On Alistair Graham, I pointed out last week that it was perfectly normal for the term of office of the Chairman of the Committee on Standards in Public Life to end after one term, and that has indeed been the consistent practice. In respect of trust in politics, I will send the right hon. Lady interesting opinion survey material which shows that in recent years trust in politicians has actually increased. It is particularly high where people know and appreciate the work of their own politicians. That may have something to do with the fact that we have been returned to office in three successive general elections.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o24"><a name="70322-0004.htm_para13"><a name="07032282000176">The right hon. Lady then wittered on about the Chancellor and a tax-adding Budget. She has obviously not read the Red Book, or the National Audit Office endorsement of the figures in it, because if she looks down the figures in table 1.2, to take one of the many tables, she will see that hard-working families have in fact benefited significantly as a result of my right hon. Friend&#146;s Budget. She talks about 3.5 million families. Since she raises the issue of tax credits, let me tell her that their introduction has transformed the lives of millions of hard-working families. Moreover, it has ended the genuine and serious evil under the Conservatives whereby people were trapped in unemployment and unable to get out of that trap because it would cost them more to go back to work than to stay on benefit.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o25"><a name="70322-0004.htm_para14"><a name="07032282000177">I also say to the right hon. Lady that what we have had from the Chancellor&#151;who has been a brilliant Chancellor over the past 10 years, setting this country on a course, from bottom among the G7 countries to second only to the United States&#151;is sensible prudence in being able to balance moderate increases in public spending against what the country can afford. I contrast that with the utter failure of the shadow Chancellor in recent months. He says that he is going to read the riot act to his shadow Cabinet colleagues to avoid their making further spending plans. The shadow Transport Secretary evidently did not hear that, because he went on to announce just recently that he was going to spend an extra &#163;14 billion on building a new rail link from Scotland to London.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o26"><a name="70322-0004.htm_para15"><a name="07032282000178">Conservative Members do not like my mentioning this, but if one adds up Conservative spending plans and then takes account of their pledges to cut taxes, one sees that Conservative economic policies simply do not add up one little jot, whereas Labour&#146;s economic policies for the past 10 years, and going forward, not only added up but produced unparalleled prosperity, investment in public services and jobs.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o27"><a name="70322-0004.htm_para16"><a name="07032282000179">Finally, the right hon. Lady asked me about a debate on the national health service. I would be delighted to have such a debate any time. Part of that debate can be about the huge improvement in East Berkshire primary care trust in the right hon. Lady&#146;s constituency. She forgot to welcome the fact that yesterday there was a &#163;38 million increase in spending for her PCT, announced as part of the &#163;8 billion increase for the health service.</p>

 May I also thank the Leader of the House for the innovation of announcing statements in advance?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o28"><a name="70322-0004.htm_para17"><a name="07032282000183">In the Budget statement, the Chancellor said:</p>
<a name="70322-0004.htm_brev4"><a name="07032282000929"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Nearly 2 million people will see their income tax bills cut in half, and take home 90p of every pound they earn.&#148;&#151;[<i> Official Report</i>, 9 March 1999; Vol. 327, c. 188.]</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o29"><a name="70322-0004.htm_para18"><a name="07032282000184">Of course, that was when he introduced the 10p rate in 1999. He has now removed it by sleight of hand. The right hon. Member for Witney (Mr. Cameron) did not notice, but we did. The effect is to increase higher marginal tax rates for the low paid, discourage work and increase in-work poverty. Following the Budget, can we have a debate on inequality, because inequality is increasing in this country, as the Young Foundation report on rural poverty&#151;often hidden in this country&#151;pointed out yet again? It is time that we had a debate on the effects of what the Chancellor is doing. </p>

<p><a name="stpa_o30"><a name="70322-0004.htm_para19"><a name="07032282000185">May we also have a debate on the position of small businesses? The right hon. Member for Maidenhead (Mrs. May) mentioned small businesses, but did not refer to the fact that small businesses are facing a  &#163;900 million hike in corporation tax. Earlier, we heard the extraordinary, preposterous argument from the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry that that would somehow benefit small businesses, who would be delighted to pay &#163;900 million more, because they might be able to claim some of it back in allowances. The increase will hurt small businesses, and we should have a debate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o31"><a name="70322-0004.htm_para20"><a name="07032282000186">Last week, I asked whether we could have a statement on the Lyons report. The Leader of the House said that that would be encapsulated in the Budget debate. However, the Budget statement did not mention council tax once. It mentioned the Lyons report, but only in respect of industrial property. Council tax is the tax that has the biggest impact on pensioners and those on fixed incomes. After long cogitation, the Lyons report says that the answer to reforming council tax is to carry on with council tax. The only answer to council tax, however, is to scrap it. Can we have a debate on that?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o32"><a name="70322-0004.htm_para21"><a name="07032282000187">Lastly, can we have a debate on surveillance? The Leader of the House may have noticed the innovative plans by the Conservative-run Ealing borough council to put spy cameras in tin cans to catch people putting out wheelie bins early. Obviously, for Ealing borough council, beans means fines. May we have a debate on whether Big Brother is getting out of hand?</p>

They were taken in a small Committee Room with no television cameras; moreover, there were not enough seats for Members, and officials had to sit on the floor. Will the Leader of the House consider making a written statement on this issue next week, or perhaps meeting me to discuss it?</p>

 I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman, too, for the compliments that he has paid to me today and yesterday, when he gave evidence to the Modernisation Committee. As I have said, there are far more demands for debates on the Floor of the House than there is time available, and that has always been the case.

 May we have a debate on the state of the youth justice system? This House has talked briefly about the tragic consequences of youth-on-youth crime in recent weeks, but the reality is that the youth justice system is creaking and unable to cope with the current number of young offenders. The secure estate for young offenders is full and contingency measures are being looked at. The community orders given to young offenders&#151;two thirds of them will get such orders&#151;are being routinely breached. Two thirds of drug rehab orders were breached last year, and 50 per cent. of intensive supervision and surveillance orders were breached. So may we have a serious debate in this House on the youth justice system, which is increasingly the gateway into the justice system for many offenders? I am convinced that, as it stands, it is not set up to succeed.</p>

 Did my hon. Friend notice the subtle adjustment in the withdrawal rate of tax credit in respect of increases in income&#151;a fact that the Chancellor failed to draw to the House&#146;s attention yesterday?</p>

 My right hon. Friend, who was of course a Treasury Minister, has been eagle-eyed and he is right. The increase in the tax credit withdrawal rate will raise &#163;600 million for the Exchequer. Like him, I missed that in the Chancellor&#146;s speech.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o57"><a name="70322-0006.htm_para7"><a name="07032282000292">As I was saying, the Chancellor taxed the low paid to fund his con trick on middle England. That is how desperate he has become. We can see why. He is attacked by those who have worked closest with him. He is less popular even than this Prime Minister. His tax and spend experiment is now deemed a total failure. If people want to know what this Chancellor would be like in No. 10, they should look no further than yesterday&#146;s Budget&#151;stealthy, sneaky and unable to tell the truth. He is not the man who can restore public trust in Government, because he is the reason why people do not believe a word that they say any more.</p>

 I am grateful to my hon. Friend for reminding me of my status and his. When commenting on the Chancellor, will my hon. Friend remind the House that the Chancellor failed to mention the phasing out of the 10p band, which is just the sort of omission that gave us the dodgy dossier on Iraq?</p>

 My right hon. and learned Friend returns to the familiar theme of Iraq, and perhaps we should save it for a later debate. However, he is right to say that people at home listening to the Chancellor must have assumed that they would be better off as a result of a tax-cutting Budget. What the Chancellor did not tell them was that it was a con trick&#151;that the cut in the standard rate of income tax would be more than paid for by the removal of the 10p starting rate and the increase in the national insurance band. It was a classic stealthy trick.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o72"><a name="70322-0007.htm_para13"><a name="07032282000333">What is baffling is that, in this Budget, the Chancellor has taken a completely opposite approach to small-business taxation. There, he has increased the tax rate and introduced more reliefs. What has the right hon. Gentleman done in his time as Chancellor with the small companies tax rate? In 1997, he cut it from  23 to 21 per cent. In 1998, he cut it again to 20 per cent. In 1999, he introduced a new 10 per cent. rate, and in 2002 he abolished the 10 per cent. and made it zero.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o73"><a name="70322-0007.htm_para14"><a name="07032282000334">All that sounds pretty good. Unfortunately, in 2004 the Chancellor put the zero rate back up to 19 per cent. Yesterday, he raised it again to 22 per cent. After  11 Budgets, and six changes in the tax rate, we are pretty much back where we started. The only thing that small businesses have to show for it is a hugely more complicated and burdensome tax system.</p>

Out there in the country it is the biggest political issue of the day. Pick up a local newspaper almost anywhere in the country and it will be full of articles about hospitals facing closure, maternity wards under threat, nursing posts being axed and junior doctors up in arms, yet the NHS hardly features at all in the national newspaper coverage of the Budget. For the Chancellor, it has become the health service that dare not speak its name. That is because he has no one but himself to blame for the monumental waste of public money and the meddling and interfering that have sent NHS staff  <br>

The Chancellor must have done the sums if he has done them for the other Departments.

Will the Secretary of State for Education and Skills confirm that the biggest user of managed service companies in the country is the NHS? Will he explain to the Chancellor that if he puts their taxes up they will put their fees up and that hospital trusts will end up footing the Bill for his entirely self-defeating stealthy manoeuvre?</p>

That means that the share of national income devoted to education is set to fall, yet the 2005 Labour manifesto promised:</p>

They thought they had finally got the Chancellor to sign up to city academies, finally got him to commit himself in public to something that he has spent the past year bad-mouthing in private.

We shall have the same old-fashioned, top-down Stalinist control that is so out of tune with our times. With his last Budget, the Chancellor has shown us that he cannot be the change the country wants&#151;that he is part of the problem, not part of the solution.

accreditation for courses, but one of the consequences of the focus on accredited courses in further education is that a particular group has fallen through the net, namely, adolescents and young adults with learning disabilities who attend FE colleges not to get a certificate but to attend valuable life skills courses. They have been priced out of the market, and I want to know what the Secretary of State is going to do about it. They are probably among the most vulnerable people.</p>

 I accept what the hon. Lady is saying. I have heard this from several quarters. I will go back and look at the matter again, and I will deal with any individual problems that she wishes to raise with me. Time and again, we have said that the priority for the Learning and Skills Council must be people with disabilities and special educational needs. Reconfiguring adult education to focus on longer courses that result in qualifications must not interfere with the important work being done with children with special education needs. I will look into that issue.</p>

All too often, bright and talented children simply do not get the support or help that they require. Early years education is vital to a child&#146;s progression, and we have invested more than &#163;20 billion in that area. There are now almost 1.3 million child care places&#151;double the number for 1997&#151;and more than 1,100 Sure Start children&#146;s centres are providing support to almost  1 million families. With yesterday&#146;s settlement, we can guarantee 3,500 Sure Start children&#146;s centres&#151;one in virtually every community across the country. We have given every three and four-year-old an entitlement to 12.5 hours free early learning, and 96 per cent. of children have taken that up. We will extend that to  15 hours by 2010.</p>

Our aim is for the state sector to match the levels of success in the independent sector, even without the harsh levels of selection in public schools. As the Chancellor confirmed yesterday, we are committed to closing the gap on capital funding with public schools by 2010, with a long-term aim to match spending per pupil.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o100"><a name="70322-0008.htm_para10"><a name="07032282000403">This is not just about finances, however.

 My hon. Friend is right about extended schools achieving better results. Ofsted has recently produced a report that demonstrates that. I have mentioned that every school will be an extended school by 2010. More importantly, my right hon.

 I fear that my right hon. Friend underplays the benefits of extended schools. In Hackney, one of our extended schools, the Hackney Free and Parochial school, is seeking to let a cleaning contract between 10 pm and 6 am, as those are the only hours when the school is not in use, save for one week&#146;s closure in the summer. Hackney schools are genuinely &#147;schools plus&#148;, and this hugely benefits Hackney parents. Does my right hon.

In relation to the theme of this part of my speech, the provision that is now available in state schools matches what has always been available in independent schools. </p>

<p><a name="stpa_o103"><a name="70322-0008.htm_para13"><a name="07032282000410">The fourth point is that private schools are free to build links with other organisations and to develop their own ethos.

I am delighted that we have exceeded our target for schools in trust pathfinders, and I am confident that we will hit 300 by the end of the year. All those measures combined will enable us to make dramatic progress in closing the attainment gap between those from deprived backgrounds and those from more affluent homes.</p>

Green Paper setting out our proposals that every child remain in education or training, full or part-time, in school, college or the workplace, until the age of 18. That is an historic proposal in more ways than one. It is a crucial step forward in meeting the challenges of the 21st century, as Lord Leitch so ably identified in his recent report, but the measure has been incorporated into legislation for most of the past 80 years, without being invoked. It was originally included in Foster&#146;s Education Act 1918&#151;Foster was a Liberal in the days when Liberals won elections. It was then carried into the great Butler reforms of 1944, before finally being revoked by the Tories in 1988.</p>

In the past, it was possible for millions of school leavers with no qualifications to find work. In the face of increased globalisation, with economic expansion in the east and technological advance in the west, those days are drawing to an end. As Lord Leitch pointed out, there will be only approximately 600,000 unskilled jobs in Britain by 2020 compared with 3.6 million today, and 40 per cent. of jobs in 2020 will require graduate qualifications. Of course, we must ensure that there is an exciting and inspiring offer for each child to pursue in key stage 4.</p>

We must get rid of the mixed message that we send to young people that, on the one hand, it is crucial that they stay in education, but, on the other, that it is okay if they just slip off the radar screens at 16.

We rescued that valuable vocational opportunity from near oblivion. The number of apprenticeships has trebled since 1997 and the Budget settlement will ensure that every young qualified person will have a guaranteed place.

A combination of the introduction of the education maintenance allowance and higher attainment, which encourages youngsters to stay on in school, has led to something like a 5 per cent. increase in participation rates. It is also fair to say and worth pointing out that only 1 per cent. of youngsters who are NEET are not in education, employment or training in each of those years&#151;16, 17 and 18.

Some of it is about the fact that they just want to take time out. A lot of it is about disenchantment with education and being able to bring those young people back into the fold.

policy issue that affects the future of our country. We rightly gauge the challenge from India and China in terms of the investment that they are making in higher education and the number of graduates that they produce every year. The Conservatives, having presided over a 40 per cent. cut in per capita funding in our universities, were preparing to make a further 6.5 per cent. cut in funding before the British people removed them from office in 1997. Let us never forget that their response to our proposals was to contract higher education down to a 36 per cent. participation rate.</p>

 My right hon. Friend the Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, East and Wallsend (Mr. Brown) voted for the reform. Opposition Members voted against it in droves. It was one of the most crucial staging posts in how we tackle the economic challenges of the 21st century. Their response was to remove almost &#163;1 billion of higher education funding by removing the existing &#163;1,000 fee, as well as contracting the participation rate to 36 per cent.</p>

 That is absolute, undiluted nonsense. Let us consider what the hon. Gentleman had to say about the issue. He said that the Conservatives did not support the Government&#146;s target for expansion, which was crucial to expand our higher education, and that, as fees are necessary to finance the expansion, if we did not have the expansion, we did not need the fees. I know that the Conservatives flip-flopped on this issue. The right hon. Member for Witney (Mr. Cameron) said that fees should be scrapped&#151;that is clear and precise. They flip-flop on the issue, but we cannot allow them to escape.

Indeed, that allegation was also made by the Liberal Democrats. Last month&#146;s figures from the Universities and Colleges Admissions Service show that 291,000 students have applied to enter university this year, which is a 7.1 per cent. increase. The social class gap, which widened during the 30 years of post-Robbins free higher education, with generous grants, actually narrowed by almost 0.5 per cent. in the first year of variable deferred fees.</p>

chances of Hackney children going to university in droves are still limited. Is this not a question of priorities? Surely it is right that we have been investing in Sure Start and primary and secondary education. If we have to make a choice, it is best to put the money there than to subsidise perhaps wealthier people to go to university, given that we never subsidise cooks, chefs and people in other trades.</p>

 My hon. Friend is right. This is not only about the stage of applying to university.

 The House might be relieved to hear that I will attempt to strike a slightly different tone from the opening speeches. I wish to concentrate on education and to deal with several aspects of that in some detail.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o120"><a name="70322-0010.htm_para0"><a name="07032282000462">I should say from the outset that I welcome many aspects of the Budget, some of which I will highlight in a moment. However, there were conspicuous absences from it and much lack of clarity. I always fail to understand why, when the Government have good tales to tell, they insist on over-selling their announcements. That is entirely counter-productive and it hands the Opposition a stick with which to beat them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o121"><a name="70322-0010.htm_para1"><a name="07032282000463">Extra funding is a good thing and we all welcome it, so why cloud the issue by continuing the false spin of raising funding to private school levels? When the pledge was made last year, it was clearly fatuous and intended not to track increases in private school funding, but to be an aspiration of raising funding to 2006 levels for private schools. Even with that narrower definition, at a forecast growth rate of 2.5 per cent. in real terms, the Institute for Fiscal Studies estimates that we would not get there until 2020. Every child in education at the moment will have left education by that stage, even under the Secretary of State&#146;s proposals in the Green Paper for young people to stay on beyond the age of 16, so the pledge is entirely irrelevant for any child in school today.</p>

However, the claim of increasing funding as a proportion of gross domestic product is rather undermined by the fact that the year-on-year percentage increase is less than the projected economic growth. The shadow Chancellor referred to that point at the outset of his speech. The average rate of economic growth cited in the Budget is 2.75 per cent. over the course of the comprehensive spending review period, so, in fact, there is a shrinkage. I do not  <br>

understand the contradictions in the Red Book, so I hope that the Financial Secretary will give me an explanation when he makes his winding-up speech.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o123"><a name="70322-0010.htm_para3"><a name="07032282000465">Let me welcome the commitment in principle that has been outlined today to raise the education leaving age. Unfortunately, the Department&#146;s rather chaotic withdrawal and replacement of the Green Paper this morning meant that none of us received it in time to go through it in any detail. However, we have made it clear from the outset that we broadly support the initiative. As the Secretary of State said, whether it succeeds will depend on not the strength of the carrots or sticks&#151;or bribes or threats&#151;but whether the proposal includes genuine educational opportunities that are tailored to meet the needs of each individual young person. The success will also depend on how transparent the choices are.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o124"><a name="70322-0010.htm_para4"><a name="07032282000466">We have one of the worst post-16 staying-on rates in the western world. That matters to the economy and for social justice. Some of the most disadvantaged young people miss out on the opportunities that education offers, and such a lack of education has lifelong impacts on a person&#146;s earning potential, life choices and life chances. Sixteen is a critical point. Ninety per cent. of those who stay on in education and do A-levels go to university, but the route back into education is a great deal more difficult for those who opt out.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o125"><a name="70322-0010.htm_para5"><a name="07032282000467">Making the proposal work will depend on much more than enticing 16-year-olds to stay on. It will also depend on changes much further back in the system. Many young people mentally leave school at 14 or 15 and no carrot or stick will re-engage them. The curriculum is key to keeping such young people interested.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o126"><a name="70322-0010.htm_para6"><a name="07032282000468">The Secretary of State referred in detail to diplomas as a means for achieving success. However, he has warned of the risk of these diplomas being seen as the secondary modern qualification. That is why I remain disappointed that the Government have not done as Tomlinson recommended and gone the whole hog by scrapping GCSEs and A-levels and introducing a new, modern, British diploma that would be recognised by all and would allow young people to mix academic and vocational learning.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o127"><a name="70322-0010.htm_para7"><a name="07032282000469">The Secretary of State referred in his speech to the pernicious link between achievement and background.

I am disappointed that the Secretary of State has not taken that on board and delivered Tomlinson in full.</p>

What does the Secretary of State mean by the &#163;200 million for capital? When will that be delivered? We know that there have been great delays in getting building projects in place  <br>

under the Building Schools for the Future programme. If we do not start this project now, by the time we change the learning leaving age, we will not have the capacity to deal with the many more young people who will be staying in education. I would be grateful if the Secretary of State wrote to me about that in detail and, perhaps, placed in the Library an answer setting out exactly what he means by the funding, what he proposes to spend it on, and when it will begin.</p>

It is likely that the young people who are not staying on at the moment will be undertaking more vocational courses. What is the rationale for keeping the educational maintenance allowance at the age of 17? It is not clear why the allowance would be kept in the system when it becomes compulsory to stay on beyond the age of 16.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o130"><a name="70322-0010.htm_para10"><a name="07032282000472">There are several practical steps that the Government should take to make 16-to-18 learning work better. First, they could narrow the gap in funding between colleges and schools, although such a measure was conspicuous by its absence from the Budget. Secondly, they could move 16-to-19 funding from the Learning and Skills Council to local authorities. We could then have some hope of devising a system under which funding would follow the student. The White Paper on further education, published with last year&#146;s Budget, promised that a technical funding group would come up with a new funding system. Where is it? Has it finished the job yet, and may we see the new system, please?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o131"><a name="70322-0010.htm_para11"><a name="07032282000473">It is a long time until 2015, but many young people have already dropped out of the system and need attention now. The training wage for teenagers not in education, employment or training&#151;NEET&#151;is a step in the right direction, but it has been an awfully long time coming. The Government have presided over a  44 per cent. increase in the number of 16 and 17-year-olds in that group. There are 124,000 16 to 17-year-olds in the NEET group, and the pledge offers help for 50,000 of them. How will that help be  targeted, and who will be selected for help? In particular, what does the Secretary of State for Education and Skills propose to do about the disproportionate number of teenagers from Pakistani and Bangladeshi backgrounds in that group? The number doubled between 2004 and 2006, and that must surely be of considerable concern. What research has been done on why those teenagers are failed by the system, and how will the pledge be targeted to help them?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o132"><a name="70322-0010.htm_para12"><a name="07032282000474">The announcement on apprenticeships was much harder to unpick.

The number of young people on apprenticeships has risen from 165,000 to 188,000 in the past five years. At that rate, it will take another  40 years to meet the target. What exactly is the Secretary of State proposing to do differently to ensure that we reach the target more quickly? I am sure that the personalised learning money will be welcomed by all, but we know that the children with the most severe difficulties need a trained teacher to achieve improvements. It is critical that the money is spent in a  <br>

way that works. Putting a child with an adult for half a day a week will not work for all children.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o133"><a name="70322-0010.htm_para13"><a name="07032282000475">Ofsted&#146;s report on the foundation stage pointed out that speaking and listening skills were holding back many young children from progressing. No details about that are attached to the proposals for personalised learning. Does the Secretary of State intend to extend that programme? The money for ChildLine and for listening services is very worthy, but will he clarify how much money will be provided? The National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children is not clear about how much money is being given, and for how long it will be available. I hope that the Government&#146;s commitment signals a shift towards focusing on the problem of bullying in schools. The Government have poured a great deal of money into initiatives to tackle truancy, but we know that a third of children who truant say that they do so out of fear of bullying. Tackling the problem at source would save a great deal of money and result in a good deal more education being provided.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o134"><a name="70322-0010.htm_para14"><a name="07032282000476">I have some further queries. Will the Financial Secretary clarify the pledge on VAT for academies? Does it refer to sports facilities, as was said in the statement, or to buildings, as the Red Book says? I hope that it refers to buildings, because the critical problem for many voluntary sector organisations in most areas is a lack of places to meet. If all academy buildings were opened up to the community, it would make a significant difference, but why have academies been singled out in that regard? Sixth-form colleges are caught in exactly the same trap; they, too, have halls and meeting spaces that could be opened up to the community. Will the Secretary of State consider asking the Chancellor for VAT relief for sixth form colleges, too?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o135"><a name="70322-0010.htm_para15"><a name="07032282000477">Academies were conspicuous by their absence from the Budget. Where is the money to meet the Prime Minister&#146;s pledge of 400 academies by 2010? The Secretary of State referred to the pledge again, so it appears that it has not been dropped, but I cannot tell where the money needed to meet the pledge will come from. Is it coming from the total pot for education, or is there specific funding of which we cannot find mention in the Red Book? If the money is to come from the whole education pot, the pledge on per-pupil funding is a bit meaningless, because the funding will obviously be concentrated in very small pockets.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o136"><a name="70322-0010.htm_para16"><a name="07032282000478">Specialist teachers are also conspicuously absent from the Budget. Last year&#146;s Budget contained a pledge to increase the number of science teachers by 3,000: where are they? The only mention that I could find of recruitment of science teachers related to the review that the Prime Minister has commissioned from Lord Sainsbury of Turville, but no details have been given  on that point. Where is the extra money for  recruiting foreign language teachers, so that the recommendations made in the Dearing report just this month can be met? There are some welcome initiatives in the Budget, but it has been spoilt by over-hype, and there are many conspicuous absences. I hope that, in his winding-up speech, the Financial Secretary can clarify some of the rather obscure aspects of the Budget.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o138"><a name="70322-0010.htm_para18"><a name="07032282000481">I do not understand why the hon. Gentleman both claimed credit for everything that the Government had done in the Budget, and attacked it. Every good proposal made by the Chancellor yesterday the hon. Gentleman said was his idea, or the idea of his buddy, the Leader of the Opposition, but he still ridiculed every aspect of the Budget. I will be interested to see how he and the Opposition vote on various measures next week, because that will be the test of whether they support this tax-cutting Budget. It is the first time in, I think, 75 years that the basic rate of income has been cut, and we should welcome that greatly.</p>

 Madam Deputy Speaker, I am sorry. I did not particularly look for the hon. Gentleman earlier; I apologise if he was here for the whole debate. My attention was, of course, on Front Benchers. Next time, during the Front-Bench speeches, I will look in his direction to make sure that he is here. Oh, now he is leaving the Chamber. That is why I was confused&#151;he keeps changing his position. He needs to have a fixed position, not just in the House, but on issues.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o140"><a name="70322-0010.htm_para20"><a name="07032282000493">I will come to my point about health and education in a moment, but first let me say that the Budget will be warmly welcomed, because it will build on the stability of the past 10 years. We should thank the Chancellor for what he has done. This will obviously be his last Budget, because he will be a candidate in the leadership elections, and I hope very much that he will take over as Prime Minister; he certainly has my support. We would then know that, over the next few years, we will continue to have stability.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o141"><a name="70322-0010.htm_para21"><a name="07032282000494">Let us look at health, because the hon. Member for West Chelmsford (Mr. Burns), who was a Health Minister in the last Conservative Government, mentioned it. We have benefited a great deal in Leicester from a huge injection of cash. Some  &#163;760 million will go towards our new pathway project. Leicester general hospital will be rebuilt and changed substantially, and Glenfield hospital and Leicester royal infirmary will benefit, too. Three brand-new hospitals will benefit the people of Leicester, East. Only a few weeks ago, the Minister of State, my hon. Friend the Member for Leigh (Andy Burnham), visited my constituency to launch the new local improvement finance trust centre in Charnwood, which has received &#163;12.8 million. Another centre is being built in the Humberstone and Hamilton area of my constituency, which did not exist when I became a Member of Parliament 20 years ago, because it is new build. There is a centre, too, in Belgrave in the heart of the inner city of Leicester, East.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o142"><a name="70322-0010.htm_para22"><a name="07032282000495">That shows a real commitment to the health service. Of course, I have raised concerns in the past, and I did so two weeks ago, as one of my constituents, Mark Golding, had waited for four months for a double hernia operation. I understand that it is a very painful condition. The hon. Member for West Chelmsford nods&#151;he may well have suffered from it himself. Mr. Golding was in great agony, and he had to wait, which is wrong. We have spent a great deal of money on the health service, so why should people have to wait so long for operations? Lo and behold, after I raised the matter in Health questions, the next day, Mr. Golding received an appointment for a hernia operation. Obviously, we do not want people to keep writing to us all the time. [Hon. Members: &#147;Oh!&#148;] We want to them to write to us with their concerns, but we do not want them to believe that just by our raising the  <br>

matter on the Floor of the House they can get their operation, as there is a system in place. I am making the point that a lot of cash has gone in: what we need to look at is the delivery of services, which is up to the local primary care trust, not the Secretary of State for Health. I do not expect her or her junior Ministers to conduct those operations, but I do expect them to set the overall framework so that the local delivery of health services is as effective as possible.</p>

<p><a name="st_o297"><a name="07032282000496"><a name="70322-0010.htm_spnew12"><a name="07032282001302"><b>Mr. John Baron (Billericay) (Con):</b>
 The right hon. Gentleman made a point about hospital waiting lists. Despite the doubling of the money spent on the NHS under the Government, why have hospital waiting times, as measured by hospital episode statistics, fallen by only five days in the past 10 years from 11.8 weeks to 11.1 weeks? Does he accept that that clearly shows that the money has not been well spent, and is not getting to front-line services?</p>

<p><a name="st_o298"><a name="07032282000497"><a name="70322-0010.htm_spnew13"><a name="07032282001303"><b>Keith Vaz:</b>
 I do not. The hon. Gentleman has a great deal of knowledge as a shadow Health Minister, so he knows much more about the economics of those issues than I do. We are meeting our targets, and the people who come to us are exceptions. Mr. Golding was the first case with which I have dealt in the past year of a constituent who is concerned about the delay&#151;we would know if there were other such urgent cases, because people would contact their MPs&#151;so matters are progressing, and I welcome that. The money has gone to front-line services, and it has improved our targets, which is to the benefit of our constituents, but of course it is important that we look at the way in which services are delivered locally by officials.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o143"><a name="70322-0010.htm_para23"><a name="07032282000498">I agree that there are too many managers in our local health service, which is why I welcome the meeting that I held last Thursday with Tim Rideout, the new chief executive of Leicester PCT, who told me that a tier of management will be removed in Leicester, so even more money will be spent on local services. Mistakes have been made. One PCT would be sufficient in a city such as Leicester, so goodness knows why we had to have two. Such decisions must be looked at very carefully indeed, as we are dealing with public money, but I am pleased with the large investment in the health service in Leicester. The Under-Secretary of State for Education and Skills, my hon. Friend the Member for Gloucester (Mr. Dhanda), is in the Chamber, so I hope that he will tell his colleagues how pleased we were to receive a visit from the Minister for Schools. Sadly, when he came to Leicester to meet the leader of the Liberal Democrat council, I could not attend, because it was a mid-week visit, but he looked at Judgemeadow community college, which will be completely rebuilt, and St. Paul&#146;s&#151;not that St. Paul&#146;s, but another one in Leicester&#151;a Catholic school, which the Minister opened, which has received public funding to build a new performing arts centre. Our schools are going to rebuilt, as a result of the largest investment by any Government in education in Leicester. Some  &#163;230 million is going into the local education system, which we should welcome enormously. The Opposition chant, &#147;Where has the money gone?&#148;, and the answer is that it has gone on local services, to improve them and provide benefits for our constituents, which is why they are happy with what the Government have done, and why they elected them three times in a row with large majorities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o144"><a name="70322-0011.htm_para0"><a name="07032282000499">I turn to Britain&#146;s position in the world and the way in which the Budget helps us to build on our achievements in Europe. I am glad that the Chief Secretary to the Treasury is in the Chamber, because he has performed many excellent ministerial roles in the past 10 years, including negotiating with our European partners. Tomorrow is the seventh anniversary of the adoption of the Lisbon agenda. I had the privilege of serving as Minister for Europe at the time, and I saw the way in which the Prime Minister negotiated a set of benchmarks for the European economy, if I may put it like that. For the first time ever at a European summit, we put in place a set of benchmarks against which the European economies would be measured, to see whether they were successful. It was not the usual warm words that are spoken European summits, where everything is wonderful and everyone is happy with everything that Europe has done.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o145"><a name="70322-0011.htm_para1"><a name="07051034000001">Those benchmarks were revisited two years ago on the fifth anniversary of the Lisbon agenda&#151;the Kok report, too, looked at the success of European economies after Lisbon&#151;so we can determine how well we have done against the Lisbon criteria. There has been growth of 25 per cent. in the past eight years and, moreover, we are the fourth-best performing economy on criteria in the Lisbon agenda. We are the best of the big European economies, and that is because of the Government&#146;s policies. If we want to turn the European Union into the most dynamic and knowledge-based economy in the world, and if the competition is the United States, as it always is, we can see that the benchmarks set at Lisbon have made an extremely important contribution to what our Chancellor and the Treasury team have achieved in trying to move the agenda forward. That agenda has not only provided a strong economy, but has created jobs.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o146"><a name="70322-0011.htm_para2"><a name="07032282000500">There was a great deal of concern among Opposition Members about the arrival of our fellow citizens from eastern Europe when the A8 joined a few years ago. They voiced criticism and, in fact, the then Leader of the Opposition, the right hon. and learned Member for Folkestone and Hythe (Mr. Howard), was going to go to Luton airport to judge how many EU citizens were coming to work in this country. Enlargement, however, has been an enormous success, and the Government, the Prime Minister and the Chancellor have led the process of enlargement. The combination of enlargement and the Lisbon agenda means that the citizens of the A8 who have come to the UK have produced huge benefits for our economy. Their taxes have benefited the economy, and their hard work and dedication have helped us to keep our place, which is why the Germans and the French must regret very much failing to do what we did two years ago, when we allowed the A8 citizens unfettered access to the UK.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o147"><a name="70322-0011.htm_para3"><a name="07032282000501">I was disappointed that on 1 January this year we did not extend that unfettered access to the Romanians and Bulgarians, as I believed that allow such access would further help the economy and make it even stronger. However, a review has been promised by the Home Secretary, and I hope that my right hon. Friend the Chief Secretary to the Treasury, who knows those reports and the statistics, will tell him that the enlargement of the European Union and our success on the Lisbon agenda have provided a huge boost to our economy.</p>

 Does the right hon. Gentleman accept that, even if there are the advantages in labour market terms that he suggests from the employment of the huge influx from the eastern European countries, it must also have had an effect on the housing market? Would he like to speculate how many houses are required to house 600,000 people?</p>

 I know that the right hon. Gentleman poses those questions sincerely. I have had no evidence at my surgeries or any anecdotal evidence at meetings that the A8 citizens are putting pressure on our housing market. He may have evidence, but I have none. If they contribute through their taxes to the British economy, they are entitled. The right hon. Gentleman is a former Secretary of State for Social Security. Very few of the A8 citizens have claimed benefits. The Minister, I know, will have the figures at his fingertips. A tiny proportion&#151;145 was the last figure that I heard&#151;of the hundreds of thousands who have come into the country have claimed benefits. If they come to the UK, pay their taxes, are not exploited and are paid the minimum wage, that is how they contribute to the economy, and it is up to local authorities to make up the difference. Any Member who represents an inner-city area knows that that is the case. That has been the magnet for people to come to this country.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o148"><a name="70322-0011.htm_para4"><a name="07032282000504">I shall make two final points. The first concerns the GE factory in my constituency, which is about to close with the loss of 287 jobs, despite the booming economy. I have had meetings with the Minister for Industry and the Regions about that. The factory has been in existence for over 60 years, and was originally owned by Thorn. It used to make the majority of the light bulbs for the whole of Europe&#151;the lights in Europe started in Rushy Mead in Leicester&#151;first for Thorn and then for General Electric, the second largest company in the world. GE has decided to close the factory, against my wishes, against the wishes of local people and against the wishes of the council.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o149"><a name="70322-0011.htm_para5"><a name="07032282000505">Sadly, the Budget&#151;the reduction in corporation tax, which I welcome, and the reduction in personal income tax, which I mentioned&#151;comes too late for the factory and the work force. As I was pressed by the hon. Member for Wycombe (Mr. Goodman), I am happy  to clarify that that will be the lowest level of tax for  75 years. I am happy to put that on the record, before he jumps up at the end of the debate and starts accusing me of a lack of knowledge of economics. Although I did economics at A-level, I plead guilty to the error and I am happy to put the record straight.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o150"><a name="70322-0011.htm_para6"><a name="07032282000506">I wish the factory could have remained open. My constituents have worked in Rushy Mead all their lives and now they have no jobs to go to. That is the problem with globalisation, which the Chancellor is good at talking about because of his visits to China and India. He has spoken about globalisation and the need to make our economy competitive. The GE jobs are going initially go Hungary and eventually to China, so we need to find a way of retraining our people so that they get they skills that they need.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o151"><a name="70322-0011.htm_para7"><a name="07032282000507">Finally, I am glad the right hon. Member for Hitchin and Harpenden (Mr. Lilley) is present, as I have some nice things to say about him. Sixteen years ago the Bank of Credit and Commerce International closed,  <br>

on 5 July 1991. I have raised with the Treasury, and it may well be in the Red Book, which I have not yet seen, the issue of BCCI and how helpful the right hon. Gentleman was to me and to those who lost their deposits, their homes and their jobs 16 years ago. He was the best Secretary of State to have dealt with the matter over the past 16 years.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o152"><a name="70322-0011.htm_para8"><a name="07032282000508">How sad it is that after 16 years BCCI is still in liquidation, with the liquidators still bleeding the bank, or what is left of it, with their huge fees. How sad it is that a Labour Government, after 10 years, have not put sufficient pressure, through the Treasury and the Department of Trade and Industry, on the Insolvency Service, which is part of Government, to put pressure on the liquidators to close the liquidation. If my right hon. Friend the Chief Secretary or the Financial Secretary gives the Governor of the Bank of England a ring about BCCI, he will hear how sad and how angry the Governor is about the fact that the Treasury still has not sorted the matter out. He and former Governors have had to go to court because the liquidators sued the Bank of England and have had to settle out of court.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o153"><a name="70322-0011.htm_para9"><a name="07032282000509">I should like to hear in the winding-up speech whether the liquidators have paid the costs of the case over to the Bank of England. I want to ask the Chief Secretary&#151;I know he is not the Minister with responsibility for banking&#151;to say to the Minister with responsibility for banking, &#147;Yet another Budget where we should have made provision for BCCI, yet no solution. Why is it that all the senior partners of Touche Ross over 16 years have dealt with the matter and have all become multimillionaires, and still there is money in the bank that has not been paid out?&#148;</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o154"><a name="70322-0011.htm_para10"><a name="07032282000510">I was very nice to the former Secretary of State, the right hon.

That was what he said when he was Chancellor. Only 80 per cent. of the money has now been paid back. Please, under this Government, let us do the decent thing and close the liquidation. The Treasury must talk to the DTI to try to resolve the matter.</p>

<notus-date day="22" month="3" year="2007" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><b>22 Mar 2007 : Column 994</b><br>

<p><a name="stpa_o156"><a name="70322-0011.htm_para12"><a name="07032282000513">The Budget was difficult to judge because part of the picture was missing&#151;that is, the now receding outcome of the comprehensive spending review, originally scheduled for this summer, and now forecast in detail for the autumn. Until we can put the tax raising and spending parts of the economy together, it is difficult to know how good are the claims made by the Chancellor were yesterday. We know that effectively there will be a squeeze on public expenditure, and if the Government will not pay for certain services, individuals may have to provide those themselves. That, from their standpoint, would be the equivalent of a further tax.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o157"><a name="70322-0011.htm_para13"><a name="07032282000514">The Chancellor was also silent on one tax rise that we know is definitely coming and that will arrive from 1 April&#151;the likely 5 per cent. increase in council tax across the United Kingdom. Many hard-working families will see a real departure of money from their balance before any of the changes announced by the Chancellor can affect their personal budgets. This has been the silent tax throughout the time the Labour Government have been in power, in that above-inflation increases in council tax have happened year in, year out. Not just hard pressed families, but many pensioners are struggling to pay their council tax. And they will have had little relief from the telephone directory-size-Lyons report.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o158"><a name="70322-0011.htm_para14"><a name="07032282000515">Another element was missing from the Red Book and I hope that the Financial Secretary will give some thought to remedying that in future. Over the Chancellor&#146;s period in office, there have been many, many changes to the tax system, but no evaluation is ever provided as to whether they have produced any net benefit to the economy. For example, the Government have spent over &#163;1.5 billion on reliefs to the British film industry. When I tabled parliamentary questions asking for some kind of evaluation, I was referred to the film industry&#146;s own reports on its overall progress. We have no indication from the Treasury of how many starts on new British films have occurred as a result of the umpteen tax changes that have affected the film industry. With &#163;1.5 billion of taxpayers&#146; money put into one industry alone, I should have thought that some kind of assessment should be available.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o159"><a name="70322-0011.htm_para15"><a name="07032282000516">I remember a small tax change some years ago whereby the rate of VAT on children&#146;s car seats was reduced, with the claim that that would somehow improve children&#146;s safety. I applaud that aim, but where was the evaluation of whether the expenditure of  &#163;5 million of the public&#146;s money ever gave us anything by way of improved safety?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o160"><a name="70322-0011.htm_para16"><a name="07032282000517">A more controversial area is the ending of the payable tax credit as regards pension provision&#151;a major change during this Chancellor&#146;s stewardship of Treasury matters that was initially a &#163;5 billion reduction in the amount of money going into pension funds. There has been much debate and argument about it. I, for one, would be interested to see a Treasury appraisal of that major change in the way in which pensions are funded, but nothing has appeared. If I had time, I could go through nearly every tax change that the Chancellor has made, for which there has been no impact study or evaluation to find out whether it worked.</p>

should reflect for a moment on his track record. Personal tax allowances&#151;much has been said about the personal tax content in this Budget&#151;have, by and large, been increased by the rate of price increases, not earnings. As a result, the Chancellor has accumulated the equivalent of another 7p in the pound in tax take&#151;an increase in revenue equivalent to &#163;29 billion during his lifetime as Chancellor. That fiscal drift has also meant that another 1.5 million people are now in a higher-rate tax bracket. I acknowledge that economic growth and increasing earnings account for part of that, but an awful lot of it has to do with fiscal drag. As for the tax bill for households, in 1997 the average household spend was 33.6 per cent. of income; now, it is 38.3 per cent.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o162"><a name="70322-0011.htm_para18"><a name="07032282000519">One can go on looking at other areas. For example, while house prices have doubled, stamp duty thresholds, with the exception of the lower band, have not changed. The revenue from that area has increased by a staggering 582 per cent. In terms of investment in the economy, the percentage of gross domestic product invested in pensions when this Government came to power was 6 per cent.; now, it is significantly lower. The savings ratio has fallen from 10 to 5.3 per cent. Total debt in the economy is up by 160 per cent., at &#163;1.3 trillion. Public spending as a share of GDP has, over the lifetime of the Government, increased from 34.7 to 44.9 per cent.&#151;an increase of 7.5 per cent. In the United States, our economic rival, public expenditure has increased by 2.4 per cent.; in Germany, the figure is 1.7 per cent. The cost to business of compliance with the multiplicity of the Chancellor&#146;s tax changes since 1997 is estimated by the British Chambers of Commerce at an additional &#163;40 billion.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o163"><a name="70322-0011.htm_para19"><a name="07032282000520">In 2001 the Chancellor announced that Government debt over the next five-year period was to be &#163;28 billion; by 2006, that had risen by an additional &#163;129 billion&#151;a &#163;101 billion overspend. Now this Budget, by contrast with the situation that was announced in the pre-Budget report for borrowing, contains a further &#163;8 billion. I would say to the Financial Secretary that Treasury forecasting is very much in need of a review as regards its accuracy. If we go back through the Red Books, we see an increasing difference between what was promised and what was delivered, particularly on the key measure of Government borrowing.</p>

Let me first acknowledge the activities of one person who was not mentioned in the Chancellor&#146;s plaudits yesterday&#151;the Paymaster General, who is continuing to provide support for the tax law rewrite exercise. That started during my time in the Treasury, and I am pleased that the Government have continued it over the past 10 years. The Treasury has also introduced some important anti-avoidance measures whereby those who wish to avoid tax must get Treasury approval in the first instance.</p>

 I, too, have taken an interest over many years, from a professional point of view, in the tax law rewrite. Does the right hon.

 I am grateful for the hon. Gentleman&#146;s observations. We do not necessarily need another commission, but the rewrite exercise&#146;s remit needs to be expanded to take account of his thought process by allowing for the expertise of the tax industry, which has been devoted selflessly and tirelessly to the rewriting of our tax law in plain English. The lessons that have come out of that should be developed, in partnership with the Treasury and Her Majesty&#146;s Revenue and Customs, into an exercise to improve and simplify the operation of our tax system without putting revenue raising at risk.</p>

On the basis of the average mortgage&#151;&#163;123,000, according to the Council of Mortgage Lenders&#151;a quarter of a point change in the Bank of England&#146;s base rate would cost people &#163;25 a month or &#163;300 a year extra. That has a far more profound importance as regards their personal budgets than the relatively small changes in the tax system that were discussed yesterday. That puts particular emphasis on the continuing importance of monetary policy.</p>

I asked the Library to provide me with a comparison between average prices, GDP growth rates and interest rates in the UK and the United States over the period 1998 to 2006. In the UK, interest rates were 5 per cent., price changes based on the consumer prices index were 2.9 per cent., and growth was 3.1 per cent. In the United States, interest rates were 3.64 per cent., price changes were slightly below, at 2.9 per cent., and growth was 3.5 per cent. I conclude from that that this other open, free market economy has some advantage allowing it to run lower interest rates than we can, and we should explore why. A recent International Monetary Fund report clearly identified the difference between the inflation rate in the manufacturing and service sectors:</p>

service sector, to ensure that it is efficient and not unnecessarily driving inflation. That was borne out in the same IMF report in relation to labour productivity growth in tradeables&#151;as it calls the manufacturing sector&#151;in the United Kingdom between 1995 and 2004. A 2.93 per cent. change is quoted, with a 1.4 per cent. increase in productivity for non-tradeables. In the United States, however, the figures are 3.5 per cent. versus 1.99 per cent. That difference needs to be looked at, and I hope that the Financial Secretary will agree that a consideration of the structural side of the economy has some merits.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o170"><a name="70322-0011.htm_para26"><a name="07032282000529">In previous speeches on the Budget, I have commented on the subject of inheritance tax. Originally, I advocated its abolition, but I recognise that anyone who says that a tax should be abolished must tell the Government, or the Opposition, of the day where the money will come from. Given that more estates are now being drawn into inheritance tax, I decided that an alternative approach was merited. Older people who want to pass on the fruits of their labour have a considerable worry that house price inflation will draw them into the complex web of inheritance tax, with its 40 per cent. marginal rate. There is now a case to re-examine that tax.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o171"><a name="70322-0011.htm_para27"><a name="07032282000530">I posed to the Library of the House the following question. If the inheritance tax threshold remained where it is now, and if all inheritance tax exemptions were removed, what rate of inheritance tax would be necessary to maintain the current yield? The answer that came back was a marginal rate of 10 per cent. If we modified that proposition by continuing the exemption from inheritance tax for the surviving spouse, a rate of 12.5 per cent. would result. With a simpler, more straightforward inheritance tax with low marginal rates, we might not have the situation in which avoidance was the privilege of the rich and sophisticated. That analysis shows that there is a case for re-examining the way in which inheritance tax operates.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o172"><a name="70322-0011.htm_para28"><a name="07032282000531">From the same analysis, I also discovered that if we removed ways of avoiding inheritance tax, and had a threshold of &#163;750,000, we would still be left with a  40 per cent. marginal rate. We can play tunes with the inheritance tax system, and the time is now right for a thorough review to remove complexity and try to introduce a lower marginal rate.</p>

review include some analysis of adopting the system in Germany, where the buy-in tariff on self-generated electricity provides a return to the individual of four times the price paid for purchasing electricity centrally. That system has dramatically increased the amount of power generated by renewables sources to 10 per cent., at no cost to the German Government and with no grants. The better buy-back price guaranteed for a period of 20 years, with the cost spread out among all electricity users, means that the average German household spends only &#8364;2 extra on their electricity bills, while still delivering a 10 per cent. renewable rate. Neither this country&#146;s renewables obligation certificate, nor Ofgem&#146;s proposals for consultation on the removal or replacement of the current ROC system, replicate the German success, which has led to widespread localised electricity generation through photovoltaic cells, wind or combined heat and power.</p>

Again, Germany provides substantial examples of local investment by local people in combined heat and power schemes, thus removing the burden from Government but ensuring that the community has the right conditions to fund effectively their own environmental programmes. Will the Financial Secretary consider a third way in the range of individual savings accounts provided to encourage personal and private investment in energy-saving projects? Either personal involvement in an ISA dedicated to that purpose or changing the operation of venture capital taxation to encourage more investment in localised schemes, coupled with improved buy-back prices for electricity, could radically transform the opportunities for localised power and heat generation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o176"><a name="70322-0012.htm_para2"><a name="07032282000535">The Financial Secretary should also consider the derogation on duty for biofuels. When the price of oil went up, the numbers wishing to invest in biofuels production substantially increased. It has become clear during the Select Committee&#146;s inquiry, however, that some producers reduce production as the price of oil decreases, as it is no longer profitable, and the duty derogation does not provide an effective subsidy to cover the additional costs. Is it not possible to vary that subsidy according to the price of hydrocarbon fuel, so that the amount of money going back to a biofuel producer when the price is $80 or $90 a barrel is considerably more than when the price decreases to  $50 or less? Take-up of the Government&#146;s help to the second-generation biofuels industry needs further encouragement if we are to sort out the food-fuel paradox, because such investment is slower in this country than in continental Europe.</p>

They could have come up with better ways of drawing to passengers&#146; attention the carbon implications of their journeys. I would favour not a tax but a carbon offset scheme, enabling people to know how much carbon their journeys were costing. Some of the work of the CarbonNeutral Company, for instance, could help to identify the carbon cost of journeys. Most important, the money raised could be put in a pot and help to fund carbon dioxide-reducing activity. Perhaps there could be a special lottery fund for localised and community-based activity, or a fund to give further support to projects such as the low carbon buildings programme.</p>

It is a policy that the Government have espoused throughout their term in office, and their investment has produced spectacular results. Standards of literacy and numeracy have risen dramatically in our primary schools, and the key stage 3 strategy is improving results in secondary schools. More young people are obtaining five good GCSEs than ever before, and we ought to recognise and celebrate their achievements, because they are too often denigrated when the results are published.

determined by the social class into which he or she is born. That inequity must give Ministers sleepless nights, but the social and economic consequences are also potentially catastrophic. We know&#151;we heard it again this afternoon&#151;that the number of unskilled jobs in the economy is set to decline, and that the number requiring higher-level skills will rise. If we do not tackle educational low achievement and under-achievement, there is a risk that a section of our society will not be able to obtain jobs and that the gap between the haves and the have-nots will increase, with consequent damage to civic society. That is how high the stakes are in respect of education, because what is at stake is the kind of society that we produce, not only in economic terms but in a host of other areas as well. </p>

<p><a name="stpa_o184"><a name="70322-0012.htm_para10"><a name="07032282000544">The Government have taken steps to tackle under-achievement. There have been valuable initiatives such as those to do with children&#146;s centres and extended schools, but many such initiatives attempt to tackle the problem through making changes to the structures of the school system, and I have concerns about how well that works, because I think that the jury is still out on a number of them. First, there is doubt about how well some of the initiatives gel with what the Government are trying to do in other areas&#151;making schools the focus of their community, for example, or having extended schools. There is also an issue to do with dynamic leadership, which we talk about often in terms of education. That is important, but unless such dynamic leadership feeds through to improvements in teaching and learning&#151;unless it is embedded in the system&#151;when the leader moves on, the school might decline again. We should focus our education spending much more on developing the curriculum and improving teacher training. Those are the keys to improving education.</p>

Of the nine academies inspected, overall effectiveness was judged to be good in three, satisfactory in five and inadequate in one.

That is a plus in one sense, but it also makes it extremely difficult to compare results because we are not comparing like with like. Some academies have a very high expulsion rate&#151;much higher than that of the local authorities in which they are situated. If difficult and challenging children are moving to other schools in the system, that also makes comparing results difficult, because the challenges presented by such children are not tackled, but moved somewhere else.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o187"><a name="70322-0012.htm_para13"><a name="07032282000549">There has also been the specialist schools programme. The Education and Skills Committee&#151;and that Committee in its previous incarnation as the Education Committee&#151;has made it clear that there are varying assessments of that programme. It is undoubtedly true that many specialist schools have improved their results and that they have offered further opportunities to many children, but let us look at last year&#146;s results. The average point score at GCSE in specialist schools increased by 10.5 per cent. but it increased throughout the secondary school maintained sector by 10.8 per cent. It is therefore very difficult to draw conclusions from those results at these early stages.</p>

To make matters more confusing, in some areas certain things have worked and Government interventions have been very successful. For example, in 1997-98, 45.9 per cent. of schools in the most deprived wards were in special measures; by 2004-05, that figure had fallen to 28.8 per cent. Primary schools with the highest number of children on free school meals&#151;a good rough index of deprivation&#151;had narrowed the results gap on schools with a smaller proportion of children on free school meals.</p>

most challenging schools. The biggest single indicator of low educational achievement in this country is not ethnicity or gender, but poverty: the simple question of whether a child is born poor. Of course, that does not mean that all poor children are destined to fail&#151;some schools prove triumphantly that that is not so&#151;but it is more likely to happen.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o190"><a name="70322-0012.htm_para16"><a name="07032282000554">So in making our spending decisions, the first question that we need to ask is, what do we do about the curriculum? What do our children need to flourish in the 21st century? The problems that they will face are quite different from the ones that we have had to face. They are growing up in a world of vast movements of people. They will indeed be global citizens, and many of them will work abroad at some time in their lives. Families are scattered and communities often fragmented; schools have a role to play in dealing with that. Most of all, our children are growing up in an age of mountains of information: in a multi-media age in which, at the touch of a button, the internet can provide information&#151;some good, some bad&#151;on every subject under the sun. Unless we teach them to deal with that information overload, we will not be preparing them adequately for the world in which they will grow up.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o191"><a name="70322-0012.htm_para17"><a name="07032282000555">I accept that we in this country are not good at talking about the schools curriculum. We tend to assume that we know what everyone should learn, and usually, it is what we ourselves learned. As a result, our curriculum is still based on a 19th-century curriculum. It has been tweaked here and there and bits have been added and subtracted, but it is recognisable as the same curriculum. That is not good enough for the  21st century. We need to ask much closer questions about what our children learn. If we all accept, as I assume we do, that the building blocks of the curriculum are literacy and numeracy, because they are the foundation of all other learning, we have to ask, &#147;What next?&#148;. I wish to make a few suggestions. They are not prescriptive or even a full list, but they are suggestions that we should debate&#151;</p>

Order. I wonder whether the hon. Lady, when she makes her suggestions, will be able to link them to the comments in the Budget speech that the Chancellor made.</p>

<p><a name="st_o310"><a name="07032282000557"><a name="70322-0012.htm_spnew6"><a name="07032282001315"><b>Helen Jones:</b>
 I will try to do so, Madam Deputy Speaker. My argument is that our money should be spent on developing the curriculum and on training teachers to deliver it. That is the key to improving teaching and learning.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o192"><a name="70322-0012.htm_para18"><a name="07032282000558">My first suggestion is that our children should learn about their own country, its history, traditions and culture. That is easy to say, but it takes a lot of thought and spending to develop that curriculum. If there are two historians in a room, they will have three different views on how to deliver the history curriculum. English teachers will argue for a long time about what children should be reading.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o193"><a name="70322-0012.htm_para19"><a name="07032282000559">I suggest that we need to be guided by two points: we need to prepare our children for work, but we also need to prepare them to live. Education is about living well, and the decisions that we make about the curriculum, and the money that we put into it, should be guided by  <br>

the desire to ensure that our children have access to the best. We should educate them for leisure, as well as for work.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o194"><a name="70322-0012.htm_para20"><a name="07032282000560">Secondly, children need to learn about at least one other culture. Culture is accessed through language, and we have heard the comments in Lord Dearing&#146;s report on the teaching of languages in primary schools. What he said was largely correct, but it still raises questions about how the money can be provided for developing the materials that will be needed to teach languages in primary schools and to train teachers to deliver that curriculum.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o195"><a name="70322-0012.htm_para21"><a name="07032282000561">There is also a question about which languages should be taught. Traditionally, in this country, most people have learned French or German at school. If we are to move to teaching other languages, developing the staff to deliver them will have major implications for public policy and finance. It is right that we should do so, but long-term financial decisions have to be made about how to spend our money.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o196"><a name="70322-0012.htm_para22"><a name="07032282000562">The third point is about science education. The Secretary of State said in his opening remarks that we are now getting more maths and physics teachers into our schools and more people are taking those subjects at university. But it is vital that children leave school with some basic scientific literacy&#151;an understanding of scientific methods and of how science has shaped our world.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o197"><a name="70322-0012.htm_para23"><a name="07032282000563">Children also need to leave school with certain skills. When the Education and Skills Committee considered citizenship education, for example, it found that we need to encourage active citizenship in our young people. They need to learn how to take responsibility and about the need to take part in their community. We need to consider whether all young people should undertake some community service as part of their progress towards leaving school. Perhaps an over-arching leaving certificate should include some such service&#151;</p>

 The hon. Lady attended the Committee yesterday when we heard evidence from the University of Manchester that it now requires all its undergraduates to do 60 hours of community service a year. Perhaps that model could be replicated in schools, even if not for so many hours.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman makes a fair and reasonable point, if we want to produce rounded citizens, but the question is how we direct our public spending to free up teachers to carry out such projects. Long-term decisions need to be taken. We need special people to deliver that. We need teachers who can inspire young people, and access the support that they need for learning. That is much more difficult than it ever used to be. We live in an age of internet chatrooms: everyone&#146;s opinion is considered to be equally valid, regardless of their knowledge of the subject, so it is very difficult to inspire respect for learning.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o198"><a name="70322-0013.htm_para0"><a name="07032282000568">The Select Committee looked at various subjects, and we found time and again that there were deficiencies in teacher training&#151;for instance, in respect  <br>

of identifying special needs, or in teaching citizenship or reading. Yesterday, the Chancellor announced that there was going to be much more funding for one-to-one tuition. The changes in personalised learning will mean that we need to look carefully at how we train teachers in the future.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o199"><a name="70322-0013.htm_para1"><a name="07032282000569">The demands of personalised learning, and the classroom changes that will follow as a result, will require much higher levels of skills in planning, assessment and classroom management. We need to look closely at the curriculum that trainee teachers undertake, and take account of the need for continuing professional development.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o200"><a name="70322-0013.htm_para2"><a name="07032282000570">For example, there are real questions about whether one year&#146;s postgraduate training is enough. If we decide that it is not, there will be major implications for where we direct our investment in higher education. If we choose not to put money into higher education directly, we must answer questions about how we ensure that teachers get continuing professional development. For example, should teachers be required to do compulsory continuing professional development units? If so, how do we finance that?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o201"><a name="70322-0013.htm_para3"><a name="07032282000571">Another problem has to do with how we secure investment in the most challenging schools located in our most deprived areas, and how we make sure that they get the best teachers. Some of the teachers who work in the most challenging circumstances are inspiring and dedicated, but they are the minority. My suggestion for how public finances should be used may not be universally welcomed, but it is that we should train an elite corps of teachers for our most challenging schools.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o202"><a name="70322-0013.htm_para4"><a name="07032282000572">We should recruit the best and brightest graduates. We should support them while they are in training, and also put in the funding needed to ensure that they are supported when they are at work. If we want them to stay in those difficult schools for some time, they should be given further mentoring and extra support at work, and further training as they proceed. Those teachers should become the best in the profession: they should be recruited by competitive entry, and fast-tracked for promotion. We should pay them more, and demand better results from them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o203"><a name="70322-0013.htm_para5"><a name="07032282000573">At the moment, the pay structure means that teachers prefer to work in nice schools with well-motivated children. That is just human nature, and only exceptional people choose to work in difficult and challenging schools. We should refocus our public finances on those areas where we need to make progress.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o204"><a name="70322-0013.htm_para6"><a name="07032282000574">Such long-term decisions about where we should put money are difficult, but they will have to be made. As we move to personalise the curriculum so that young people are able to make different choices, we will also have to consider ways to ensure that young people must attain minimum entitlements, at a speed that suits them. There are fine judgments to be made about education spending, but what is clear is that we are making them in an atmosphere of rising spending and better provision; we are no longer in the era of cutbacks. When I was teaching, two or three children had to share a textbook. Now, the finances are available and we can make decisions. The consequences if we do not will be serious both for our economy and for our society as a whole.</p>

 I remind the House of my interest, which is recorded in the register.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o205"><a name="70322-0013.htm_para7"><a name="07032282000576">My right hon. Friend the Member for Fylde (Mr. Jack) has already told the House that a Budget cheered on the day quickly loses its shine. However, I cannot recall a Budget that has disintegrated quite as rapidly as this one. The Chancellor&#146;s speech yesterday, which I understand was a record in terms of time, was itself a guide. He seemed quite unaware of the fact that after the speech anybody outside the House could go on to the web, turn up pages 208-09 of the Red Book and discover that, although they were being offered a tax cut next year of &#163;8 billion, &#163;7 billion and other bits and pieces would be taken away from them. It is a strange Chancellor who does not understand that our constituents, who are already faced with an increase in air passenger duty, who will be faced in October with significant increases in fuel duty, and who will be faced this year and next year with council tax increases in the order of 5 per cent., will not suddenly fall over in gratitude at a reduction of merely 2p.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o206"><a name="70322-0013.htm_para8"><a name="07032282000577">There are a number of tables in the Red Book, and if the Chancellor is to claim the credit for cutting tax for a significant number of people, it would have been more honest if he had published in the Red Book the table that is now beginning to emerge, and shown exactly who the winners and losers in that exercise would be. Given that the Financial Secretary is going to the trouble of making our statistics service more independent, perhaps the new statistics board could undertake to ensure that the Red Book at next year&#146;s Budget is accompanied by a proper independent assessment of who the winners and losers are by category, so that the Chancellor will be unable to throw up smoke and mirrors in the immediate aftermath of the Budget.</p>

<p><a name="st_o316"><a name="07032282000578"><a name="70322-0013.htm_spnew1"><a name="07032282001321"><b>Mr. Paul Goodman:</b>
 Did my hon. Friend hear the economics editor of the BBC observe last night that although the Treasury was able to give him a list of winners it was, for some reason, unfortunately unable to give him a list of losers?</p>

<p><a name="st_o317"><a name="07032282000579"><a name="70322-0013.htm_spnew2"><a name="07032282001322"><b>Mr. Fallon:</b>
 I did not, but the BBC&#146;s economics editor made that point in a BBC broadcast in which I participated, because he was searching for the information at the time. It is extraordinary that economic commentators, our research teams and the Library will all have to spend the next two or three days discovering information already held in the Treasury about who the winners and losers are. It looks as though single people will be losers from the changes announced yesterday. Young, professional single people&#151;perhaps working in the public services&#151;may find that they are worse off, not better off, as a result of what was announced yesterday.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o207"><a name="70322-0013.htm_para9"><a name="07032282000580">I want to consider the economic position in respect of the public finances. The Chancellor did not quite have time in his speech to apologise for the fact that he has yet again overestimated the amount of tax revenue that he was supposed to gather in. I think that this is the sixth year running when he has wrongly forecast the tax revenues on the wrong side. As a result, the deficit is widening and he will have to borrow more than he originally forecast. The public finances have worsened.</p>

<notus-date day="22" month="3" year="2007" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><b>22 Mar 2007 : Column 1006</b><br>

<p><a name="stpa_o208"><a name="70322-0013.htm_para10"><a name="07032282000581">In the private sector, the economic stability about which the Chancellor boasts depends very much on who one is. The stable economic framework that he claims to have created is not particularly attractive to a potential first-time buyer, struggling for a foothold on the housing ladder, or to a pensioner, struggling to make ends meet on a fixed income and confronted with retail prices inflation which is much higher for the pensioner community than the 2 per cent. figure the Chancellor talks about.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o209"><a name="70322-0013.htm_para11"><a name="07032282000582">We have a very lop-sided economy now, in which home owners&#151;those already on the housing ladder&#151;enjoy year-by-year huge rises in their capital assets, while those outside the housing market find life harder and harder. I suggest to my hon. Friend the Member for Wycombe (Mr. Goodman), who is participating in our work on policy formation, that we need to look again at the housing market and perhaps find new ways of helping young couples. If we do not, home ownership will slowly and steadily become predominated by the wealthy and the middle aged.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o210"><a name="70322-0013.htm_para12"><a name="07032282000583">Secondly, we need to do more to protect pensioners from council tax increases that well exceed the money that they are paid through various fixed incomes. At the moment, the Chancellor tries to protect them by one-off measures&#151;pre-election bribes&#151;that are introduced one year, then withdrawn the next. We need to look again at our council tax system. An increase of 5 per cent. in one year may be sustainable, but year after year, for a pensioner on a fixed income facing high utility costs, it is a very serious matter indeed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o211"><a name="70322-0013.htm_para13"><a name="07032282000584">I would like to deal now with the tax burden, and  the element that I particularly want to concentrate on is the business tax burden. The Library tells me that of all the taxes garnered in 2005-06, business taxes account for some 27 per cent. of the total burden. I have to say that a corporation tax rate of even 28 per cent. still looks very high compared with our Organisation  for Economic Co-operation and Development competitors. We are now slipping into the bottom half of that table, as we see other competitor countries&#151;sometimes neighbouring countries such as Ireland&#151;with much more attractive rates.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o212"><a name="70322-0013.htm_para14"><a name="07032282000585">My right hon. Friend the Member for Wokingham (Mr. Redwood) mentioned yesterday that we are seeing the slow but steady movement of multinational headquarters away from London. As I understand it, there are no statistical tables available yet to provide the evidence, but there is a worrying trickle of members of the Institute of Chartered Accountants and the CBI reporting in their surveys that firms with headquarters in London are now assessing every couple of years whether they should retain their headquarters here in London. HSBC, for example, conducts such an assessment every two years. In 1993, the answer was a categoric yes&#151;London was the place to do business. Now, it is reported, the answer is much less clear cut. That is extremely important, because 1993 was the year in which HSBC chose to move to London. It could have chosen elsewhere. That is a reminder that, if we are to continue to attract and retain in London the headquarters of these larger companies, we need to get the tax and regulatory regimes right.</p>

increasingly have to review competitiveness, perhaps on a monthly as well as a yearly basis, in the light of the emerging economies across Europe and the world? If we do not do that, we could find ourselves quickly disadvantaged in some of the emerging markets.</p>

<p><a name="st_o319"><a name="07032282000587"><a name="70322-0013.htm_spnew4"><a name="07032282001324"><b>Mr. Fallon:</b>
 I certainly agree with that. We all, across the House and across government, ought to be more aware of just how mobile company headquarters are. We hear people in the City talking rather grandly about the City of London being like Wimbledon, in that we put on the best tournament in the world and all the foreign banks and companies want to come and play here. However, the analogy that I would commend to the House is that of Silverstone. We do not have to have a grand prix in this country. If it becomes too expensive, Mr. Ecclestone can move it somewhere else. There are plenty of other people who want to put on a grand prix. The hon. Gentleman&#146;s point is extremely well made: if the burden of tax or the regulatory framework enveloping some of these successful financial services companies becomes too great, London could lose them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o213"><a name="70322-0013.htm_para15"><a name="07032282000588">I want to make several points about the spending side of the Budget. The first relates to the curious claim that the Chancellor repeated yesterday&#151;he has probably inserted it into almost every Budget speech that I have heard him make&#151;that he has abolished boom and bust in the economy. So far as the private economy is concerned, we will be able to test that claim only when the present house price boom finally runs out of steam. The Chancellor has, however, created boom and bust in the public economy, through the way in which he has organised public spending.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o214"><a name="70322-0013.htm_para16"><a name="07032282000589">At first, public spending was tight, then we had the splurge, and now it looks as though it is going to be tight again. Indeed, having studied the detail of the numbers that were announced yesterday, I am worried not only that it will be tight but that there will be a sudden change that will affect some of the smaller spending programmes as well as some of the long-term programmes that are vulnerable to sudden changes because of the way in which they are planned and organised. Research spending at the universities is one example, as is the work of the British Library and the British Museum. I understand that both those organisations have been asked to consider illustrative cuts&#151;cuts, not freezes&#151;of 5, 10 or 15 per cent. in their budgets as part of the work leading up to the spending review in the autumn. It is those smaller essential longer-term programmes that need protection from this sudden feast and famine in our public spending.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o215"><a name="70322-0013.htm_para17"><a name="07032282000590">My second point relates to the NHS. As others have already noted, we did not hear an awful lot about the NHS yesterday. It is my view that the NHS is still in turmoil. We have seen the extraordinary upheaval in manpower planning, with a number of young doctors now struggling to find positions. We have also seen endlessly overlapping reorganisation at every level of the health service, and we are now seeing very real job cuts in some of the non-medical professions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o216"><a name="70322-0013.htm_para18"><a name="07032282000591">I should like to give the House an example. Well over a year ago, the community hospitals in my constituency were being reviewed by the former South-West Kent primary care trust. The review, involving all the staff and services at those hospitals, has now been continued  <br>


<meta name="Date" content="22 Mar 2007">

<notus-date day="22" month="3" year="2007" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><b>22 Mar 2007 : Column 1008</b><br>
and widened by the new West Kent primary care trust, which took up its role in October. That review, which will determine how many and what kind of services should be provided by the community hospitals, will itself be overtaken by the more general fit-for-purpose exercise being conducted by the strategic health authorities. The result is that staff are demoralised and the future of the Sevenoaks and Edenbridge hospitals still swings in the balance.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o217"><a name="70322-0013.htm_para19"><a name="07032282000592">Furthermore, the Government have still failed to decide on the key issue of resource accounting for the trusts&#146; deficits. All three of the trusts that serve my constituency&#151;the West Kent primary care trust, the Maidstone and Tunbridge Wells NHS trust and the Dartford, Gravesham and Swanley primary care trust&#151;have been struggling with deficits. Because of the way in which resource accounting has been applied, they must balance their books each year, but if they fail to clear the historic deficit, its effect is doubled in the subsequent year. As a result, trusts up and down the country are scrambling to make last-minute economies. In fact, the Maidstone and Tunbridge Wells NHS trust wrote to all its staff inviting them to work a day unpaid to help to clear the deficit.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o218"><a name="70322-0013.htm_para20"><a name="07032282000593">The Audit Commission reported last July that the resource accounting rules were simply incompatible with the way in which NHS spending has been conducted, yet there has been no decision, either in the Budget or from Health Ministers, on whether that will be corrected in time and the NHS will be released from those obligations from the beginning of the new financial year&#151;1 April. If the Financial Secretary to the Treasury has time, I would be grateful to hear whether resource accounting is to be abandoned for the NHS trusts in time for the new financial year. The way in which it is being applied now seems to be extraordinarily arbitrary and is undermining the staff and public support that the trusts need if they are to serve their public.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o219"><a name="70322-0013.htm_para21"><a name="07032282000594">As for jobs in the NHS, in 20 years as a Member of Parliament I have never seen job cuts on the scale that we are now seeing across our local NHS. Physiotherapists coming out of training who were promised jobs are now being denied them and have to consider alternative careers. Health visitors are being told that their services are no longer required, and midwives are being made redundant. In all those professions the number of posts is being reduced. Those people decided to go into the public service, but now their career aspirations are being shattered. If the Government were going to cut NHS jobs on such a scale, they should have been more honest at the start.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o220"><a name="70322-0013.htm_para22"><a name="07032282000595">Finally on the spending side is the voluntary sector. It ought to have been encouraged to come forward in support of the state, but the sector is now crippled by new legislation of all kinds and the excessive application of regulations on money laundering and criminal records, which are worth while in other fields but which are now applied to the very smallest, most local charity that is never likely to have been involved in money laundering or anything like it.

 If we look back on the past 10 years, we see that the Chancellor has consistently said that the economic situation is unparalleled in our history. If we look at actual performance, however, we see the truth&#151;that the growth rate has been approximately 2.8 per cent. If we look beyond that to the post-war rates, we see an average increase of  2.5 per cent. The performance over the past 10 years has been achieved in what is generally accepted as having been one of the most benign economic environments and world conditions imaginable.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o223"><a name="70322-0013.htm_para25"><a name="07032282000599">The idea that there has suddenly been a step change in the economic growth performance under this chancellorship in the last 10 years is simply not a sustainable argument. We should remind ourselves that, when the Chancellor came into office in 1997, the International Monetary Fund described the situation as a golden economic scenario. In one of the biographies of the Chancellor it is alleged that, when it was pointed out to him what a fantastic inheritance he had, he said something along the lines of, &#147;Am I expected to write a thank-you note?&#148;. The difference is this. Many of the essential reforms that were vital to secure greater economic stability and better British economic performance, such as trade union reform, reform of the closed shop, dramatic cuts in personal taxation, privatisation and the big bang, were opposed by the Labour party&#151;totally incorrectly at the time.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o224"><a name="70322-0013.htm_para26"><a name="07032282000600">As we look back over the last few years, we can see that much of the feel-good factor has been generated by rising house prices. As we heard the other day from the former Governor of the Bank of England, much of that arose because of concerns about a recession. The way in which the Bank of England reacted was to ensure that there would be a greater housing boom, despite the potential consequences.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o225"><a name="70322-0013.htm_para27"><a name="07032282000601">Looking beyond the figures that were produced in the Budget report, one of the key indicators of economic success is the improvement in living standards. Figures from the Office for National Statistics tell us that the average weekly gross income per household in 2001-02 was &#163;600. It rose, in real terms, to &#163;616 last year&#151;a compounded growth rate of just 0.5 per cent. The real weekly disposable income per household rose in real terms by only 0.35 per cent. per year. So, for all the headline growth rate increases, the net effect in terms of household incomes tells a different story.</p>

 Does the hon. Gentleman agree that one of the things that contributes most to making people feel good is the fact that they have a job? In  my constituency of North Durham, since 1997 unemployment has come down by 65 per cent. and youth unemployment has come down by over 90 per cent. Does he not think it is worth giving a least some credit for that achievement?</p>

<p><a name="st_o322"><a name="07032282000603"><a name="70322-0014.htm_spnew1"><a name="07032282001327"><b>Mr. Spring:</b>
 I accept that there has been a growth in employment. That is true in almost all industrialised countries. However, in fairness to the hon. Gentleman, if he looks at the pattern in the last year, he will see that it has begun to reverse itself quite dramatically, compared with other major industrialised countries.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o226"><a name="70322-0014.htm_para0"><a name="07032282000604">If we look at the difference in household incomes between the richest 20 per cent. and the poorest 20 per cent. in 1997 and today, we can see that it is 10 times. The amount is identical. There has been no change. According to the same Office for National Statistics data, the lowest-income households are paying a higher share of tax and receiving a lower share of benefits than they were in 1997.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o227"><a name="70322-0014.htm_para1"><a name="07032282000605">That has come about at a time of a massive increase in public expenditure. That expenditure has not, of course, resulted in a transformation of public services. That is at the heart of the criticism of the governance of this country. People are asking, &#147;Where has all the money gone?&#148;. The truth is that the Chancellor has not taken anything like the tough and radical decisions of his predecessors, which were often controversial and sometimes, indeed, divisive. The Chancellor has poured money into the public sector and has swollen public sector employment, but without effective prioritisation and consultation to achieve measurable better outcomes. I am afraid that, as we now know, that is coming to an end, because the rate of growth in public expenditure is going to be less than the rate of growth in the economy overall. Of course, the Chancellor had no alternative but to do that, so the bonanza in public expenditure is about to end without the reforms that were necessary to produce a massive increase in the quality of our public services.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o228"><a name="70322-0014.htm_para2"><a name="07032282000606">There have been three main factors behind the economic growth that has occurred under the Chancellor. I have touched on the massive increase in public expenditure. We have also seen the trebling of house prices, so this is growth led by consumption. Household debt in 1997 was 100 per cent. of disposable income, but it is now more than 160 per cent., and the figure is rising. There has also been a substantial increase in the population of this country.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o229"><a name="70322-0014.htm_para3"><a name="07032282000607">Productivity has not matched economic performance to the extent that it should have done. We are suffering the highest current account deficit in our entire history, with a third of that figure being filled by our service industries. We are hugely and increasingly dependent on our financial services sector. As my hon. Friend the Member for Sevenoaks (Mr. Fallon) pointed out, however attractive London has been as a centre for the financial services industry, the mobility of that sector is much greater than that of manufacturing, so we must watch with great concern the burden of taxation and regulation.</p>

Indeed, one in four of the new jobs that have been created in this country has been in the public sector, and our tax burden has risen appreciably under this chancellorship&#151;it is certainly higher than that in the United States, Germany and Japan. Much of our lack of performance on productivity has come about because of poor performance in the public sector. The International Monetary Fund describes what the Chancellor has done as the</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o231"><a name="70322-0014.htm_para5"><a name="07032282000609">The heart of the problem is that expenditure on the public sector has cost the taxpayer a staggering amount, yet the functional mismanagement in the public sector has, at times, been absolutely grotesque&#151;we only have to look at the mismanagement of our health service and the financial difficulties that have resulted to realise that. If one is the guardian of the public purse, one is entitled to invite Cabinet Ministers with departmental responsibilities to ensure that the management of such huge sums is appropriate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o232"><a name="70322-0014.htm_para6"><a name="07032282000610">Let me relate my experience during my time as a Member of Parliament. When I was first elected in 1992, we had the West Suffolk health authority. We were then told that we needed a pan-Suffolk health authority. More latterly, we were told that economies of scale and management were not the important thing and that we needed the management of health to be close to communities. We thus got five primary care trusts, which became three primary care trusts, and now we are back to having a Suffolk-wide health authority all over again. The cost of that has been grotesque and the events have ill served the people who depend on the health service.</p>

 I agree with the hon. Gentleman about the fiddling around with health authorities. In Durham, for example, we went from having one area health authority to having seven, yet now we are back to where we started. However, does he agree that that has gone on under previous Governments, although that does not excuse what has happened? Perhaps we have tried to change the management of the health service in the expectation that that will deliver results. Rather than concentrating of delivering front-line services, management changes have been put in place.</p>

 I am glad that the hon. Gentleman accepts that errors have occurred. I dare say that management has never been perfect in the health service. However, the changes of the past few years have been extremely dysfunctional. The difference is that the salaries paid to the senior people who run health services are equivalent to those of Cabinet Ministers and the Prime Minister. The cost of the massive managerial overheads, the salaries and the consultancies has been a damp hand on the provision of good and decent health care. We see the problems now: the difficulties faced by our junior doctors, the sacking of nurses, and the closure of wards and everything that goes with that. The chief executive of the NHS recently said that</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o233"><a name="70322-0014.htm_para7"><a name="07032282000613">The Public Accounts Committee talked about the &#147;weak control&#148; of finances. As we know, there is a shortage of midwives, and junior doctors, to whom I have just referred, have been protesting. Huge deficits have grown up in the NHS, despite the massive increases in funding that the Chancellor has made in our health service, and that situation will continue for at least another year.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o234"><a name="70322-0014.htm_para8"><a name="07032282000614">At the heart of the problem is disgraceful managerial dysfunction. The Chancellor is the guardian of our finances, but a lack of consultation and prioritisation has resulted in our wholly wasting, in many respects, the huge sums that have been given to the NHS. That is an increasingly common view among our constituents. Where, indeed, has the money gone?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o235"><a name="70322-0014.htm_para9"><a name="07032282000615">I should like to draw the Financial Secretary&#146;s attention to another point: one of the most bizarre aspects of yesterday&#146;s Budget was the treatment of small businesses. When he gets back to his office, he should expect a huge volume of letters and e-mails, sent to the Treasury by business people in the smaller and medium-sized business sector who simply cannot believe that taxation for the sector has gone up, as was announced yesterday. I draw his attention, as my hon. Friend the Member for Tatton (Mr. Osborne) did, to the fact that there has been a series of changes in taxation in the sector since 1997, with rates of tax going back and forth. In 2005, small business tax rates were 20 per cent. First-year capital allowances were then introduced, and now the small business tax rate has gone up to 22 per cent.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o236"><a name="70322-0014.htm_para10"><a name="07032282000616">Although it is true that the headline rate of corporation tax has gone down from 30 to 28 per cent., smaller companies that have profits of up to &#163;300,000 will see taxation rise from 19 to 22 per cent. Of the &#163;985 million that the Treasury is expected to reclaim from the corporation tax system, no less than  &#163;820 million will come from small businesses. That will help to offset the corporation tax reduction for larger firms. If we consider the pressures on small companies, which include local taxation and the business rate, we see that 10,000 local shops have closed since 1997. Corporation tax, despite the new rate announced yesterday, is now higher than when the Chancellor came to office in 1997.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o237"><a name="70322-0014.htm_para11"><a name="07032282000617">The capital allowances in the Budget are allegedly an offset against the higher level of taxation, but the truth is that many of our acorn, smaller and most dynamic businesses do not have high capital expenditure. They are in the creative industries and in the knowledge-based economy that we keep hearing about. They will not be beneficiaries of those allowances. It is astonishing for a Chancellor who talks about the need for entrepreneurial activity, and to encourage new business investment and new start-ups, to increase taxation as he has done. I hope that we can get a satisfactory explanation from the Financial Secretary, but I cannot imagine what it might be.</p>

 I am afraid that the Chancellor&#146;s Budgets are always rather mysterious and arcane, and it takes great armies of accountants, tax advisers and lawyers to establish what he means. My hon.

<p><a name="stpa_o239"><a name="70322-0014.htm_para13"><a name="07032282000621">The Financial Secretary dealt with the subject of energy security and the taxation of North sea oil in an Adjournment debate, and I have read the Treasury discussion paper on that hugely important matter. The reaction to the Budget demonstrates that there is genuine concern about the declining base in the North sea. The Chancellor has spoken at length about the vulnerability of our energy security in an era of geopolitical instability. Natural hazards, too, are a difficulty, as well as the technical problems that arise in this area. UK domestic fuel sources have been depleted, and we are moving inexorably from being a net exporter to being a net importer. Objectively considered, some countries that supply our energy are not among the most stable in the world. The capacity for production is at the upper limit&#151;the oil supply from OPEC is often at full capacity&#151;so any hint of instability in the middle east means a sharp rise in prices. Indeed, the middle east accounts for 65 per cent. of the world&#146;s oil reserve, and in periods of instability we have seen the consequences for oil and energy prices, and have experienced the impact in the UK on prices, inflation and the consumer. The issue is therefore hugely important, given the nature of the world and, indeed, terrorist activity.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o240"><a name="70322-0014.htm_para14"><a name="07032282000622">We are very much beholden in Europe to Russian supplies, particularly for natural gas. Many people have asserted that Russia will exploit its ability to supply Europe with energy, and use its influence to make political decisions about that supply. There have been instances of such behaviour in the past 12 months in eastern Europe, and the director of the strategic studies centre at the Russian Academy of Sciences said:</p>
<a name="70322-0014.htm_brev3"><a name="07032282000956"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;What has changed is that Russia has begun using energy as a political tool&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o241"><a name="70322-0014.htm_para15"><a name="07032282000623">That is important from Britain&#146;s point of view. The pattern of production in the UK demonstrates that there are huge questions about the future viability of production in the North sea. Oil and gas remain vital to the UK for the foreseeable future, and account for  75 per cent. of the UK&#146;s primary energy supplies. The UK oil and gas industry has spent more than  &#163;370 billion&#151;all of it private capital&#151;to recover the nation&#146;s offshore hydrocarbon reserves, and it has generated huge sums of money for the Treasury, so it is in everyone&#146;s interests, not only geopolitically but economically, that production is sustained and encouraged.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o243"><a name="70322-0014.htm_para17"><a name="07032282000625">Yes, the oil and gas industry is an important contributor to our economic life and to the Treasury coffers. It is hugely important for our geopolitical stability, but the real shock, if there was one, in the Budget presentation was the decline in revenues from North sea oil. There is one thing that I do not understand, and I hope the Financial Secretary will be able to explain it to the House. The Government have known for some time the pattern that is emerging. The current situation is one thing; looking down the track the situation is extremely serious for us, yet what we have is yet another discussion paper. All the right questions may be there and it is a complicated tax matter, but urgent action is required. It is a matter of great disappointment that all we get is more talk on the subject. I hope the Treasury will be provoked into taking sharper action.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o244"><a name="70322-0014.htm_para18"><a name="07032282000626">We have seen a massive increase in public expenditure, which is beginning to tail off. Parallel with that there has been a huge increase in the monstrous bureaucracy in the public services. It affects the morale of teachers, the numbers who wish to retire early, and the turn-over of young teachers who come into the profession wanting to teach but are twisted up in form-filling and bureaucracy. There are only a small number of police officers on patrol at any given time, and they all say that they are caught up in a web of bureaucratic interference by Government that makes their jobs impossible.

According to the Chancellor&#146;s statement, national debt is down to 38 per cent., compared with the euro zone, where it is 50 per cent., the USA where it is 44 per cent. or the staggering height of debt in the great dynamic economy of Japan, where it is 92 per cent. We ought to be proud also of the levels of capital investment that the Government have made, which is up from  &#163;18 billion in 1997 to over &#163;43 billion now.</p>

Member for Tatton (Mr. Osborne), who entered the House, as I did, in 2001, said in response to a question that the past  10 years had been worse than the 10 years before 1997. Again, the hon. Gentleman seems to live in a universe parallel to the one in which I and many of my constituents live. It is worth remembering those years, when we had inflation of more than 10 per cent., interest rates that hit a record 15 per cent., and unemployment of 3 million-plus. That had a dramatic effect in constituencies such as mine. The economic heart of many of those communities was ripped out overnight, with no protection or investment afterwards. Now, house prices are rising, but we do not have the cancer of negative equity, which affected 1.5 million people.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o249"><a name="70322-0014.htm_para23"><a name="07032282000632">Another achievement since 1997 is the fact that net borrowing, which had hit a record of more than 8 per cent., is now predicted, as the Chancellor said yesterday, to be down to 2.7 per cent. and, in future years, 1.4 per cent. Borrowing is not intrinsically bad&#151;it is a question of what is done with the money that is borrowed. The important thing is that we are no longer borrowing to invest in unemployment.</p>

The Budget increased the working tax credit threshold by &#163;1,200. I welcome that. The gloom and doom merchants complain about how the tax credits system has been administered. The Paymaster General, who is on the Front Bench at the moment, knows that I have not been uncritical of the way in which her Department has administered the system, causing hardship to some of my constituents. However, we should look at the bigger picture and think about the support that it has given to many families in my constituency, where it is making a real difference.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o253"><a name="70322-0014.htm_para27"><a name="07032282000638">This Labour Government must be proud of the national minimum wage. During the 1997 general election, when I was a trade union official, the Conservatives told us that it would create mass unemployment and be bad for the economy. It has done exactly the opposite. It has helped to raise people out of poverty and removed the absolute disgrace, in a decent society, of people working for &#163;1.50 an hour or less. There was the famous occasion when a security guard at a jobcentre was being paid &#163;1.50 an hour and had to bring his own dog to guard the premises. We have a proud record on employment, which we should not stop championing.</p>

No, it is not, and the test for the Government now is to help those in every constituency, including mine, who have been on long-term incapacity benefit and need assistance to get into work. The change since 1997 is that jobcentres are not trying to get people into any job, at any cost, just to manipulate the figures downwards. For example, Stanley jobcentre in my constituency has dedicated workers who advise clients and support people, who often have serious health issues, into work. There are those who say that people are being forced into work who should not be, but it is good for a lot of those people to access work and to gain the place in the world to which I have referred.</p>

It is repeatedly pointed out to me that those pensioners who were the poorest in 1997 are now better off than they have ever been, certainly in my constituency. For example, Annie Bell from Waldridge, who unfortunately died last year at  85 years of age, had campaigned for a free bus pass all her life. When we announced the free bus pass for pensioners, she said to me, &#147;Kevan, this will change my life.&#148; More importantly, because she was on a basic state pension and had no savings, she had never been better off. At her funeral, her daughter said that the last few years of her life had been changed by the fact that she was not scrimping and saving and suffering poverty in old age.</p>

At the Dryburn hospital, where some members of the present Prime Minister&#146;s family were born, the maternity unit was in portakabins in the hospital grounds. We now have two brand new hospitals. Next year a brand new mental health hospital will open just over the border in the City of Durham. Four new doctors&#146; surgeries will be built in my constituency in the next two years.

 It is, actually. When I was elected in 2001, my constituents had to wait at least two years for orthopaedic operations. Many of them needed such operations, because they had worked in the mining industry. Now the waiting time is down to less than three months, and those who go on to the emergency waiting list can be operated on within weeks.</p>

Let me give the hon. Gentleman a positive example, however. In 2001 the new University Hospital of North Durham was completed, and was seen to have fewer beds than its predecessor. There was a big hue and cry about there not being enough beds, but over the past five years waiting lists have shortened, and the number of beds is now about right. In fact, we may have a few too many. Part of the success story of shorter waiting lists is overcapacity in certain areas. The alternative is to leave things the same and never change anything, but that means wasting money, which is what the Opposition&#151;notably the Liberal Democrats, on many occasions&#151;accuse us of doing.</p>

It will be able to do a hell of a lot more with modern rather than outdated facilities&#151;although it would have been easy enough for me, as a constituency Member, and for others to campaign to keep open a hospital that was not fit for purpose and had seen better days.</p>

 I accept that things may be going very well in Durham, but I suggest that one reason why people are becoming increasingly discontented with the way in which the national health service is operating is the time for which they are having to wait for operations. I refer the hon. Gentleman to the figures for average waiting times. Despite a doubling of the NHS budget, the figures clearly show&#151;<i> [Interruption.] </i>Cries are coming from the Government Front Bench, but Government hospital-episode statistics show that average waiting times have fallen by only five days&#151;from 78 days to 73 days&#151;in the 10 years they have been in power.

A lady came to my surgery and said, &#147;I went into hospital and had only a three-week wait from diagnosis to treatment for a hip replacement&#148;, but she then said that she wanted a second opinion, as she thought that that was too quick.

A teacher came to my surgery a few weeks ago and asked, &#147;Does that mean that we will force people to do A-levels?&#148; No, that is not what it means. It will force people to take part in training courses and apprenticeships, and it will ensure that they have basic numeracy and literacy skills. That is vital.

 I agree with my hon. Friend; indeed, this is a great opportunity for schools. Schools and further education colleges are up for the 14-to-19 agenda; however, it is not just about putting young people through GCSEs. I must agree that this Government&#146;s method of measuring success just through GCSEs has sometimes been a bit crude; we must also look at apprenticeships, and make sure that employers play a part by providing training places. The hon. Member for Sevenoaks mentioned globalisation. If young people do not drop out of the education system at 16 but continue and get the skills and training that they need, that will make this country competitive. Young people who drop out of the education system can also be led into crime, for example; moreover, it is a wasted opportunity.

We must recognise that airports such as Newcastle&#146;s&#151;I was, but no longer am, a director of it, so I need not declare an interest&#151;are an important economic driver in regions such as the north-east.

 That is very true. When the figures were published, the examples given were all positive, but the real detail was not provided. We will get that in the next few weeks and it will show who will be worse off. Single people will suffer most, and it is single pensioners with a small occupational pension who fall just outside the &#163;9,700 limit about whom the Chancellor is talking. My mother is one of those people and she already complains that she never gets anything, even though she worked all her life. The change to the 10p rate means that she and many like her will pay more in tax than they paid before. That change should be linked with the Lyons report, which was also published yesterday.</p>

 The Minister could apply the same argument to the taxes on tobacco or alcohol.

 Yesterday we heard what we all assume will be the final Budget from the current Chancellor. I thought that it would be worth while in examining it to look back to his first Budget in July 1997, to assess what progress has been made on the various items that he identified in his opening remarks on that occasion. He identified what he perceived as four weaknesses within the British economy: instability, under-investment, unemployment and waste of talent. It would be fair to say that unemployment and waste of talent were closely linked&#151;indeed, he dealt with them together in his speech&#151;so his very first statistic in his very first Budget speech should probably have referred to three weaknesses instead of four.

From 1997 to 2000, he was fiscally prudent, conservative and careful, and he reduced the budget deficit substantially. From 2000 to 2006,  <br>

however, we saw a sharp deterioration in public finances. Public spending took off dramatically, while tax revenues at times disappointed. We have seen a sharp tightening since the 2005 general election, and we saw further evidence of it yesterday with the announcement of the public spending plans&#151;the envelope, as it were&#151;for the next few years.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o286"><a name="70322-0016.htm_para11"><a name="07032282000699">In assessing the Chancellor&#146;s record as a whole in this area, it is worth citing the findings of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, which noted some improvement over the past 10 years but made an international comparison: of the 22 countries for which comparable data are available, 17 improved their structural budget balance by more than the UK. We have been living through a time in which the budget balances should have been getting better, yet the Chancellor&#146;s record is not all that impressive. Indeed, he has been able to recover a degree of sustainability in the public finances only by means of a rather sharp slow-down in public spending, in which we have seen spending falling as a percentage of national income.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o287"><a name="70322-0016.htm_para12"><a name="07032282000700">During the last general election campaign, my party put forward proposals in which public spending would rise in real terms but fall as a percentage of gross domestic product. The Chancellor&#146;s response to our proposals was that they would result in &#163;35 billion of public spending cuts. Applying the methodology that he used to reach that conclusion to yesterday&#146;s spending announcement, the Institute for Fiscal Studies has made it clear that the Chancellor would yesterday effectively have announced &#163;8 billion of cuts by 2010-11, or &#163;10 billion worth by 2011-12. The methodology is absurd. What the Chancellor announced yesterday were not really spending cuts in the normal sense of the word. If he is to be consistent in his choice of methodology, however, that is precisely what he did.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o288"><a name="70322-0016.htm_para13"><a name="07032282000701">As a member of the Treasury Select Committee, I had the opportunity after the pre-Budget report to ask the Chancellor how he would define a cut in public spending. He evaded my question, saying that we would have to wait and see what the public spending envelope looked like. That was no answer; we do not have to wait and see at all. I had another go at the question when I asked the Chief Secretary to the Treasury what constituted a cut, and he said that it was in the eye of the beholder. We are in the rather curious position of having a new irregular verb, as far as the Chancellor is concerned: &#147;You cut spending. I demonstrate fiscal discipline while increasing real-terms spending.&#148;</p>

We all know, however, that the golden rule that current spending must be met by taxation over the economic cycle has largely been discredited by the various changes to the economic cycle, which have always made the Chancellor&#146;s job somewhat easier. The Chairman of the Treasury Committee, the right hon. Member for West Dunbartonshire (John McFall), raised one or two concerns about the golden rule and the economic cycle yesterday. I intervened on him yesterday, and I have an opportunity today to raise with the Financial Secretary my concern about what one might call a fiddle.</p>

Yesterday the Chancellor said that the current economic cycle will finish in early 2007, which I think probably means within the 2006-07 financial year, so my question is: will the 2006-07 financial year, which is a deficit year, be treated as part of the next economic cycle? The question seems fairly straightforward, and if the answer is yes, that would be a continuation of the policy that has applied in the past. However, when asked the question, Treasury officials before the Treasury Committee were unable to give an answer, and no answer has been given in response to parliamentary questions that I have tabled. When he winds up the debate, I hope that the Financial Secretary will clarify whether the last year of one economic cycle will continue to be the first year of the next. As far as I can see, the Government will meet the golden rule for the next economic cycle either way. According to their current projections, there is no reason why not. None the less, it is important to have consistency if the golden rule is to have any sort of credibility.</p>

Friend the Member for Witney (Mr. Cameron) pointed out yesterday, the savings ratio has halved since 1997. In addition, business investment in this country is less than 10 per cent. of GDP and has averaged a smaller proportion of GDP than in France, Germany and the United States since 2000. A matter raised in 1997 that is topical again this year is the rate of corporation tax. In 1997, the Chancellor reduced the mainstream rate from 33 to  31 per cent.; he subsequently reduced it to 30 per cent. and, of course, yesterday he reduced it to 28 per cent. In 1997 he boasted that our rate was lower than our competitors&#146; and that we had a competitive advantage, which would help both inward and domestic investment. However, that competitive advantage has been allowed to slip in the succeeding 10 years.</p>

It is right to lower the rate and to simplify the system by having fewer allowances, exemptions, reliefs and so on. That is to be welcomed. The change was foreshadowed in the report produced by the Tax Reform Commission chaired by Lord Forsyth, and the shadow Chancellor was advocating that approach only this week. In fact, the tax cut can safely be said to be the first of many tax cuts initiated by my hon. Friend the Member for Tatton (Mr. Osborne).</p>

to reduce the reliefs, allowances and so on, but to reduce the rates as well. That is entirely sensible, but for smaller companies, he has done quite the reverse: increased the rate and increased additional allowances. That seems an illogical, and perhaps unfortunate, position. Perhaps there is an explanation that we have not heard. I raised a point earlier about the curious phrase &#147;legitimate small businesses&#148;. There may be an explanation there. <i> [</i><i> Interruption.</i><i> ]</i> The reference was to &#147;legitimate&#148; businesses, as if those businesses that did not invest were somehow illegitimate, but I do not intend to pursue the point.</p>

Curiously, in 1997, that was justified as helping investment. The Chancellor referred yesterday to the 125,000 people who lost their work pensions through no fault of their own. He was absolutely right: it was not their fault. That is more than can be said for the Chancellor, whose tax raid has contributed to some of the difficulties with occupational pension funds. However, the Chancellor made an announcement yesterday about the financial assistance scheme.</p>

 Is it not a fact that, in addition to the changes in corporation tax, many of those companies and pension funds did very well out of that change? Some companies then took pensions holidays and did not put any of the money into their pension schemes.

 That was the justification that the Chancellor used at the time for the abolition of tax credits on pension funds. However, with the benefit of hindsight, actuaries calculate that the cost to pension funds has been something like &#163;100 billion since then. Clearly, some occupational funds have been severely affected.</p>

FAS pays out only from the age of 65, whereas many people were looking to retire at 60, and would like to be able to do that. There is no inflation linking. All FAS payments will be taxed, although to some extent perhaps the tax changes announced yesterday will be of some assistance. There is no tax-free lump sum. Widows lose out significantly. On the basis of Ros Altmann&#146;s comments&#151;we should at least respect what she has to say&#151;it seems that what the Government have done has not been quite as generous as it first appeared.

 It is worth nothing that when the hon. Gentleman&#146;s party was in power it did nothing at all to protect occupational pensions. I know that he does not speak for the Conservative Front-Bench team, but is he suggesting that the Government should underwrite completely every single private pension scheme in this country? If he is, that is certainly a huge spending commitment that will not fit in with the spending plans with which the shadow Chancellor said this afternoon he agreed.</p>

 I am not suggesting that. However, the Government have lost a case on the basis of maladministration, although they are appealing, and certain legal obligations might thus be forthcoming. This is not a question of underwriting every single private pension in the country, but we must consider what happens when people have been misled, which is the case in the example that I am citing. We need to look carefully at the matter, and I am not sure that the Chancellor&#146;s announcement succeeded in dealing with the problem.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o297"><a name="70322-0016.htm_para22"><a name="07032282000716">Let me move on to the third and fourth elements of what the Chancellor said in 1997 that remained current yesterday. Welfare reform was at the heart of the 1997 Budget and, to some extent, the 2007 Budget. The right hon. Member for Birkenhead (Mr. Field), who was the Government&#146;s first welfare reform Minister, has said:</p>
<a name="70322-0016.htm_brev0"><a name="07032282000957"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Labour&#146;s hugely expensive welfare reform programme has largely failed.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o298"><a name="70322-0016.htm_para23"><a name="07032282000717">Aspects of the programme clearly have failed. I do not want to enter a long debate about the new deal, but yesterday we seemed to have the new new deal. Should anyone want to examine the arguments and evidence, I recommend the pamphlet &#147;Reforming Welfare&#148;, which was written by Nicholas Boys Smith and produced by the think-tank Reform. It lists a range of areas in which the new deal has failed and identifies what should be done about it. It is striking that the Freud report, which was commissioned by the Department for Work and Pensions, comes up with almost exactly the same prescriptions as Mr. Boys Smith: more emphasis on outcomes, not procedures; greater involvement of the voluntary and private sectors; and greater conditionality.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o299"><a name="70322-0016.htm_para24"><a name="07032282000718">It is also worth considering lone parents. Again, the Chancellor stressed his desire to improve the employment rate for lone parents. There has been an improvement since 1997, but our rate of 56 per cent. is still the lowest such employment rate of any major European country. The Chancellor&#146;s proposals&#151;whether in 1997 or 2007&#151;appear to be a form of gentle encouragement, but they  <br>

do not seem to be working especially well. One can sense the frustration of the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, who perhaps looks at these things from a slightly different perspective, when he says that we ask very little of lone parents. The Secretary of State&#146;s emphasis is on conditionality, whereas the Chancellor has avoided conditionality when addressing welfare reform as a whole.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o300"><a name="70322-0016.htm_para25"><a name="07032282000719">Hon. Members on both sides of the House agree that we want to encourage more lone parents to work. However, I think that most Conservative Members hold the view, although it is not necessarily shared by Labour Members, that the best environment in which a child can be brought up is within a marriage, or at least by two parents in a stable relationship. The system has created difficulties because, while the DWP&#146;s figures show that a couple needs more to escape poverty than a lone parent might receive, the levels of tax credits do not necessarily address that adequately. On last night&#146;s &#147;Newsnight&#148;, Stephanie Flanders made the point that one group of beneficiaries of the Budget would be out-of-work lone parents.</p>

 I will give one point: the Department for Work and Pension has assessed the weekly income that is required for a lone parent with children if they are to escape poverty, and for a couple with children if they are to escape poverty, and those figures are adjusted for rent. The second figure is higher than the first figure, in terms of what the couple and the lone parent would get from tax credits. If I may press on with the subject of tax credits&#151;</p>

 No, I have given way. I wish to conclude with this point on tax credits: another clear difficulty with them is that although they try to address the poverty trap for people entering employment, there has been difficulty with people in low-paid employment who move up, whether they are earning more or whether they are moving from part-time to full-time work, because of the very high marginal rate. According to one figure that I have seen, since 1997, the number of people facing a marginal rate of 50 per cent. or more has increased by 874,000. I think that the Government tried to address that yesterday, to some extent, by raising the threshold of the working tax credit, but I would be grateful to learn whether more people will be caught by the higher marginal rate. I do not know whether an analysis of that has been done, but there is concern that more people might be caught. I do not wish to dwell on the administrative difficulties with the tax credits system. I am sure that if I did the Paymaster General would intervene frequently&#151;</p>

 Indeed; the Chancellor certainly would not. None the less, there are administrative difficulties, and an official from Her Majesty&#146;s Revenue and Customs who gave evidence to the Treasury Committee last week said how difficult it was for forms to be completed. I am concerned, too, about the greater user of tax credits, which the Chancellor has promoted.

strategic mistake in associating himself with what was essentially a con trick. His record on the substance is not as impressive as is often claimed. He has been inconsistent on public spending, he has been incoherent on welfare reform, and on pensions he has been incompetent. The question that the country must ask is whether, given the fact that the problems that he identified in 1997 still remain in 2007, the Chancellor is the right person to tackle them.

 This is an interesting Budget, if only because there is a dispute about whether it is a tax-cutting Budget. The Secretary of State for Education and Skills, who opened the debate, certainly found it difficult to justify the Chancellor&#146;s claim that it is indeed a tax-cutting Budget. Most independent economists believe that there is nothing in the Budget to correct the fact that tax freedom day&#151;the day British taxpayers stop earning money for the Government and start to keep the money themselves&#151;has gone from 25 May in 1997 to 2 June last year.

The Budget is interesting, because we have been told for the past year that we cannot share the proceeds of growth. The Chancellor has confirmed in the Budget that we can do so&#151;we can increase public expenditure but, at the same time, if we believe him, we can have a tax-cutting Budget. Let us at least hope that that has moved on the debate about sharing the proceeds of growth, and that we do  not hear any more nonsense from the Government on the issue.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o303"><a name="70322-0017.htm_para2"><a name="07032282000741">In the past 10 years, the Government have taxed too much and thrown money at unreformed public services, and that has not resulted in the improvements that we all desire. There is little doubt that the growth in public expenditure as a proportion of gross domestic product has increased&#151;up from 37 per cent. in 1999-2000 to an estimated 42 or 42.5 per cent. this year. Extra money for public services is good in principle&#151;I do not think that anyone would disagree with that&#151;but not enough of those resources have reached the doctors, nurses, soldiers and police on the front line. Too much of the extra money has been soaked up without improving productivity, and Ministers cannot dispute that the cost of inflation in the public sector is running at twice the rate in the private sector.</p>

on improving front-line services. As a result, productivity in the NHS has fallen by up to 1.5 per cent. in each year since 1997. Labour Members might question those figures but the Chancellor himself, I am led to believe, has similarly been questioning why productivity has fallen in the NHS and has held meetings at No. 11 to discuss the matter.

Clearly, once the layers of Government spin have been peeled away, the extra money has not delivered the improvements that we all hoped to see, and that should have been delivered, given the amount of money that has been put into the NHS.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o307"><a name="70322-0017.htm_para6"><a name="07032282000751">Let me put to rest the argument that is continually rolled out at the Dispatch Box that because we have seen such a good decline in cancer mortality rates, that is living proof, so to speak, that all that money is having a beneficial impact. That decline has occurred over the past 10 years, but it continues the decline in the preceding 10 years. In other words, it has made no significant improvement to the long-term decline in cancer mortality rates that has been evident for the past 20 to 25 years.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o308"><a name="70322-0017.htm_para7"><a name="07032282000752">That argument needs to be challenged time and again. The statistics are available for everyone to see. If we look at the mortality rate for cancer among people under 75, we see that the proportion dying from cancer fell by 12.5 per cent. in the seven years after 1997. The comparable fall in the seven years before 1997 was  12.6 per cent., so all the extra money that has been put in has not made a discernible difference to the long-term trend in declining mortality rates.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o309"><a name="70322-0017.htm_para8"><a name="07032282000753">Let me turn to taxation in general. It is evident that the Government simply do not accept the case for lower taxes. We have had 11 Budgets in which, broadly speaking, the tax take by the Government has gradually increased. Only 10 years ago, the UK&#146;s tax burden was close to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development average of about  39 per cent. of gross domestic product. Since then, while across the rest of the OECD the burden has fallen to an estimated 38 per cent., in Britain it is forecast to rise to 42.5 per cent.&#151;its highest since 1986. The Government seem to take the view that public services should be micro-managed and that they know how best to spend people&#146;s money&#151;that is why the tax take has gone up so much.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o310"><a name="70322-0017.htm_para9"><a name="07032282000754">There is a strong case&#151;indeed, almost a moral case&#151;for lower taxation. Evidence the world over has shown that where Governments reduce the tax burden on their countries, over the medium and longer term that increases the prosperity&#151;the growth rate&#151;more than making up for the short-term shortfall in receipts through the initial tax cut. Hon. Members, especially my hon. Friends, must not be afraid to make the case for lower taxes. Tax cuts create a bigger economic cake from which the Government can take their honest share and help the less fortunate in society. I am sure that we all want to achieve those ends, but it is a question of how we do it. I suggest that the best way of creating increased prosperity&#151;the bigger economic cake&#151;is to lower taxes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o311"><a name="70322-0017.htm_para10"><a name="07032282000755">As I said, there is evidence across the world for that, but to find it we need only look across the Irish sea. Throughout the 1990s, liberalisation of the corporation tax laws in Ireland created a huge economic dividend that cannot be ignored. There we have a concrete example of a country making a determined cut in its tax rates and increasing prosperity over the medium to longer term. Real national income per head rose from less than 65 per cent. of the EU average at the beginning of the decade to rough parity by the end of it&#151;a phenomenal achievement.

This is not just wishful thinking&#151;there is concrete evidence to suggest that cutting taxes can create that bigger economic cake over the medium to longer term for the benefit of the whole of society, especially its more vulnerable elements.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o312"><a name="70322-0017.htm_para11"><a name="07032282000756">At the moment, we have a British Government who are going the other way. In the past 10 years, they have marched in the wrong direction against the trend of lower taxation that has been evident across much of Europe as a whole. There is no shortage of statistics in this regard, and I suppose that one can always bend an argument to one&#146;s own way of thinking by choosing the right ones. Nevertheless, the bottom line is that if we are to reach a relatively independent assessment of the tax burden on individuals in this country, a good and objective measure is tax freedom day&#151;the day each year on which the average British taxpayer stops working for the Government and starts working for himself. Back in 1964, tax freedom day fell on  St. George&#146;s day, 23 April. In 1997, it had reached  25 May. Last year, it was 2 June, and our forecast suggests that by next year it could be as late as 3 or  4 June.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o313"><a name="70322-0017.htm_para12"><a name="07032282000757">Perhaps most worrying of all is the increasing burden of corporation tax. I accept that there has been a 2 per cent. cut in the main headline rate, but I am fearful of the effect that the Budget will have on small businesses. There is little doubt&#151;and there can be little disagreement&#151;that the tax take from small businesses under this Budget has increased. The increase from  19 per cent. to 22 per cent. by 2010 for small businesses gives the lie to the Chancellor&#146;s claim that this is a Budget for enterprise and prosperity.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o314"><a name="70322-0017.htm_para13"><a name="07032282000758">The importance of small businesses to the UK economy should not be underestimated. More than 4 million small businesses make up over 99 per cent. of all enterprises in the UK. The Small Business Service has estimated that small businesses provide 47 per cent.&#151;nearly half&#151;of UK non-government employment, and 38 per cent. of the UK&#146;s turnover. Meanwhile, research by the Federation of Small Businesses shows that small firms created a phenomenal number of jobs&#151;550,000 or over half a million&#151;in the second half of the 1990s, compared with just 200,000 jobs created by large companies. These people are not fat cats or multinational businesses. Mostly, they are entrepreneurs who have an idea and are willing to risk their own money to get it off the ground. Small businesses are often the lifeblood of our local communities and high streets in constituencies up and down the country. Over time, many of them grow and contribute even more to the economy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o315"><a name="70322-0017.htm_para14"><a name="07032282000759">Were the Chancellor really determined to encourage prosperity and enterprise, he would not target tax increases on small businesses. He has claimed that the &#163;50,000 capital allowance will result in many small businesses paying less tax, but we simply do not know whether that will be true. Many small businesses will not be able to take up that allowance, particularly in the service sector, which has done so much for the economy in the past. Many economists are still crunching the numbers, but the early indications are that netting off the introduction of a capital allowance  <br>

will still mean that the Treasury takes hundreds of millions of pounds away from small businesses and into the Exchequer.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o316"><a name="70322-0017.htm_para15"><a name="07032282000760">Nor should we forget the effect of bureaucracy. Allowances and credits might be good for business but they also generate more bureaucracy for firms. It is far simpler to give companies a cut in the tax that they pay, and let them make their own decisions about investments in research and development. According to the Federation of Small Businesses, the average small business already spends about 28 hours a week filling in forms for the Government. The Budget will add to that while increasing the burden of direct taxation. When I am out and about in my constituency, I am told by entrepreneurs that that is a growing problem, and that they have to spend a disproportionate amount of time filling in forms rather than concentrating on running their businesses. That bugbear has just been increased further by the Budget.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o317"><a name="70322-0017.htm_para16"><a name="07032282000761">All parties might claim to be the party of small business, but the important thing to entrepreneurs is hard cash. It is easy to talk about cutting bureaucracy, but hard to do something about it. Entrepreneurs are fed up of hearing both main parties simply talking about cutting bureaucracy; they want hard evidence that the Government are serious about helping small businesses. Small businesses are fed up to the back teeth of the Government claiming to be the party of small business but failing to deliver and only increasing the tax burden.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o318"><a name="70322-0017.htm_para17"><a name="07032282000762">I would like to hear a promise of tax cuts for small businesses. My back-of-an-envelope calculations suggest that if a Government promised a 1 per cent. cut in small business corporation tax for each year of a term, by the end of the five-year term a 5p cut in small business corporation tax would cost the Exchequer only about &#163;1.2 billion. In the great scheme of things, that is not a lot of money, but it would create such good will for the Government of the day.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o319"><a name="70322-0017.htm_para18"><a name="07032282000763">This was a disappointing Budget. Whether or not it is tax-cutting is disputable: only time will tell. What we do know is that too much money is going into unreformed public services, and that small businesses will suffer as a result of the Budget. That will be to the long-term detriment of this country.</p>

Lawson Budget. It was the first instalment of the first Budget of my hon. Friend the Member for Tatton (Mr. Osborne) because it was he who advocated the cut in the corporation tax rate which the Chancellor has made, and it was the last instalment of Nigel Lawson&#146;s last Budget because he set out his ambition to establish a simple two-rate taxation structure with a top rate of 40p and a bottom rate of 20p.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o322"><a name="70322-0017.htm_para21"><a name="07032282000767">As you will remember, Mr. Deputy Speaker, when Nigel Lawson made that announcement in his Budget speech it produced uproar. For the first time in history, the Budget debate had to be suspended by your predecessor and could not continue until Labour Members had calmed down, such was their horror at the prospect of an income tax system with just two rates, 40p and 20p.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o323"><a name="70322-0017.htm_para22"><a name="07032282000768">I wonder whether those who were so appalled then were among those who cheered yesterday when their own Chancellor announced, rather implausibly, that that had been his long-term ambition too. Perhaps they dwelt on the subject overnight. That may explain why only one Labour Back Bencher is present today to support the final instalment of Lord Lawson&#146;s Budget, which&#151;in that respect, at least&#151;Conservative Members welcome.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o324"><a name="70322-0017.htm_para23"><a name="07032282000769">In short, this sounded like a Conservative Budget with Conservative tax cuts, coming from a tax-raising Chancellor. Let us be clear about this, however: Conservative Budgets cut not only the rates of tax but the burden of tax, and this Budget increased the burden of tax. We should take account not just of the measures on page 209 of the Red Book&#151;Budget measures which themselves increase the overall burden of taxation&#151;but of those on page 210, which show all the measures introduced since the last Budget but not included in this Budget. Then we see that the total burden of taxation is rising by &#163;2.5 billion this year, and by &#163;3 billion in the subsequent year. This was a tax-raising Budget of the sort that we have come to expect from a Chancellor who taxes by stealth.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o325"><a name="70322-0017.htm_para24"><a name="07032282000770">The Chancellor has achieved the illusion of cutting taxes while increasing the overall tax burden&#151; largely by scrapping measures that he himself introduced. He introduced the 10p starting rate; now he has scuppered it. He said that he was halving the rate of tax imposed on the working poor; now he has doubled it. He reintroduced allowances on capital expenditure; now he is reducing them. He reduced the corporation tax rate on small companies; now he is raising it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o326"><a name="70322-0017.htm_para25"><a name="07032282000771">The Chancellor of the Exchequer spent his first four Budgets marching his troops up the hill towards a 10p tax band, a 20p small business rate and capital allowances for manufacturing. Now he has marched them back down again, leaving all that behind. He has been described&#151;by my hon. Friend the Member for Tatton, I think&#151;as the Prince of Wales waiting to be King. Actually, he is the Duke of York, who marched his troops to the top of the hill and marched them down again.</p>

choice; he then spent his subsequent Parliaments reintroducing grant-maintained schools, which were renamed foundation schools, city technology colleges, which were now called city academies, GP fundholding, which was called practitioner commissioning, and patient choice&#151;which, because the Government could not think of another name for it, they have reintroduced as patient choice. Therefore the Prime Minister has been a Duke of York and will be remembered, primarily, as that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o328"><a name="70322-0018.htm_para1"><a name="07032282000773">That point helps to answer the central question behind the Budget: where has all the money gone? Reorganisations&#151;especially pointless and unnecessary ones which reverse previous reorganisations&#151;are hugely expensive. Palms must be crossed with silver, as Nye Bevan remarked when he introduced the reforms that led to the creation of the national health service. Vested interests must be bought off. In every change, bureaucracy and unions find opportunities to boost pay, reduce work loads, increase the number of posts and reduce overall productivity.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o329"><a name="70322-0018.htm_para2"><a name="07032282000774">That is one reason why so much money has been spent to so little effect, but the Budget speech highlights a second reason why this Chancellor has wasted money on an industrial scale, as my right hon. Friend the Member for Witney (Mr. Cameron) said. A Chancellor who measures success by how much money he spends, rather than by the results achieved, ends up spending a lot and achieving very little. The Chancellor set himself the wrong measure of performance, and as a result he has succeeded only in spending money and not in improving services.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o330"><a name="70322-0018.htm_para3"><a name="07032282000775">The third reason why there is so much waste is that the Chancellor has a centralising nature. That is not only because he is a Stalinist&#151;he is a believer in the central doctrine of Stalinism, which is bureaucratic centralism&#151;but because he is new Labour and new Labour has a preoccupation with tomorrow&#146;s headlines, as he has demonstrated. New Labour is preoccupied with wrong-footing the Opposition, spin and media manipulation. In order to do such things, it is necessary to centralise. If what is wanted is a continual flow of news manipulated from the centre, the decisions must be made at the centre; it is necessary to indulge in micro-management, setting targets, ring-fencing budgets, detailing regulations and having detailed management controls in the public sector. The Government have, of course, done all that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o331"><a name="70322-0018.htm_para4"><a name="07032282000776">Let me give an example that comes from my own experience of visiting a national health service hospital. Hon. Members will recall that the Government got a good headline when they announced their waiting list target. They got another good headline when they announced ring-fenced waiting list budgets for every hospital. They got yet another good headline when they announced that waiting list managers would be appointed to every hospital. So they got three good headlines, but the consequences in the hospital I visited were as follows. The waiting list manager spent his ring-fenced waiting list budget on carrying out operations on Sundays in order to get the waiting list down. It might be thought that that was an expensive way of doing that, as higher rates had to be paid to locum surgeons, but one would expect more operations to be done and waiting lists to be reduced. However, at the end of Sunday all the equipment needed to be sterilised and it was impossible to employ spare  <br>

sterilising teams on Sunday. Therefore the equipment had to be sterilised on Monday, which meant that no operations could be carried out on Monday. The money for that did not, however, come from the waiting list manager&#146;s budget; his budget was ring-fenced. It came from the budget of the rest of the hospital, so he did not worry. As a result there were no extra operations and no other achievements, but a vast sum of money was spent.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o332"><a name="70322-0018.htm_para5"><a name="07032282000777">That was a waste of money, which is bad enough, but there was a second consequence which was worse. A surgeon to whom I spoke had established a dedicated open-wound operating theatre and a ward served it that was kept scrupulously clean to avoid any risk of contamination by methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus&#151;MRSA&#151;or any other infection. However, the waiting list manager had to manipulate the waiting list, and some patients were getting dangerously near one of the thresholds, which meant that he might not meet a particular target. So he insisted on dumping some of his patients on that ward, including one with MRSA, another with a liver infection, and a third with another such problem.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o333"><a name="70322-0018.htm_para6"><a name="07032282000778">My consultant informant said that he could not operate in those circumstances. He was told by the hospital authorities that he must&#151;they had targets to meet. He said that that would put the health of his patients at risk. He was told that this was a P60 matter, and that he would have to think about it hard. Happily, he has a private income from a medical invention of his, so he was able to call their bluff. He simply gave all the patients a form, saying that if they wanted to go ahead with the operation immediately, they should fill it in and remove any liability that he might have&#151;but that he could advise them to do that only if they were feeling suicidal. So none did. No operations were carried out and their lives were saved.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o334"><a name="70322-0018.htm_para7"><a name="07032282000779">This is the implication of detailed micro-management&#151;waste and reduction in quality, instead of improvements and enhancement of quality. Nothing that we heard in this Budget suggests that the Chancellor or the Government have learned the lessons of 10 years of spending and wasting. The Budget is a Budget for short-term headlines and long-term waste. It is a Budget of Conservative appearance, but socialist substance. It is a Budget that cuts rates, but increases the burdens on the British people. It will be remembered for the latter.</p>

Chancellor did not tell them yesterday? I suspect that the answer is yes, and I shall come to that point later.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o335"><a name="70322-0018.htm_para8"><a name="07032282000783">However, we have had some good speeches. As one would expect from a member of the Education Select Committee, the hon.

She said that spending should be focused on the curriculum and teachers; we will doubtless all agree with that. She also said that poverty can be a greater barrier to progress in schools than ethnicity.

If he wants to speak to me about his ideas on taxation and air travel, I will be very happy to listen. I will now commit my colleagues, without having consulted them, and say that if he wants to talk to any of them about inheritance tax, they will see him.

The latter made an interesting point about waiting times and used a particular statistic to which I intend to come later. My hon. Friend the Member for South-West Hertfordshire (Mr. Gauke) gave us a forensic analysis of the Chancellor&#146;s record, and I am sure that the Chancellor will enjoy discussing that with him when my hon.

statement, forget the starkness and seriousness of the international challenge that confronts the British economy. We must at least try to raise our eyes from this debate and look ahead and look abroad.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o340"><a name="70322-0018.htm_para13"><a name="07032282000788">By 2050, it is estimated that China&#146;s share of world trade will have risen from roughly 18 per cent. to 24 per cent., but North America&#146;s will have fallen by 2 per cent. to 23 per cent. The EU&#146;s is set to fall by almost half, from 22 per cent. to a mere 12 per cent. So the choice is clear. Even to maintain our position&#151;to keep up with US rather than EU growth rates&#151;we have  to compete to prosper, if we are to meet the challenge of the 21st century. The economy must travel in the right direction.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o341"><a name="70322-0018.htm_para14"><a name="07032282000789">So we need improved competitiveness. However, according to the World Economic Forum, since 1997 we have dropped from fourth place in the competitiveness league to 10th. Nor is that a one-off. The Institute for Management Development&#146;s global competitiveness survey tells the same story. In it, we have dropped from ninth to 21st. Eleven Budgets on, the Chancellor has taken our competitiveness in the wrong direction.</p>

Between 1997 and 2001, it fell to 2.1 per cent. and between 2001 to 2005 it fell again, to 1.5 per cent. Eleven Budgets on, the Chancellor has also taken productivity growth in the wrong direction.</p>

Members have guessed it&#151;going in the wrong direction. In 1997, it was &#163;270 billion. Eleven Budgets on, it is  &#163;517 billion, a rise of no less than 41 per cent. in real terms&#151;the highest tax burden in the history of the British economy. Business taxes alone have risen by  &#163;50 billion since 1997 and this year&#146;s Budget will take them up again, by an extra &#163;1 billion next year, as my hon.

But we look at the Red Book and see that over the next five years the Chancellor is planning to borrow another &#163;153 billion. Each year he will borrow more than the entire budget for schools. Let us not forget that the &#163;153 billion figure is only the Chancellor&#146;s forecast.

<p><a name="stpa_o345"><a name="70322-0018.htm_para18"><a name="07032282000795">We need strong savings, and the Chancellor is especially culpable in that regard. In opposition, he told pensioners:</p>
<a name="70322-0018.htm_brev0"><a name="07032282000958"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;I want the next Labour Government to achieve what in  50 years of the welfare state has never been achieved: the end of the means test for our elderly people.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o346"><a name="70322-0018.htm_para19"><a name="07032282000796">So what happened to means testing? When we left office, 37 per cent. of pensioners were means tested; now, the proportion is 45 per cent., and climbing. What happened to saving? Since 1997, the personal savings ratio, as set out on page 255 of the Red Book, has fallen by half. No wonder the right hon. Member for Birkenhead (Mr. Field) has said:</p>
<a name="70322-0018.htm_brev1"><a name="07032282000959"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;When Labour came to office we had one of the strongest pension provisions in Europe and now probably we have some of the weakest.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o347"><a name="70322-0018.htm_para20"><a name="07032282000797">Above all, as so many Conservative Members have said, we need value for money in our public services. We do not dispute that we have had the spending: an extra &#163;175 billion since 1997. Money has been poured into the health and education budgets, but where has it all gone? Staggeringly, and according to the Treasury&#146;s public finances databank, out of every &#163;10 that the Chancellor has spent, only &#163;1 has gone on investment. </p>

<p><a name="stpa_o348"><a name="70322-0018.htm_para21"><a name="07032282000798">Let us take the NHS. The Chancellor scarcely mentioned it yesterday, and he certainly did not announce his comprehensive spending plans for it, so I shall do so today. As my hon. Friend the Member for Billericay said, only a quarter of the Chancellor&#146;s NHS spending has gone on improving front-line services. Productivity in the NHS has fallen during each year since 1997.</p>
<a name="70322-0018.htm_brev2"><a name="07032282000960"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Given the record levels of public investment, our public services should now be reaching world-class levels&#151;we shouldn&#146;t be seeing only incremental changes.&#148;</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o350"><a name="70322-0018.htm_para23"><a name="07032282000800">So after 11 Budgets, the Chancellor has given us competitiveness that is not better, but worse; productivity growth that is not higher, but lower; a tax burden that is not lower, but higher; borrowing forecasts that are discredited, and a golden rule that is now completely derided. Above all, his mania for means-testing has delivered lower savings, with over &#163;100 billion missing from pension funds since his raid on them during his Budget of 1997, 10 long years ago.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o351"><a name="70322-0018.htm_para24"><a name="07032282000801">The Chancellor would have hoped, 10 years on, to present this Budget ahead in the polls. Instead, he is behind in the polls. So what does he do? Well, with his borrowing forecasts missed, his spending out of control, his tax burden rising and his popularity falling, he has been forced to take a last, desperate gamble.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o352"><a name="70322-0018.htm_para25"><a name="07032282000802">The Chancellor hopes that, if he says that he will cut one income tax after raising over 100 others, he will fool the voters into thinking that he has somehow been transformed from Stalin into Milton Friedman&#151;that he has somehow turned into a tax-cutter. However, as we all know only too well, what this Chancellor gives away with one hand&#151;I will not say one &#147;clunking fist&#148;, as that is the Prime Minister&#146;s language&#151;he grabs back with the other.</p>

We told him to remove the VAT restriction on academies. Only a few weeks afterwards, in the Budget he was forced to follow our lead&#151;Conservative policy.</p>

He is fully entitled to claim that he can rise to the challenges of the 21st century and that the Budget will allow him to turn over a new leaf&#151;greeting his colleagues with a cheerful smile and a listening ear, winning the trust of his most senior civil servants and bringing about a new open style of government, in which decision making is a shared responsibility animated by a generous spirit of give  and take.</p>

We have also seen more schools rebuilt in the past five years than in the previous 25. As the Secretary of State said earlier, we have seen essential investment over the recent period, accompanied by important reforms.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o369"><a name="70322-0019.htm_para10"><a name="07032282000842">The extra investment will allow us to do still more. There will be one-to-one teaching for 600,000 students, the number of apprentices will double to 500,000, and we will increase the number of higher education students by another 60,000. Every school will become an extended community school.</p>

 I understand the answer that the Minister gave me earlier; I was expecting him to say that. Nevertheless, his response contradicts the figures in the Red Book, which give an average projected economic growth rate of 2.75 per cent., not 2.5 per cent. as he has just said. I understand that the Treasury has its own special figures, but will he explain the contradiction between his statement and the figures in the Red Book?</p>

 I do not want to repeat myself, but I will explain that, although the trend rate of growth is 2.75 per cent., we take a cautious baseline view of public finances, using 2.5 per cent., and that is what we base all our public spending decisions on.</p>

They include: a desire to cut the basic rate of income tax by 2 per cent. for all; taking 600,000 pensioners out of taxation altogether by increasing the age-related allowances; providing direct support for families with children, taking another 200,000 children out of poverty; improving the incentives to work by raising the value of the working tax credit; and simplifying the personal tax system so that we have two rates and two thresholds, by aligning the national insurance contributions upper earnings limit with the higher rate threshold.</p>

All the revenue raised from the increase in the small companies rate will be recycled back to legitimate small businesses in the form of support and investment incentives, and the new annual investment allowance of 100 per cent. up to a limit of &#163;50,000 will be available to all companies, incorporated and unincorporated. <i> [</i><i> Interruption.</i><i> ]</i></p>

The hon. Gentleman should not confuse small companies with small businesses. The present system of capital reliefs is not necessarily available in full to unincorporated businesses.

Will they support the environmental tax changes? Will they support the business corporation tax reforms? Will they support our spending totals for the comprehensive spending review in the future? Or will they stick to their third fiscal rule? Will they stick to what the Leader of the Opposition said? He said that, when the money comes in, it should be shared between taxes and public spending. That is a dramatic difference. By taking an inflexible, ideological approach, it is not just a dramatic difference over an economic cycle; it is a dramatic difference each and every year.

 I am grateful for the opportunity to raise before the House the issue of the enforcement of the Hunting Act 2004.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o391"><a name="70322-0020.htm_para10"><a name="07032282000878">As has often been said, hundreds of hours were taken up in this Chamber debating whether or not there should be a ban on hunting with packs of hounds. Parliament voted for that ban on numerous occasions, and finally the ban became law. It is axiomatic that when the Chamber passes law, we expect it to be enforced. It is quite wrong if a group of people believe that they are uniquely above the law and, furthermore, that their breaches of the law may be blatant and rejoiced in. I hate to say it, but I have even heard hon. Members boasting that they have been hunting since the passing of the ban. We need to ask why the ban is not being properly enforced.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o392"><a name="70322-0020.htm_para11"><a name="07032282000879">To date, there has been only one successful prosecution for hunting with packs of hounds.

Indeed, all that I have heard is that a public meeting was laid on by the hunt to protest that the law dared to take its course and that a conviction had actually been secured. The sad thing is that that prosecution was not brought by the police or sanctioned by the Crown Prosecution Service. It was actually brought by the League Against Cruel Sports.</p>

 Some hunts, but only a very small number, have registered as drag hunts. Only a small number have done so because once they register they are bound by drag-hunt rules and are subject to the discipline of drag hunting. Rather than convert to drag hunting, most of them say that they are not chasing live quarry but are flushing, following a trail or doing something else, because they do not want that discipline. The hon. Gentleman raises a most important point: there is a mechanism by which they can say that they are doing one thing but, in effect, do another. I will come on to one of the ways in which that has been monitored.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o396"><a name="70322-0020.htm_para15"><a name="07032282000887">Of course, we have known for a long time&#151;we knew it long before hunting was made illegal&#151;that hunts cause tremendous problems. They disrupt traffic, block roads, kill domestic animals, and let hounds get on to railway lines, sometimes with horrible consequences. If any other group in society regularly caused that amount of disruption, grief and trouble, and carried on doing so when a law had been passed to try to stop their activities, there would be an outcry, but that one group in society seriously thinks that it is above the law.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o397"><a name="70322-0020.htm_para16"><a name="07032282000888">I was asking why enforcement is not as effective as it should be, and and the answer partly because there is a lack of understanding on the part of the police. In one hilarious conversation that took place between the police and a hunt monitor who had called them, the policeman said, &#147;But, madam, as long as they&#146;re not killing the fox, they&#146;re not committing an offence.&#148; There is an absence of understanding generally throughout the police force, and an absence of willingness but greater understanding among the senior part of the police force. Let me say, as any reasonable person would, that we know very well that the police are completely overburdened and overworked; they have plenty of things to worry about, and one can understand the temptation for them to say that the issue does not matter, but it does matter if the message is going out that the law may be broken, blatantly and deliberately, and that nothing will be done about it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o398"><a name="70322-0020.htm_para17"><a name="07032282000889">I turn to the activity of hunt monitors. I stress that I am talking about monitors and not saboteurs. Monitors are generally elderly, inoffensive ladies&#151;I have met a lot of them&#151;who go to hunts with cameras and who film what is happening. They have to do that because the police are not doing it. If we leave it to the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, the League Against Cruel Sports and other such bodies to gather the evidence to mount prosecutions, which the police take over only at the last minute, if at all, we must have people who gather the evidence. At the moment, that is done by hunt monitors, and I pay tribute to them, because some of  <br>

them are extremely brave. They are inoffensive, modest people whose motivation is simply to try to ensure that the law is upheld.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o399"><a name="70322-0020.htm_para18"><a name="07032282000890">There have been assaults on hunt monitors. There is a film in my possession that I intend to make available to Members of the House later this year&#151;after the decision on Exmoor has been confirmed, so that I do not risk having my film pulled half way through. It shows a large number of incidents involving hunt monitors, including direct assaults and damage to cars. Hunt monitors call the police, but the police do not always arrive. Although they sometimes do, I cannot show that on my film. In one instance, a lady in her car was hemmed in by two hunt vehicles, or vehicles belonging to people supporting the hunt. She was unable to move and was being threatened&#151;a man was actually bashing on the window of the car&#151;but there was not a policeman in sight. That is simply not acceptable.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o400"><a name="70322-0020.htm_para19"><a name="07032282000891">If the police are rather torpid on the issue, the Crown Prosecution Service is even worse. Its default position is that if there is a doubt, and if it is a bit difficult to try to work it out, the benefit of the doubt is given to the hunt. That attitude must be challenged, as it is crucial that the CPS understands the law on hunting. It should not be the case, as the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals put it to me today, that those cases should arrive in the in-tray of some junior person in the CPS who finds it all a bit difficult, so the cases sit there for five and a half months and, under statutory limitations, run out. The CPS must get a grip on the problem.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o401"><a name="70322-0020.htm_para20"><a name="07032282000892">The Under-Secretary is nodding&#151;I am grateful that she is doing so&#151;and I hope that she turns that nod into verbal reassurance when she replies. I have seen that film and the detail that it provides, and I have to say that I was shocked. Even though I knew that hunting was going on, I did not quite realise the risk that hunt monitors ran. We saw the hunting brigade&#146;s contempt for the law when some of its members entered the Chamber, believing that they had the right to do so and to defy the law. Because they have been doing that for several centuries, they believe that they have a God-given right to be above the law.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o402"><a name="70322-0020.htm_para21"><a name="07032282000893">I mentioned one way to monitor hunting. It is very expensive, but it has been done successfully. People can go up above the hunt in a helicopter that has monitoring equipment. When that happens, the hunt suddenly obeys the law, so no one sets off after a fox and no one encourages the hounds&#151;they sit there. That would be a very good solution if only there were a billionaire benefactor in the animal welfare lobby who would enable us to put helicopters up over every hunt. Very soon, people would be bored, because all that they could do would be to sit there, obeying the law. They would not follow the hunts, which would not have any supporters and would go broke. Failing a billionaire benefactor, may I suggest to the Minister that the occasional police helicopter over a hunt&#151;I am not saying that we should divert huge resources&#151;would act as a dampener on its very unlawful activities?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o403"><a name="70322-0020.htm_para22"><a name="07032282000894">I have a final suggestion to make. I do not expect the Minister to respond on the hoof tonight, but I hope that she will contemplate it seriously. As I said, if the police are not going to go out and collect the evidence, someone has to do so. I believe that we should license  <br>

hunt monitors&#151;they would be checked to ensure that they did not have a criminal record, and would be respectable people, not &#147;sabs&#148;&#151;and it should be made an offence to obstruct a licensed hunt monitor, in the same way that it is an offence to obstruct a policeman. </p>

<p><a name="stpa_o404"><a name="70322-0020.htm_para23"><a name="07032282000895">One thing that will be shown on that film, apart from the shocking assaults on hunt monitors, is the way in which the hunt deliberately sets out to make sure that those people cannot film. Its members stand in front of them, put horses in front of them, and hem in their vehicles so that they cannot move. If it were an offence to do so, and if the hunt monitors were licensed to film, we might have more law-abiding hunts&#151;if there is such a thing and it is not a contradiction in terms. I look forward to the Minister at least telling me that she will have give that proposal serious consideration, and to hearing any suggestions from the Government to make sure, first, that illegal hunting is monitored and, secondly, that monitors are given better protection.</p>

 May I start by congratulating the right hon. Member for Maidstone and The Weald (Miss Widdecombe) on securing this Adjournment debate? I acknowledge her longstanding and ongoing commitment to the hunting legislation and, indeed, the whole issue. It is a timely point at which to discuss the enforcement of the legislation. There is plenty to say in the debate, and she is right that there is still a great deal of activity. However, we contend that that activity centres on drag hunting, and I hope to be able to unravel some of the issues this evening. It is an interesting debate and the matter should be scrutinised.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o405"><a name="70322-0020.htm_para24"><a name="07032282000897">Before dealing with enforcement of the Hunting  Act 2004, it is important to clarify what exactly the legislation does and does not ban. The Act came into force on 18 February 2005. It bans all hunting with dogs of wild mammals in England and Wales, apart from a few tightly drawn exemptions set out in the Act, which allow for pest control and other essential activities to be undertaken, subject to strict conditions. The ban covers the hunting of all wild mammals, including hare, deer, fox and mink. It also completely bans hare coursing.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o406"><a name="70322-0020.htm_para25"><a name="07032282000898">The Act does not prevent hunts from meeting up and riding with their dogs, provided they stay within the law. It does not prevent legal equestrian activities, such as trail or drag hunting.</p>

<p><a name="st_o435"><a name="07032282000899"><a name="70322-0020.htm_spnew8"><a name="07032282001442"><b>Mr. Olner:</b>
 One of the major problems is that there is incitement by some hunts to break the law. I agree with the right hon. Member for Maidstone and The Weald (Miss Widdecombe) about monitors and that they need protection, but there is incitement to break the law, and I hope my hon. Friend the Minister will deal severely with that.</p>

<p><a name="st_o436"><a name="07032282000900"><a name="70322-0020.htm_spnew9"><a name="07032282001443"><b>Joan Ryan:</b>
 If my hon. Friend bears with me, I shall come to some of those issues shortly.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o407"><a name="70322-0020.htm_para26"><a name="07032282000901">The Act does not prevent hunts from meeting and it does not prevent activities such as trail or drag hunting. We would have no difficulty with those activities, and I noticed that the right hon. Lady feels the same way.  <br>

<notus-date day="22" month="3" year="2007" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><b>22 Mar 2007 : Column 1056</b><br>
The Act does not prevent farmers and others from undertaking legal pest control activities, such as using up to two dogs to stalk and flush out foxes and other wild mammals, providing they are shot as soon as possible after being found or flushed out. All the other activities that hunts have traditionally engaged in, such as dog walking, puppy shows, hunt balls and point-to-point racing, are equally unaffected. Those are perfectly acceptable social activities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o408"><a name="70322-0020.htm_para27"><a name="07032282000902">The criminal offences created by the Hunting  Act 2004 are punishable by a fine of up to &#163;5,000, the maximum that magistrates courts may impose. The Act gives the police powers to search and seize vehicles, animals or other articles used for illegal hunting, with a related power of entry to land, but not to private houses. The Act also allows the courts to order the forfeiture of vehicles, dogs or hunting articles and gives the court the discretion to order their disposal or destruction.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o409"><a name="70322-0020.htm_para28"><a name="07032282000903">Operational decisions on the arrest and prosecution of those taking part in illegal hunting activity are a matter for the police and prosecuting authorities. The police have made it clear that they will enforce the hunting ban, and the Association of Chief Police Officers has issued guidance for police forces on the practical aspects of enforcing the Act. The police are treating offences in the same way as other wildlife offences with similar penalties. The police also have obligations under the Director of Public Prosecution&#146;s guidance on charging, which ensures that all offences under the Hunting Act are referred to a Crown prosecutor for early consultation and charging decision. That is in line with the procedure for all other crimes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o410"><a name="70322-0020.htm_para29"><a name="07032282000904">I hear what the right hon. Lady says about the case to which she referred, which is in the public domain&#151;she is right, although it is as well that we are wary of crossing that line. The individual to whom she referred was one of the first people to be convicted under the Hunting Act. His case was brought privately by the League Against Cruel Sports and later taken over by the Crown Prosecution Service.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o411"><a name="70322-0020.htm_para30"><a name="07032282000905">The case led anti-hunting groups to question whether the police were acting properly before cases reached the CPS. Following a meeting with anti-hunt groups on 20 October 2006, Assistant Chief Constable John Sampson, the ACPO lead on the issue, sent a reminder to ACPO colleagues about their obligations under the DPP&#146;s guidance on charging to ensure that all offences under the Act are referred to a Crown prosecutor for early consultation, which is a crucial point. I heard what the right hon. Lady said about how these matters are dealt with by the CPS, which will, I am sure, pay attention.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o412"><a name="70322-0020.htm_para31"><a name="07032282000906">Early consultation and charging decisions are in line with the procedure for all other crime. Lessons have been learned from that. The right hon. Lady referred to one conviction. In fact, there were three convictions in 2005. Figures are not yet available for 2006.</p>

 I accept that the right hon. Lady has in-depth knowledge of this matter. Nevertheless, it is important to clarify the point about convictions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o414"><a name="70322-0021.htm_para1"><a name="07032282000912">It is not for the Government to direct chief constables on how to deploy their resources to deal with hunting. Chief constables are best placed to decide how to deploy the resources available according to operational priorities and objectives. While we have not made funding available specifically to tackle illegal hunting, the rural policing fund was introduced part way through 2000-01, when some &#163;15 million was made available to enhance the policing service in rural areas at no cost to metropolitan forces. The fund comprised &#163;30 million per annum benefiting 31 shire forces. In 2006-07, Ministers agreed to amalgamate the rural policing fund with three other specific grants&#151;special priority payments, London and south-east allowances and forensic grants&#151;to create a single special formula grant to give police authorities more control over how the grant may be used.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o415"><a name="70322-0021.htm_para2"><a name="07032282000913">Three individuals have been prosecuted under the Act, and there are, as the right hon. Lady said, other cases in the pipeline. Court proceedings data for 2006 will be available in the autumn of 2007, when we will see the outcome of several ongoing operations. Anyone convicted of offences under the Act will get a criminal record as well as a fine of up to &#163;5,000. Those are appropriate and proportionate sanctions for such an offence.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o416"><a name="70322-0021.htm_para3"><a name="07032282000914">Let me return to what the right hon. Lady said about the need for evidence and the conversations that she reported hearing, with even hon. Members discussing hunting. Anybody who has any evidence should make it available to the police, who have made it clear, as we see in the ACPO guidance, that they will act upon evidence received. We must make it clear that nobody, inside the House or not, is above the law. In a democratic society, we cannot pick and choose what laws we obey, and hunts must obey the law as it stands. It would come as no surprise to us that hunts want the Act to be repealed. For whatever reason they have remained in business&#151;perhaps to try to outlast the ban and wait for a change&#151;there should be consequences if they do not abide by the law. That will depend on evidence being available and action being taken.</p>

<p><a name="st_o441"><a name="07032282000915"><a name="70322-0021.htm_spnew2"><a name="07032282001448"><b>Miss Widdecombe:</b>
 I think that the Minister will acknowledge that the hunts are carrying on because they are waiting for a change, which they think will take place at the next general election. They hope that the legislation will then be repealed, which is even greater reason to make their lives uncomfortable between now and then.</p>

<p><a name="st_o442"><a name="07032282000916"><a name="70322-0021.htm_spnew3"><a name="07032282001449"><b>Joan Ryan:</b>

previous practice. The vast majority of the public still support a hunting ban&#151;they were not just supporting it when legislation was before the House and interest in the issue peaked&#151;and any future Government of any party will need to pay attention to that. The legislation is in force and must be adhered to.</p>

<p><a name="st_o443"><a name="07032282000917"><a name="70322-0021.htm_spnew4"><a name="07032282001450"><b>Mr. Olner:</b>
 In the four minutes remaining, I hope that the Minister will address the right hon. Lady&#146;s point that it is important not only to get evidence but to protect the evidence givers and gatherers. Incitement to break the law is also a tremendously important issue, and we should seriously address that on a national basis.</p>

 As I said, anyone who has evidence should make that available. I acknowledge what the right hon. Lady said about helicopters, and serious concerns have been expressed, including by members of ACPO, that a danger might be posed to both humans and animals. We must pay attention to that. The advantage of having this debate is that all those undertaking the activity, dealing with it or enforcing the law will see that these are important issues that are still being considered by the House and the public.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o417"><a name="70322-0021.htm_para4"><a name="07032282000919">I am aware that some commentators have suggested that the legislation has loopholes and that that has resulted in limited convictions. That is not the case. The Hunting Act makes it an offence for a person to hunt a wild animal with a dog unless the hunting is exempt. For the purposes of the Act, the word &#147;hunting&#148; has its ordinary English meaning, which includes searching for wild animals, chasing them or pursuing them for the purpose of catching or killing. Hunting requires an intention, on the part of the person rather than the dog&#151;for example, to chase the quarry&#151;so there can be no accidental hunting. We need to be clear about that. </p>

<p><a name="stpa_o418"><a name="70322-0021.htm_para5"><a name="07032282000920">I also acknowledge the point made by the right hon. Lady, and echoed by my hon. Friend the Member for Nuneaton (Mr. Olner), about hunt monitors. She asked me to consider that point, and I undertake to reflect further on it. In practice, hunting includes a range of activities, from chasing an animal over many miles with the intention of killing it, to deliberately setting one&#146;s dog on to a wild animal with the intention of catching it or frightening it away. It would be for the police and prosecutors to decide whether to pursue individual cases and for the courts to decide whether an offence had been committed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o419"><a name="70322-0021.htm_para6"><a name="07032282000921">Inventive individuals can create a large number of theoretical scenarios to call the detail of any legislation into question. In practice, the courts apply common sense to clear legislation. The Hunting Act is clear legislation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o420"><a name="70322-0021.htm_para7"><a name="07032282000922">In summary, I must disagree with the right hon. Lady&#146;s contention that the Act is not being properly enforced. ACPO has made it clear on a number of occasions that it will enforce the hunting ban, and I am satisfied that that is being done. Having said that, I welcome the opportunity provided to debate the issue this evening, and am pleased that the concerns have been put on the record. I undertake to reflect further on her points.</p>
