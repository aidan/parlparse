 (Con): What recent representations she has received on the Licensing Act 2003. [20214]
</p>



<p><a name="st_o0"><a name="51024-01_spmin0"><b>The Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport  (Tessa Jowell): </b> 
 My Department continues to receive a number of representations about the Licensing Act, mainly relating to the fees review, the consultation on temporary event notices and the timing of the second appointed day. On the issue of whether the Government should press ahead with full implementation of the Licensing Act on 24&nbsp;November&#151;the second appointed day&#151;the key stakeholders are supportive, and that is what the Government intend to do.


<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>24 Oct 2005 : Column 2</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br></p>








<p><a name="st_o1"><a name="51024-01_spnew0"><b> Michael Gove: </b> 
 I am sure that the Secretary of State will be aware of the widespread concern that many of my constituents feel about the legislation. In particular, they are deeply concerned about the rise of alcohol-fuelled antisocial behaviour. Many establishments in Camberley town centre have been pressing for extensions to their licences, but unfortunately local residents who do not live in the immediate vicinity are barred from making representations. Local councillors who are deeply concerned about preserving the character and tranquillity of that town centre are also gagged from making their representations heard when deliberations are made on the extension of licences. What can the Secretary of State say to reassure my constituents that she takes seriously the threat of alcohol-fuelled antisocial behaviour and that she will show respect for those local people who cannot have their voices heard in the debate because of her legislation?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o2"><a name="51024-01_spnew1"><b> Tessa Jowell: </b> 
 On the first point, on alcohol-fuelled antisocial behaviour, it is precisely because of the new police powers in the legislation that we intend to press ahead and secure its implementation as quickly as possible, so that those powers are at their disposal. On the second point, in looking at the performance of local authorities around the country, to which I pay tribute for setting up the new regime, I am pleased that in 95&nbsp;per cent. of the cases in which residents make representations against variation in hours, their concerns have been met and a satisfactory conclusion reached.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o3"><a name="51024-01_spnew2"><b> Mr. David Crausby  (Bolton, North-East)</b> 
 (Lab): Does my right hon. Friend agree that the problems of binge drinking and antisocial behaviour have grown as a result not of the licensing laws, but as a by-product of an increasingly selfish society, nurtured in the early 1980s? Does she also agree that a more civilised regime is essential to reform the existing drinking culture?


<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>24 Oct 2005 : Column 3</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br></p>








<p><a name="st_o4"><a name="51024-01_spnew3"><b> Tessa Jowell: </b> 
 I certainly agree that a regime that combines tough law enforcement and powers to crack down on antisocial behaviour and alcohol-related crime, linked to the end of the curfew for the law-abiding majority, is the right way to go, and that is the way in which the Government intend to proceed.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o5"><a name="51024-01_spnew4"><b> Mark Pritchard  (The Wrekin)</b> 
 (Con): Will the Secretary of State comment on a contradiction at the heart of Government policy with regard to alcohol disorder zones as proposed in forthcoming legislation and the 2003&nbsp;Act? Is there not a contradiction between rising antisocial behaviour as a result of excess alcohol consumption and, at the same time, the introduction of alcohol disorder zones?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o6"><a name="51024-01_spnew5"><b> Tessa Jowell: </b> 
 No, I certainly do not accept that there is any inconsistency. We have a big problem with alcohol-fuelled violence and binge drinking. The 2003&nbsp;Act makes a necessary, but not complete, contribution to solving that problem. The Violent Crime Reduction Bill, which is legislating for the introduction of alcohol disorder zones, is a second very important stage. Put together, the powers of the Violent Crime Reduction Bill and the powers of the 2003&nbsp;Act give the police unprecedented powers to crack down on alcohol-fuelled disorder. That is why getting the legislation enacted is so pressing.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o7"><a name="51024-01_spnew6"><b> Mrs. Joan Humble  (Blackpool, North and Fleetwood)</b> 
 (Lab): Is my right hon. Friend aware that 1,700&nbsp;premises licences and 2,000&nbsp;personal licences have been awarded in Blackpool? Will she congratulate seaside towns on getting the balance right between listening to the representations of the local community and taking account of the needs of visitors, to ensure that our seaside towns continue to prosper?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o8"><a name="51024-01_spnew7"><b> Tessa Jowell: </b> 
 I thank my hon. Friend for that. I certainly do pay tribute to those councillors who sat on local authority licensing panels in seaside towns and, indeed, across the country for their magnificent effort in getting us to the position in which 97&nbsp;per cent. of licences are transferred to the new regime. We also have a new regime that gives power to local residents in a way that they have never had before.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o9"><a name="51024-01_spnew8"><b> Susan Kramer  (Richmond Park)</b> 
 (LD): Does the Minister accept that in communities such as mine licensees are applying for exactly the same extended hours, thus defeating the Government&#039;s goal of staggering closing? Drunks will now come out onto the street at a time that is more disruptive to the community. They will have had even more to drink and police resources will be diminished.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o10"><a name="51024-01_spnew9"><b> Tessa Jowell: </b> 
 The pattern established by authorities around the country is different from the position in her constituency. We are indeed seeking to avoid replacing one fixed closing time with another for the reasons that she identified. I suggest that she make representations to her local council to address the problem.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o11"><a name="51024-01_spnew10"><b> Andrew Miller  (Ellesmere Port and Neston)</b> 
 (Lab): My right hon. Friend is right that the Licensing Act gives enormous power to local authorities, but there is 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>24 Oct 2005 : Column 4</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>confusion about how far they can push the boundaries, particularly with regard to the role of councillors who wish to make representations in the area where they live. Will she look at that and at whether, for example, councillors can make children&#039;s areas no-smoking areas?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o12"><a name="51024-01_spnew11"><b> Tessa Jowell: </b> 
 We have undertaken to review the implementation of the Act, and when we do so we will of course look at that. When Parliament considered that point it sought to ensure that councillors who raise concerns with the local authority&#151;such concerns could result in a licensee losing their licence&#151;do so in their representative capacity. I am happy on the strength of the experience to date to give the House an assurance that we will look at that issue in our longer-term review of the Act.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o13"><a name="51024-01_spnew12"><b> Mrs. Theresa May  (Maidenhead)</b> 
 (Con): Figures out last week showed violent crime up by 6&nbsp;per cent. on the same period last year. The Secretary of State has already referred to the link between binge drinking and violent crime, so does she not accept that the new licensing hours will simply make the problem worse?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o14"><a name="51024-01_spnew13"><b> Tessa Jowell: </b> 
 No, I certainly do not. The Association of Chief Police Officers wants the Act to be implemented on time, as do local authorities. They recognise something that seems to have escaped the right hon. Lady for many weeks&#151;the police need those new powers to tackle alcohol-related crime. In her constant opportunistic opposition she is in effect voting against the voices in the police and local government saying that we need those powers to make a serious attack on alcohol-related crime.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o15"><a name="51024-01_spnew14"><b> Mrs. May: </b> 
 I suggest that the Secretary of State listen more carefully to the question in future. I did not ask about the licensing law and the new powers; I asked about the new licensing hours. Senior police officers have made it clear that new powers are welcome but that extended licensing hours are not. A Scotland Yard report predicts an

 Some of the crimes that people commit while under the influence of alcohol are hideous. There is no dispute in the House about that, but I would not want the right hon. Lady to think that this was a decision that was reached lightly. The Government are determined to push ahead with the implementation of the Licensing Act, because we can provide protection to innocent victims by giving the police powers to take effective action.

 (Lab): If she will make a statement on the Committee of Public Accounts report on the distribution of lottery funds by awarding bodies. [20215]
</p>



<p><a name="st_o17"><a name="51024-02_spmin0"><b>The Minister for Sport and Tourism  (Mr. Richard Caborn): </b> 
 We will respond to the PAC&#039;s report before 15&nbsp;December. We agree broadly with its conclusion that lottery money must get to the communities as quickly as possible, and that we need to do more to ensure that distributors do more to get the balances down. I would also like to place it on record that we have reduced lottery balances by a third since 1999.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o18"><a name="51024-02_spnew0"><b> Mr. Illsley: </b> 
 I am grateful to my right hon. Friend for his reply. It is essential that the Government follow that route. Will he give me a reassurance that the Department will redouble its efforts to ensure that the balances are used, particularly in constituencies such as his and mine, which have traditionally received less lottery funding than other parts of the country?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o19"><a name="51024-02_spnew1"><b> Mr. Caborn: </b> 
 Much as I would like to say yes to the last part of my hon. Friend&#039;s question&#151;we accept that Barnsley and Sheffield are the centre of the universe&#151; I cannot guarantee that lottery money will be there. Seriously, however, we are determined to get the balances down, and I hope that we will get support on the National Lottery Bill, whose Committee starts sitting tomorrow. The Bill contains measures that will help the lottery distributors to get the balances down to between &#163;1.5&nbsp;billion and &#163;1.7&nbsp;billion, which we think would be reasonable. I hope that those measures will help us to achieve that objective.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o20"><a name="51024-02_spnew2"><b> Peter Luff  (Mid-Worcestershire)</b> 
 (Con): Is it not prudent for the Heritage Lottery Fund, which has recently granted &#163;3&nbsp;million to the Droitwich canals, to keep its money in the bank until it is ready to be spent, when we see the amount of money that the Government commit to the original purpose of the lottery reduced year on year, as they shift funding to other causes? Would it not be prudent to keep that money in the bank, as we are so fearful of what the Government might do to that funding stream in future?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o21"><a name="51024-02_spnew3"><b> Mr. Caborn: </b> 
 No. If the hon. Gentleman reads the PAC report, which we agree with, he will find the answers to his questions. It would be wrong to say that the Heritage Lottery Fund, the distributor, does not have to look again at these issues. Some of the measures that we hope to take in the National Lottery Bill, whose Committee starts tomorrow, will bring some discipline into these matters.

</p>








<p><a name="st_o23"><a name="51024-02_spnew5"><b> Mr. Caborn: </b> 
 I honestly do not know where these rumours come from. We take these matters seriously, so far as the Heritage Lottery Fund is concerned, and we have guaranteed it up to the end of this licence. We have also said that serious consideration must be given to enabling the good causes programme to continue after the beginning of the new licence. If we are talking about a commitment to ensuring stability of spending on good causes in the medium to long term, then, crikey, I do not think that any Government could have done more than we have. It is despicable of people to try to undermine the Heritage Lottery Fund by spreading these rumours, and they ought to stop immediately.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o24"><a name="51024-02_spnew6"><b> Mr. Laurence Robertson  (Tewkesbury)</b> 
 (Con): Rather than leaving the money in the bank, would it not be better to use it to finance an organisation called the Severn Area Rescue Association, whose application for just &#163;5,000&nbsp;for a new Land Rover to launch its lifeboats was turned down because it could not provide details of the social background of the people it rescued? I am sure that the Minister would not want its members to try to assess the wealth of the people they were dragging out of the river. Does he agree that a better way forward would be for the lottery people to review their criteria?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o25"><a name="51024-02_spnew7"><b> Mr. Caborn: </b> 
 I would not disagree with that. This is one of the reasons why we are bringing the Bill before Parliament again, and as I said earlier, we are moving with the times and trying to evolve what is probably the most successful lottery in the world. We have put these matters out to wide consultation to assess how the general public and the lottery players want the money to be spent. I have no doubt that the Big Lottery Fund will respond to some of the issues that the hon. Gentleman has mentioned, but I cannot comment on the specific case that he raised. If he wants to write to me, however, I will take the matter up with Stephen Dunmore of the Big Lottery Fund, and I will write to him with the response.

Will he also encourage a more rounded view to be taken of the receipts from each constituency? The receipts from Warrington town centre are not allocated to my constituency at all, even though it is the shopping area for Warrington, North.

 My hon. Friend probably knows that several reviews have taken place, and we have tried, wherever possible, to factor in some of the concerns that she has just expressed. Broadly speaking, I hope, we are getting that right. The distribution in terms of geography and the indices of deprivation is now factored in&#151;we have gone from capital to revenue spending, and have made it much easier, and will continue to do so through the Big Lottery Fund, for small organisations not only to apply but to get awards. We are trying to simplify and make such applications much more user-friendly, which is the whole object of the exercise.

<p><a name="st_o28"><a name="51024-02_spnew10"><b> Mr. Hugo Swire  (East Devon)</b> 
 (Con): The Minister&#039;s complacency is wondrous to behold, but the fact is that organisations such as the New Opportunities Fund, a lottery distributor under direct Government control, missed the Government&#039;s target to reduce its balances by a massive &#163;376&nbsp;million. He can add that failure to the Government&#039;s lengthening list of missed targets. Is not the real lesson of all this simple: Government interference in the lottery simply does not work? Should not the Minister therefore interfere less in the lottery, not more, as the Bill proposes? Will he drop the draconian power in the Bill that effectively allows the Government to nick lottery balances and give them to anybody the Secretary of State chooses?

<p><a name="st_o29"><a name="51024-02_spnew11"><b> Mr. Caborn: </b> 
 I have no doubt that we will have that debate in Committee in the coming weeks, and it will be very interesting. I will give reasons in Committee, rather than at the Dispatch Box, and the House will be able to debate those further at a later date. Through the Bill, we are taking no more powers than existed under NOF or the Community Fund, and we will debate those in Committee. In terms of the balances, we have been reasonably successful, although there is no doubt that we can do better. We have brought them down by a third, from &#163;3.73&nbsp;billion to &#163;2.3&nbsp;billion, which is not good enough&#151;we want to get to around &#163;1.8&nbsp;billion to &#163;1.9&nbsp;billion, which is at least sustainable. We will continue those efforts, and I hope that the hon. Gentleman will support the Government&#039;s Bill in Committee in the next few weeks. That will help us to get those balances down to the figure that I have indicated, which we think is reasonable.

 I thank the Minister for his reply, but I am particularly concerned about under-age drinking. I welcome the tough new penalties for selling alcohol to those under 18. There was a particular problem in an area in my constituency called Buckland, where antisocial behaviour was linked with under-age drinking. A partnership was formed between the local Co-op store, the police, the council and residents. On investigation, they found that it was not a case of stores selling alcohol to children, but a case of adults purchasing alcohol on children&#039;s behalf. The partnership organised a local awareness campaign, but when the police spoke to parents, they encountered a lax attitude towards children&#039;s drinking. Would the Government be prepared to undertake a nationwide awareness campaign?

 My hon. Friend has campaigned assiduously in her constituency, and we will certainly consider her suggestion of a national advertising campaign. That would, I think, be the right way in which to educate parents about their responsibilities. It is also important for us to implement the extra powers in the Act, such as the fine to punish those who sell alcohol to under-age drinkers, and the powers in the Violent Crime Reduction Bill which enable us to close for 48&nbsp;hours premises that persistently sell alcohol to under-age drinkers.

The law is due to be introduced just before Christmas, when resources in the Metropolitan police area in London are likely to be considerably stretched because of the heightened terrorist threat that exists at that time.

 The hon. Gentleman makes a good point. We are having discussions with the Home Office and the police about how they can use the extra powers in the Act over Christmas to do exactly as he suggests. The Act is, however, already producing an improvement in licensing conditions. It has led to more people joining Pubwatch. The police are using it as a way of persuading people to sign up to CCTV and pager schemes and to employ extra door staff. The licensing process has tidied up and toughened the regime that operates in pubs, and it will help us to deal with problem pubs that have got away with their practices for too long under the current licensing laws.

 It was in response to campaigning by Members of Parliament that we introduced those extra powers. Any Member who has tried to have a pub closed down knows that it is virtually impossible to do so. Only 0.2&nbsp;per cent. of premises failed to have their licences renewed last year. The Act provides for a review that any resident, the police or the council can use at any time to deal with a problem pub. We believe that the Act will change for ever the incentives provided for landlords, who will now know that if they misbehave or cause disorder on their premises, they will be on probation, that they will be targeted by the police and the council, and that their premises may be closed down.

 I obviously cannot comment on an individual case, but my experience across the country is that the police are proving successful in objecting to applications. For example, some premises are being closed down because they have a previous history of drug dealing or of causing disorder. As the hon. Lady knows, under this legislation there will for the first time be a review mechanism, so if the problems occur that she and the police are worried about, they can ask for an immediate review of the licence in question. The powers to deal with the minority of pubs and bars that cause problems are therefore much more stringent under this legislation, and they can be used much more rapidly.

 Did the England and Wales Cricket Board ask the Government to be released from the informal agreement reached by the then Secretary of State in 1998&#151;that although cricket was to be delisted, the majority of home test matches would continue to be available live on free-to-air TV? In the interests of the many rather than the few and in the interests of all who cannot afford &#163;400&nbsp;for Sky sports, should not the main test match series in the summer be restored to the A list forthwith?

 I thank my hon. Friend for that question. No, the ECB did not ask to be released and I must also say that the status of the reported gentleman&#039;s agreement is somewhat unclear. Lord MacLaurin has taken steps to clarify it and to explain that the ECB had no choice. The point at which cricket was delisted was also the point at which the Government ceased to have a direct role in the decision. From then on, the decision became a matter between the ECB and the broadcaster.

 The BBC, as television licensing authority, has responsibility for the collection and enforcement of the licence fee and TV Licensing operates as agent for the corporation.

 (DUP): There are areas where licence evasion rates are much higher than the national average, especially in parts of Northern Ireland.

 The hon. Gentleman is right to say that the evasion rate is higher in Northern Ireland, and we could all speculate on the reasons for that.

The response has been fantastic and we have already banked the first &#163;3&nbsp;million for the Olympics. Camelot was surprised at the take-up and had to reprint earlier than anticipated.

 (Con): What steps the commission plans to take to increase public confidence in voting by post. [20209]
</p>



<p><a name="st_o84"><a name="51024-05_spnew8"><b> Peter Viggers  (Gosport)</b> 
 (Con): The Electoral Commission takes the view that a key element in increasing public confidence in postal voting is improving the security of the process. Since 2003, the commission has therefore made a series of recommendations for changes to electoral law, which are designed to improve the security of postal voting in Great Britain. The commission welcomes the fact that the Government are taking forward many of its recommendations in the Electoral Administration Bill, which is due for its Second Reading in the House tomorrow, although it is disappointed that the Bill does not provide for the introduction of full individual voter registration in Great Britain.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o85"><a name="51024-05_spnew9"><b> Mr. Hollobone: </b> 
 In the Kettering constituency, some 16,000&nbsp;voters are registered to vote by post, which is one of the highest proportions of the electorate anywhere in the country. Nevertheless, that is still a small percentage of the 81,000&nbsp;voters who could do so. I congratulate my hon. Friend on identifying the point about secure individual voter registration. Only if that is put in place by the Government can voters have full confidence in the system of voting by post.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o86"><a name="51024-05_spnew10"><b> Peter Viggers: </b> 
 Yes, it is true that registration for postal voting varies considerably, for example, from 45&nbsp;per cent. in Newcastle to 3.1&nbsp;in Glasgow, East. Similarly, turnout varies considerably. In my hon. Friend&#039;s constituency, I believe that the turnout of postal voters was 60&nbsp;per cent., compared with an 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>24 Oct 2005 : Column 18</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>average across the United Kingdom of 76&nbsp;per cent. It is alarming that in its report on participation in the 2005&nbsp;general election, the Electoral Commission reported that, for the first time, research showed that the number of people rating postal voting as unsafe was higher than the number of people who rated it as safe.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o87"><a name="51024-05_spnew11"><b> Mr. Patrick McLoughlin  (West Derbyshire)</b> 
 (Con): Has the Electoral Commission done any work on the number of postal votes that arrived after the poll in the general election was closed? That would be an interesting figure, bearing in mind some of the complaints that were made about the problems of getting out the postal votes in the first instance.

<p><a name="st_o90"><a name="51024-05_spnew14"><b> Kate Hoey: </b> 
 Does my hon.

Will he guarantee that if the Church Commissioners sell off the rest of those properties, they will do so to a registered social landlord and not to a 50:50&nbsp;partnership between a social landlord and a private landlord, as has already happened? Will he guarantee that rent levels will be protected? Does he agree with my constituent, who is a tenant of the Church Commissioners&#151;and who was very proud to be a tenant of the Church Commissioners until now&#151;and who wrote to me this week:

 I refer the hon. Gentleman to the Church Commissioners&#039; track record on these matters.

However, I stress that that sale involved the freehold only and that existing tenancy arrangements were unchanged. The Church Commissioners will listen to all the points raised by tenants, but they have a statutory obligation to manage their funds in the interests of the Church, in the interests of those who receive moneys from the Church and in the interests of the cure of souls.

Far from vindicating the Government in all respects, as they try to claim, the court case merely excused them from that one extreme and specific charge.

<p><a name="st_10"><a name="51024-07_spmin0"><b>The Secretary of State for Transport  (Mr. Alistair Darling): </b> 
 The hon. Gentleman said at the outset that he wished largely to ignore the judgment and I can see why. It would be highly inconvenient for him if he did take it into account. Does he accept that all this evidence and all these documents were laid before the court, that the court was invited to find that the Government, Ministers and others had acted improperly, and that the judge found the complete opposite?&#151;<i>[Interruption.]</i> No wonder the hon.

<p><a name="st_11"><a name="51024-07_spnew6"><b> Mr. Duncan: </b> 
 The Secretary of State could not be more wrong and he knows it. The evidence before the court was to prove one particular aspect of the alleged misbehaviour of one person, the right hon.

The judge specifically said in his judgment that it is for Parliament to adjudicate on the conduct of the Government. That is what we are doing today.

<p><a name="st_12"><a name="51024-07_spnew7"><b> Mr. Darling: </b> 
 I am sorry, but the hon. Gentleman has either not read the judgment or has drawn the wrong inference from it. The judge, in respect of the evidence given in court by my right hon. Friend the Member for North Tyneside (Mr. Byers), said that that was a matter for the House of Commons. However, in his judgment he examined every piece of evidence put before the court, which of necessity meant examining the background against which Ministers acted, and he found at no stage that anyone in the Government had acted improperly. Surely the hon. Gentleman must accept that, unless he is saying that he does not accept the judgment.
</p>








<p><a name="st_13"><a name="51024-07_spnew8"><b> Mr. Duncan: </b> 
 That was a nice try, but again it is completely wrong. As the Secretary of State well knows, the judge was only looking at the specific allegation put to the court about the conduct of the right hon.

Member for North Tyneside told the High Court about a special list that had been nicknamed the 10&nbsp;commandments&#151;10&nbsp;conditions that needed to be satisfied before the plan to crush Railtrack was hatched. Can we guess who the 10&nbsp;commandments came from? Yes, they came from the Chancellor&#151;and it gets better. I have obtained from the Permanent Secretary at the Department for Transport minutes of a very interesting meeting in September 2001, where further details of the plot were discussed behind Parliament&#039;s back. Let me quote a small part of the official record of the meeting. It states: &quot;The Secretary of State&quot;&#151;to us, the right hon. Member for North Tyneside&#151;

<a name="51024-07_para10">
<a name="stpa_23">Abundant evidence was produced in the court case showing that from the very beginning of 2001&#151;six months before the right hon. Member for North Tyneside became Secretary of State&#151;the Government planned to seize Railtrack&#039;s assets and use railway administration as the means to that end. The papers show that right up to the day before they went to court&#151;7&nbsp;October 2001&#151;the Government were seriously worried about not having adequate evidence of Railtrack&#039;s insolvency. Again, I could give the House scores of examples in which it is abundantly clear that that was so, but I shall offer only a few.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51024-07_para11">
<a name="stpa_24">On 3&nbsp;August, the right hon. Gentleman wrote a memo to the Prime Minister in which he deals with options for dealing with Railtrack. He talks of the not-for-profit trust, which became the company limited by guarantee option, which was soon after adopted, saying:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_6">&quot;The option of a not-for-profit trust has attractions as a non-nationalisation alternative to a failed private sector solution.&quot;</p>

<a name="stpa_25">The House knows that to be lawful a Minister may use statutory powers, such as the power to apply for an administration order, only for the purpose for which they were conferred. The administration power of the Secretary of State was given to him by Parliament to enable him to react to the insolvency of a railway company. In the present case, the evidence is 

<br>&nbsp;<br>

 I wish to intervene because, contrary to all the evidence, the hon.

As I shall demonstrate shortly, that is not quite the case. I am wondering how the hon. Gentleman can square what he says with a letter that was sent to the Department in March 2001&nbsp;from Railtrack, which states that on its own analysis, on the day when its shares were trading at 800p a share, the company thought that they were worth 60p a share.

<p><a name="st_26"><a name="51024-08_spnew12"><b> Mr. Darling: </b> 
 That was not my assessment; that came from Railtrack.

That is not my judgment but the judgment of Railtrack.

<p><a name="st_27"><a name="51024-08_spnew13"><b> Mr. Duncan: </b>

: That was not about reacting to the company&#039;s insolvency; it was about cutting its financial lifeline, and the right hon. Gentleman has just condemned himself with his own words. Indeed, the company was not insolvent, because that lifeline was available. As it would have taken highly controversial primary legislation and a period of months in which to pass such legislation, including the use of the Parliament Act, to sever that lifeline, the Government had a major problem. How could they present the judge with a convincing case that Railtrack was already insolvent when that lifeline was still intact? They were seriously worried.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51024-09_para10">
<a name="stpa_53">The Government knew that they were planning to use the railway administration regime for a collateral, and therefore illegal, purpose.

They knew that they could not sever that lifeline without legislation, and that they could not pass such legislation in a short enough period of time, so they decided to present to the Court a case that contained serious and culpable omissions.

It demonstrates beyond all doubt the utter contempt that Ministers and special advisers had for shareholders. I remind the House that 90&nbsp;per cent of Railtrack&#039;s employees held shares in the company, and many of the shareholders were small investors, so we are not talking about big business or fat cats. Gordon&#039;s representative on Earth has described shareholders as &quot;grannies&quot; on many occasions.

During the period up to and immediately after the administration order was made, the Government displayed two characteristics that were extremely damaging and alarming to confidence, in their actions and their iron-control mindset. They showed that they did not understand the importance of independent economic regulation and regarded it as a disposable commodity; and they showed such contempt for the constitutional significance of an independent institution that they had to devise a discreditable plan to extinguish that independence, to prevent it from interfering with their plan to seize the assets of a FTSE 100&nbsp;company for nothing.

There was one more obstacle&#151;a formidable obstacle&#151;to the Government&#039;s secret plan: the independent rail regulator. I emphasise the word &quot;independent&quot;, as the holder of that office, established in 1993, oversees the economic regulation of the railways. Independence from the Government has always been critical, but the Government were very worried. Ministers and special advisers were quaking in their boots. Why? Because in situations that were difficult for Railtrack, the independent rail regulator had power to throw the company a financial lifeline. During the summer of 2001, the office of the rail regulator therefore posed a significant threat to the Government&#039;s secret plans. Perhaps that is why Brian Hackland, head of the Prime Minister&#039;s policy unit at No. 10, e-mailed colleagues in September 2001&nbsp;to ask:

The papers given to the judge do not adequately explain the nature of the rail regulator&#039;s powers&#151;powers to advance potentially billions of pounds more in financial support to Railtrack&#151;or the fact that he had twice announced, in January and May 2001, his intention to carry out such a review.

<p><a name="st_54"><a name="51024-11_spnew7"><b> Mr. Duncan: </b> 
 In my view, Railtrack should have done so and is culpable for not having done so. The principal basis of the Government&#039;s case that Railtrack was insolvent was a report from Arthur Andersen, which stated:

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_48">&quot;We have no information regarding Ariel&#039;s ability to raise additional funding via alternative sources.&quot;</p>

<a name="stpa_95">The report was heavily relied upon as evidence of Railtrack&#039;s insolvency. The evidence of the then rail regulator to the High Court in the shareholders&#039; case says that if Arthur Andersen did not know about the rail regulator&#039;s power to award additional money to Railtrack in higher access charges, someone should have told it, and in any case, someone should have told the Court.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51024-11_para13">
<a name="stpa_96">Will the Secretary of State tell the House why the Court was not told about the availability of an alternative source of finance via the rail regulator, and whether it was assumed that a bald statement that the Government had decided to introduce a Bill to enable the Secretary of State to give directions to the rail regulator was enough to excuse the need to provide such an explanation.

<p><a name="st_55"><a name="51024-11_spnew8"><b> Mr. Bernard Jenkin  (North Essex) (Con):</b> 
 May I point out that the rail regulator was appointed by the Deputy Prime Minister, who was then Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions, and that it was widely regarded as a controversial appointment?

<p><a name="st_56"><a name="51024-11_spnew9"><b> Mr. Duncan: </b> 
 My hon. Friend, having held the post of shadow Secretary of State in the past, has considerable expertise in this matter, and I hear what he says.

<p>
<a name="51024-11_para14">
<a name="stpa_97">Why, too, one might ask, was there no mention by the rail regulator of the Hatfield statement on 15&nbsp;January 2001&nbsp;or again on 24&nbsp;May? That provided undeniably crucial information about the willingness of the rail regulator to conduct an interim review, but it was not disclosed to the judge. The Secretary of State may say that the judge was told that the independence of the rail regulator would soon be blown away, so there was no need to tell the judge about his powers. However, the right hon. Member for North Tyneside told the House on 13&nbsp;November 2001&nbsp;that if the judge had known that the rail regulator had the power to do an interim review and had started the process, he would probably not have made the administration order. That is a stark admission, as it could only be because, until the rail regulator&#039;s independence had been removed and he had been stopped from doing an interim review, the company was not insolvent.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51024-11_para15">
<a name="stpa_98">The independence had not been removed and the rail regulator showed, by his offer to Railtrack on 6&nbsp;October, when senior management called the regulator to ask for a review&#151;to be told that he was willing to start the process and make an announcement to that effect&#151;that he had not been stopped from carrying out that review. The Government had tried to intimidate him with the threat of legislation, but the rail regulator was not intimidated. It was Railtrack that had been scared witless by the threat, which is why it foolishly turned down the rail regulator&#039;s offer to start the interim review process. It could not be assumed that a short Bill to enable the Secretary of State to give directions to the rail regulator would pass in time to stop the regulator&#039;s interim review proceeding. The right hon. Member for North Tyneside admitted in court in 2005&nbsp;that it could not have been passed in time.
</p>

<p>

The question is: having decided to take action&#151;in the right or wrong direction; it does not matter&#151;did the Government proceed in a straightforward and fair fashion, or in an underhand, cynical way that showed a cynical disregard for the interests of small shareholders? That is why the quotation from Shriti Vadera is so important. Does not that reflect all too well the new Labour values that permeate the Government, including the Treasury?

 The Government did act appropriately. My point is that the directors knew that the shares were worth a fraction of what they were trading at, because they knew that the company faced deep-seated problems. I mentioned the valuation of the shares earlier. I am also bound to draw the House&#039;s attention to the fact that the company wrote to all its shareholders in April 2001&nbsp;drawing attention to its agreement with the Government, which states:


</p>
<ul>

</p>

<p>
<a name="51024-14_para4">
<a name="stpa_145">It is worth reminding the House that on 20&nbsp;August the directors of Railtrack were proposing to set aside the regulatory regime for four years&#151;so much for the much vaunted independent economic regulation. They wanted unconditional funding from the taxpayer. They wanted to emerge after the four-year period with their shares worth between &#163;3.50&nbsp;and &#163;5&#151;and of course the Government would have to underwrite that value. In the meantime, they were going to carry on with a dividend of 20p per share. In other words: everything courtesy of the taxpayer.

</p>








<p><a name="st_93"><a name="51024-14_spnew7"><b> Mr. Darling: </b> 
 Let me put this to the hon. Gentlemen&#151;if they accept that this was a company with deep-seated financial and management problems: how on earth could the Government be justified in simply saying, &quot;Have some more money&quot;?
</p>








<p><a name="st_94"><a name="51024-14_spnew8"><b> Mr. Blunt: </b> 
 The fact is that the company was operating in an environment in which very shortly after it was taken into administration it required another &#163;7&nbsp;billion to underwrite it or to keep it in operation. When the Secretary of State describes the circumstances known to the directors, that was the environment in which the company was operating prior to October 2001. Subsequently, is it not true that the Government had to give the company, as Network Rail, &#163;14&nbsp;billion to achieve solvency?
</p>








<p><a name="st_95"><a name="51024-14_spnew9"><b> Mr. Darling: </b> 
 The hon. Gentleman ignores the fact that the company did not have only financial problems. Everybody accepts that in the late 1990s and the first part of 2000, and after Hatfield, it became apparent that the deep-seated problem of successive years of lack of maintenance meant that costs were rising. However, it was to do with the management as well.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51024-14_para5">
<a name="stpa_146">It is worth repeating Railtrack&#039;s comments about the genesis of its problems because they show that the problems were due to management as much as finance. Railtrack defined the problems as lack of any recent major projects experience inherited from British Rail. It did not have the expertise in-house to deal with such matters. The company defined another problem as


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_71">&quot;stunning commercial naivety in agreeing to loosely-scoped, fixed-price contracts&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="51024-14_para6">
<a name="stpa_147">years in advance of its ability sensibly to price the risks or lay them off on contractors. It also stated that that was compounded by guaranteeing outputs without adequate timetabling work and without scoping infrastructure works. That, in turn, was compounded by more traffic and a declining infrastructure.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51024-14_para7">
<a name="stpa_148">In other words, the company&#039;s problems were not only financial but due to management. In the days following the judgment, the hon. Member for Rutland and Melton appeared reluctant to admit that the Tory position was to give that poorly managed company, which had financial problems, more money.
</p>








<p><a name="st_96"><a name="51024-14_spnew10"><b> Mr. Bellingham: </b> 
 Let me revert to the point that my hon. Friend the Member for Reigate (Mr. Blunt) made. If the company had not been forced into insolvency, it

<b>24 Oct 2005 : Column 47</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>would have remained a FTSE company and retained access to global capital markets, which Network Rail does not possess because its only source of finance is the Government. Will the Secretary of State confirm the figure of &#163;14&nbsp;billion? How much extra has the process cost the taxpayer?
</p>








<p><a name="st_97"><a name="51024-14_spnew11"><b> Mr. Darling: </b> 
 The point is that the company was insolvent. It approached the Government to say that it could not make ends meet. Paragraph 105&nbsp;of the judgment refers to a representative of Railtrack&#039;s advisers, Credit Suisse: First Boston, and states:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_72">&quot;He said Railtrack had virtually no management control, it was the worst case he had seen for a period and that there was management paralysis. It had major projects without the skills to manage them.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="51024-14_para8">
<a name="stpa_149">Yet Conservative Members&#039; central argument is that the Government should have given Railtrack more money through a regulatory review. That is nonsense.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51024-14_para9">
<a name="stpa_150">What were the Government supposed to do with a company that was painting a picture throughout 2001&nbsp;of financial difficulties and self-confessed management failings? The Tory answer is, &quot;Give them more money.&quot; I do not believe that the majority of people would agree with such a proposition.
</p>








<p><a name="st_98"><a name="51024-14_spnew12"><b> John Bercow  (Buckingham) (Con):</b> 
 I appreciate that the Secretary of State is in a difficult position and that he is probably trying to tough it out.

If so, he has lost his moral compass.

The Secretary of State and Ministers&#151;they make the decisions&#151;acted correctly when faced with a company that had deep financial problems and deep-seated management difficulties.

<a name="stpa_154">I want to come to the regulatory point, of which the hon. Member for Rutland and Melton made much. By way of background, it is worth bearing it in mind that the regulator himself had been quite critical of Railtrack.

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_75">&quot;Railtrack should put away the begging bowl, and stop spending valuable management time hawking themselves . . . round Whitehall, and knuckle down to getting train services back to a sustainable level of reliability and quality of service.&quot;</p>

<a name="stpa_171">The hon. Gentleman says that the judge should not have made that decision, suggesting that incomplete information was laid before him. I repeat the point that Railtrack could have objected to the administration order. It could have said, &quot;If you only allow the regulator to come in and bail us out, everything will be fine.&quot; Indeed, Mr Justice Lindsay, in his judgment on 14&nbsp;October, said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_83">&quot;Mr Byers is accused of engineering a situation in which he could present evidence that Railtrack was or was unlikely to be able to pay its debts. But that needed no engineering.&quot;</p>

</p>

<p>
<a name="51024-16_para3">
<a name="stpa_172">That is what the judge found. My right hon. Friend the Member for North Tyneside did not engineer the situation.

</p>

<p>
<a name="51024-16_para4">
<a name="stpa_173">It seems that the foundation upon which the Conservatives seek to build their case falls apart. Railtrack was heading towards insolvency throughout 2001. It had grossly underestimated its costs, it had lost control of its finances and it was in deep financial trouble. Its own advisers said that there was management paralysis. The difference between us seems to be that the Tories would have said, &quot;Never mind, have some more taxpayers&#039; money.&quot; Our position is quite different. Our position was that in the light of these difficulties the Government were not prepared simply to bail out the company. It was appropriate, when the company eventually went into administration, to put in place an organisation that could run the railways properly.

It is clear to me, coming relatively fresh to the situation, having read the court judgment and having considered all the evidence, that the Government and our Ministers acted entirely properly. That is why I believe that the House should agree to the amendment and throw out the nonsensical motion that has been tabled by the Conservative party&#151;a party that is discredited for the way in which it brought about rail privatisation and allowed Railtrack to be created.

</p>

<p>
<a name="51024-16_para7">
<a name="stpa_176">I shall give a few examples of Railtrack&#039;s performance. At the time of administration, it was preparing to pay a fine of at least &#163;10&nbsp;million for failing to reduce train delays. There was Lord Cullen&#039;s public inquiry into the deaths at Ladbroke Grove, which found Railtrack to be an incompetent and inadequate company. Railtrack&#039;s poor performance was also the subject of a report by consultants Booz Allen Hamilton, which was very critical of the lack of investment by Railtrack. It found that track renewals had averaged only 1.3&nbsp;per cent. per annum during the control period, which was 1995&#150;2001, which was a low rate of renewal compared with European railways, which typically replace 2&nbsp;to 3&nbsp;per cent. per annum. Railtrack&#039;s 1995&nbsp;business plan referred to 2.2&nbsp;per cent. renewals per annum, not 1.3&nbsp;per cent., which it delivered. Clearly it was far short of delivering on its targets.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51024-16_para8">
<a name="stpa_177">The National Audit Office report, published on 14&nbsp;May 2004, entitled &quot;Network Rail&#151;Making a Fresh Start&quot;, quoted a number of factors that contributed to Railtrack&#039;s failure, including a lack of attention to its core business, leading to underinvestment in the infrastructure, loss of engineering skills and poor asset knowledge.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51024-16_para9">
<a name="stpa_178">Given the background of the Hatfield crash, the record for track failure rose by 42&nbsp;per cent.

I checked out the website for the shadow Home Secretary. On 29&nbsp;March, he listed 14&nbsp;campaigns, all of which he seemed to have launched on that one day.

Friend the Secretary of State, however, we can also consider the nature of the privatisation of Railtrack in the first place. I am delighted that the former Chancellor of the Exchequer, the right hon. and learned Member for Rushcliffe (Mr. Clarke), will be replying to this debate. I hope that he will explain to the House what value there was for taxpayers in his writing off &#163;1.4&nbsp;billion owed to the taxpayer so that Railtrack would not inherit the debt, thereby making it more juicy for potential shareholders. That was a bung of huge proportions from the former Chancellor&#151;to make the privatisation fly in the markets, he made a &#163;1.4&nbsp;billion gift.

<a name="51024-18_para2">
<a name="stpa_208">It is worth reminding the House that under the Conservative Government&#039;s Railways Act 1993, which saw the privatisation of large sections of the railway system, Railtrack, responsible for the infrastructure, was kept in the public sector. That was for a good reason: everybody realised that the infrastructure operators and licence holder had to be accountable to the travelling public, not to private shareholders. However, John Major, the former Prime Minister, desperate to unite a party that was bitterly divided over issues such as Europe&#151;if I can say that to the right hon. and learned Member for Rushcliffe&#151;wanted a bone of dogma to give his braying Back Benchers. That dogmatic bone was the privatisation of Railtrack, pushed through in 1996.

<a name="51024-18_para3">
<a name="stpa_209">Every independent commentator said that it simply did not make sense to have the licence holder in the private sector, accountable to shareholders and with a legal duty to put their interests first, not those of the travelling public. The right hon. and learned Member for Rushcliffe, however, when Chancellor of the Exchequer, wrote off &#163;1.4&nbsp;billion of taxpayer&#039;s money to make that privatisation float. In addition, a &#163;69&nbsp;million surplus had been made by Railtrack while in the public sector. What did he do with it? He did not use it for schools or to employ more nurses. He held it back and then showered it over the new shareholders in Railtrack like confetti&#151;&#163;69&nbsp;million of confetti. That money was

 When I was Secretary of State, I obviously had to have regard to the interests of shareholders, which is right and proper.

People chose to invest in Railtrack shares, and they received the value that was in the company. That is the nature of shareholding. There was value in the company&#151;what was it? &#163;2.50&nbsp;or &#163;2.60&nbsp;per shareholder&#151;and it was right for the shareholders to receive that amount.

Reading the papers, I rather thought that his main motives at the time were to get hold of its assets at minimum cost and at the shareholders&#039; expense, and to ensure that the successor company kept its debts off the public balance sheet. There is no mention of this concern for the travelling public, this desire to avenge the wrongs of nationalisation or the dreadful instance of the Hatfield crash. Is the right hon.

 That was an interesting intervention, although it was more of a winding-up speech. There is no chicanery here. I am sure that this was the right decision, and I am even more confident of that now than when I took it way back in October 2001. Politically, I can see the value of the private sector in some parts of public service, but I do not accept that contracting out to a private sector company that is accountable only to shareholders is the right way forward for good, high-quality public services. If we can get the private sector to work for the public service, that is acceptable.

 That certainly was not the thrust of Lord Cullen&#039;s judgment when he issued his public report on the tragic crash at Ladbroke Grove.

<a name="stpa_220">A lot has been made this afternoon of Railtrack&#039;s not being insolvent. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State has gone through a number of clear statements showing that Railtrack itself told the Government that it was in great difficulties. Mr. Smith, an employee and senior member of Railtrack who was the interface between the company and the Government, wrote to the Government on 16&nbsp;March 2001, when shares in Railtrack were trading on the market at &#163;8&nbsp;each. He said that in the view of Railtrack and its board, the true value of those shares was 60p each.

The judge in the case called it a remarkable document. He said that it accepted that processes for maintaining and renewing the railway to an acceptable standard had clearly been broken, and that there were no robust plans in place to live within the rail regulator&#039;s targets, even before the lessons of the Hatfield derailment. There was a significant unwillingness by managers higher up to live within budgets and plans, and the business plan could not

<a name="stpa_223">Railtrack&#039;s audited results for the year ending 31&nbsp;March 2001&nbsp;appeared on 24&nbsp;May 2001. For the first time, the Railtrack Group had made a loss, after taxation, of &#163;559&nbsp;million&#151;down from the previous year&#039;s profit of &#163;295&nbsp;million. That, I would have thought, would have given a stark warning to many of the private shareholders and small investors, to whom the hon. Member for Rutland and Melton and others have referred. A gap of &#163;3.6&nbsp;billion was disclosed between budgeted income and expenditure during what is called control period 2. The projected cost of the west coast main line had increased and escalated to &#163;6.3&nbsp;billion as a result of Railtrack&#039;s management.

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_106">&quot;It would not, in my view, be unfair to comment that a company which needed, as did Railtrack, to give very careful attention to whether its accounts could properly be prepared on a going concern basis was a company which was likely to be heading towards seriously difficult times.&quot;</p>

<p>
<a name="51024-19_para5">
<a name="stpa_225">The final piece of the jigsaw in respect of the real value of Railtrack came on 4&nbsp;June 2001, when the financial brokers ABN Amro, released a circular with a selling recommendation to the market as to the value of Railtrack shares. It analysed the financial position of Railtrack in some detail and there were dire warnings. It said that investors should be in no doubt that their equity was in danger of being wiped out and that the rising levels of debt threatened to engulf the value of its regulated assets, rendering the equity worthless. The then current share price of 438p implied wildly optimistic outcomes. Based on its expectations of performance, Amro valued Railtrack&#039;s shares at 58p.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51024-19_para6">
<a name="stpa_226">We can therefore see the financial position of Railtrack in the statements of Railtrack itself and from independent financial commentators who made it clear that the company was in great difficulties. Investors were warned to be careful in case their equity was wiped out. All the warning signs were there.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51024-19_para7">
<a name="stpa_227">Then, of course, there is the view of the regulator. Conservative Members have made a big issue of the role played by the regulator. It was in many ways a unique privatised sector because, although regulation applied across all privatisations, Railtrack was the only privatised utility that depended on a public subsidy. Two thirds of its revenue came from taxpayers and no other regulator had the same responsibility. With the regulation of gas and electricity, for example, when the regulator makes his determinations, he is not signing a cheque on behalf of the Government. That is the difference: when the rail regulator makes a determination, it is not the shareholders or the private sector, but the taxpayer who bears the cost. We are talking about a structure that was set up under the Conservatives to make Railtrack work in the City: they introduced an independent regulator but, exceptionally, one who was using taxpayers&#039; money to subsidise the company.

He said that Railtrack could not be trusted to deliver, that its share price had fallen below the 1996&nbsp;offer price and that it had lost its essential skills base of engineers.

<a name="51024-20_para2">
<a name="stpa_234">Mr. Winsor was robust in his approach to Railtrack, and it was for that reason that the company came to the Government and not to the rail regulator for an interim review&#151;the route established by the Conservative Government when they were in office. Because the rail regulator was sending out such a clear message, the company decided to try to do a deal with the Government. I can understand why. A deal was done in April 2001, when &#163;1.5&nbsp;billion was brought forward in what was described as the endeavour settlement to assist Railtrack in its financial difficulties, largely as a result of Hatfield. A deal was done with the Government. The company pleaded poverty and &#163;1.5&nbsp;billion was made available. It is interesting that, within a month, &#163;134&nbsp;million of that sum had been given out in a dividend to Railtrack shareholders.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51024-20_para3">
<a name="stpa_235">Another key point about the April settlement is that the Government made it clear that, although we would stand behind the railway industry, we would not stand behind individual companies and that shareholders needed to be aware of that fact. Unlike what the hon. Member for Rutland and Melton said, the Government were open about our approach to the railway industry. There were to be no more bail-outs. People learned lessons after the &#163;1.5&nbsp;billion in April and we hoped that that money would see Railtrack through, but the company told us that it needed more money.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51024-20_para4">
<a name="stpa_236">Railtrack came to the Government in strictest confidence, however, so it was not something we could make public. The company wanted help but it told us about the position in confidence. The right hon. and learned Member for Rushcliffe will know from his outside interests that companies often approach the Government on a commercially confidential basis, which is not to be made public to the stock market or anybody else. That is what happened in that case and I make no apology for it. The matter was not something to be debated openly. A company was coming to the Government in private, in commercial confidentiality, saying, &quot;We&#039;ve got these problems. Can you help us out?&quot;. As a result, we held discussions, especially from 25&nbsp;July, to try to resolve the difficulties that Railtrack faced. On 5&nbsp;October, I had to decide whether to give more public money to Railtrack or tell the company that enough was enough and that, if it was insolvent, it should petition for administration.

The company was failing in management terms and it can also be argued that its structure and the way that it was set up&#151;putting the interests of shareholders first&#151;could not deliver for the railway. The performance figures show that the railways are on the mend. There still needs to be much improvement, but the structure that is in place and that is being built on by my right hon.

He asked them when they wanted the money. They said, &quot;By Monday.&quot; They wanted millions of pounds by Monday. That was the response of the Railtrack directors. Mr. Winsor indicated clearly that, although he could conduct a review, I would have to take the measure through this place and the House of Lords and that it would take time, but they did not want to know. They knew that the game was up and that Railtrack was a company that could not pay its way. For that reason, when the case got to the court on the Sunday, they waived the two-days&#039; notice that was theirs. They could have delayed the whole thing by a couple of days to have proper conversations with the regulator. They did not do that, but waived their right to have another couple of days to try to get a deal with the rail regulator. They gave up&#151;they did not want to know.

With Network Rail, we now have a far better system that can put the travelling public first and we are beginning to see improvements in the railway system as a result. When the chairman of Railtrack met the Prime Minister in July 2001, he described his view of Railtrack. I shall quote because the language may not be quite parliamentary. He said that Railtrack was &quot;a crap company&quot;. He was absolutely right in that analysis of Railtrack.

I did it with the powers that I then had as Secretary of State for Transport, and I am absolutely confident that it was the right decision to take in the public interest and for those people who travel every day on our railway network. So I make no apology for that decision and for unwinding the Tory privatisation that was Railtrack. It was failing the industry and the travelling public, and we did things rightly and properly in the public interest. That is why I will support the Government amendment this evening.

That lies at the heart of the debate. As well as the hugely important issue of running an efficient railway, it is possibly even more important that we run a fair and decent Government, and the whole episode reveals that the current group of Ministers&#151;especially the Chancellor of the Exchequer and his advisers&#151;are not capable of doing so.

Permanent officials would not write e-mails like that about a sensitive matter of public policy, because they have proper regard for the way in which advice to Ministers should be devised and presented. Under previous Governments, special advisers would not have written like that, either. It is not a matter of pedantry or trying to wrap up advice in Sir Humphrey-style obfuscation; it is a decent regard for propriety, without which even democratic government loses its legitimacy.

<a name="stpa_256">We have just had an interesting debate about the role of the rail regulator and Mr. Tom Winsor&#039;s interpretation of it. It was entirely in the Government&#039;s power in four years to instigate a discussion and introduce legislation. They chose not to do so. When it came to the point where they wanted to renationalise Railtrack on the cheap, they realised that he might be an obstacle, so they started threatening him. The history of that episode shows that instead of having a proper policy debate, they choose to do things behind closed doors.

<a name="51024-21_para16">
<a name="stpa_257">It is worth analysing who lies behind this manifestation of the increase in special advisers&#039; powers and the misuse of that power. The plans for the destruction of Railtrack on the cheap were clearly hatched in the Treasury, and the spider at the centre of the web was the Chancellor of the Exchequer. It is a little ironic, but I feel sorry for the Prime Minister, who has had to suffer public rebuke following the Butler report for his informal style of sofa government. The Chancellor is in many ways more culpable of subverting the proper processes of government, because he is characteristically more thorough, more rigorous and more focused than the Prime Minister when he sets about subverting the processes of proper government.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51024-21_para17">
<a name="stpa_258">The Chancellor&#039;s special adviser in this case was assiduous in pulling together and forcing through the policy that led to the collapse of Railtrack. To return to my first point, such behaviour on the part of a special adviser was unthinkable under any previous Government of any party. Special advisers are in a privileged position and should recognise that that brings responsibilities. That has clearly not happened in this case. Even more importantly, senior Ministers who appoint and employ special advisers should make it clear to them that they are expected to meet the highest standards of propriety&#151;the standards that all of us expect from permanent officials. It is plain that the Chancellor does not expect or encourage his special advisers to meet those high standards.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51024-21_para18">
<a name="stpa_259">All that is a most serious charge to lay at the Chancellor&#039;s door. He aspires to be Prime Minister. In that role he would be responsible for the conduct of all his Ministers. Why should Ministers or special advisers respect the rules when the Chancellor of the Exchequer holds the rules in contempt? The Government&#039;s conduct over Railtrack stinks, because those at the very top of the Government do not care about using their power in a proper, decent and fair way. For that they should be ashamed.

That is the only subject of the debate, and all the contributions that we have heard this afternoon from the Government Benches about how it was something to do with the success or otherwise of Railtrack are red herrings. They are irrelevant to the case. I have been in business for the past 15&nbsp;years. It is a company limited by guarantee, so there are shareholders. The idea that a Government can take away those shares without due process and, in this case, without reference in advance to Parliament, is appalling. That is exactly what happened.

<p><a name="st_161"><a name="51024-22_spnew1"><b> Mr. Byers: </b> 
 The hon. Gentleman stated that the Government took away the shares of those who held shares in Railtrack. To ensure that he is not misleading the House, will he reconsider what he said? He will know that Railtrack shareholders got &#163;2.50, I think, or &#163;2.60&nbsp;each, so they got the value in the company. The Government did not take away any shares from Railtrack shareholders.

<p><a name="st_162"><a name="51024-22_spnew2"><b> Grant Shapps: </b> 
 Indeed. I am grateful for the right hon. Gentleman&#039;s intervention. Earlier, he told us that he thought shareholders got &#163;2.50&nbsp;or &#163;2.60&nbsp;when the company went into administration. I can tell him that the shares were at &#163;2.80&nbsp;when he effectively put Railtrack into administration, and the shareholders were compensated at just &#163;2.50.

It is not even an argument about whether we think the directors of the company were running the company correctly. There is well established company law to deal with all those matters. If the company was trading insolvently, just as if my company were trading insolvently, there are laws to deal with the directors in such instances. It is not good enough for the Government or the former Secretary of State for Transport, Local Government and the Regions to say that because the company was inefficient, or even if the company was in some way acting incorrectly in a legal sense, the only choice was to force it into administration, yet that is exactly what happened. The critical point is that it happened without reference to the House.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51024-22_para2">
<a name="stpa_262">The same argument is used about the independent rail regulator and the idea that he could not have been approached differently. We have heard about the e-mails that were flying about. In one, the Government were concerned that the rail regulator might thwart them, and they considered the Office of the Rail Regulator a &quot;total wild card&quot;. In the e-mails of September and October 2001, the Government said that if they could not silence the regulator, and if he stood up to them, the plan to keep the company solvent would be &quot;up the creek&quot;. In other words, the right hon. Gentleman feared the rail regulator.

In the past eight years, most of the proper process has been subverted by the way in which new Labour operates, of which the Railtrack case is a prime example&#151;indeed, it is the best example that we have seen so far, because of all the evidence that has come out.

Today, the Government are trying to evade responsibility by introducing general arguments about the privatisation of the railways and the competence of Railtrack&#039;s directors, whom I will not defend. They are avoiding not only the decision itself, but the very way in which the decision was taken and the processes by which the ultimate insolvency occurred and the situation we face today arose.

I have been through all the papers and, so far as I can see, no Cabinet paper was ever produced and most Ministers, including most members of the Cabinet, had no idea what was being planned. That is a classic example of informal decision making on the sofa of one Minister or another.

Friend the Member for Bury St. Edmunds (Mr. Ruffley), who was also a special adviser, had sent such e-mails to the Department for Transport and had addressed the Secretary of State and his officials in the same way as the current Chancellor&#039;s special adviser, they would have been sacked. However, I would have expected any half-decent Secretary of State for Transport to have thrown out the Chancellor&#039;s special adviser and sent her back to the Treasury. When the Chancellor wants to issue instructions, he should have the courtesy to call a meeting and issue them himself.

<a name="51024-22_para15">
<a name="stpa_275">What were those instructions, and what was the Government&#039;s motive? The right hon. Member for North Tyneside has attempted to evade the whole point of the debate. He relies heavily on the fact that the court found in his favour, but it did so because the shareholders had to climb the extraordinary mountain of seeking to demonstrate that he was acting out of a sense of personal malice against them, which they failed to do. The court expressly left open the politics of the matter, and I do not think that a court was the right place to determine the proper conduct of government, the parliamentary process and other things.

<a name="stpa_276">I have no personal malice against the right hon. Member for North Tyneside, but he cannot escape either on the grounds of the court judgment or on the evidence he cited, where he was just being disingenuous. He says that he was motivated by a concern for the travelling public, but they are not mentioned&#151;there is not even a passing reference&#151;in the e-mails. <i>[Laughter.]</i> Suddenly, he remembered Hatfield and Ladbroke Grove. There is nothing in the papers about punishment being imposed for the undoubted lapses in maintenance standards at Hatfield and Ladbroke Grove. He talked about how much he resented having the legislation, which was not his creation, that gave the regulator his role, and how it was really all the Conservatives&#039; fault that that was there in the first place. He is a Blairite&#151;a pro-privatiser. When the privatisation of the Royal Mail is proposed, if the Government can sort it out, he might even agree with me on that&#151;I have no idea. During all his years in government he never showed the slightest interest in renationalising anything. For four years, his Government were in office and did nothing whatever to change the structure that they had, including the role of the independent regulator.

<a name="stpa_277">Let us have none of this. The right hon. Gentleman and Ms Vadera were not driven by a sense of concern for the travelling public or by a sense of outrage at the evils of privatisation or the rail accidents that had occurred. They were interested in two things. The first, which we have not touched on today and is the subject for a much wider debate, is the Chancellor&#039;s overriding concern that the new body that was to be set up should be off balance sheet. That is why it failed and every other device failed. The thing that the Chancellor was most

 The right hon. Member for North Tyneside (Mr. Byers) has just agreed.
</p>








<p><a name="st_165"><a name="51024-23_spnew1"><b> Mr. Clarke: </b> 
 It is impossible to deny it: it is set out time and again as a given. There were 10&nbsp;commandments, but one was the most important of all&#151;&quot;We must not have an honest Red Book; the public accounts should not reveal the truth about this creature we are going to set up called Network Rail&quot;&#151;and that had to determine everything. If the Chancellor had come here today, we might have had a go at him about this: given that he makes all these speeches about the need to have genuinely independent statistics of value and the importance of having an independent office, what on earth is he doing bullying the Office for National Statistics to reach, as it eventually did, the absurd decision&#151;which no other statistician I know agrees with&#151;that the current debts and liabilities of Network Rail should not be on the public balance sheet? The only reason the Chancellor is able to say that he is following his prudent borrowing rule is that &#163;20&nbsp;billion-worth or thereabouts of current Network Rail liabilities are shown as being in the private sector&#151;at least, they are not included in the public debt and are never used when the Chancellor describes his actual fiscal position.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51024-23_para0">
<a name="stpa_278">So the Government&#039;s first main motive was to keep any debt off the public accounts&#151;that drove everything and virtually stopped any other solution being chosen. The second, and the one that caused all the concern after the case, was that they must get hold of the assets of Network Rail either free of charge or at minimum cost, at the expense of the shareholders. That is what makes this example of abuse of public power particularly bad. All of us politicians, and anybody with a concern for public life, wish to see Cabinet government, the independence of the civil service, and proper accountability to Parliament. Those are very important constitutional issues. Sometimes the victim is public interest generally, and the problem is one of the proper administration of affairs. In this case, people were the victims&#151;the shareholders whose assets had to be acquired, at minimum cost. The shareholders&#151;I will not repeat the quotes, as they have featured often in the debate&#151;were treated with total contempt, even being described by the Chancellor of the Exchequer&#039;s special advisers as grannies who would lose their blouses. The special advisers did not often mention the railwaymen. Ninety per cent. of the staff of Network Rail had shares in their own company. They were the shareholders. Conservative Members have been accused of being more concerned about 250,000&nbsp;shareholders than about the travelling public. A quarter of a million of our fellow citizens&#151;not all of whom were small shareholders, but very many of whom were&#151;were to have their assets taken from them at the very minimum cost to the Treasury. All these heaps of paper are taken up with constant contrivance to achieve that result.

 They were obviously wrong in March. Everybody seems to have left to try to work out what assets would be available if the company was wound up. The price did go down to &#163;2.80, which was below the level that the company had been floated at. It had at one time been &#163;17. The fact is that we will never know what the value of the company would have been if the proper process had been followed. I shall turn to that in a moment.

 I will give way in a moment, but I am about to move on to the key question, which the right hon. Gentleman has not answered. Before asking me his question, will he agree that the main aim was to get the company into insolvency&#151;that is repeated time and again&#151;and to get the assets at low value? Can he find any expression of concern for the shareholders in these documents, apart from the fear of class actions in the United States&#151;the Government were very worried about the American shareholders, who are litigious&#151;and the fear of the institutional shareholders, who decided to cut their losses and bale out? If he will answer that, I will answer whatever question he wishes to ask me.

<p><a name="st_170"><a name="51024-23_spnew6"><b> Mr. Byers: </b> 
 I know that the right hon. and learned Gentleman&#151;[Hon. Members: &quot;Answer!&quot;] I am going to answer his question in two parts. First, he should read the judgment to see what the judge says about the way in which the term &quot;grannies&quot; was used; he is very clear about that.&#151;<i>[Laughter.]</i> It is interesting that Conservative Members have obviously not read the judgment.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51024-23_para2">
<a name="stpa_280">Secondly, the right hon. and learned Gentleman&#151;this is the point on which I tried to intervene on him&#151;is saying that taxpayers&#039; money should have been used to give value to Railtrack shareholders. He must recognise, as the architect of Railtrack, that the regulator gives taxpayers&#039; money as a result of any interim review, so he is saying, on behalf of the Conservative party, that taxpayers&#039; money should have been used to increase the value of Railtrack shareholders.
</p>








<p><a name="st_171"><a name="51024-23_spnew7"><b> Mr. Clarke: </b> 
 On the first point, I concede that there are occasions when the word &quot;grannies&quot; can be used as a term of endearment, but it is not my interpretation that that was the tone being adopted by the Chancellor&#039;s special adviser.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51024-23_para3">
<a name="stpa_281">On the second point, the right hon. Gentleman is misinterpreting what we are saying, as he and his right hon. and hon. Friends have done throughout the debate. We are not saying that if there had been a Conservative Government we would have put in a

<br>&nbsp;<br>whole lot of money that the Labour party would not have put in. We are defending the then legal position of the independent regulator, which was undoubted. It was not for the Secretary of State to decide whether the company was solvent or received any income. We had legislated, I agree, for a situation whereby it was not a decision for the Secretary of State. The regulator had a statutory duty to make provision for these things. The whole basis upon which Railtrack had been floated was that of investment in the company by the shareholders. Of course the shareholders took a risk, but their measurement of that had to be based on what the judgment of the statutory regulator might be. That was the law&#151;the right hon. Gentleman had made no attempt to change it. He acted because he feared that the powers of the regulator would stop him proceeding to his chosen route of insolvency.
</p>








<p><a name="st_172"><a name="51024-23_spnew8"><b> Mr. Byers: </b> 
 Will the right hon. and learned Gentleman confirm that, in line with the structure that he helped to create, the trigger for the review would have been a request from Railtrack&#039;s directors? If so, will he concede that they made no such request?
</p>








<p><a name="st_173"><a name="51024-23_spnew9"><b> Mr. Clarke: </b> 
 That is poor mitigation. The right hon. Gentleman is accused of a crime&#151;I use the word loosely; he is accused of an offence&#151;yet he says, &quot;I now realise that I needn&#039;t have done it.&quot; It is surprising that Railtrack did not resist. As I shall show, it was offered the opportunity to resist but it did not take it. It amazed the Government and it slightly amazes me that Railtrack did not challenge the administrative order. The right hon. Gentleman did not expect that; that is not what he was warned it would do.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51024-23_para4">
<a name="stpa_282">Let me make it clear again: I do not defend the board of Railtrack. Those who say that the shareholders and the travelling public have cause for complaint against the board of Railtrack have some grounds. It was in a lamentable state and I accept that any Government would have been obliged to consider restructuring the company to put it on a sounder footing, and to decide what had to be done to make the privatised railway, which the Government continue to run, work better. We are arguing about what they did and how they did it. They chose the route of insolvency and subsequently realised that they did not have the legal power to make the company insolvent because all the relevant powers were in the hands of a regulator.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51024-23_para5">
<a name="stpa_283">The Government held all sorts of private discussions. The lady from the Treasury pointed out that the regulator was the truly wild card. We have heard about all the connotations and how it was made increasingly clear to the Government that the chosen route of insolvency could be stopped by Tom Winsor, the regulator. They were discussing his, not their powers. The then Secretary of State for Transport cooked up the idea of legislating to take away the regulator&#039;s powers to make any decisions about the company&#039;s financial state or to give it any financial support. That was catastrophic. The regulator&#039;s decisions determined 90&nbsp;per cent. of Railtrack&#039;s revenue. The train operators paid it for the use of the track and the signalling, and the regulator determined the amount. He had wide powers to undertake a financial review. The Government

 I shall do so for the last time because I do not want to detract from the main point.

<p><a name="st_176"><a name="51024-24_spnew2"><b> Mr. Darling: </b> 
 I am grateful. I allowed the right hon. and learned Gentleman to intervene in my speech on several occasions. Is not his problem the fact that Railtrack knew that it was insolvent? It unquestionably could not pay its debts. It had been telling the Government for six months before October 2001&nbsp;that it was in deep financial trouble. It might have wanted to approach the regulator, but not to get a second opinion about whether it was insolvent. The only reason for going to the regulator was to get barrel-loads of public money to stop it being insolvent. For that reason, the right hon. and learned Gentleman&#039;s argument falls down. We are not considering a company that was solvent in October 2001. By its own admission, it could not pay the debts and it wanted &quot;millions of pounds by Monday morning&quot;. It could not get that.
</p>








<p><a name="st_177"><a name="51024-24_spnew3"><b> Mr. Clarke: </b> 
 It was for the regulator to decide whether the company was insolvent. Railtrack knew that as well as the then Ministers. Railtrack despaired of following that route. Regardless of what it requested, it was up to the regulator to decide whether to give it anything. The regulator was independent and had rightly been severe about Railtrack&#039;s past performance. However, the route of approaching the regulator was cut off.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51024-24_para0">
<a name="stpa_284">The former Secretary of State has no answer to the question of why he got, in a meeting, the Prime Minister&#039;s personal authority to legislate, unless he feared that the regulator would produce a financial arrangement that would block the insolvency. There was no need to ask the Prime Minister for legislation if the regulator intended to do nothing. There was no need to contemplate emergency powers if Railtrack had accepted that it would not approach the regulator. The only reason for the device was to force an insolvency that the regulator might have stopped.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51024-24_para1">
<a name="stpa_285">The former Secretary of State told the regulator of his intentions only on the Friday before the Sunday when he made the application for the insolvency.

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_118">&quot;that Mr. Robinson&#039;s reaction would be likely to be an immediate application for an early interim review. Mr. Byers said that that had been thought of and that if such an application were made he had the authority (as he had) of the Prime Minister and Chancellor immediately to introduce emergency legislation to entitle the Secretary of State to give instructions to the Regulator. Mr. Winsor pointed out what adverse effects such legislation would have not just on railway financing but on regulated industries generally. He spoke, too, of implications under the Human Rights Act. He made no headway; Mr. Byers said an application to put the company into Railway Administration would be made on Sunday.&quot;</p>

<a name="51024-24_para3">
<a name="stpa_287">Railtrack rolled over on the Sunday. It did not oppose the administration. By that time, it was disheartened, but the regulator had tried to stiffen its resolve. By Saturday, Mr. Winsor was talking to the chief executive of Railtrack. The judgment states:

Member for North Tyneside and the Government that Railtrack had finally had the stuffing beaten out of it. It was presented with a pistol but it did not fire it. It agreed to administration and the victims were the shareholders&#151;the people who never discovered what the value of their company might have been. The scheme of putting the company into administration had been successful because the people in charge of Railtrack would not ask for a financial review. When told that the Government would legislate, they despaired.

<br>&nbsp;<br>Government did not take away the shares of those who invested in Railtrack. Those shareholders were paid between &#163;2.50 and &#163;2.60 for each of their shares.

<p><a name="st_183"><a name="51024-25_spnew1"><b> Mr. Duncan: </b> 
 If insolvency was absolutely inevitable, why did the Government try to intimidate the rail regulator and threaten him with abolition?
</p>








<p><a name="st_184"><a name="51024-25_spnew2"><b> Dr. Ladyman: </b> 
 Insolvency was not only inevitable, it was a fait accompli because the directors of Railtrack themselves had admitted that the company was already insolvent. That comes out of every page of the judgment. It comes out of every page of the witness statements. It comes out of every page of the bundle of evidence provided to the courts. What comes out of every single page of the judgment is that the Railtrack directors understood themselves that the company was already insolvent. They even had a document that told them that, when the company shares were trading at &#163;8, they were worth just 60p. They even got a letter from one of their own advisers saying that 60p was an exaggeration and that the shares were actually worth 58p. The Government did not make Railtrack insolvent&#151;it was insolvent all along.

<a name="51024-25_para5">
<a name="stpa_300">Indeed, post Railtrack being put into administration, the Government did act, when restructuring the industry, to provide &#163;500&nbsp;million for the shareholders of Railtrack, so the idea that we took away the shares and&#151;

 Will the Minister give way?

 I have no time. I am sorry. The right hon. and learned Member for Rushcliffe was only supposed to speak for 20&nbsp;minutes, but like all his promises when in government, he broke that one, too.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51024-25_para6">
<a name="stpa_301">I put it to the hon. Member for Welwyn Hatfield: what role does he think directors take in running a company? Whom should shareholders blame when things go wrong in a company? If his company went into insolvency, would he think that he had a right to go to his major customer and demand that it provide more money in return for no more services, just to keep his company going? Of course he would not.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51024-25_para7">
<a name="stpa_302">As we have heard, the judgment is a complete vindication of the Government&#039;s position. After weeks of evidence and weeks of cross-examination, the judgment found&#151;<i>[Interruption.]</i>

<p><a name="st_188"><a name="51024-25_spnew6"><b> Dr. Ladyman: </b> 
 I am sorry, but I could not hear what the hon. Gentleman said because his Conservative colleagues were making so much noise.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51024-25_para8">
<a name="stpa_303">The Government were right to put their contingency plans in place, and the idea that the Government should have funded Railtrack without limit and conditions was, in the judge&#039;s own words, a &quot;hopeless proposition&quot;. The judge described what was the reasonable perception in Government of Railtrack in 2000&nbsp;and 2001:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_122">&quot;It was seen as &#039;frankly a mess&#039;, with weak management at the zonal levels. It was pilloried in the Press for bad management. It had difficulty even in funding the necessary regular maintenance. It had major projects without the skills to manage them. It was being ground down by the Regulator (so said its own advisers).&quot;</p>
</ul>

<br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>

<p>
<a name="51024-25_para9">
<a name="stpa_304">It was not the Government who sought not to go to the regulator. It was Railtrack itself that proposed to the Government that they should bail it out by giving it unlimited money, and freedom from the regulator for four years. When putting those plans to the Government, it insisted that the regulator should not be told about them.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51024-25_para10">
<a name="stpa_305">The directors of Railtrack were directly responsible for the management of their company. The Opposition Front-Bench spokesmen and the remnants of the Major Government need to take responsibility for the fact that they put incompetent people on the board of that company, which led directly to its collapse and to the problems that we have experienced in the rail industry. The Labour Government have been vindicated, every step of the way, by the judgment. I suggest that we regard the Conservative motion in the same way as the judge described the shareholders&#039; proposition: it is a preposterous idea.

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_123">That this House welcomes the judgement in the recently concluded Railtrack court case which, after weeks of evidence fully tested by cross examination, completely dismisses the claimants&#039; allegation of wrongdoing on the part of Government; further welcomes the fact that the judgement exonerates entirely the way the Government responded to its growing concerns about Railtrack&#039;s financial position and the propriety of the process that led to Railtrack being put in Administration, including the Government&#039;s stance in relation to the Rail Regulator; notes that the judge described Railtrack&#039;s request for unlimited public funding and support, which was made in part to maintain its share price, as a &quot;hopeless proposition&quot;; and that there were good public reasons for the policy developed; congratulates the Government for bringing under control the situation which resulted from the previous Government&#039;s botched privatisation and putting ownership of the track into the hands of a not-for-dividend company operating in the broad public interest; and recognises the significant progress that is being made by Network Rail in improving performance on the railway and in bringing costs under control, in stark contrast to the management incompetence shown by Railtrack.&#039;.</p>

<a name="51024-27_head0"><h3 align=center>Licensing Laws</h3>






<p><a name="st_191"><a name="51024-27_spmin0"><b>Madam Deputy Speaker  (Sylvia Heal): </b> 
 We now come to the motion on licensing laws. Mr. Speaker has selected the amendment in the name of the Prime Minister.

<a name="time_8">
<a name="51024-27_time0"><h5>7.28&nbsp;pm</h5>
</p>








<p><a name="st_192"><a name="51024-27_spnew0"><b> Mrs. Theresa May  (Maidenhead) (Con):</b> 
 I beg to move,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_124">That this House notes the growing public concern that the Licensing Act 2003&nbsp;will increase levels of violent crime and anti-social behaviour; observes that the cost to the taxpayer of rising alcohol-fuelled crime and disorder is already &#163;12&nbsp;billion a year; objects to the presumption in favour of late-night drinking irrespective of the views of local residents and local representatives; disapproves of the disproportionate burden of administration and increased costs for village halls, sports clubs and community centres; calls for local councils to have greater discretion to take into account the interests of their local community; and calls on the Government to cancel the full commencement of the Act and overhaul the primary legislation.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="51024-27_para0">
<a name="stpa_311">It is a matter of record that, since the Committee stage of the Licensing Bill, my party has consistently raised our concerns about the implications of the Government&#039;s proposal to introduce extended licensing hours. Both in Committee and since, we have argued that the drinking culture in the UK&#151;in particular, the culture of binge drinking and the explosion of alcohol-fuelled violence and antisocial behaviour&#151; has made the Government&#039;s plans dangerous and foolhardy.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51024-27_para1">
<a name="stpa_312">Ministers offered us a number of reassurances in Committee. At the same time as promising that Labour could not give a XXXX for drinking-up time, the Prime Minister was also pledging:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_125">&quot;We will tackle the unacceptable level of anti-social behaviour and crime on our streets. Our &#039;zero tolerance&#039; approach will ensure that petty criminality among young offenders is seriously addressed.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="51024-27_para2">
<a name="stpa_313">The reality on our streets is very different. There are now 1&nbsp;million violent crimes a year and, in the three months to June, police recorded 318,200&nbsp;violent crimes&#151;up 6&nbsp;per cent. on the same period last year. A particularly worrying statistic is that half the violence is due to binge drinking.
</p>








<p><a name="st_193"><a name="51024-27_spnew1"><b> Kitty Ussher  (Burnley) (Lab):</b> 
 Is the right hon. Lady aware that the hon. Member for Witney (Mr. Cameron), the bookies&#039; favourite to become the next Tory leader, has publicly declared his support for the Government? In the <i>Oxford Journal</i>, he said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_126">&quot;The idea behind the Bill is to liberalise the licensing laws, simplify the system for getting an entertainment licence and let pubs stay open for longer, so long as there is no public nuisance. I would say &#039;amen&#039; to all those things.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="51024-27_para3">
<a name="stpa_314">Given that&#151;
</p>








<p><a name="st_194"><a name="51024-27_spmin1"><b>Madam Deputy Speaker:</b>

 My hon. Friend has made an important and valid point. She has spent much time examining the issues that we need to address if we are to ensure that prisoners can deal with problems such as drink.

<a name="stpa_326">In previous debates, and during Culture questions today, Labour Members have raised the issue of police powers to tackle the problem. However, I question whether existing powers are being used to tackle under-age drinkers and other problems related to drinking. The number of people found guilty of, or cautioned for, offences of drunkenness has fallen by almost 10,000&nbsp;since 1997. The number of people under 18&nbsp;found guilty of, or cautioned for, buying intoxicating liquor has fallen by 81&nbsp;per cent. since 1997. In 2003, only 53&nbsp;teenagers were found guilty of, or cautioned for, buying or trying to buy alcohol. I would welcome new powers to deal with the problems of alcohol and young people, and with problem pubs and clubs, but existing powers also need to be used effectively. It is rich of the Government to say that the Act must go ahead because it gives the police extra powers to deal with problem drinking when it will actually exacerbate the problem.

Ministers claimed that the new laws would give greater powers and discretion to local councils, and that local residents would have greater powers to deal with rowdy pubs and to shut down those that encouraged violent or antisocial behaviour. We were also assured, time and again, that the new laws would lead to the introduction of what the Prime Minister calls a European-style caf&#233; culture. Tell that to the Council of Her Majesty&#039;s Circuit Judges, which, in its submission to Home Office consultation earlier this year, warned that

For example, residents can object only if they live in the immediate vicinity of the premises concerned. The definition of &quot;vicinity&quot; is down to the local authority. There are plenty of examples of local authorities that have adopted definitions such as 100&nbsp;yd or 150&nbsp;m, which has resulted in people being unable to object to applications for licence extensions until 6&nbsp;am because they live 150&nbsp;yd away from the pub or nightclub. They are told that they cannot object because they do not live close enough to it.

In reality, there are few powers to hold pubs and clubs responsible for rowdy or drunken customers once they are outside the licensed premises, even if the nuisance was caused by the pub having served them the alcohol in the first place. Councils and police cannot use nuisance and noise from outside a licensed premises as grounds for a closure order against a particular venue. Pubs and clubs can only be penalised if they make excessive noise from inside a pub, so licensed premises cannot be held responsible for the antics of their drunken customers leaving in the early hours, ruining the lives of those living nearby in the process. Again, as Commander Chris Allison of the Association of Chief Police Officers has said:


</p>
<ul>

In such circumstances, the code of conduct for councillors states that they have a prejudicial interest and should not be allowed even to address the licensing sub-committee, so they cannot speak up, residents are disqualified even if they live close to the pub, and police cannot object&#151;hardly the brave new world of local accountability promised by the Government.

We all know the problems caused by many under-age drinkers having access to alcohol as a result of being able to buy it in supermarkets and shops.

Meanwhile, those who do not abide by the law get away with doing so more often than not, because the police simply do not have the necessary powers to take decisive action.

They can take away licences, and they will soon be able to declare an area that is persistently disorderly as an alcohol disorder zone, in which publicans will have to pay a levy to help cover the costs of extra policing.

So they should consider themselves on probation.

<a name="stpa_354">The code will promote a more responsible approach to sales promotions, happy hours and the various promotions that can cause binge drinking and the like. It will ensure that better training becomes a high priority for the industry, and it will set out examples of good practice.

<a name="stpa_355">The alcohol harm reduction strategy will also focus on education. There will be new teaching materials for educating the public and educating our children in schools about problems associated with alcohol. The Violent Crime Reduction Bill will add to the measures for tackling the problems that alcohol misuse can cause. It will include drink banning orders to exclude violent and antisocial drinkers from premises that sell alcohol. It introduces alcohol disorder zones, enabling the police and local authorities to put in place action and measures to combat the problems of alcohol-related crime and disorder and to charge the premises selling alcohol for the additional enforcement costs when that becomes necessary.

 As the hon. Gentleman is aware, those powers have been greatly argued for by the police and are supported by local authorities. They are still subject to debate in the House, but I expect that the advocates of crime reduction on behalf of both the police and local authorities will ensure that their voices are heard and are represented in the legislation, although the way in which representations can be made has not yet been settled.
</p>

<a name="51024-32_para3">
<a name="stpa_356">The Bill will also expedite fast-track reviews, where serious crime&#151;drug dealing or the use of guns and knives&#151;is associated with any premises. It will also create a Licensing Act offence of persistently selling alcohol to children and a new power to ban the sale of alcohol for up to 48&nbsp;hours at the premises where the offence is committed. That is extremely important for addressing the current problem that much of the alcohol consumed by young people is bought not from pubs, but from off-licences.

 I am pleased to hear that evidence of a U-turn, albeit one performed behind a smokescreen. Does the Liberal Democrat spokesman agree that concern about binge and under-age drinking has been evident for a significant period and stretches back at least to the time of the Standing Committee examination of the Licensing Bill? Will he confirm that Liberal Democrat members of the Committee tabled no amendments, at no stage voted against clauses dealing with flexible licensing hours, and, indeed, nodded through the relevant legislation, as we have come to expect from Liberal Democrats in this place?

 The hon. Gentleman is wrong: the Liberal Democrats voted against the legislation&#151;full stop. That is clearly on the record. He should take into account what his Secretary of State said. She referred to a number of issues that she claimed had not been argued by either of the Opposition parties. She failed to point out, of course, that many of the issues came to light not in Committee, but in the regulations that resulted at a later stage. Many of those regulations are creating many of the current problems. The hon. Gentleman should also be aware of the huge delay. The Government have only just finished consulting&#151;despite the fact that the Act was passed in 2003&#151;on what to say about temporary events notices, which have not yet been debated on the Floor of the House. The hon. Gentleman really needs to check his facts about what the Liberal Democrats and others did during the Bill&#039;s passage.

Member for North-West Leicestershire have said that we have a serious problem with binge drinking, but the real problem is that it is getting significantly worse every year. The figures are clear. The British crime survey released last week shows a 12&nbsp;per cent. increase in violent assaults, in which alcohol was a major contributing factor. There has been a 15&nbsp;per cent. rise nationally in

</p>

<p>
<a name="51024-32_para9">
<a name="stpa_362">Health problems are deeply concerning and getting worse. There has been an 18.4&nbsp;per cent. increase in alcohol-related deaths over the past year. The overall cost of alcohol to the health service and others is about &#163;20&nbsp;billion a year, with one in 13&nbsp;adults dependent on alcohol and nine children being admitted to hospitals in England every day with alcohol-related problems. The Secretary of State is right; we have a very serious problem, and, sadly, it is getting worse.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51024-32_para10">
<a name="stpa_363">The real question for the House is whether the Licensing Act will help to solve that problem or make the situation worse.

</p>

<p>
<a name="51024-34_para6">
<a name="stpa_390">The Secretary of State should consider the police&#039;s existing powers and examine whether they are being enforced. For example, she has referred to drunken people on the streets, who must buy their alcohol from somewhere. As the right hon. Member for Maidenhead knows, an existing law forbids landlords to sell alcohol to people who are drunk. That law was amended in 2001&nbsp;to ensure that anybody who sells alcohol to somebody who is drunk is breaking the law. The House may be surprised to know that on average there are 11&nbsp;prosecutions a year under that legislation. The Secretary of State may be taking a few additional powers, but most of those powers already exist, so we should make sure that the existing legislation is being used.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51024-34_para7">
<a name="stpa_391">All the evidence suggests that the 2003&nbsp;Act will not resolve the problem of binge drinking, and I believe that it will make the problem worse. I do not accept that chaos will occur if we do not go ahead with the 2003&nbsp;Act, because all the existing licences for pubs, clubs and off-licences will continue until February 2007. There will not be chaos if the 2003&nbsp;Act is stopped, but there will be chaos if we go ahead with it. The public do not want it, and I hope that the whole House will support the motion. Let us end the nonsense that the Government are going to deal with binge drinking, which is something that the 2003&nbsp;Act definitely fails to do.

<p><a name="st_311"><a name="51024-34_spnew3"><b> Mr. Wayne David  (Caerphilly) (Lab):</b> 
 During the general election campaign, my Conservative opponent accused me and the Labour party of being in favour of 24-hour drinking. His slogan was, &quot;Vote Conservative. Vote against 24-hour drinking&quot;. That slogan has nothing to do with the legislation. My constituency does not contain a single licensed establishment that has applied for a licence to allow 24-hour drinking. In my constituency, that Conservative campaign failed abysmally, which is one of the reasons why I increased my parliamentary majority.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51024-34_para8">
<a name="stpa_392">Such misrepresentation continued after the general election campaign, with certain elements of the press suggesting that we will see a descent into chaos, the end of civilisation as we know it, confusion and anarchy. Having heard those prophecies of doom, it was not enough for me to take the Government&#039;s word for it, so I decided to go a step further and ask my local authority what is happening on the ground.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51024-34_para9">
<a name="stpa_393">I therefore spoke to people at Caerphilly county borough council, and the first thing they said was&#151;surprise, surprise&#151;that not one single establishment 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>24 Oct 2005 : Column 112</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>had applied for 24-hour opening and none was likely to do so. Moreover, they said that far from confusion there is a great deal of orderliness in the new regime that has been introduced. Only this morning, they told me that 88&nbsp;per cent. of previously licensed premises have already applied for a continuation of their licences and have been granted one. More are in the pipeline, and I anticipate that the figure will go up to the upper 90s before the process is completed.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51024-34_para10">
<a name="stpa_394">So far, 483&nbsp;pubs and clubs have made applications for licences in the Caerphilly borough, and it is interesting to note the detail of those applications. The breakdown is as follows: 218&nbsp;are for conversions of existing licences, 249&nbsp;are for varying existing licences, and 16&nbsp;are for new premises. In other words, there is no uniformity whatsoever. In fact, nearly half the existing licensed premises want to continue as they are. That is what is happening in practice in one particular part of the country, and I would suggest that Caerphilly is fairly typical not only of many other parts of Wales but of many other parts of Britain.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51024-34_para11">
<a name="stpa_395">Of the applications for varying existing licences, in many cases any objections from local residents were resolved at the hearing stage through mediation and agreement between the parties. That is a vital and central aspect of the Act, and in practice it is working very well. Of course, it is recognised that in some cases mediation has not led to an ideal situation so far as all parties are concerned. However, it is important also to recognise that, contrary to what some Opposition Members have said, there is no presumption in the Act in favour of longer hours over objections from local people. Let us be absolutely clear about that. Where there has not been agreement, all parties have been clear that the licences that were issued would be subject to strict monitoring and very careful review.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51024-34_para12">
<a name="stpa_396">When I asked the chief executive of my local authority what he thinks about the suggestion that there could be an extension beyond the 24&nbsp;November deadline, he told me in no uncertain terms that he and many of his colleagues in local government would be utterly against that. Caerphilly county borough council has worked extremely hard and effectively to meet the deadline, and we see no reason why it is not a reasonable deadline that we should continue to adhere to.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51024-34_para13">
<a name="stpa_397">As a result of the hard work of Caerphilly council, 15&nbsp;councillors have been properly briefed and trained to oversee the whole process. That is far more democratic than the former arrangement whereby determinations about licences were made by faceless magistrates whom nobody knew or had any contact with, and who often did not know or understand anything about the locality. The new arrangement is an important step forward for democracy, and the Government should be complimented&#151;as should local authorities such as Caerphilly county borough council for introducing it so effectively.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51024-34_para14">
<a name="stpa_398">Caerphilly council is taking two initiatives that add weight and importance to the legislation. First, the safer Caerphilly county borough community safety partnership has been established. As one of the first new licensing forums in Wales, it is bringing together, very effectively, all the stakeholders involved in the process, who meet monthly and produce their own newsletter. That has been very well received.


<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>24 Oct 2005 : Column 113</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>

<p>
<a name="51024-34_para15">
<a name="stpa_399">Secondly, the local authority is introducing a drinkwise scheme for responsible licensed premises. Again, it is the first of its kind in Wales. It will give accreditation to licensed premises that are following good practice. That is warmly to be welcomed.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51024-34_para16">
<a name="stpa_400">In addition to those two initiatives, the local authority has had the wherewithal to recognise that other policy areas are affected by the legislation. For example, it is mindful of the fact that there will be a greater demand for taxis when some premises have extended opening hours. It has therefore established a taxi association to liaise with local taxi operators, and is in the process of introducing additional taxi ranks. All those measures are to be welcomed and show why many of the fears that were whipped up in Caerphilly just a few months ago have no basis whatsoever.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51024-34_para17">
<a name="stpa_401">At the end of the summer, I took part in the police secondment scheme. I spent the best part of two weeks with Gwent police, especially in Newport. I naturally asked the police with whom I worked what they thought of the new legislation. I shall be frank: some believed that the Act would cause more problems and others thought that it would make no difference. However, the majority of police officers to whom I spoke believed that it would lead to an improvement in many young people&#039;s behaviour. Policemen and women on the ground, who are in touch with their communities and engaged in neighbourhood policing, look forward to the implementation of the Act.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51024-34_para18">
<a name="stpa_402">One Saturday night, I spent a couple of hours in the custody unit at Newport police station. It was quiet for most of the evening but, as expected, from 11.15&nbsp;pm till midnight, all hell broke loose. It happened because, as we all know, that is when the pubs close, the binge drinking takes place and the trouble occurs on the streets. That is one of the main problems that the Act tries to tackle and I believe that it will succeed.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51024-34_para19">
<a name="stpa_403">The new powers that are proposed for the police complement the central element of this legislation. Contrary to the comments of the hon. Member for Bath (Mr. Foster), many aspects of the Act are brand new. It extends existing legislation and takes matters forward significantly.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51024-34_para20">
<a name="stpa_404">I am mindful of the time limit that has been placed on Back Benchers and I shall therefore conclude. I do not want the implementation date of 24&nbsp;November to be abandoned and I want the Government to ignore the scaremongering of Opposition Members. Above all, we should have the courage of our convictions and acknowledge that the Act will, slowly but surely, change attitudes and get to grips with the terrible problem of binge drinking.

<a name="51024-35_para0">
<a name="stpa_405">When the debate was called, I anticipated that the Secretary of State and many Labour Members would refer to the position that the Opposition took during the Bill&#039;s passage. Since I was the Opposition spokesman at the time, I read my remarks before the debate. At the time, we supported more flexible opening hours. However, even then, we raised some anxieties and we based our support for the measure on the Government&#039;s 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>24 Oct 2005 : Column 114</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>argument that longer and more flexible drinking hours might reduce binge drinking, crime, disorder and public nuisance. I pointed out that, even at that time, several people were questioning that assumption and that it was not necessarily the view of several police officers or local authorities.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51024-35_para1">
<a name="stpa_406">Nevertheless, the Association of Chief Police Officers recommended supporting the relevant provision in the White Paper, subject to two caveats. First, it was concerned that there may not be sufficient police officers available to deal with problems that might occur later in the evening or the early hours of the morning. Secondly, it echoed the concern of the hon. Member for Bath (Mr. Foster) that the consequence of more flexible opening hours might not be different closing times but, because of competition and for other reasons, pubs all closing at the same time but later in the evening. At that time, fewer police officers would be available on the streets. The same problems would therefore arise but with fewer people to deal with them.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51024-35_para2">
<a name="stpa_407">Genuine concerns were therefore expressed during the Bill&#039;s passage but the Government assured us that the police believed that the measure would contribute to tackling the problems and we supported it on that basis. However, since then, there has been a stream of informed protest from a wide variety of groups.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51024-35_para3">
<a name="stpa_408">Several hon. Members have already cited people who have expressed anxiety and I do not intend to repeat their remarks, but let us consider the number of different organisations that have voiced their concerns. From the police, we have ACPO&#151;my right hon. Friend the Member for Maidenhead (Mrs. May) quoted the ACPO licensing representative&#151;the chief inspector of constabulary; the former Metropolitan Police Commissioner; the Police Federation; and the chief constable of Nottinghamshire. It is plain that many police officers believe that the Act will make things worse.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51024-35_para4">
<a name="stpa_409">The judiciary will have the job of enforcing the legislation, and both Her Majesty&#039;s Council of Circuit Judges and the Magistrates Association have been vocal in their criticism. In the medical profession, the Royal College of Physicians, the Irish Medical Organisation and, most recently, Professor Lord Winston, who sits on the Government Benches, have all expressed concern about the Act increasing the opportunities to drink and therefore increasing the likelihood of binge drinking, leading to alcohol-related disorder.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51024-35_para5">
<a name="stpa_410">After the Bill reached the statute book, we discovered that concerns had been expressed not only outside Government but within Government. The then Home Secretary, the right hon. Member for Sheffield, Brightside (Mr. Blunkett), talked about the proposals in the Bill as

<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="51024-35_para6">
<a name="stpa_411">that risked &quot;worsening the situation&quot; of violent crime and yobbish behaviour, yet none of that was said when we debated the Bill.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51024-35_para7">
<a name="stpa_412">I say to the Secretary of State and to the Minister who will respond to the debate that, at the time of the Bill&#039;s passage, we were willing to accept the assurances that the legislation was supported by the police and many others as a means of helping to solve the problem of binge drinking. Now we discover that there is a widespread belief that it will help to make the problem 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>24 Oct 2005 : Column 115</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>worse. We have changed our view on the basis of the fact that expert opinion is almost unanimous in its belief that the Bill poses real dangers. We now believe that the Bill should not be implemented. Having listened to expert opinion, we have demonstrated that we are a responsible Opposition. I just regret that the Government have not taken the same stand. I hope that, even now, the Minister will reflect on that.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51024-35_para8">
<a name="stpa_413">In fact, not just expert opinion, but our own experience has led to our change of heart. I suspect that many hon. Members have been out with their local police, and I spent a night out with a police officer in a squad car. We responded to about 12&nbsp;or 15&nbsp;incidents. Every one was alcohol related. A lot is said about vertical drinking establishments in inner cities but the problem is now affecting every market town in Britain. Maldon and Burnham in my constituency both have a major problem with hooliganism that is directly related to alcohol. The incidence of such behaviour is another reason why we need to proceed cautiously.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51024-35_para9">
<a name="stpa_414">I do not want to repeat the arguments that have already been advanced by the Front-Bench team; instead, I shall discuss two other aspects of the Act that have not been mentioned. First, let us consider its impact on village halls, which are central to many local communities. In my constituency, a new village hall was recently built, which cost &#163;1.5&nbsp;million. All the money for it was raised by the local community through the sale of land for building. That project did not receive any assistance from the lottery or Government. The village hall is a remarkable achievement, which will be a real asset to the community, but it needs to cover its costs. Those behind the project came to see me and said that the only way they could so was if they were able to rent the hall out for private functions on every Friday and Saturday of the year. At the vast majority of those private functions&#151;parties, wedding receptions and the like&#151; people will want to enjoy themselves and drink, but the village hall is limited to just 12&nbsp;temporary event notices a year.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51024-35_para10">
<a name="stpa_415">I know that the Minister has said that that limit will be considered and that a review is under way, but I hope that he will give at least some indication this evening that that limit will be raised significantly, because many village halls throughout the country will find it difficult to cover their expenses if they are confined to just 12&nbsp;temporary event notices a year.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51024-35_para11">
<a name="stpa_416">The other matter to consider is the effect of the Act on another institution that is central to many local communities&#151;the sports clubs. The Central Council of Physical Recreation, which the Secretary of State cited in support of some of her remarks, has been vocal throughout in pointing out the huge burden and cost that the new provisions will place on thousands of sports clubs. I happen to be vice-president of Maldon cricket club, which, like many other such clubs up and down the country, is staffed largely by volunteers. It manages to muster three or four enthusiastic local teams, but it does a lot more. It provides an opportunity for young people in the community to learn about cricket and runs a quick cricket day for all the local schools. It is a hugely valuable resource.

 I wish to bring the debate back to its roots in actuality&#151;what is happening on the ground. Like my hon. Friend the Member for Caerphilly (Mr. David), at the last election, I faced the suggestion of 24-hour drinking. That seemed to be the only line taken by the Tory candidate standing against me&#151;it was the only thing I heard her say. It came as no surprise to me that that late-in-the-day concern about the issue arose so near to the election.

<a name="stpa_420">I think that the whole House accepts that licensing laws in England and Wales are out of date and do not work as they were intended to. The licensing regime in its present form was introduced almost 100&nbsp;years ago, during the first world war. We have heard nothing about the fact that the licensing laws were relaxed under the Conservative Government. Hon. Members will recall that pubs used to shut at 3&nbsp;pm, but that was done away with under the Conservatives&#151;I see Opposition Members nodding&#151;because it was thought a reasonable measure, and so it was.

One premises called Aurora made an application for 4&nbsp;am. In the end, the licensing committee extended its licence to 12.30&nbsp;am. Of all the other licensing applications that have gone through in my constituency, none has gone past 12.30&nbsp;am. There is the idea, as the hon.

Having taken special care to examine applications in my constituency, I know that, far from local residents having no voice, and given that I have come across no applications for a licence extension beyond 12.30&nbsp;am, it is clear that the councillors on the sub-committee have taken into account the observations and objections that it said are not being taken into account in other parts of the country&#151;something that I do not accept.

<a name="stpa_430">The Grosmont House hotel in Grosmont sleeps 10&nbsp;and is situated next to the terminus of the North Yorkshire Moors railway, famous as the Hogwarts express in the Harry Potter films. Many people, having seen the film or Yorkshire Television&#039;s &quot;Heartbeat&quot; series, come to stay at that small family hotel, which is renowned for its local lobster. Some residents enjoy a bottle of wine with their evening meal, or have a glass of something before embarking on one of the railway&#039;s excellent dinner excursions. Others fancy a nightcap before turning in. Rosalind and George Andrews, the proprietors, faced with increased charges and a minefield of regulation, have decided reluctantly not to maintain their table licence. One of them would have to attend a training course, despite the fact that Mrs. Andrews completed a similar course before entering the trade and despite the fact that her husband has been a licensee for 38&nbsp;years. The police have never been called to an incident in premises controlled by Mr. Andrews who, according to the Government definition, is untrained.

Mr. and Mrs. Andrews must submit plans not only of the bar, dining room and lounge but all the corridors and, surprisingly, the kitchen. Rosalind is not brewing moonshine in there as far as I know, nor is she manufacturing alcopops on the aga. Perhaps the Government know something that I do not, but I have not received reports of drunken youths prowling the North Yorkshire moors with jugs of Mrs. Andrews&#039; rum sauce, gorging themselves with trifle or terrorising local people with brandy butter running down their chins&#151;the only alcoholic products to emanate from her kitchen. The Andrews say:

 I am staggered at the complacency of those Labour Members who seem to think that, as long as people are not making applications for 24-hour licences, everything is fine. The people of St. Albans are desperate for me to bring their concerns to this debate, as they will be badly affected by the Act. St. Albans is a lived-in city, not a desolate, late-night city. It is not a city that shuts up shop when everyone goes home to the suburbs. It has familiar large-name retailers, as well as small cobbled alleys, quaint historic quarters, picturesque conservation areas and lots of pubs. But people also live and sleep&#151;or try to sleep&#151;in the heart of St. Albans.

<p>
<a name="51024-37_para2">
<a name="stpa_436">According to the chief licensing officer, St. Albans has more licensed premises per capita than anywhere else in Europe. The sheer number of those premises already causes problems with late-night noise, antisocial behaviour and policing issues. Those adverse effects are not covered in the Act. We are talking not about people bashing each other to bits on the streets, but about general rowdy behaviour that does not constitute an arrestable offence. At the moment, most of that noise and disruption ends at about 1&nbsp;o&#039;clock, when most of the drinkers disperse, often waking residents as they leave to go home. However, residents now fear that that disruption will carry on deep into the early hours of the morning. Okay, it might not go on for 24&nbsp;hours, but 4&nbsp;o&#039;clock in the morning sounds pretty late to someone who has to get up at 6&nbsp;o&#039;clock.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51024-37_para3">
<a name="stpa_437">The chief constable of Hertfordshire, Frank Whiteley, warned the Government that the new laws would be a disaster. Yes, that is another chief constable who is on record as a staunch opponent of the Act, and he says that his views have now hardened. At a recent meeting, he said that, because of the sheer number of licensed premises in St. Albans, he could not police them all. If he were even to try to do so, he would have to take resources from elsewhere. Front-line policing would have to be diverted to deal with licensed premises.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51024-37_para4">
<a name="stpa_438">Between April 2004&nbsp;and March 2005, there were 1,310&nbsp;incidents of alcohol-related crime and disorder, and 848&nbsp;alcohol-related arrests, most of which took place on a Saturday night. Seventy per cent. of police officers polled by Alcohol Concern reported that alcohol-related incidents frequently diverted them from tackling other crime. That is certainly true in St. Albans.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51024-37_para5">
<a name="stpa_439">Like many other Members, I have spent a Friday night out with a local police inspector. My inspector and I visited a local pub, where we saw a young girl lying in the toilets, drunk and vomiting, at 10&nbsp;o&#039;clock. This was not because she was short of drinking-up time; she was just drunk. She is a product of our vertical binge-drinking culture. We saw men outside the Water End Barn, which has a later licence, so the drunkenness goes on until later. It takes &#163;60,000&nbsp;a week and is now licensed until 4&nbsp;o&#039;clock in the morning. In an attempt to get a slice of that very lucrative pie, other bars are following suit and applying for later licences. The complacency of Labour Members is not shared by the licensees of St. Albans; they all want some of that pie.

<a name="51024-37_para6">
<a name="stpa_440">I have seen the police operating at first hand, and I know that they are reluctant to arrest a shambling drunk if he is not causing too much trouble. The figure of 848&nbsp;arrests is therefore the tip of the iceberg. As our inspector pointed out, our cells and accident and emergency units would be overflowing if everybody who was drunk was arrested or sent for treatment. Individual revellers are often noisy, but do not commit an arrestable offence. So nothing much can be done as they clatter down the streets, keeping the people of St. Albans awake.

<a name="stpa_441">&quot;Cumulative impact&quot; is a vital factor in a city such as St. Albans, but the local council&#039;s licensing policy is far from robust, and &quot;cumulative impact&quot; is not accepted 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>24 Oct 2005 : Column 122</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>when applications are being considered. Each application has to be judged on its own merits. Many city centre residents have joined the Save Our Sleep campaign in an attempt to lobby the council. They are worried about the problems that the evening economy is bringing. They put up a spirited, well informed argument at the meetings, and they are regularly supported by our local police, who&#151;such is their concern&#151;have taken it upon themselves to alert residents to applications by giving out leaflets to affected homes. But this is all time-consuming for the residents, the police and, most importantly, the council, which has had to put masses of extra resources into dealing with these issues.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51024-37_para8">
<a name="stpa_442">At present, we have six committees dealing with licensing. They have granted 400&nbsp;licences, and still the deluge continues. Before the Act, the former, Labour, Member for St. Albans reckoned that only about 1 per cent. of licensees would apply for longer hours, but the figure is 40&nbsp;per cent. Just as importantly, many of the premises offer music and entertainment. Some residents who have bought flats above small shops now find themselves above caf&#233; bars that have turned themselves into late-night music venues.

<a name="stpa_443">With so many licensed premises in St. Albans, it will be almost impossible firmly to attribute blame, which is part of residents&#039; problem. They are worried that if they challenge, they will have to pay their costs on appeal. Residents are also worried&#151;the Government have not tackled this&#151;that the future sale of their properties may be blighted if they keep being in dispute with local pubs and highlight the nuisance, so some are choosing to stay quiet. Some city centre properties are already blighted and some residents are moving out.

<a name="51024-37_para10">
<a name="stpa_444">So how is the council coping and interpreting the policy? I believe that it is a shambles in St. Alban&#039;s, with brewers being the winners. At a recent licensing meeting, the chair gave her view that the council was &quot;here to compromise&quot;. Perhaps that is the mediation to which one Labour Member referred. In this case, compromise means that if one applies to open until 3&nbsp;in the morning, then quickly changes it to 2&nbsp;in the morning, the objections of residents to 3&nbsp;in the morning are deemed not relevant. Local police officers turn up to support residents with anecdotal evidence of rowdy behaviour&#151;as I said earlier, they do not arrest everybody&#151;but those views are deemed hearsay if an arrest has not been made, and the council cannot take it into account. St. Albans has also adopted a policy of not defining a vicinity. In theory, that means that anyone can object, but the reality is that the committee is left unsure as to how much weight to give to objections. Again, how will that stand up on appeal?
</p>

<p>
<a name="51024-37_para11">
<a name="stpa_445">Worst of all, there is no concept of cumulative impact&#151;the onus is on residents to monitor the licensed premises and then petition for enforcement if they can &quot;show nuisance&quot;.

That is a heavy cost for us to bear, but I can only imagine the burden on many small rural businesses that do not sell much alcohol.

I am thinking particularly of the message that the Government sent at the time of the general election, to the effect that if people voted for them they would be able to drink all day.

The Secretary of State tries to pretend that the new laws will protect all those young people and their parents, but many of the laws are already in place. Moreover, many of the laws that she mentioned could have been introduced in splendid isolation, separately from the Act.

That is what frightens us. We are not worried about the staggering of closing times, which will have many benefits for the police.

 If implementation of this Act were proceeding smoothly and it were being welcomed by the majority of our constituents and the electorate at large, I am pretty sure that we would not be having this debate. I strongly rebut the Secretary of State&#039;s claim that we are being opportunistic and are guilty of flip-flop&#151;inconsistency. This legislation&#039;s progress has been inadequate; it has been late and badly prepared throughout. As the hon. Member for Bath (Mr. Foster) pointed out, in Committee we had no regulations, no guidance, no fee structure and no clear idea of implementation. There have been delays at every stage of implementation, and as many Members have said this evening, the application process has been a million light years away from the promises made by various Ministers.

<a name="stpa_460">When it became obvious that the Government were not addressing the binge drinking problem and ignoring representations from the police, the judiciary, local authorities and the village hall and sports club communities, we on the Opposition Benches opposed the legislation at every opportunity. The Minister in Committee raised the possibility of an amendment providing for a 20&nbsp;per cent. limit on fees for sports clubs, but subsequent Ministers reneged on that. We opposed the Bill on Report and on Third Reading, and the Government&#039;s attempt to suggest otherwise is, at best, misleading, and, at worst, an outright calumny. In any event, since this Act was debated in the House in 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>24 Oct 2005 : Column 126</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>2002&nbsp;and 2003, the problem of binge drinking has escalated to the point where large swathes of society are now in despair at the Government&#039;s intention to press ahead with this Act and with the second appointed day.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51024-38_para12">
<a name="stpa_461">A September Populus poll for <i>The Times</i> showed that the public are overwhelmingly against Government plans to extend licensing hours. It found that three fifths&#151;62&nbsp;per cent.&#151;opposed the changes. Only a third&#151;34&nbsp;per cent.&#151;were in favour of them. Women were against the changes by 71&nbsp;per cent. to 25&nbsp;per cent.; men were against them by 52&nbsp;per cent. to 34&nbsp;per cent. Not surprisingly, the only group in favour were 18&nbsp;to 24-year-olds. In direct opposition to ministerial assertions, the proposals are not popular. People see the extension of licensing hours as having a direct correlation with crime, antisocial behaviour, ill health and additional costs to the taxpayer.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51024-38_para13">
<a name="stpa_462">There are now 1&nbsp;million violent crimes a year. Violent crime rose by 7&nbsp;per cent. overall last year, on top of previous year-on-year increases. But the most important point is that nearly half of victims of violent crime thought that their attacker was under the influence of alcohol. The Home Office&#039;s report of June this year, entitled &quot;Findings from the 2003&nbsp;Offending, Crime and Justice Survey: alcohol-related crime and disorder&quot;, admitted that binge drinking is a major source of crime. It states:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_170">&quot;Binge drinkers accounted for a disproportionate volume of crime. They accounted for only 16&nbsp;per cent. of the adult sample but were responsible for 55&nbsp;per cent. of all offences reported by adults in the past 12&nbsp;months . . . It is young male binge drinkers who have the highest rates of offending. This would therefore suggest that any measures to reduce alcohol-related offending should consider tackling binge drinking, particularly within the young male population.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="51024-38_para14">
<a name="stpa_463">More worryingly, the Government have fiddled and hidden evidence that shows the damaging effect of more late-night drinking. Papers uncovered by the BBC&#039;s &quot;Panorama&quot; programme show that, as originally drafted, the Government&#039;s alcohol harm reduction strategy, launched in March 2004, included evidence from other countries of the damaging effects of longer opening hours. The Downing street strategy unit, which consulted 17&nbsp;experts in preparing the strategy, concluded that extending licensing hours could have a severe negative impact. It said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_171">&quot;Restrictions on availability reduce consumption and general levels of harm. Relaxing availability increases general harm whether through more outlets (Finland), denser outlets (California) or longer hours (Western Australia)&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="51024-38_para15">
<a name="stpa_464">Such concerns were removed from the final version, which made no reference to opening hours. A source cited by <i>The Sunday Times</i> as being close to the strategy stated that civil servants


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_172">&quot;drafted what they thought was a pretty decent strategy only to see it get decimated as it got passed around government departments&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="51024-38_para16">
<a name="stpa_465">The cost of alcohol-fuelled crime and disorder is already &#163;12&nbsp;billion&#151;&#163;5&nbsp;billion more than the strategy unit predicted.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51024-38_para17">
<a name="stpa_466">The alcohol committee of the Royal College of Physicians stated:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_173">&quot;Already, alcohol-related diseases are costing the NHS about &#163;1.7&nbsp;billion every year. Around 17&nbsp;million working days are lost annually because of alcohol abuse, costing our economy &#163;6.4&nbsp;billion. 70&nbsp;per cent. of all weekend night-time admissions to hospitals Accident and Emergency Departments are linked to alcohol. More than half of all violent crime is related to drink.&quot;</p>
</ul>

<br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>

<p>
<a name="51024-38_para18">
<a name="stpa_467">The committee believes:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_174">&quot;The places that will take advantage of changes in the law are not the local, neighbourhood pubs where responsible drinking already occurs and the staff know their customers. It will be the large, anonymous, urban establishments, with a young clientele, that will benefit most&#151;but experience the most trouble, whether it is through an increase in street violence or in damage to health.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="51024-38_para19">
<a name="stpa_468">There are few powers in the legislation to hold pubs and clubs responsible for rowdy or drunk customers once they are outside their licensed premises&#151;even if the nuisance was ultimately caused by serving alcohol. Most local residents cannot object to controversial proposals for late-night licensing in their town centre&#151;unless, of course, they live very close by. Yet antisocial behaviour, crime and nuisance are not limited to the immediate area around the licensed premises; they can occur miles away as drunken revellers return home. Moreover, councils and police cannot use nuisance and noise from outside a licensed premises as grounds for a closure order against a particular venue. Pubs and clubs can be penalised only if they make excessive noise from inside a pub. Hence, licensed premises cannot be held responsible for the antics of their drunken customers leaving in the early hours.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51024-38_para20">
<a name="stpa_469">The Secretary of State claimed earlier in the debate that the curfew, as she calls it, would be a thing of the past. However, as the hon. Member for Bath said, there is nothing in the Act to secure staggered closing times. Let me quote Peter Fahy, the chief constable of Cheshire police:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_175">&quot;In the various applications coming through, we are seeing a general extension of an hour or two on to existing hours. And that means that some of the problems we see on a Friday and Saturday night are now going to spread into other nights of the week.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="51024-38_para21">
<a name="stpa_470">The idea that we will be able to curtail antisocial behaviour by staggering the closure of these outlets is nonsense. As my hon. Friend the Member for Ribble Valley (Mr. Evans) said, publicans have looked at what their neighbours and competitors are doing and have put in for exactly the same extension of hours so that custom does not go elsewhere.

A simple statutory instrument could be introduced to implement the parts of the measure on which there is common agreement, but the hours extension provisions could and should be delayed for a rethink because of the binge-drinking implications.

<a name="stpa_474">I agree with him. There are real issues, however, as the hon. Member for Ribble Valley (Mr. Evans) made clear in an excellent speech.

That is legal under current law. That is exactly why we are changing the law. Such problems are occurring under the current law and they need to be fixed.

There is a loophole in the current law whereby people can drink in pubs after 11&nbsp;o&#039;clock, but only in pubs that put on dancing and music&#151;the very ones about which we are most worried. There are 320&nbsp;such pubs in the centre of Manchester alone, so the idea that people are not drinking after 11&nbsp;o&#039;clock at night is wrong, but they can do so only in the places that we would be most worried about if we were designing the law from scratch.

<br>&nbsp;<br>the answer to the concerns about binge drinking is to change the behaviour of customers and proprietors, as well as introducing stronger licensing regulations. We agree with the police. If we delayed the Act&#039;s implementation, we would not get the powers that we need, contrary to what the hon. Member for Bath suggested in his speech. He is wrong to say that we would have those powers anyhow. For example, if we delayed implementation, we would lose the power for review, which will be central to changing the incentives open to landlords, so that they know that, if they misbehave or cause problems, they will face an immediate review by residents or the police.

<p>
<a name="51024-39_para8">
<a name="stpa_480">The hon. Member for Bath said that we should just rely on the current powers, but ACPO says that those powers are broken, and it has told us that they want new powers. Frankly, it is not folly to implement the Act; it would be folly not to do so against the advice of the police.

<a name="51024-39_para9">
<a name="stpa_481">If we delay the Act&#039;s implementation, we would not have the powers to deal with binge drinking and the costs placed on businesses would rise. Hon. Members made important points about the costs, and we will look at them in the review that Sir Les Elton is chairing.

The representatives of the Central Council of Physical Recreation and of Action with Communities in Rural England, who represent village halls, have written to hon. Members to say that they do not want the Act&#039;s implementation to be delayed. If we delayed it, they would lose the &#163;2&nbsp;billion of savings that they will get over the next 10&nbsp;years and all the work, which he described so eloquently, that has been going on over the summer would have been wasted, and the money would have been wasted. Hon. Members have championed that cause, and they would not be thanked by their constituents if we imposed greater costs on them.

<a name="51024-39_para11">
<a name="stpa_483">The hon. Members for Bath and for North-East Cambridgeshire said that we did not have evidence for the Act. In fact, flexible hours have been introduced in New Zealand, Victoria and New South Wales, and they have reduced alcohol consumption in all those places. Today&#039;s argument about delay is not about serious politics; it is just about chasing headlines. I believe that this is good legislation, but even those who have had concerns about the specifics of the Act now say that they want it to be implemented. When politicians in the House look at the Act impartially, they agree with us. The deputy leader of the Liberal Democrats served on the independent Nicholson committee in Scotland that recommended following the path that we are following and he backed our proposals.

<a name="51024-42_time1"><h5>10.32&nbsp;pm</h5>




<p><a name="st_366"><a name="51024-42_spnew2"><b> Mr. David Kidney  (Stafford) (Lab):</b> 
 I am pleased to have secured tonight&#039;s Adjournment debate on this important subject.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51024-42_para4">
<a name="stpa_497">For most people, the penny has dropped that the housing sector is not one homogenous whole, although there are still some people who have ventured only so far as to think that there is overheating in the housing market in the south-east and problems of low demand in the north. Even within that simplistic view of the housing sector there are empty homes in the south-east and areas of high-priced housing and tight housing markets in the north. However, the situation is much more varied than that.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51024-42_para5">
<a name="stpa_498">I like to think of the west midlands as a microcosm of the entire country&#039;s housing market. For example, in the west of the west midlands there are sparsely populated rural areas in Herefordshire, Shropshire, the north-east of the area and Staffordshire, Moorlands. In the centre, major conurbations such as Birmingham are regenerating, growing and becoming increasingly engines of future development.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51024-42_para6">
<a name="stpa_499">In Stoke and in Sandwell, two areas of housing market renewal, we are trying to build up areas of housing where markets have become distressed in the past. In some parts of the region, in counties such as Warwickshire and Worcestershire, there are terrible housing hot spots where even key public sector workers cannot afford to buy a home.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51024-42_para7">
<a name="stpa_500">On top of all that, the regional housing strategy that was agreed in June identified a need for a net 13,464&nbsp;new affordable dwellings in the region in just three years, from 2006&#150;08. It is important to impress on the Minister and on everyone who is interested in this subject that different solutions are required in different places. That applies in the west midlands and in the broader country, too. It is vital that the very diversity that makes the west midlands so fascinating and gives us so much economic and social potential should be matched with a housing sector that is also diverse, flexible and dynamic.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51024-42_para8">
<a name="stpa_501">I hope to cover two central points. First, we need more affordable housing in our region&#151;more than we already have and more than is planned. Secondly, rural areas need special attention if there is to be enough affordable housing for local people in their rural communities. What I mean by &quot;affordable housing&quot; is low-cost housing that people can buy on the open market, and subsidised public or private housing, whether it be for rent, sale or shared ownership. My starting point is Shelter&#039;s analysis and campaign on the subject, starting a few years ago with its million children campaign, which reminded us of the devastating impact of homelessness, overcrowding and unfit housing on children&#039;s health, education and life chances.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51024-42_para9">
<a name="stpa_502">Shelter&#039;s analysis focuses on a chronic shortage of social rented housing. I hope to go further than that, but in its new campaign document &quot;Building hope: the case for more homes now&quot;, it calls for 20,000&nbsp;more social rented homes each year from 2008&nbsp;to 2011, in addition to planned outputs. It says that that package could help to lift more than 150,000&nbsp;children out of bad housing by 2011.


<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>24 Oct 2005 : Column 142</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>

<p>
<a name="51024-42_para10">
<a name="stpa_503">The Barker review of housing supply identified the broader lack of supply across all tenures. According to Barker, builders, who already provide about 160,000 new properties a year for open market sale, should raise that by between another 70,000 and 120,000 a year. Although registered social landlords and councils are adding nearly 20,000 new affordable homes a year, Barker suggests that an extra 17,000 a year above that is needed to meet expected future demand. Barker also says that there is a case for up to another 9,000 a year above that rate to make inroads into the backlog of need.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51024-42_para11">
<a name="stpa_504">Of the 21 million or so existing homes in Britain, more than 1 million houses are below the current fitness standard&#151;most are in the owner-occupied sector&#151;500,000 households are in overcrowded accommodation, and 90,000 households are in temporary accommodation. On top of those problems, on 1 April 2004, 693,000 dwellings in England were standing empty&#151;most of them in the private sector&#151;and at any one time more than 300,000 potential homes stand empty for more than six months. That is more than the figure for every council&#039;s waiting list of those who have been accepted as homeless and in priority need. The amount of existing assets that stand empty when we could be putting them to use is a crying shame.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51024-42_para12">
<a name="stpa_505">Against that background, what is the Government&#039;s position on housing policy generally? Under Labour since 1997, home ownership has increased by 1 million, and the target is set for another increase in this Parliament of a further 1 million home owners. This year, the Council of Mortgage Lenders published useful research called &quot;Understanding first-time buyers&quot;. It shows that the number of first-time buyers has declined recently, but that they remain crucial to the health of the housing market as a whole. Renting fulfils a need for flexibility and mobility, but in the longer term 80&nbsp;per cent. of young adults still want to be owner occupiers. However, the size of the deposit paid by first-time buyers has risen so that some of them rely on parents and grandparents for help with that. The research by the Council of Mortgage Lenders concludes that Government policy needs to focus on more flexible movement into and out of home ownership to reflect changing lifestyles. It also says that further development of an intermediate tenure could help to sustain the long-term future health of the housing market.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51024-42_para13">
<a name="stpa_506">In addition to home ownership, the Government have raised the stamp duty threshold from &#163;60,000&nbsp;to &#163;120,000. An extra 300,000&nbsp;home buyers a year will be exempt from paying stamp duty as a result. The Government have also reduced rough sleeping in a dramatic way. The number of those sleeping rough is now less than one quarter of the figure given for 1998. In Birmingham in 1998&#151;admittedly, these are estimates by the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister&#151;there were 56&nbsp;rough sleepers, but in 2005&nbsp;there are just seven. That is a commendable performance.

<a name="stpa_507">The Government have plans for a stronger intermediate housing market to help people achieve home ownership at an affordable pace. A new &quot;homebuy&quot; scheme for council and housing association tenants has been planned. A first-time buyers initiative will help first-time buyers who cannot afford to own or part-own a home without extra help. Existing home ownership schemes such as the key worker living scheme and shared ownership are being strengthened. In addition, the Government are releasing more vacant public sector land for housing. Their funding for social housing has doubled, and they wish to improve not just supply but quality. Existing social housing, for example, is subject to the decent homes standard, which has raised more than 1&nbsp;million homes to a decent standard. The Government are also concentrating on the need for warmer homes. In addition to work under the decent homes standard, projects such as warm front have provided insulation and improved heating in more than 1&nbsp;million homes. Higher standards for building new homes so that they are sustainable are at the heart of the Government&#039;s strategy. The more public money that the Government pay to build homes, the more they can insist that those homes are built to a given standard. From next April, a code for sustainable building will be introduced, and it is pleasing that the Government have announced that they expect homes paid for by public funds to meet that standard.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51024-43_para1">
<a name="stpa_508">By 2008, the Labour Government promise to build 30,000&nbsp;new social homes, including new build by councils. Councils have stronger powers to bring empty properties back into use, and a range of legislation has been introduced to enable them to do so. For example, councils can impose a fuller council tax on empty properties instead of rewarding the owners for keeping them empty with cuts. Councils can secure information to track down the owners of empty properties so that they can hold discussions with them. The Housing Act 2004&nbsp;includes a power for councils to exercise new empty property management orders so that empty properties can be brought into productive use for society&#039;s benefit.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51024-43_para2">
<a name="stpa_509">A week ago, during the national week of action of empty homes, I published a pamphlet calling for a new classification of empty properties as &quot;redfield&quot; sites. Such sites would be used to designate land containing vacant property that could be brought back into use as residential housing. Government guidance to planners would require them to apply the sequential test to the provision of housing sites. Redfield sites containing empty properties would be considered first for their suitability as sites for new homes. Brownfield sites would be considered next and then, as now, greenfield sites.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51024-43_para3">
<a name="stpa_510">The need for affordable housing can be met by building new homes; by converting existing houses and other buildings; and by bringing vacant homes and

<br>&nbsp;<br>other vacant properties back into residential use. That national plan is applied locally by the west midlands regional housing strategy, a well-researched document prepared after extensive consultation with local authorities and other stakeholders. There are agreed priorities for the region, including urban and rural renaissance and something that the strategy calls &quot;The Big Issue: Affordability&quot;. All those priorities have been developed within the context of mixed, balanced and inclusive communities.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51024-43_para4">
<a name="stpa_511">West midlands housing resources for the current financial year include a Government housing allocation of more than &#163;180&nbsp;million. As a result of the last spending review an estimated 2,000&nbsp;social rented units will be delivered in the west midlands in 2007&#150;08. There is a desperate need to help large numbers of residents trapped in overcrowded or unfit housing, as well as people who have no permanent housing at all. An eighth of England&#039;s homeless live in the west midlands, and about 120,000&nbsp;households are registered on council housing lists. There are 116,000&nbsp;unfit dwellings and 75,000&nbsp;empty homes. Last year, 5,332&nbsp;council homes were sold under the right to buy, including 200&nbsp;in Stafford.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51024-43_para5">
<a name="stpa_512">Sadly, however, despite that background, the constituency of Stafford is not identified in our regional plan as an area of particular need requiring special help for meeting our needs for affordable housing. That dismays me, because I uncover in my casework a great deal of pressure across the board for help with affordable housing, be it from young couples looking for their first home, key public sector workers having trouble finding a home to buy, existing tenants of councils and housing associations wanting to move or to buy but finding themselves trapped where they are, or retired people on limited incomes who want to downsize but cannot find anywhere to suit their pocket. Increasingly, I am also having to advise people who have been knocked back by councils in homelessness applications to challenge them in the courts.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51024-43_para6">
<a name="stpa_513">In addition to all this, the house price to average salary ratio in my constituency is as high as 8:1. Furthermore, 80&nbsp;per cent. of the South Staffordshire district&#151;part of which is in my constituency&#151;is unsuitable for the building of new homes because of green-belt and other open countryside policies. That means that housing is concentrated in the existing villages, where restrictive planning policies result in very high prices that local people cannot afford.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51024-43_para7">
<a name="stpa_514">The Shelter campaign&#039;s request for 20,000&nbsp;additional social rented houses a year in England would translate into an extra 1,330&nbsp;units annually in the west midlands during the three years from 2008. Shelter estimates that that could help to lift more than 11,500&nbsp;children out of bad housing. Will the Minister acknowledge the urgency of the need for more affordable housing across the whole of the west midlands region? Will he also spare a thought for the specific needs of my constituency?
</p>

<p>
<a name="51024-43_para8">
<a name="stpa_515">I would ask the Minister to adopt policies such as ensuring that Labour&#039;s manifesto promises relating to the Homebuy programme, the first-time buyers&#039; initiative, the key worker living scheme, and shared ownership will apply in the west midlands. The key worker living scheme does not apply outside the south-east. Will the Minister ensure that there are stronger planning powers under new planning policy statement 3, 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>24 Oct 2005 : Column 145</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>when it appears, which would enable councils to secure affordable housing as part of all new developments? Will he also ensure that there is greater certainty for developers, registered social landlords and private property investors, so that they will invest in our region? Will he look at Shelter&#039;s Building Hope agenda, so that there can be more homes? Will he introduce policies for more funding, for stronger section 106&nbsp;agreements, for modernising the private rented sector and for further reform of the right to buy?
</p>

<p>
<a name="51024-43_para9">
<a name="stpa_516">I hope that we will take forward the Deputy Prime Minister&#039;s initiative for affordable homes built by modern methods of construction at affordable prices. I should like to mention that there is a developer in my Stafford constituency who would like to see affordable homes being built as part of his wider regeneration projects, but who argues for a tax credit arrangement for a public subsidy to him, instead of the complex system of applying for grants. He also has an idea for establishing an institute for modern building technology to train the labour force required for putting into practice modern methods of construction. I hope that all that will be welcomed by the Minister.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51024-43_para10">
<a name="stpa_517">Rural housing needs particular attention. In the last Parliament, Labour set targets for the creation of affordable homes in rural areas, and met them. In our manifesto, we promised to explore how to ensure that a proportion of all new housing development could be made available and affordable to local residents and their families in rural areas. In fairness, the Government have now established what they promised in their rural manifesto: an affordable rural housing commission, chaired by Elinor Goodman, which is due to report early next year.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51024-43_para11">
<a name="stpa_518">Let us remember that rural Britain generates 30&nbsp;per cent. of the nation&#039;s jobs and 25&nbsp;per cent. of its gross domestic product, all from 23&nbsp;per cent. of the nation&#039;s population. However, the lack of affordable housing in rural areas is a key challenge. Many of my constituents have raised this issue with me many times. Sometimes, the houses are just not there to enable children to live in the places where they grew up. In other cases, the homes that are there are simply too expensive for them to afford, so they are unable to live locally.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51024-43_para12">
<a name="stpa_519">The west midlands regional housing strategy goes so far as to suggest that, in rural areas, consideration should be given to allocating 100&nbsp;per cent. affordable housing sites. That is an impressive commitment to what could be done through planning law to ensure that we can have affordable housing in rural areas. We also need special measures, including more stretching targets for new affordable homes in rural areas&#151;recognising the higher costs of rural developments, both in land prices and unit building costs&#151;and ring-fencing the investment needed to meet the higher targets. We also need innovative co-operative, mutual and other models under which the affordability can be locked in for all time. Similarly, we need to make more attractive the use of exceptions sites for new affordable homes.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51024-43_para13">
<a name="stpa_520">On right to buy, I would also argue that councils in rural areas, and housing associations in rural areas with a population larger than 3,000, ought to have more protection from losing their stock to right to buy. Let me give the example of one village in my constituency, Wheaton Aston, where the South Staffordshire Housing Association has a stock of 58&nbsp;units of affordable homes 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>24 Oct 2005 : Column 146</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>but currently has a waiting list of 74&nbsp;and a turnover in 2004&#150;05&nbsp;of just three. For the full picture for my constituency, one would have to multiply those figures by a factor of about 30. To get the full picture in the west midlands, where there are 59&nbsp;constituencies, one would have to multiply again. It is therefore a huge problem.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51024-43_para14">
<a name="stpa_521">That is why, across the west midlands, there are families, single people and vulnerable individuals who have no secure homes of their own. Some would like to buy a home but cannot do so without help. Others would like to make progress towards home ownership, but there is no supply of intermediate housing for them. Others still want to rent, because they prefer this tenure long-term, or because renting suits their immediate needs. On the other hand, there are developers willing to provide, investors willing to fund, builders willing to construct, and registered social landlords and councils willing to manage. I am asking the Minister to join up the supply side and help meet the demand.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51024-43_para15">
<a name="stpa_522">We should not rest while there is so much unmet need for affordable housing. Opportunity, ambition and lifetime achievement will be hindered until those in need can have access more consistently, in greater numbers and with wider choice to a range of affordable housing in all parts of the west midlands. I therefore ask the Minister to help the west midlands to help itself to meet the pressing need for affordable housing.

<p><a name="st_369"><a name="51024-44_spmin0"><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Office of the Deputy Prime Minister  (Jim Fitzpatrick): </b> 
 I thank my hon. Friend the Member for Stafford (Mr. Kidney) for raising the issue of affordable housing, which the Government consider to be of great importance to the future economic and social development and well-being of our country. Before moving to the specifics of the west midlands, I want to outline what we are trying to achieve nationally, as well as that which we have accomplished. Some of those issues were raised by my hon. Friend.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51024-44_para0">
<a name="stpa_523">First, as my hon. Friend mentioned, the number of home owners has increased by 1&nbsp;million since 1997. Repossessions have fallen from 75,000&nbsp;in 1991&nbsp;to just over 6,000&nbsp;in 2004&nbsp;and mortgage interest rates have remained at low levels over a considerable period. We have a strategy to increase housing supply, as set out in the communities plan and that is now delivering results in London and the south-east&#151;a 36&nbsp;per cent. increase in new homes built between 2001&nbsp;and 2005, combined with increasing densities and reuse of brownfield land. That is addressing one of the causes of affordability problems: that, over several decades, we have simply not built enough new homes.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51024-44_para1">
<a name="stpa_524">My hon. Friend raised the issue of homelessness and the fact that it is perceived as increasing and becoming the predominant route to social housing. We have tried to tackle the worst homelessness problems, as I am sure he knows. We have reduced rough sleeping by 75&nbsp;per cent. and ended the long-term use of bed-and-breakfast accommodation for families with children. The number of people becoming homeless is also falling. The latest statistics, from April to June this year, show homeless acceptances as 17&nbsp;per cent. lower than in the same period in 2004.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51024-44_para2">
<a name="stpa_525">A range of measures are necessary in addition to a stable market and increasing supply to tackle the problem of the lack of affordable homes. Since 1997, we 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>24 Oct 2005 : Column 147</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>have doubled the investment in affordable housing for rent or purchase. Over the three years to 2006, &#163;5&nbsp;billion will be spent. That investment will support the delivery of our new range of simpler, more affordable, more accessible home ownership schemes. In the short term, through our new homebuy schemes, we will help more than 100,000&nbsp;households to own their own home by 2010. Homebuy will provide a flexible shared equity-based product that will increase access to home ownership for those currently priced out of the market. It will also provide opportunities for social tenants to buy a share in their homes. Homebuy will reinforce the longer-term strategy by increasing home ownership opportunities for key workers now.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51024-44_para3">
<a name="stpa_526">Many initiatives focus on the urban areas where key workers and first-time buyers have found it difficult to obtain affordable housing but, as my hon. Friend said, rural areas have not been and will not be overlooked. Current schemes are designed to be flexible enough to respond to the needs of rural as well as urban communities. The Rural Affordable Housing Commission is now examining issues, problems and solutions across the country in rural areas, and will make recommendations based on good practice.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51024-44_para4">
<a name="stpa_527">Empty homes are also a factor in the contribution to an adequate supply. My hon. Friend produced a useful pamphlet that highlights the issue, but we do not agree that a new &quot;redfield&quot; label is required. Over the last decade, the number of vacant dwellings has dropped by nearly 180,000, to 690,000&nbsp;in 2004. More remains to be done and we recently provided local authorities with a new tool&#151;empty dwelling management orders&#151;to support their efforts to return empty dwellings to use. There are also tax incentives to support the use of space above shops, the conversion of properties and the renovation of properties that have been empty for three or more years.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51024-44_para5">
<a name="stpa_528">The west midlands contains some urban areas where market restructuring is essential and, indeed, is pressing ahead&#151;for example, the north Staffordshire and Birmingham-Sandwell housing market renewal pathfinder areas. But in other areas there are significant affordability and supply issues comparable with those seen in parts of the south-east. The regional spatial strategy has had a key input in the update of the regional housing strategy that was completed in June this year.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51024-44_para6">
<a name="stpa_529">The importance of housing in delivering the region&#039;s wider objectives is demonstrated by the commitment to an extensive research exercise. That research, which is the envy of many other regions, has provided a comprehensive picture of the housing problems in the west midlands. It was led by Birmingham university&#039;s centre for urban and regional studies, which identified the key issues and used extensive engagement to develop a consensus on the priorities for action.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51024-44_para7">
<a name="stpa_530">The research resulted in the definition of four housing market areas in the region. In each area, surveys of needs and aspirations were considered together with average house prices, incomes and trends in household formation. It confirmed that affordability problems are experienced most acutely in the west and south of the region, where price-to-income ratios reach a value of nine. In the north of the region, although prices are 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>24 Oct 2005 : Column 148</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>lower, incomes are also lower. That has resulted in affordability problems that had not previously been highlighted.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51024-44_para8">
<a name="stpa_531">On the basis of the estimates of affordable housing needs for each market area, a total of 78,000&nbsp;affordable dwellings will be required across the region over the period to 2021. The central market area, including the Birmingham conurbation, has the greatest requirement: more than 45,000&nbsp;dwellings. Issues highlighted include the need to provide improved choice of property type across the area, where terraced properties are over-represented.
</p>








<p><a name="st_370"><a name="51024-44_spnew0"><b> Lynne Jones: </b> 
 Is my hon. Friend satisfied that there are enough new affordable homes, particularly for rent, to meet demand? I gave some figures earlier. In Birmingham, the number of re-lets has fallen from 9,200&nbsp;a year in 1997&nbsp;to 4,600. As a result, a higher proportion are being used to deal with homelessness. Will he ensure that the supply is adequate? Birmingham city council has been demolishing homes without building replacements. That council alone needs 3,000&nbsp;new homes a year, more than even Shelter&#151;
</p>








<p><a name="st_371"><a name="51024-44_spmin1"><b>Madam Deputy Speaker  (Sylvia Heal): </b> 
 Order. The hon. Lady&#039;s intervention is going on rather.
</p>








<p><a name="st_372"><a name="51024-44_spnew1"><b> Jim Fitzpatrick: </b> 
 My hon. Friend makes a strong point. I know that she has written to the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister. I also know that there is to be an Adjournment debate later this week to deal with aspects of the Birmingham difficulties.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51024-44_para9">
<a name="stpa_532">I can only repeat what I tried to say at the beginning of my speech. Decades of decline in house building have led to a serious problem and the issue of affordable housing and the building of enough affordable homes in the country is at the top of the ODPM&#039;s agenda. We are doing all that we can to address the deficit in the meantime, and opportunities such as this to put on record what has been done nationally and regionally will help to fuel the debates and allow us to make progress, with the assistance of my hon. Friends.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51024-44_para10">
<a name="stpa_533">In the west market area&#151;Herefordshire and Shropshire&#151;there are also high levels of home ownership, with significant retirement migration and a limited mix of properties. This pressure on prices has led to a requirement for 12,000&nbsp;affordable homes. My hon. Friend the Member for Stafford will be most interested in the north market area, which covers Stoke and northern Staffordshire. This, like the central area, suffers from an over-representation of terraced properties. The economy is weak and insular, and generally low incomes have led to a requirement for 3,000&nbsp;affordable homes.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51024-44_para11">
<a name="stpa_534">To address the need for affordable housing in the west midlands over the next two years, &#163;198&nbsp;million has been allocated to the Housing Corporation&#151;an 11&nbsp;per cent. increase on the figure for the past two years. That funding is prioritised toward the mainly rural areas of the region in the south and west housing market areas. It will deliver an increase in affordable homes&#151;from 1,200&nbsp;for 2004&#150;06&nbsp;to 2,500&nbsp;for 2006&#150;08&#151;in these largely rural areas.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51024-44_para12">
<a name="stpa_535">To improve delivery, the Housing Corporation is seeking ways to improve the cost-effectiveness of its programmes. These range from innovative and modern

The regional housing board is facilitating region-wide sharing of good and innovative practice in the delivery of the regional housing strategy. Practitioners will be encouraged to think the unthinkable in considering the most effective ways of delivering affordable housing. Solutions will be sought from all sectors&#151;legal, financial, technological, property, house-building, voluntary and charitable&#151;as well as local authorities and RSLs.

<br>&nbsp;<br>the factors associated with the affordability of housing. The west midlands regional housing board has gained a thorough understanding of the problems across the region and the regional housing strategy provides guidance on the issues to be addressed in each of the housing market areas.
