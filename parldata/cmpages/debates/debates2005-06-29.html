 (Con): Whether the UK&#039;s position on aid for Ethiopia has changed as a consequence of (a) border hostilities with Eritrea and (b) uncertainty over the recent election results; and if he will make a statement.  [7781]
</p>


<p><a name="st_0"><a name="50629-01_spmin0"><b>The Secretary of State for International Development  (Hilary Benn): </b> 
 The UK&#039;s position on the border question between Ethiopia and Eritrea remains that the boundary commission decision is final and binding, and that both parties should discuss the issues that separate them. On the Ethiopian elections, we have made clear our view that the complaints investigation process should be completed as soon as possible, that the deaths resulting from civil disturbances should be investigated, and that those detained should either be released or charged. Until the situation is clearer, I am putting on hold plans to increase budget support this year by &#163;20 million.
</p>





<p><a name="st_1"><a name="50629-01_spnew0"><b> Tim Loughton: </b> 
 I am grateful for the Secretary of State&#039;s answer, because those of us who are familiar with Ethiopia will know that the most progress that has been made in that country has come since the end of 21 years of conflict with Eritrea and a return to democratic processes of sorts, and yet 100,000 Ethiopian troops are posturing on the border, and almost two months after a general election there is no result, with many anticipating that it was won by the opposition. Can he tell me what steps he will take in the future to remind the Ethiopian Government that British and other aid is in part contingent on an avoidance of military conflict and a promotion of democratic processes in that country, which are most of all in the interests of the Ethiopian people?
</p>





<p><a name="st_2"><a name="50629-01_spnew1"><b> Hilary Benn: </b> 
 I agree with the hon. Gentleman. When I was in Ethiopia two weeks ago, I spent an hour with Prime Minister Meles discussing those issues. The decision that I have taken to hold for the time being the increase in budget support is in recognition of the real crisis there. Currently, there is no election result, with 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>29 Jun 2005 : Column 1280</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>many claims and many complaints about the electoral process. The only way to resolve those, and to allow the voice of the Ethiopian people to be heard, is for the national election board to complete its work. In the meantime, we very much hope that the countries will not return to fighting each other, because the real issue in Ethiopia is fighting poverty.
</p>





<p><a name="st_3"><a name="50629-01_spnew2"><b> Derek Wyatt  (Sittingbourne and Sheppey)</b> 
 (Lab): As someone who has also been to Ethiopia and met Prime Minister Meles, as I understand it, the general election results will be made known on 8 July. Is the Secretary of State saying that, notwithstanding those results, he will give no further aid until he is satisfied in relation to those who are in prison?
</p>





<p><a name="st_4"><a name="50629-01_spnew3"><b> Hilary Benn: </b> 
 A large number of people who were      arrested have now been released&#151;about 2,700 according to our best estimate&#151;and about 1,500 people are still in detention. My hon. Friend is right that 8 July is the date by which the result is supposed to be declared, but given that 140 complaints have now been approved by the national election board for investigation, and that there is a full process to allow those investigations to take place, including rights to appeal, it is hard to see the results being declared by 8 July. What everyone wants is for the process to proceed to a successful conclusion&#151;namely, the voice of the people being heard and the results being declared. In the circumstances, it is right to wait and watch, and to see what the outcome is.

<p><a name="st_5"><a name="50629-01_spnew4"><b> Mr. Laurence Robertson  (Tewkesbury)</b> 
 (Con): I would normally pay tribute to the Secretary of State&#039;s deep interest in Ethiopia, and he has carried out a great deal of useful work. I am concerned, however, that he has now put on hold the increase in assistance to Ethiopia. It is true that there has been an unfortunate incident, which is being investigated, but we need to recognise how far Ethiopia has come in the past few years, and we ought to encourage that country. Elections have recently taken place in Ethiopia, and yes, there are complaints, but we must recognise that for the first time those elections were open to international observers, many of whom were complimentary. Can I therefore suggest that the Secretary of State examine the situation closely? Can I also&#151;<i>[Interruption.]</i>

<p><a name="st_7"><a name="50629-01_spnew6"><b> Hilary Benn: </b> 
 I recognise the hon. Gentleman&#039;s close interest in Ethiopia and agree with him that until polling day and what happened afterwards, the election process was quite remarkable, with 1 million people demonstrating in Addis, and the opposition winning every seat in the capital and having access to the media for the first time. In the context of the history of Ethiopia, that was an extraordinary change, which makes the violence and arrests, including of workers of the Coalition for Unity and Democracy, the main opposition party, who are needed to participate in the national election board process, a source of such concern. I can assure him, however, that I will keep a close eye on the situation and that we remain firmly committed to our development partnership with Ethiopia, as the challenges are enormous. 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>29 Jun 2005 : Column 1281</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>Currently, through support to the safety net programme of &#163;70 million over three years, we are helping to give food and money to people so that they can improve their lives.
</p>





<p><a name="st_8"><a name="50629-01_spnew7"><b> Mr. Eddie McGrady  (South Down)</b> 
 (SDLP): Does the Secretary of State agree that irrespective of boundary disputes or elections, the overwhelming, underlying problem in Ethiopia is the starvation of ordinary people? When he was visiting the country two weeks ago, did he share the experience of some people from Northern Ireland, teachers and past pupils, who went there to build a village school? When they got there and saw young children falling by the wayside, suffering from malnutrition and blind from lack of nurturing, they decided that their role should instead be to come home and raise money to feed those people. On their way out of that village, mothers pleaded with them to take their children back to Ireland. Will the Minister make every endeavour at the G8 summit to ensure that, irrespective of Government interventions and misdeeds, ordinary people get food in their tummies?
</p>





<p><a name="st_9"><a name="50629-01_spnew8"><b> Hilary Benn: </b> 
 I am happy to give my hon. Friend that assurance. According to the current estimate, about 10 million people need food aid. The number goes up or down each year, depending on the harvest and the rains.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50629-01_para0">
<a name="stpa_0">The safety net programme that I mentioned in my last answer is a practical expression of our determination to work with the Ethiopian Government to provide support. I applaud all who are working in whatever way&#151;whether helping to provide education or raising funds for relief and humanitarian support&#151;because this is a country in which many people live on the margins of existence every single day of every single year. That is why the chance of development for Ethiopia is so important, and that is why a proper outcome of the democratic process would be the best way of helping the country to have a better future.

</p>


<p><a name="st_10"><a name="50629-01_spmin1"><b>The Secretary of State for International Development  (Hilary Benn): </b> 
 Good governance is essential to reducing poverty, and we take account of governance in allocating UK aid. DFID is supporting action against corruption, the reform of public financial management and improved accountability and transparency, through, for example, the extractive industries transparency initiative. We are also assisting the African peer review mechanism.
</p>





<p><a name="st_11"><a name="50629-01_spnew9"><b> Alistair Burt: </b> 
 The Secretary of State&#039;s suspension of the increase in aid to Ethiopia is a mark of his concern about governance there. It contrasts markedly with the Home Secretary&#039;s failure to make a similar gesture in response to concern about Zimbabwe. But in the event of a major humanitarian crisis involving famine and homelessness in Zimbabwe, how will the Secretary of 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>29 Jun 2005 : Column 1282</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>State achieve the difficult balance of supporting those in need while not indirectly rewarding the perpetrator of the original injustice?
</p>





<p><a name="st_12"><a name="50629-01_spnew10"><b> Hilary Benn: </b> 
 We do that in Zimbabwe. In the past we have supported a programme of food aid, along with others in the international community. Following the disgraceful demolition of homes, which has cast people out on to the street in the cold, we have so far given $570,000 to the International Organisation for Migration and, most recently, to UNICEF, to provide practical assistance for those who have lost their homes. As the hon. Gentleman will know, we also have an HIV/AIDS programme in Zimbabwe, which we operate through non-governmental organisations and others. As he will also know, we do not give any financial assistance directly to the Zimbabwe Government.
</p>





<p><a name="st_13"><a name="50629-01_spnew11"><b> Mr. Mackay: </b> 
 May we have an absolute guarantee that in the case of a barbarous regime like Mugabe&#039;s in Zimbabwe, which is doing horrendous things to its people&#151;as we see with the demolition of all those homes&#151;all our financial aid goes only to NGOs, and nothing whatever is allowed to go to a Government who would politically manipulate aid to their own ends?
</p>





<p><a name="st_14"><a name="50629-01_spnew12"><b> Hilary Benn: </b> 
 I am happy to give that assurance. We work through others. The case of Zimbabwe demonstrates that our concern for good governance is reflected in the decisions that we make through our aid programme about the way in which we give our support, but ultimately the fact that the people of a country have a rotten Government should not prevent them from receiving appropriate financial assistance, and we will continue to provide it.
</p>





<p><a name="st_15"><a name="50629-01_spnew13"><b> Mr. Tom Clarke  (Coatbridge, Chryston and Bellshill)</b> 
 (Lab): Has my right hon. Friend had more time to consider last year&#039;s report from the International Development Committee, which referred to the Africa Commission&#039;s work on good government? In particular, has he noted the Committee&#039;s views on the Swedish model and its recommendation on systematic reporting to Parliament on these issues?
</p>





<p><a name="st_16"><a name="50629-01_spnew14"><b> Hilary Benn: </b> 
 My right hon. Friend has raised an important point. This is one step that we are taking: our agreements with aid partners, in which each side undertakes to make commitments, will now be displayed on the DFID website. That is our own act of transparency, showing people the basis on which we make decisions about aid.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50629-01_para1">
<a name="stpa_1">The report adopted by the Swedish Government also reflects the importance of ensuring that all the steps that we are taking, involving aid, debt relief and trade, are consistent so that we can support development, including good governance.

<p><a name="st_17"><a name="50629-01_spnew15"><b> Mr. Michael Clapham  (Barnsley, West and Penistone)</b> 
 (Lab): Whilst it is enormously important to support good governance in developing countries, along with the building of integrity structures, does my right hon. Friend agree that it is time that the rich countries in the   developed world stopped poaching medial staff from the developing world? Does he further agree with 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>29 Jun 2005 : Column 1283</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>the chairman of the British Medical Association that the G8 ought to support a commitment to ensuring that the developing world is self-sufficient in medical staff?
</p>





<p><a name="st_18"><a name="50629-01_spnew16"><b> Hilary Benn: </b> 
 This is a very important issue, and my hon. Friend will be aware of the code of practice that the Department of Health has adopted, which has recently been extended, by agreement, to the private recruitment agencies. It is leading the world in saying that we will not recruit directly from developing countries, but we must recognise that the second step that we can take is to support developing countries in trying to address the causes of doctors, nurses and others leaving those countries and taking their skills elsewhere. As the House will know, those causes are principally poor pay, poor working conditions, and lack of opportunity for career and professional development. So what will really make a difference in the long term is the aid that we give to support developing countries in building their health services, paying their doctors and nurses more, and providing better working conditions, housing and the drugs with which to work.
</p>





<p><a name="st_19"><a name="50629-01_spnew17"><b> Mr. Jeffrey M. Donaldson  (Lagan Valley)</b> 
 (DUP): I recently attended a presentation in Northern Ireland on the report of the Commission for Africa. Some of the non-governmental organisations represented at that meeting expressed concern about the failure of international Governments to address the issue of education, even though targets have been set. Last year, I, like many other Members, visited schools to promote the objectives that the international community has set in order to improve education in developing countries. Can the Minister give us an update on what our Government are doing to ensure that education is a priority in the effort to improve governance in the continent of Africa, and in other developing parts of the world?
</p>





<p><a name="st_20"><a name="50629-01_spnew18"><b> Hilary Benn: </b> 
 The first thing that we are doing over the next three years is investing, bilaterally and through our contributions to multilateral development agencies, &#163;1.4 billion in education. We are seeing some progress, including in Kenya, which has abolished school fees in the past couple of years. Kenya now has a million more children in school, and we helped to pay for that through our increased aid, with the support of other donors. That shows that such countries do want to make progress in tackling the obstacles that prevent children from attending school. But in Africa, more than 40 million children are not where they ought to be today&#151;in a school classroom with a teacher and a desk. That makes the discussion in the run-up to the G8 and the increased aid to which Europe is now committed so important. It is a way in which&#151;along with debt relief&#151;we can provide very practical assistance, so that finance and education Ministers can be confident that they have the money they need to employ the teachers, build the classrooms and buy the textbooks, thereby getting those remaining children into school.

<p><a name="st_21"><a name="50629-01_spnew19"><b> Mr. Piara S. Khabra  (Ealing, Southall)</b> 
 (Lab): Can the Secretary of State explain a little more about the criteria for good governance, and can he name a few of the countries to which he will apply those criteria?
</p>





<p><a name="st_22"><a name="50629-01_spnew20"><b> Hilary Benn: </b> 
 The criteria are, first, that the money that we give in aid should go towards poverty reduction; 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>29 Jun 2005 : Column 1284</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>secondly, that human rights and international obligations are upheld; and thirdly, that there is strong financial management and action on corruption. We write such conditions into our aid agreements. We have already discussed Ethiopia, and I have decided to hold back some of the budget support in respect of Uganda and Sierra Leone, because progress there has not been sufficiently great. We are also working in countries such as Nigeria, Malawi, Sierra Leone and Zambia to provide practical support for the anti-corruption commissions, because tacking corruption is fundamental to good governance.
</p>





<p><a name="st_23"><a name="50629-01_spnew21"><b> Mr. Andrew Mitchell  (Sutton Coldfield)</b> 
 (Con): Does the Secretary of State accept that while everyone at Live8 in Edinburgh on Saturday and around the country will be wishing the British agenda every success at the G8 summit in Gleneagles, hard-working British taxpayers will insist that extra money for aid be spent precisely in the way intended, rather than being siphoned off&#151;as has happened all too often in the past&#151;into the Swiss bank accounts of corrupt African leaders?
</p>





<p><a name="st_24"><a name="50629-01_spnew22"><b> Hilary Benn: </b> 
 I do indeed accept that British taxpayers and those attending the concert will want to be reassured on that issue. As the hon. Gentleman knows, Britain has, in truth, a pretty good record in this regard. We take decisions on the way in which we give our aid according to our assessment of the circumstances, and we are very vigorous in monitoring how that money is used. The hon. Gentleman will also recognise that there has to be a strong lead from the developing countries themselves. That is why I welcome the steps that Nigeria, for example&#151;a country that has suffered grievously from corruption in the past&#151;is now taking to bring those who are acting corruptly to book, and to reform the running of public finances.
</p>





<p><a name="st_25"><a name="50629-01_spnew23"><b> Mr. Mitchell: </b> 
 We all strongly agree with that. If we are to build on the good governance provisions first set up under the last Conservative Government by Chris Patten and Lynda Chalker, will the Secretary of State consider additional structural ways of promoting the audit, accountability and, above all, the transparency of aid spending so that taxpayers around the world, as well as poor people in Africa, can be reassured that aid funds are being well spent?
</p>





<p><a name="st_26"><a name="50629-01_spnew24"><b> Hilary Benn: </b> 
 I agree: there is an obligation on all of us to be able to demonstrate to our constituencies and our own Parliaments, as we do in the UK, how our aid money is used. I am committed to transparency, but I am also committed to it on the part of our partners. That is why the UK launched the extractive industries transparency initiative, which is all about encouraging oil and mineral extracting companies to be open about the payments they make to developing country Governments, and encouraging those Governments subsequently to be open about the money that they receive. With that openness comes a better functioning democracy, because it means that people in developing countries can ask their Governments what they have done with the money.

<br>&nbsp;<br>from some of the most vulnerable people in the third world? If they really believe what they are telling us, perhaps they should appear in front of the conference centre housing the G8 conference with placards saying, &quot;Make Poverty Permanent&quot;!
</p>





<p><a name="st_28"><a name="50629-01_spnew26"><b> Hilary Benn: </b> 
 I would say to my hon. Friend that we all want to make poverty reduction permanent. I believe that good governance is fundamental to making progress in reducing poverty. There is no question about that whatever, and we should all be in favour of transparency and openness about the way in which aid money is used. We are giving increased development assistance because we want to help developing countries, but progress will sometimes be fitful. In the end, we have to make a judgment about whether a country is moving in the right direction. That, in the end, should be the fundamental judgment that determines the aid that we give, and I hope that the Opposition will support that approach.

<p><a name="st_29"><a name="50629-01_spnew27"><b> Andrew George  (St. Ives)</b> 
 (LD): While hectoring others on governance, will the Secretary of State reassure the House that Britain will itself sign up and will encourage other G8 nations to sign up to the United Nations convention against corruption? Will he also assure us that the Government&#039;s practices on arms sales will ensure that&#151;in future, unlike at present&#151;we do not provide arms to regimes in developing countries that are persistently abusing human rights?
</p>





<p><a name="st_30"><a name="50629-01_spnew28"><b> Hilary Benn: </b> 
 On arms sales, the hon. Gentleman will be aware that the Export Control Act 2002 provides a very strong framework, under which we take decisions based on the purpose for which the weapons will be used. If they are to be used for conflict or internal repression, we refuse licences. On the UN convention, we are committed to ratifying it; we have tightened up our money laundering legislation; and we have given the UK courts jurisdiction over UK nationals who engage in bribery overseas. The Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 will allow for the speedier freezing of assets and we are now putting in place better arrangements to help developing countries to repatriate money that has been stolen from them. All those are indications of our commitment to act to tackle corruption.

What we are trying to do is to make them honest while respecting their right to independence. Does my right hon. Friend agree?
</p>





<p><a name="st_32"><a name="50629-01_spnew30"><b> Hilary Benn: </b> 
 Yes, I do. When it comes to economic policy conditionality, the new policy document which I published in March makes it very clear that it is inappropriate for us to enforce particular policy choices. However, when it comes to human rights and good governance, I believe that it is right and proper&#151;to ensure that our money is used for the proper purposes&#151;to attach appropriate conditions. In the end, it is about getting the balance right and finding the right type of conditionality.

</p>


<p><a name="st_33"><a name="50629-02_spmin0"><b>The Secretary of State for International Development  (Hilary Benn): </b> 
 The humanitarian situation in Darfur remains one of grave concern. Just under 2 million people have been displaced from their homes, and 2.7 million need humanitarian assistance. The international effort has grown over the past year, and malnutrition in the camps has fallen below emergency levels, from over 30 per cent. a year ago to between 5 and 10 per cent. now. However, the situation could deteriorate during the forthcoming hungry season, when up to 3.5 million people will require food.
</p>





<p><a name="st_34"><a name="50629-02_spnew0"><b> Lynne Featherstone: </b> 
 Do the Government recognise that there is now a need for peace enforcement action by the UN Security Council to provide for a substantive increase in the African Union presence in Darfur, and a stronger mandate? Without that, the situation there is so unstable and insecure that hundreds of thousands of refugees and internally displaced people will not feel safe, and are unlikely to return.
</p>





<p><a name="st_35"><a name="50629-02_spnew1"><b> Hilary Benn: </b> 
 The hon. Lady is absolutely right about the importance of civilian protection. I was in Darfur two weeks ago, and given what I saw and what people told me, that is the principal priority. She refers to the mandate, and I went to Darfur with an open mind about that. However, everyone to whom I spoke said that the AU was doing an outstanding job in providing civilian protection in those places where it is based. That is why Britain is providing strong support for the expansion of the AU force. Currently, it has 2,700 troops on the ground, but that number will increase to 7,500. When I was there, I announced an increase in our support. Britain will now provide &#163;19 million to enable those forces to deploy and airlift extra vehicles and logistic support. The most important thing is to get more AU troops there. The people in the camps told me that they feel safest when the AU is close by.

 I very much welcome what my hon. Friend&#039;s constituent is doing to contribute to Sudan&#039;s development. Before I visited Darfur, I went to Rumbek in southern Sudan, where one child in four dies before the age of five, and three quarters of adults cannot read. The need for development in southern Sudan is therefore enormous. There is peace there now and refugees are beginning to return. That is why we are increasing our development assistance, to provide the basics to support the Government there in getting children into school and providing health care.

We are also encouraged by the decision of the International Criminal Court to investigate war crimes suspects.

By doing that, the world has sent the very clear message that those responsible for the atrocities will not be able to escape.

 I am happy to say to my hon. Friend that we will indeed do that. There is a real problem of women in particular being attacked when they move outside the camps. It is highly regrettable that the response from the Government of Sudan was to arrest two people from M&#233;decins sans Fronti&#232;res who had published a report describing the women&#039;s experiences, instead of arresting the people responsible for the rape. The two people have now been released as a result of representations that I and others in the international community have made, but that demonstrates how far we have to go to provide effective protection to those who are now sheltering in the camps.

 Does the Prime Minister still regard Sir Richard Dearlove as having been a reliable source of information on Iraq?

 As I am sure the hon. Gentleman knows, that memo and other documents of the time were covered by the Butler review.

Gentleman&#039;s view, when I stood next to the new Prime Minister of Iraq, who had five of his relatives assassinated by Saddam, and realised that he was in power because of the democratic votes of 8 million Iraqis, I was glad that we took the action that we did and ensured that Iraq was no longer governed by a dictatorship but by a democracy.

<p><a name="st_47"><a name="50629-02_spmin3"><b>The Prime Minister:</b> 
 It is important that they receive their compensation properly. That was one of the changes that this Government introduced when we came to office. Tens of thousands of miners had suffered as a result of having worked in the mines and, thanks to this Government, they received the compensation to which they were entitled. Of course, that compensation should go only to those who are entitled to get it, but billions of pounds has been paid out to people who desperately needed our help in some of our poorest constituencies.

<a name="stpa_2">In other words, they do not have the money to hire the expertise they need to fight their corner at the talks.

<p>
<a name="50629-02_para1">
<a name="stpa_3">Yesterday I wrote to the Prime Minister giving him notice that I would raise today our proposal for an advocacy fund that would enable developing countries to pay for the expertise they need. Will he consider that proposal in advance of the G8 summit next week?
</p>





<p><a name="st_49"><a name="50629-02_spmin4"><b>The Prime Minister:</b> 
 I thank the right hon. and learned Gentleman for advance notice of that question. The advocacy fund is something that he has raised before and I shall give him my answer to it. He is right to say that part of the problem of developing countries is that they do not have the capacity to argue their case on trade. Nor do they have the capacity within their Governments to make the best use of any opening up of the markets that the G8 and other forums may agree. That is one of the reasons why we have provided over the past few years some &#163;200 million to countries specifically for building capacity in respect of trade. The European Union also provides several hundred million pounds for that task.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50629-02_para2">
<a name="stpa_4">The advice that I have is that the trouble with the advocacy fund that the right hon. and learned Gentleman suggests is that countries would prefer to receive the aid in the way in which it is given to them at the moment. We have not received any representations from them for such a fund. Obviously, I will continue to look at the proposal closely, as is proper since he has asked me to do so, but the best advice that I have at the moment is that it is better to proceed as we are now.
</p>





<p><a name="st_50"><a name="50629-02_spnew12"><b> Mr. Howard: </b> 
 Of course it is important that developing countries get help to build their own capacity, but the UN Task Force on Trade has said that there is a need for resources to be provided for the specific purpose that I have just identified. The Hong Kong talks are, after all, just months away and it is vital that developing countries should not be disadvantaged in those talks. Is it not the case that without the resources that an advocacy fund would provide, those countries risk going into those talks with one hand tied behind their back? Surely we need to take action now, and is not the setting up of an advocacy fund precisely the kind of action that would deal with that problem?
</p>





<p><a name="st_51"><a name="50629-02_spmin5"><b>The Prime Minister:</b> 
 We must distinguish between the question of a separate fund, and the need to give those countries help as well as make the case on trade and enable them to gear themselves up for the opening up of markets. On the latter point we are in total agreement, and that is why we have been providing such help. For example, I understand that there was a trade ministerial meeting in Zambia a short time ago in which, together with the Swedes and the Canadians, we specifically gave help in order for developing countries to have the resource necessary to put their case effectively. The question is not whether we should give that help; the question is, is it best to establish a separate fund or are we best offering help as we do now, on the basis of our own bilateral links with individual countries and through the European Union? All I am saying is that judging from the representations that we have received, we are best to maintain our current arrangements, without setting up a separate fund. Indeed, I think the developing countries worry that such a fund would set bureaucratic hurdles in their way.

</p>





<p><a name="st_52"><a name="50629-02_spnew13"><b> Mr. Howard: </b> 
 I am sorry that the Prime Minister continues to reject a proposal that, for a tiny fraction of the cost of the aid programmes that he is rightly championing, could make a real difference to the ability of developing countries to lift themselves out of poverty through fairer trade. But that, of course, is not the only issue that will be before the G8 next week.

<a name="50629-02_para4">
<a name="stpa_6">On Monday, the Minister for Trade said that we should not allow Zimbabwe to get in the way of helping other countries of the G8. But is it not clear that the two go hand in hand, and that tackling head-on the issue of Zimbabwe would send the clearest possible signal that the west will not turn a blind eye to injustice and repression, there or anywhere else? So when President Mbeki comes to the G8 next week, will the Prime Minister undertake to leave him in no doubt of what the world expects of him in terms of action to help the suffering people of Zimbabwe?

 I can assure the right hon. and learned Gentleman that I will certainly do that, as I have done constantly, and of course the G8 Foreign Ministers&#039; meeting specifically referred to the desperate situation in Zimbabwe and the appalling cases of torture and abuse of human rights that occur there daily. We will continue to exert all the pressure that we can, but I think he would accept, as we must accept, that in the end the best pressure will come from those countries surrounding Zimbabwe. That is why he is right to say that we must ensure that African countries realise that they have a great responsibility to sort this out themselves.

<a name="stpa_7">I would like to make another point on this. We are going to the G8 to make the case for helping poverty in Africa. There is no doubt at all that it is harder to make that case while abuses of governance and corruption occur in African countries. I do not believe that what is happening in Zimbabwe should prevent us from still taking action on poverty in Africa; I think that would be wrong, but it is also right to say that we should draw attention not just to the abuses in Zimbabwe but to the urgent necessity to change what is happening in that country, for the benefit of its own citizens.

I know that he will have meetings with Ministers, and I am happy to see him myself about that and to ensure that we put in place every assistance that we possibly can. The situation is particularly tragic since it comes at a time when, yet again, this country has been designated No. 1 for foreign direct investment in the European Union&#151;so we are drawing in jobs. Unfortunately, however, for the reasons to which he rightly draws attention, the changing way that the market is working means that it is very hard for people to remain secure in their jobs, even with excellent companies, such as Sony. However, we will certainly do everything that we can to help people in that situation.

We have a strong technical bid and the most powerful part of it is the legacy that it would leave, not only for London but for sport in this country and for the spirit of the Olympic movement.

 I thank my hon. Friend for his kind words about our achievements since 1997, but no one is coerced&#151;<i>[Interruption.]</i> That is the case because there is a ballot for these transfers. Tenants benefit because housing associations are able to secure more investment than is usually available from the local council or Government grant. Actually, &#163;6.5 billion has been levered in from the private sector through the stock transfer and the 61 schemes announced last week should deliver a further &#163;3 billion of investment. We should celebrate the fact that by 2010, 2 million homes will have been brought up to the decent homes standard. However, that cannot be done simply through the old local authority route. There must be a mix of provision and, as I say, stock transfers occur only when tenants have actually voted for them&#151;they take the final decision.

 On a point of order, Mr. Speaker. We all accept that the difficult circumstances of terrorism that we now face lead to the Prime Minister requiring increased security: the happy days when Prime Ministers such as Sir John Major could occasionally walk from Downing street to the House of Commons have gone. However, the level of security now surrounding the Prime Minister&#039;s entourage making the journey here is now causing real inconvenience to the general public, as all access roads to Parliament square are closed for many minutes. Perhaps more relevant to you, Mr. Speaker, that means that Members of Parliament are also inhibited from making the journey to the House of Commons. Today, it was clear that the police officer who tried to stop me accessing the House had no idea of the Sessional Order that we passed on 23 November, as we do at the start of every Parliament, and that he did not intend to allow me to pass. Can you examine this problem as a matter of some urgency, Mr. Speaker? I believe that other hon. Members were detained in their cars and were unable to reach the House.

<p><a name="st_1"><a name="50629-03_spnew4"><b> Mr. Speaker: </b>

 Further to that point of order, Mr. Speaker. I do not know whether you are aware that Parliament square is now sealed off for 15 or 20 minutes before the Prime Minister is due to arrive here and that no traffic can get in or out of the square during that time. I was in a car in the square and was prevented from reaching Parliament. Although one is sympathetic in view of the security problems, the present arrangements are reminiscent of those that were enjoyed by members of the Politburo in the former Soviet Union.

That this House notes with concern the crisis in NHS dentistry, together with problems in accessing other primary care services; recognises that many dentists chose to undertake more private practice as a consequence of the new contract introduced under the Conservatives in 1990 and the subsequent reduction in dentists&#039; fees in 1992; notes that the Conservative government closed two dental schools; further notes that the number of adults registered with an NHS dentist fell by five million between 1994 and 1998; recalls the Prime Minister&#039;s pledge in 1999 that &#039;everyone within the next two years will be able once again to see an NHS dentist just by phoning NHS Direct&#039;, but notes that less than half the adult population is now registered with an NHS dentist; and calls on the Government to work with the dentistry profession to ensure that the new contract delivers more dentists spending more time working in the NHS.

I remind the House that the rot set in&#151;if I can use that phrase&#151;some years ago. It is widely accepted that the problem started in the early 1990s, when dentistry fees and contracts were changed. The change was well intentioned&#151;instead of dentists simply receiving a set amount for every filling or treatment, there was a per patient element, which undermined the inducement to do more work just for the sake of it. The thinking was right, but the implementation failed, because budgets spiralled. Only a couple of years later, dentists&#039; fees were cut and, as a result, they started to leave the NHS. The National Audit Office says that

<p>
<a name="50629-04_para3">
<a name="stpa_3">The situation was probably not helped in 1992 by the previous Government&#039;s decision to close two dental schools. The Conservatives sometimes demand more NHS dentistry and more places in dental schools. I do not know whether dental treatment generates amnesia, but they display plenty of it on the subject. In 1997, a bright, shiny, new Government came to power, with all sorts of new ideas. Immediately, they introduced an Act of Parliament&#151;if in doubt, legislate. The National Health Service (Primary Care) Act 1997 created personal dental services&#151;so called, because no person can access them&#151;with the aim of trying to tackle the legacy of a decline in NHS dentistry. Two years later, we were given something that everyone fears&#151;a promise from the Prime Minister, who said in 1999 that
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_2">&quot;everyone within the next two years will be able . . . to see an NHS dentist just by phoning NHS direct&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="50629-04_para4">
<a name="stpa_4">It is not obvious how one could see a dentist by phoning NHS Direct, but we were promised that everyone would be able to do so two years after 2001. Six years later, however, NHS dental registrations are at low levels, and there is little sign of an upturn.

<p><a name="st_13"><a name="50629-04_spnew6"><b> Ms Thornberry: </b> 
 Does the hon. Gentleman agree with the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam (Mr. Burstow) that there is not a magic solution to fix NHS dentistry?

Are we likely to hear, for example, anything about the introduction of

 Indeed. Because of that, the Government on day 1 in 1997 should have been tackling those problems. For example, it takes five or six years to train a dentist, so if they had got on with it on day 1, we would not now have a shortage of dentists, but only now are they talking about expanding places for dentists. There are no quick fixes&#151;I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Sutton and Cheam (Mr. Burstow), who researched the matter thoroughly. It takes time to train dentists, which is why the Government&#039;s lack of effective action over eight years is all the more culpable.

It was postponed, first until October, then until next April. One of the reasons for that was the dental profession&#039;s lack of trust of the Government. The failure to negotiate a new dental contract was described by a dentist to whom I spoke recently as the best recruiting sergeant for Denplan that he has ever come across.

 My hon. Friend is making an incisive speech. Many members of the dental profession have, as he says, reluctantly moved out of the NHS, not because of the financial considerations, but because they are not able to provide the professional service to their patients that they believe they should be providing. That is why they have sought an alternative way of providing a service to their patients.

 My hon. Friend is right. Many dentists who went into dentistry to provide a quality service are finding that they cannot do so within the constraints of the existing NHS arrangements.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50629-05_para0">
<a name="stpa_8">What is the root problem? Clearly, the fact that there are not enough dentists. It is not a complex matter. The Government&#039;s work force review stated that there were 2,000 dentists short, but that that number would rise to 5,000 over the next few years. Given that it takes about six years to train a dentist, how will we bridge that gap? The work force review did not take account of the impact of the new contracts, which could make matters worse. How many dentists short do the Government believe that we are? What is the grand plan?
</p>

<p>
<a name="50629-05_para1">
<a name="stpa_9">The Government said that they wanted 1,000 more dentists by October, but Lord Warner suggested in another place that they were only half way there, yet we are only a few months away. Will the Government hit that target of 1,000 new dentists? They speak of more training places, which are clearly welcome, but the number of people who teach dentists is falling. I hope that the Minister will tell us what she is doing to ensure that the clinical experts who teach the next generation of dentists are there. Like many parts of the NHS, dental schools are in financial deficit. If they have to cut corners and spend less clinical time with new dentists, can we be confident that dentists will be as well trained as they need to be?

Surely anyone who goes to one because there is nowhere else to go will think so, but is this as good as seeing a dentist regularly? A dentist I spoke to recently told me that, typically, it cost &#163;50 to deal with one NHS patient, while the cost at one of these dental access centres is &#163;160 per patient. So three regular NHS patients could be treated at a surgery for the price of treating one at an access centre. This is a very expensive sticking plaster solution to the underlying problem.

<a name="stpa_24">One of the unspoken issues today has been charging for dental treatment. Charging is a central feature of NHS dentistry, unlike in most areas of the NHS, in that people are already paying very large sums of money for their treatment. The Government commissioned a review into charging, which was produced in March 2004. They are still thinking about it. They have had a year, and an election, since then, but they are still not telling us their conclusions. They have promised us a response shortly, and I hope that they will publish not only their response but the review itself.

<a name="stpa_25">The danger is that the Government will fill the gap with charges. In other words, they could say, &quot;We&#039;ve put some money into the NHS. It&#039;s not enough. Dentists are going to get less income because they are doing fewer of the unnecessary treatments that they used to be paid for. If their income falls, where is the filling going to come from? The answer is that it is going to come from charges.&quot; That is the danger. Will the Minister tell us whether that is the Government&#039;s strategy? Charges are not the answer to this problem. We are keen on prevention rather than cure, but charging people the earth will simply put them off.

<p><a name="st_49"><a name="50629-06_spnew7"><b> Steve Webb: </b> 
 My judgment is that the concept of the national health service that we apply elsewhere should also be the starting point for NHS dentistry. In other words, we need to get to the idea that people have a basic entitlement to it. For too many people, that entitlement exists in theory but not in practice, with only half of all adults being registered with an NHS dentist. At the moment, the right to an NHS dentist is like the right to eat at the Ritz; we all have such a right in theory, but in practice we cannot exercise it. If that entitlement were to cover the whole breadth of treatments&#151;including, for example, cosmetic dentistry&#151;it could result in a very expensive commitment, but there must be a basic right to core NHS dental services. That must be the principle.

To find out the level of NHS dental coverage there, I typed &quot;Cheadle&quot; into the national health service website, as any resident might do. It came up with the names of 18 NHS dentists, which I thought was great. The first one, however, was not accepting any new NHS patients for treatment, while the second was offering an emergency dental service only, and accepting no new NHS patients for treatment. Nor was the third accepting any new NHS patients for treatment, and that was the case all the way through to the 18th on the list. So not one of the dentists that the Department&#039;s own website came up with was taking NHS patients. How can it be, therefore, that according to the Government amendment, all patients are getting better dental care under this Government?

A certain number of people have always not registered and the task is to ensure that they do so in future. That must be combined with water fluoridation policies, because in areas where water is fluoridated, the number of children without tooth decay has risen by 15 per cent. As right hon. and hon. Members know, the Water Act 2003 allows fluoridation of the remaining water supply where there is local support, which will further improve the oral health of the nation.

 Does my hon. Friend agree that local partnerships are crucial in delivering services? The quality of the local PCT is critical. In Shropshire, Mike Prendergast has done a tremendous job in developing a dental action plan, and new practices are opening up on the sites of regeneration projects. One very large new dental practice is opening in Telford in the next few months, with five of six new dental chairs providing thousands of new places for NHS patients. Can she therefore confirm that partnerships are important, and that we need to be positive about encouraging people to register? Some of the stories of doom and gloom are problematic.

 My hon. Friend is right. When I visited his constituency, it was encouraging to see the action that the primary care trust was taking, in partnership with other agencies. There is no doubt that, for example, local authorities can be helpful in examining local action plans with primary care trusts to see what they can do, even in planning terms, to assist with registration. As he said, thousands of new places are coming on stream in his area, with encouragement from him. It makes a difference locally to know that Members of Parliament are working with primary care trusts.

As he said, the contract that they introduced was extremely unpopular with the dental profession. It gave dentists incentives to undertake invasive treatment rather than adopting a preventive approach&#151;the drill-and-fill treadmill, as it is known.

Was that not the same menu without prices&#151;the same list of uncosted commitments&#151;with which the hon.

 My hon. Friend speaks of the drift to the private sector. I believe that there is more to it than that. In my area, Dumfries and Galloway NHS trust has employed salaried dentists. When they arrive in local communities, local NHS dentists move to the private sector. That development involves economics and the marketplace, and a strong dislike of salaried dentists who arrive on the scene to treat NHS patients only. The local dentists do not like the competition.

A problem often cited by Members is that, if an NHS dentist, under the current contract, decides to leave the NHS, the local PCT has no funds to fill the gap, so to speak. The money returns to the centre and is redistributed if another NHS dentist comes in. That is not a satisfactory arrangement.

 NHS dentists need give no notice at all to PCTs before they go private. The PCT in my constituency, for example&#151;it is responsible for NHS care in my area&#151;was given no notice that the dental practice in Longton intended to go private and, as a result, had no time to prepare an alternative strategy. Surely there should be some mechanism that forces NHS dentists to give at least a minimum period of notice if they are going into the private sector, in order to allow PCTs to plan properly and to bring in alternative dentists.
</p>





<p><a name="st_76"><a name="50629-08_spnew11"><b> Ms Winterton: </b> 
 I agree and, in fact, such dentists should give approximately three months&#039; notice to the PCT, but in practice some avoid doing so, which makes it very difficult for the PCT to plan, as my hon. Friend says. The new contract and the new way of commissioning will ease that problem. Dental leads in PCTs have been discussing with dentists their commitment to the NHS and their future plans. That has eased the situation because, as a result, they have been able to secure more notice from dentists who are thinking of leaving.

 The Minister will have noted the points made earlier about the spectrum of NHS dentistry available for dentists to offer their patients. Are there any plans to broaden that spectrum, or are we going to stay with the core?
</p>





<p><a name="st_94"><a name="50629-10_spnew3"><b> Ms Winterton: </b> 
 I am sorry, I did not catch all that question.
</p>





<p><a name="st_95"><a name="50629-10_spnew4"><b> Sir Paul Beresford: </b> 
 Earlier, there was a suggestion that one of the difficulties faced by dentists was that the broad spectrum of equipment, services, treatment and materials was not all available on the NHS. Is what the NHS offers going to be broadened or will the NHS stick to offering only a core service?
</p>





<p><a name="st_96"><a name="50629-10_spnew5"><b> Ms Winterton: </b> 
 The NHS will continue to offer what is considered clinically necessary. The hon. Gentleman rightly distinguishes between the core service and some of the cosmetic treatments that are available, such as white fillings, teeth whitening and so on. We firmly believe that the NHS should continue to provide what is clinically necessary for good oral health, but it will not extend into cosmetic surgery, as that is for individuals to decide. Those services are available in the private sector, but we do not believe that they are suitable for NHS provision.
</p>





<p><a name="st_97"><a name="50629-10_spnew6"><b> Chris Huhne: </b> 
 Earlier, I asked for a reassurance that the reforms would take account of the problems faced in different regions of the country, especially in respect of costs. I am told that the costs of dental provision are substantially higher in some parts of the country than in others. Will the Minister give the House the benefit of her analysis of those differences? Will they be taken into account in the reforms, and especially in the new contract? In my constituency, registration for NHS dentistry is very poor. The local newspaper found that not one dentist was prepared to take on any new NHS patients.
</p>





<p><a name="st_98"><a name="50629-10_spnew7"><b> Ms Winterton: </b> 
 The hon. Gentleman needs to remember that, under the new system, commissioning is done at local level. There are always variations: for example, some dentists will be fully committed to the NHS, some will be 50 per cent. committed, while the commitment of some dentists will be lower still. The PDS system has involved negotiations with local PCTs to determine the historic amount paid to NHS dentists in that PCT area. In that sense, therefore, the new system reflects the income that dentists received previously, and we have guaranteed that that amount will continue to be paid for three years. In many cases, however, new ways of working mean that dentists&#039; time can be freed up and that new patients can be taken on as a result.

At that time, Governments of all parties had to base their plans on what the best available evidence suggested. It could not have been predicted that the incidence of dental caries would not improve as had been suggested, nor that the take-up of cosmetic surgery would increase to the point that it has characterised dentistry over the past 30 years.

<a name="50629-11_para4">
<a name="stpa_74">I am concerned about the commodification of health care across the board, both in primary health care and in dental care; I would not want to make a distinction between the two. In recent weeks and months there have been announcements about dental access centres, walk-in centres and megasurgeries. We know about falling dental registration rates. We know about the threat to registration with GPs. We have heard about the 48-hours-in-advance conundrum that faces many practices, which are not permitted, apparently because of their fiscal settlement, to allow patients to book surgery appointments a long way in advance. All these things, and more, mean that there is far less personal one-to-one contact between practitioner and patient than there used to be.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50629-11_para5">
<a name="stpa_75">The unique thing about health care in this country has always been that personal contact, be it in terms of general practice or general dental practice, and nothing in the Government&#039;s actions in the recent past has given me any confidence that they fully appreciate the importance of that personal service&#151;that one to one. Arguably, it is far more important in general medical practice because one is dealing with long-term chronic disease, very often with life-threatening disease, and very often with elderly people who need that contact. I fully accept that very often in general dental practice contact tends to be a little more one-off, but most of our constituents would say that they value an ongoing relationship with an identifiable practitioner, and I fear very much that both in medical care and dental care the Government are moving away from that important model of registration and an ongoing relationship. I hope very much that the Minister will give us some idea in her remarks whether she associates with that and if not, why not, because it seems to me very much that we are indulging in the commodification of health care, in that less personal model, rather than the personal model that is so important for most of our patients.

It is hailed as a major public engagement exercise. Being a bit of a cynic, I am concerned that this might be yet another tick-box exercise. I hope that that is not the case and I very much hope that the Minister will give some thought to the results. Recently we have had the results of referendums in France and the Netherlands in relation to the constitution, and it would appear that the results of those referendums are largely going to be finessed by the EU and by the countries involved. I hope very much that the Minister does not agree with such a model, and that she will truly reflect on the outcome of the consultation exercise, because I know full well that some of the messages that she will receive have to do with the value that people place on personal contact between practitioner and patient.

<a name="stpa_81">But I promised to impart a little bit of the flavour of the situation in Yorkshire. To be very parochial for a minute if the House will allow me, I think that in Selby    and York, my local primary care trust, the commissioning that the Government have brought in is making a difference and is working. That is one thing that has improved in the past seven or eight years. It does give a very local focus. It enables MPs, councillors and others to speak to the decision makers, to get down to the detail of where NHS dentists are, where there are gaps and where improvements could be made.

<a name="50629-12_para2">
<a name="stpa_82">In Selby and York, for example, 15,000 extra places have been approved under personal dental schemes for the next three years. It appears that they will be delivered within the next year, and I understand that we will be up to about 56 per cent. coverage in Selby and York. We want to get a little higher than that, but that will not be bad in comparison with a lot of other areas in the country.

<a name="50629-12_para3">
<a name="stpa_83">One dentist, Mr. Kelsey, made it on to the front page of the <i>Yorkshire Post.</i> The Minister and I discussed his case over tea and biscuits for no less than 45 minutes, and I bring her good news. He wants to retire. He could not find someone to buy his practice. He tells me that he is committed to that practice transferring to the NHS. A buyer has now been found, with two dentists in that practice, and the local PCT will propose a personal dental scheme to the Department that, I hope, will be approved, so that the 5,000 places that would have been lost in Selby can be replaced, possibly on a like-for-like basis.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50629-12_para4">
<a name="stpa_84">If I have one criticism of some PCTs, it is that the local delivery of dentistry is important. It is not acceptable to have to take long journeys, perhaps on two or three buses, to get to a dentist. In rural areas, it is important that NHS dentistry is available in market towns, such as Selby, Sherburn and Tadcaster in my area.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50629-12_para5">
<a name="stpa_85">I want to make two suggestions for improving the situation in Yorkshire. We have heard a lot about queues forming outside dentists&#039; surgeries when they open up for additional NHS places. In some areas, PCTs have introduced waiting lists&#151;Doncaster may be one of them, but there are certainly other examples throughout the country&#151;whereby people who want an NHS dentist go on to a waiting list. Instead of having to queue or ring up every two or three weeks as the situation changes, those people will be informed&#151;in a short period, we hope&#151;when extra NHS places become available in the locality. I urge my own PCT in Selby and York to consider that development, which makes the system much more civilised and efficient. It allows a certain degree of preference to be given to local people to gain access to dentists in their own areas.

I remind the House that, despite the problems of the past few years, NHS dentists earn, on average, &#163;75,000 or &#163;76,000&#151;considerably more than MPs&#151;and most of them also do private work. We are talking about relatively highly paid people, many of whom are very much committed to the NHS, but it takes two to tango in negotiations, and there is a high expectation among Labour Back Benchers that, if the Minister puts a reasonable offer to dentists, as I am sure she will, they should respond in kind. That will involve changes in working practices.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50629-12_para8">
<a name="stpa_88">If we look back over the past eight years, another thing that has become apparent, for whatever reason, is drill-and-fill&#151;I think that was the phrase mentioned by the Minister. Numerous reports, dating back to one in 2000 in the NHS prepared by Aubrey Sheiham, professor of public health at University college London, refer to practices such as dentists
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_15">&quot;inflicting &#163;200 million of extra scaling, X-rays and fillings on patients to boost earnings&quot;,</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="50629-12_para9">
<a name="stpa_89">and an economic model encouraged them to do so. The report states:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_16">&quot;Studies show that dentists replace fillings far more than necessary, and that if they suffer a drop in income, they will replace their patients&#039; fillings more frequently.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="50629-12_para10">
<a name="stpa_90">There were economic incentives for dentists to adopt such an approach, but that will not happen under the new contract, and nor should it. Perhaps some patients will be seen less frequently. If there is less dental need for them to be seen every six months, perhaps a check-up every year or so will be sufficient, and a lot of dentists who are committed to the NHS realise that.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50629-12_para11">
<a name="stpa_91">It is interesting that perhaps one of the better puns that has been coined in this respect appeared in the <i>Yorkshire Post</i> headline &quot;Dentists set to bare their teeth&quot;. The <i>Yorkshire Post</i> has been running quite an effective campaign called stop the rot&#151;a rather more hackneyed phrase&#151;but nevertheless it has been pointing out some of the things that hon. Members on both sides of the House have mentioned today: the expansion of dental places, the need for a new contract and so on.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50629-12_para12">
<a name="stpa_92">A few weeks ago, the front page of that paper commented on an attempt by the leadership of the British Dental Association to get its members to go on strike for a day and not to do routine NHS treatment. Rather less prominently, it reported the following day that that attempt had been rejected by two to one. The dentists themselves decided that a much better approach would be to lobby Members of Parliament, and they will do so in July.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50629-12_para13">
<a name="stpa_93">The <i>Yorkshire Post</i> and, indeed, most people in Yorkshire would agree that we want value for money, that it is not a question of writing a blank cheque to dentists, as I am sure the hon. Member for Northavon would agree, and that those negotiations depend on a responsible attitude on both sides. Where that responsible attitude is not shown&#151;I hope that that will

</p>

<p>
<a name="50629-12_para14">
<a name="stpa_94">Many dentists from overseas are coming in on that model and are directly salaried by the PCT. If that is what is takes to fill the gaps in NHS provision, that approach will receive a great deal of support among Labour Members. Dentists cannot have the NHS over a barrel. They have earned reasonable amounts of money from the NHS in previous years, and I think that they will be offered that in the future. Many of them are committed to the values of the NHS. However, if it is a question of taking on local dentists in certain areas and ensuring that NHS dental provision is maintained and expanded, that is what Ministers must do.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50629-12_para15">
<a name="stpa_95">Incidentally, we have an almost all-female team in the Department of Health, with a solitary male Minister. We have a number of strong female Ministers and I am sure that my hon. Friend the Member for Doncaster, Central (Ms Rosie Winterton) will, if necessary, show a good deal of Yorkshire grit and determination in those negotiations and ensure that, by the next election, we have a very good story to tell on NHS dentistry.

 As dentists have been gently attacked, it is rather appropriate to get an opportunity to return that gently. I clearly have an interest, although my dentistry aspect is such that my income does not reach anywhere near that suggested by the hon. Member for Selby (Mr. Grogan)&#151;would that it did.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50629-13_para0">
<a name="stpa_96">I want to touch in particular on the point that was raised during the Liberal Democrat presentation&#151;if we can call it that&#151;and I refer to the fact that dentists feel that they are highly trained for five or six years. They have a broad spectrum of facilities that they wish for and a broad spectrum of opportunities to provide a wide range of treatments, but the NHS does not allow them to do that if they keep strictly to the NHS. The key thing&#151;the Minister seems to be moving in this direction and it will be interesting to find out whether it happens&#151;is that the NHS must work in partnership with the dentists providing a mixed service. Using that method, we can attract dentists back into the NHS, as well as providing an opportunity for those who leave the dental schools, move straight into the NHS and suddenly realise that they cannot do much of the work for which they have been trained. We hope that that method will thus prevent them from moving into the private sector, with the consequent loss to the NHS.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50629-13_para1">
<a name="stpa_97">It is vital that we have NHS dentistry. One need only walk into an old people&#039;s home to see a lady with a broken denture to recognise that that is her means of eating and that she has no opportunity of having her denture repaired, particularly in the south and south-east, as she does not have an NHS dentist, and especially not one who would provide dentures or who would come out to provide dentures because she cannot travel to him. What does she do&#151;live through a straw? We must consider those patients.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50629-13_para2">
<a name="stpa_98">There is a crisis, but it is possibly not quite as bad as the Liberal Democrats say, and I do not intend to go through the figures. When I first came to this country, dentistry in Britain was seen by much of the western 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>29 Jun 2005 : Column 1329</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>world as being absolutely appalling and, to a fair degree, the NHS was the cause. The hon. Member for Selby touched on that fact, calling it &quot;drill-and-fill&quot;. The Australians used to call it &quot;bash the gnash&quot;. They used to come here and fill anything and everything. I remember taking on two Australian dentists from Queensland&#151;they will remain nameless&#151;and the figures that they produced at the end of the week for the NHS work that they had done stunned me. I asked them how they had managed it and they said that they got the patients in the chair, filled them with local anaesthetics until they were grey with the stuff, turned up the air rotor and drove round. I saw one or two of their patients and I was absolutely appalled by what I saw. We sacked those dentists, but it took weeks to put right what they had done.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50629-13_para3">
<a name="stpa_99">There have been dramatic changes since them. The first change is the addition of fluoride to the water supply, which must be the cheapest, simplest and most sensible way of dealing with dental decay. That is done in many other western nations such as Australia, New Zealand, Canada and the United States and it has got to come here. Fluoride in toothpaste has also made a dramatic difference. My recently deceased father was a dentist in New Zealand and he said that until fluoride in the toothpaste and in the water supply came along, trying to deal with dental decay was like trying to fill the bath with the plug out. He said that the changes it produced were dramatic. We will see that here&#151;indeed, we are already seeing it to some degree.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50629-13_para4">
<a name="stpa_100">The second issue that changed the system in the NHS was the introduction of patient charges. To a fair degree, that stopped the Australian-type practice that I have just described. I am not being particularly anti-Australian, because dentists of many nationalities, including English ones, engaged in &quot;bash the gnash&quot;. However, when charges were introduced patients started to look at what they were paying for and they used to ask why work was being done again. They did not want the work done again, so they moved to other dentists and a few dentists actually went bankrupt as a result.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50629-13_para5">
<a name="stpa_101">When patients realised that they had to pay, they started to ask whether they could pay for something different&#151;whether they could have white fillings, crowns or whatever was available at the time. I know that dentists complained when the fees were cut, but that made them concentrate on what they were providing and look at whether they could provide a better and fuller service. Some of the bad dentists who I know&#151;again, I mention no names&#151;went bankrupt. The technicians carrying out crown and bridge work and making dentures often commented that the standard of dentistry demanded by patients went up as dentists moved into the private service. The standards of NHS dentistry then went up as well. The technicians were stunned because the change happened so quickly.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50629-13_para6">
<a name="stpa_102">In the past 10 or 15 years, there have been dramatic changes in dental techniques. The changes have made different approaches available to patients, but they have also brought with them enormous costs. We now have new restorative materials, tooth-coloured composites, 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>29 Jun 2005 : Column 1330</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>techniques of bonding, new ceramic to metal crowns and bridges, new all-porcelain crowns and bridges, inlays, inlay overlays, overlays, veneers and bleaching.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50629-13_para7">
<a name="stpa_103">The Minister said that the NHS should not provide bleaching and, in many circumstances, that is right. However, the NHS needs to think again. If a teenager has badly stained teeth&#151;perhaps as a result of tetracycline, which may, by then, have gone&#151;the NHS&#039;s answer is for the dentist to pick up a high-powered drill, scream round and take all the enamel off and put on crowns that will have to be replaced again and again. Bleaching will stop that. Patients will have their own teeth that are properly bleached and looking right, and the process can be topped up every three to five years. This brings me to what I am after&#151;a radical rethink.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50629-13_para8">
<a name="stpa_104">Techniques have changed. We now have the new nickel titanium endodontic root canal instruments, digital x-rays, various hot seal endodontic filling materials&#151;and many dentists use loupes and microscopes as well as new impression materials. We also have new and reliable dental implants, and orthodontics and oral surgery have also leapt ahead. I deliberately ignore those dentists who use Botox.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50629-13_para9">
<a name="stpa_105">Those and many other improvements have meant that the dental treatment available offers the cosmetic approach to dental health care that is wanted by patients. That does not mean that patients are not being looked after, but that they are being looked after differently and that they are choosing, when they can, to pay. Over the past few years, the reactions of patients have been dramatic. It might be basic in some cases as in when they ask for a white filling rather than a black one, but it goes right through to requests in the full American style for a Hollywood smile makeover. The effect of television and magazines on demand over the past few years has been dramatic. Patients have started to get a better understanding of what they want. Sometimes that makes it difficult for the dentist. I remember a 5 ft 2 in lady coming in with a picture of Farrah Fawcett-Majors and asking whether she could have a smile just like that. I suggested to her that she would be more likely to win the Derby if I could manage it. <i>[Interruption.]</i> Sweetness and light.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50629-13_para10">
<a name="stpa_106">The NHS has not kept up with the treatments that are available, and I do not think that it should. That is not its realm. However, I was a little surprised when, I think, the first Labour Secretary of State for Health said something along the lines that the NHS could compete with the private sector. It should not. According to a recent estimate, that would cost about &#163;6 billion. There are better things that we can do with the money. The NHS&#039;s target should be health, although there are variations on that&#151;I referred to bleaching a moment ago.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50629-13_para11">
<a name="stpa_107">The new contract offers an opportunity to look at the issue again. Before the contract is set in stone, I hope that the close discussions with the dental profession will bring some changes. I have spoken about endodontics and root canal treatment, but such work is poorly paid in an item-based payments system. However, it is vital for many patients.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50629-13_para12">
<a name="stpa_108">To give another silly dental example, an elderly patient with a few teeth left may have a tooth that is heavily filled and that has suddenly blown up because there is an abscess underneath it. The patient suffers the

<br>&nbsp;<br>pain that my hon. Friend the Member for Westbury (Dr. Murrison) mentioned, and the dentist has several options. The first is to take the tooth out, and that is quick and cheap, but the patient&#039;s denture will not work anywhere near as well as it did. The other option is root canal treatment, but that is exceptionally difficult for a molar in an elderly patient. It takes one, two, three or possibly four hours and requires loupes, microscopes, nickel titanium reamers and so on. That is just the endodontics but, after that, the tooth then needs to be built up. The recompense for the capital outlay for the equipment&#151;I have not touched on digital x-rays, for example&#151;is pitiful. It should be possible to rethink our approach to try to slant the money towards such preventive treatment as well as towards the prevention involved in teaching children how to look after their teeth better, in improving their diet and in adding fluoride to toothpaste and to the water supply.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50629-13_para13">
<a name="stpa_109">I am not attacking the Minister, but I am ignoring much of what the Liberal party has said in its classic approach of attacking everyone but not coming forward with solutions. We have an opportunity to move forward and my hon. Friend the Member for Westbury has described some of the options. The only part of the Liberal motion that has any credibility is the request for Ministers to discuss the issue with the profession. Let us take this opportunity, but without setting things in stone.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50629-13_para14">
<a name="stpa_110">We must bear in mind two key issues: the fact that the nature of dentistry has changed dramatically, even though we often look at it in a stone-age way; and the fact that dentists must be encouraged to return to the NHS to provide a basic core service, but be allowed to offer private dentistry because patients demand that. I hope that the opportunity is taken.

 It is a great pleasure to follow the hon.

<a name="stpa_111">I certainly welcome the Government&#039;s record levels of investment, and it is perhaps not surprising that those on the Opposition Front Benches did not refer to that. One reason why the Conservatives ran into difficulties on under-investment in so many public services was that by the end of their time in government they were having to spend 45p in every pound of new taxation on the economics of failure, paying for the national debt, which had risen to unsustainable levels, and financing the high level of unemployment. It is largely thanks to the Chancellor of the Exchequer and our stable economy that we are talking about making some progress in dental care, albeit somewhat belatedly from the point of view of many of us.

<a name="50629-14_para2">
<a name="stpa_113">All Members can give examples of the sort that have been given at length today. The problems go back to the early 1990s. Even last year, when I spoke in an Adjournment debate in Westminster Hall on 20 May, I told my hon. Friend the Minister that the problems seemed to be escalating, although we could see the first signs that there might be light at the end of the tunnel in the work that was going on locally, beginning in the primary care trusts and reflected in the work of scrutiny committees from local authorities across Devon and Cornwall. I congratulate those local authorities on their work in bringing people and PCTs together locally, regionally and nationally to consider what we can do to tackle the extremely difficult problems in the far south-west.

<a name="50629-14_para3">
<a name="stpa_114">We seem to have been indulging in fanciful word plays today. One idea from Plymouth city council&#039;s scrutiny committee was that we might bring the tooth fairy to the rescue. I am not sure what the committee had in mind&#151;perhaps it was to bring a ferry full of dentists across the channel to tackle the problem.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50629-14_para4">
<a name="stpa_115">At my Adjournment debate, I spoke about the work going on in the primary care trusts in Plymouth, which was an &quot;options for change&quot; field site, and a year later it is fair to say that steady progress is being made. Of course, it would be nice to report that everything in the garden is rosy&#151;although perhaps I should refrain from using that phrase&#151;but given the context in which we are working, where we have to come to an agreement with people who are independent contractors, the fact that we are making steady progress is something on which the Government should be congratulated.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50629-14_para5">
<a name="stpa_116">Plymouth, in common with other hot spots, is receiving support from the Department&#039;s dental team. I understand from James Short of the PCT, who is doing a splendid job with his team, that the departmental team visited recently and that they are in the process of agreeing a dental plan for the PCT. That will secure the position of people who already have an NHS dentist, and slowly but surely the PCT is negotiating new NHS contracts to treat new patients.

<a name="50629-14_para6">
<a name="stpa_117">The south-west peninsula and Plymouth have both achieved the target of 25 per cent. of dentists on local contracts, with the PCT&#039;s personal dental services contract. Again, I thank my hon. Friend the Minister for the urgent and immediate attention she gives me and the trust whenever we seek it in dealing with the fine details that can stand in the way of concluding an agreement. Dentists have signed up for three years, which has secured services for more NHS patients in Plymouth. That is not yet enough, but we are in the right direction of travel and, although it will be more difficult over the next year to achieve another 25 per cent. of dentists signing up to NHS contracts, if we succeed we shall be travelling at a speed that should make a difference in some of the difficult situations that my constituents experience.

<br>&nbsp;<br>I met a young dentist who had young children and could no longer make a living from his private practice in Bridgnorth, so he was planning to emigrate to Australia&#151;perhaps to indulge in some of the practices to which my hon. Friend referred. That illustrates the problems of providing dentistry, whether private or NHS, in rural areas, which are compounded by the lack of NHS dental facilities. When a new practice opened in Ludlow earlier this year, the local PCT refused to provide details of its telephone number or address for fear of being inundated with applicants for registration, because there were so few available places. That problem in rural areas does not seem to be reflected as much in cities.

 As I shall explain in a moment, the far south-west has some of the most difficult problems in the country. It is far from the situation that the hon.

</p>

<p>
<a name="50629-14_para7">
<a name="stpa_118">It is difficult to achieve change. Plymouth and the south-west remain hot spots. There are difficulties everywhere, but especially at our end of the region: for example, in Devon and Cornwall the ratio of dentists per head of population is 1:3,549; at the other end of our region it is 1:3,081, but in Hampshire the ratio is 1:2,821. There are even more favourable ratios in other parts of the country.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50629-14_para8">
<a name="stpa_119">A study by Rabinowitz showed that significant proportions of clinical graduates tend to stay on at the place where they studied. Given the above ratios, I hope that my hon. Friend and her colleagues in the Department of Health, especially the Secretary of State&#151;she knows this is coming&#151;will give serious consideration to the expression of interest from the Peninsula medical school in establishing a new dental school alongside its successful training for doctors. Apart from the good socio-demographic reasons that I mentioned, there are strong clinical arguments for a dental school in Plymouth. My hon. Friend the Member for Selby (Mr. Grogan) asked where we would get the academics to train new dentists. Many academics are practising dentistry in the south-west and are not currently deploying their teaching skills. They could easily be brought back in if there were a local dental school in Plymouth, thereby avoiding the poaching of academics, which could be a problem as we expand our dental schools.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50629-14_para9">
<a name="stpa_120">The Peninsula medical school makes extensive use of distributive clinical outreach facilities, which enable students to become familiar with current community morbidity patterns, to which the Minister referred in her speech. Plymouth has established a track record in high quality clinical teaching and one of its four centres of excellence in teaching and learning&#151;there are only five such centres in the country&#151;relates specifically to clinical placement learning. For those and a number of other reasons, which I should be happy to outline to my hon. Friends in the Health team, I hope that we shall be shortlisted for further consideration in the near future.

<p><a name="st_126"><a name="50629-14_spnew6"><b> Linda Gilroy: </b> 
 I thank my hon. Friend for that clarification. One of the problems with setting up a new dental school is that it could mean that it takes longer to bring dentists forward into clinic practice. A further advantage of establishing a dental school in Plymouth would be that we already have shorter learning models in the medical school, so by using a four-year learning model we could bring dentists on stream at the same time as if the increase in the number of dentists was achieved by expanding places in existing schools. Indeed, we could bring dentists on sooner in years to come.

<a name="stpa_123">The Minister spoke about some of the issues that must be addressed. I agree with the hon. Member for Mole Valley (Sir Paul Beresford) about fluoridation. Yet another debate is going on in the north-west about whether we should have water fluoridation and I have met one of the officers employed by the regional primary care trust who is involved in that. I believe that fluoridation should happen, so it would help if the Government gave clear advice and instructions so that it is not left up to individual areas and authorities to decide whether such a simple and cost-effective way of improving dental health could be implemented.

 Just for clarification, guidance will be issued in the summer on the processes that should be followed when engaging in public consultation.

<p><a name="st_129"><a name="50629-15_spnew2"><b> Paul Rowen: </b> 
 I welcome that.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50629-15_para1">
<a name="stpa_124">I shall use an example from my constituency to demonstrate the problem with dentist numbers. I have received figures from my primary care trust showing that Rochdale needed 65 registered NHS dentists. We actually have 38, which is why the number of people registered with an NHS dentist has gone down. One of my constituents told me the other week that if people do not regularly attend for check ups, they get dropped off the list, which made my constituent less than happy. We need to change some working practices, such as drill and fill and the requirement for people to attend their dentist every three months if that is not necessary. I welcomed the comments made by the hon. Member for Mole Valley about that matter, of which he has a lot of experience.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50629-15_para2">
<a name="stpa_125">There is also a problem with conditions of service and the contracts under which people work. A report appeared recently in the local paper about three young Rochdale-born dentists who wished to establish a new surgery in the town. They could get a grant if they joined an existing practice, but they could not get a grant to open their own surgery. As a result, the three dentists moved 10 miles down the road and now provide a service in Radcliffe in Bury, rather than in Rochdale, which was where they wanted to work.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50629-15_para3">
<a name="stpa_126">Many dentists have moved out of the NHS because of the contracts under which they have worked. The Minister will face a big problem when trying to convince them that they will benefit both financially and in terms of their working practice by returning to the NHS. They are currently able to provide services at a cost that they would be unable to offer under the NHS. When she enters into the new contract discussions, she will need fresh thinking about what NHS dentists can offer, otherwise dentists who have got used to private practice and different working conditions will not move back to the NHS. We all want a viable NHS dentistry service, so we want the negotiations brought to fruition in a meaningful way, as the motion makes clear. I look forward to the Minister&#039;s statement next week and hope that she will think about what she can do to improve the situation in the north in general, and in Rochdale in particular.

 Thank you, Madam Deputy Speaker, for calling me to speak. I have enjoyed the contributions made by hon. Members on 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>29 Jun 2005 : Column 1336</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>both sides of the House. I pay tribute to the hon. Member for Mole Valley (Sir Paul Beresford), who has sadly left the Chamber, because his speech was extremely eloquent and interesting.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50629-15_para4">
<a name="stpa_127">I am pleased to have the opportunity to describe to the House the successes of NHS dentistry in South Swindon and to inform my hon. Friend the Minister of the challenges that we still face. Happily, those challenges are by no means the mountains that they were in 1997 and I am sure that they will be resolved simply by her plans for NHS dentistry.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50629-15_para5">
<a name="stpa_128">In 1997, one could not get an NHS dentist for love nor money in Swindon, but the Labour Government&#039;s commitment to, and investment in, dentistry and especially their commitment to training more dentists, has dramatically changed the situation. Our financial investment would be stymied without an increase in the number of dentists, but of course it takes time to train people. It is easy to pass judgment when in opposition. If the training programme were circumvented, the Opposition would accuse the Government of endangering people&#039;s dental health. However, because the training programme takes time, Opposition Members complain that the Government are not acting fast enough. They are having their cake and eating it, and they might find that that leads to dental caries, if they are not careful.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50629-15_para6">
<a name="stpa_129">I am pleased to say that Wiltshire is involved in the Government&#039;s initiative to train overseas dentists. Earlier this year, the primary care trust, the community dental service and the personal dental service investigated training overseas dentists who already lived nearby, but could not practise because they did not have the IQE&#151;the international qualifying exam. The training will allow them to gain clinical experience here in the UK while they study for the IQE. Individuals on the programme fund themselves, but all the partners involved are seeking innovative ways to fund the training&#151;for example, by getting those involved to practise as dental nurses first.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50629-15_para7">
<a name="stpa_130">The Government&#039;s initiative to increase the number of places for undergraduates is also being supported in the south-west. Bristol dentistry school is, I am pleased to say, developing outreach teaching. The consultant dental manager at our PCT&#151;a difficult phrase to say; I am glad that I still have my own teeth&#151;met with Swindon medical academy and Bristol dentistry school earlier this year to discuss the possibility of outreach teaching at the medical academy. All the parties are keen, but, as always, resources are an issue. I hope that my hon. Friend the Minister of State will be able to reassure me that the enthusiasm of Swindon practitioners will be matched by the funding needed to realise their plans.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50629-15_para8">
<a name="stpa_131">Swindon has already benefited from dental access grants to the tune of &#163;170,000. Six applications for funding were made, five of which were successful. The PCT has allocated &#163;95,500 to the successful applicants, which translates into 10,000 new registrations. The money is enabling the five existing services to expand and modernise by providing new equipment and, crucially, four more dental chairs. The PCT is using the remaining money to set up two new dental chairs at one of Swindon&#039;s medical centres. By the end of 2005, therefore, Swindon will have a total of six new dental chairs.

<p><a name="st_131"><a name="50629-15_spnew4"><b> Dr. Murrison: </b> 
 I am fascinated by the dental chairs and I wonder who will fill them, given that we have lost 100 dental academics since 2000 and that the research assessment exercise appears to be sounding the death knell of dental academia.
</p>





<p><a name="st_132"><a name="50629-15_spnew5"><b> Anne Snelgrove: </b> 
 I thank the hon. Gentleman for enabling me to take my maiden intervention. I think that the Government&#039;s plans to increase the number of dentists by increasing the number of undergraduates and by employing people from overseas under strict licensing controls are the right way to proceed. I am sure that we will be able to fill the places.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50629-15_para9">
<a name="stpa_132">I was pleased to visit one of the NHS dentists in my constituency a few weeks ago. Ambience dental practice opened in 1998 as a direct result of Government funding, and it has seen 32,000 patients since then. Ambience is one of the pilots in the Government&#039;s personal dental services scheme, which began in January 2005. The practice is strongly in favour of the scheme, because it releases capacity and gives the practice a steady monthly income, which helps financial planning.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50629-15_para10">
<a name="stpa_133">Under the old general dental services scheme, which is still running in many practices and in many Conservative Members&#039; constituencies, Ambience&#039;s maximum capacity was 13,500 patients. If a patient did not attend within a fifteen-month period, that patient dropped off the list&#151;a problem described by the hon. Member for Rochdale (Paul Rowen). If a patient who had once been on the list rang up in pain for emergency 24-hour treatment, Ambience was normally unable to help them and directed them to our local access centre, which we are lucky to have. Under the new scheme, the period in which patients may remain on the list without attending the practice is 30 months, the effect of which is to increase Ambience&#039;s capacity to 17,500 patients. That is one of the reasons why I welcome the new contract: the Minister is right to say that it points the way ahead. Because of the new contract, instead of turning patients away, Ambience is taking on an average of 10 new patients a week, which is extremely good news for my constituents.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50629-15_para11">
<a name="stpa_134">Under the old budgeting system, a dental practice&#039;s income was based on the earnings of the practice in the previous year; in addition, fluctuating payments were made based on how much work was achieved by the practice each month, so when a dentist was on holiday, income fell. Under the pilot scheme, Ambience is given approximately &#163;13,000 per treatment room&#151;it has five&#151;of which 50 per cent. represents salary and 50 per cent. costs. That gives Ambience a stable income and helps it to cater for the ebbs and flows of the dental practice.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50629-15_para12">
<a name="stpa_135">With extra Government funding, Ambience could increase the number of treatment rooms available: it has the space to do so in the building in which the practice is located. The building is in the centre of town and would make an excellent extended practice. Each treatment room has the capacity for 2,000 to 2,300 patients per annum, so with two new treatment rooms Ambience could increase practice capacity by 4,600, which would greatly help South Swindon. Ambience dental practice is just one example of successful development by dental practices in Swindon: there are other NHS dental practices which I am sure are equally successful, and I look forward to visiting them.


<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>29 Jun 2005 : Column 1338</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>

<p>
<a name="50629-15_para13">
<a name="stpa_136">In addition to the increase in capacity and in the number of patients being treated that I have described, Swindon has a dental access centre for emergency treatment. Sadly, I have had to use it myself, but I cannot speak highly enough of the prompt, efficient service that I received. As the hon. Member for Westbury (Dr. Murrison) has reminded us, toothache is a dreadful thing. It was a relief to me to be seen within 24 hours&#151;something that most NHS patients could only dream of before the Labour Government&#039;s investment in dental services.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50629-15_para14">
<a name="stpa_137">I am pleased to inform the Minister that, earlier this year, I registered with an NHS dentist in Swindon. It was not difficult, as some would have us believe. I have received excellent service from my NHS dentist, including treatment for an abscess at 9 am on 6 May, which was not how I anticipated celebrating my election, especially given that the course of antibiotics prescribed forbad the consumption of alcohol.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50629-15_para15">
<a name="stpa_138">There are two issues to which I wish to draw the Minister&#039;s attention. First, not enough of my constituents are aware of the availability of NHS dentists and they sometimes make erroneous value judgments about the quality of treatment. For example, a constituent attending my advice surgery last week&#151;she did not come to discuss NHS dentistry, but she said, &quot;Oh, and another thing,&quot; and launched in on the subject&#151;complained that she and her husband had paid approximately &#163;1,000 for private dental treatment, including root canal treatment. Not only did she think that there were no NHS dentists with open lists in Swindon, which is not the case, but she believed that complex treatment could be offered only by private practices. Nothing could be further from the truth. Expert root canal treatment is offered on the NHS&#151;I paid approximately &#163;60 for mine. Incidentally, I was cheered by the comment of the hon. Member for Mole Valley that root canal treatment on elderly patients takes three to four hours: given that mine took less than half an hour, the hon. Gentleman has knocked a few years off me, which alone makes getting elected worth while. We clearly need to publicise the treatments available to an excellent standard on the NHS.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50629-15_para16">
<a name="stpa_139">Secondly, I am sad to say that some dentists are charging an initial registration fee before taking on NHS patients. Initial charges can be as much as &#163;40 to &#163;50 and apply to children as well as adults. For those on low incomes, that is a daunting sum to find, so I ask my hon. Friend the Minister of State to look into the issue. One of my constituents recently contacted me about her 10-year-old son, who had severe toothache. He was treated at the dental access centre, but could not be given follow-up treatment there. When my constituent, who is on income support, tried to register her son with a local NHS dentist, she was asked to pay &#163;45, which she could not afford. I understand that there is some dispute about whether that charging practice is allowable within NHS dentists&#039; terms of reference; in my opinion, it should not be, because it places an unacceptable barrier in the way of many who are most in need of treatment. Such charges might explain why the registration of children in Swindon as a whole has decreased slightly, whereas adult registration has increased. Despite that, 69 per cent. of children are registered, which is 6 per cent. above the national average. I do not want Opposition Members to run away with the idea that the situation is dreadful.

We in Swindon have seen great investment in dental services and we look forward to it continuing. In addition, I look forward with great interest to hearing about my hon. Friend&#039;s plans for the continuing development of dentistry. There is more to be done, as she has acknowledged, but we have made great progress in this important area of health.

 I am grateful for the opportunity to contribute to our debate on NHS dentistry, which is a serious concern for a number of residents in my constituency and for people across south Manchester.

<a name="stpa_142">I regularly receive correspondence from constituents&#151;I am sure that hon. Members on both sides of the Chamber do so too&#151;whose dentists have sent them letters telling them without prior warning that they are going to stop doing NHS work. Those patients are left to their own devices to find an alternative NHS dentist, which is a far cry from the Prime Minister&#039;s pledge in 1999 that everyone would

</p>

<p>
<a name="50629-16_para2">
<a name="stpa_143">Figures showing that less than 50 per cent. of people are now registered with an NHS dentist demonstrate the lack of success of the Government&#039;s policy on dentistry. One of my constituents in Didsbury is in the unfortunate position of losing two successive dentists. After his local dentist in Didsbury stopped carrying out NHS work, the nearest NHS dentist that he could find was over the border in Cheadle. Not one local dentist in my constituency was able to accept him as an NHS patient. Now he has been told by Cheadle dental practice that it will stop doing NHS work from 1 September. I wonder how many hundreds of residents in Manchester, Withington and will be in the same position?
</p>

<p>
<a name="50629-16_para3">
<a name="stpa_144">Who is to blame? Some people might argue that it is the dentists themselves, who not interested in working in the NHS. At least one hon. Member asked why dentists should do NHS work when they can make much more money in the private sector. I do not believe that that is the case. Dentists are not to blame&#151;it is the policies of successive Governments that have failed NHS dentistry. Speaking to dentists in my constituency, it is clear that the majority want to work in the NHS. They want NHS dentistry to be available to all, but it has become impossible for them to carry on working in the NHS. I have already written to Cheadle dental practice more in hope than expectation, urging it to reconsider its decision to end NHS treatment.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50629-16_para4">
<a name="stpa_145">I have little reason to be optimistic. This is not about dentists just wanting to make money but about them being unable to deliver a decent service under the NHS contract. In a letter to patients, Dr. Campaigne&#151;I apologise if I have mispronounced his name&#151;of Cheadle dental practice wrote:

</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="50629-16_para5">
<a name="stpa_146">That sums up the situation. Dentists tell us time and time again that the pricing structure means that dentists are unable to spend time with their NHS patients, give advice on preventive care or carry out good-quality work. Without a complete renegotiation of the contract to give dentists time with their patients and put in place effective plans the situation will become worse, not better.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50629-16_para6">
<a name="stpa_147">It was the Conservative Government who were responsible for the decline in NHS dentistry in places such as Manchester Withington and Cheadle. A new contract and reductions in fees in the early 1990s started the trend, but it is the failure of the Labour Government to do anything about it that has brought the NHS to a crisis point.

<p><a name="st_134"><a name="50629-16_spnew1"><b> Mr. Ian Austin: </b> 
 I would like to ask the hon. Gentleman a question that I tried to put to his hon. Friend the Member for Northavon (Steve Webb). We have heard a great deal from the Liberal Democrats about the shortage of NHS dentists, but the only proposal in their manifesto on dentistry was for personal dental plans. How many extra dentists would personal dental plans require to be trained, recruited and employed, and how would they be paid for?

<a name="stpa_148">In conclusion, the Prime Minister&#039;s amendment is typical of a Government with their head in the clouds.

However, we were disappointed by the fluff and nonsense that we heard. There were no facts of any merit and no positive suggestions about what the Liberal Democrats would do. It was simply blatant electioneering, which is sad, because the issue is important for people in my constituency and the rest of Hackney.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50629-16_para10">
<a name="stpa_151">The problems with dentistry in Hackney are very different from the problems experienced elsewhere. We have plenty of NHS dentists, but we lack the patients. The startling fact is that less than a third of residents are registered with a dentist. Just over 61,000 people are registered in a population of 222,000, according to the figures produced by the primary care trust. Locally, the PCT is working with dentists. Thanks to the Government&#039;s policies, the priorities are to register more children and to promote preventive work. Eight dental practices have already signed up to the new personal dental services contract. The PCT, particularly its visionary and highly effective chief executive, Laura Sharpe, has made a good start in tackling the problems in partnership with the Government. It is easy for people to carp about things they think the Government have not done, so let us remind ourselves of what they have done. There has been an extra &#163;250 million in this financial year alone&#151;an increase of 19 per cent. in investment in dentistry&#151;and a new dental contract has been introduced.

<p>
<a name="50629-16_para11">
<a name="stpa_152">I am delighted that my hon.

We do not live in the Liberal Democrat world of easy solutions but in the real world of government. I am delighted that under her stewardship we are working on long-term, sustainable solutions to problems. An extra &#163;9 million has been provided by the Government to PCTs for training to help dentists to prepare for the introduction of the new ways of working from October this year.

<p><a name="st_137"><a name="50629-16_spnew4"><b> Mr. Walker: </b> 
 While all that Government investment is much appreciated, is it not the case that much of it is lost on the public, because they would like more dentists in their community and the chance to get on to dental lists and receive treatment?

 As I said, in my constituency there is no shortage of dentists in the community, but I accept that we must consider the need for information about the availability of dentists. As my hon. Friend the Member for South Swindon (Anne Snelgrove) said, dentists are available, but people are not always aware that they can register with them. I hope that my hon.

<p>

<b>29 Jun 2005 : Column 1342</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>Hackney residents across the board. Hackney has the second highest proportion of 0 to 4-year-olds in London&#151;just over 8 per cent. It also has a high population turnover&#151;about 20 per cent. a year. That is well illustrated by a primary school that I visited a few weeks ago in Hoxton in the heart of a large number of council estates in my constituency. In year 6 of that primary school, just under 20 per cent. of the pupils have been there since reception. That is an indication of the challenges facing the promotion of registration and access to dental health in populations such as mine in Hackney, South and Shoreditch.

<a name="stpa_154">My hon.

<a name="stpa_155">Personally, I support fluoridation. In a previous existence, when I was a member of another Assembly, we discovered that, in London, it is particularly difficult to achieve because of the number of water companies and their geographical spread and cover, which makes it difficult under the new legislation to get an agreement to provide fluoridation across London. That leaves many of London&#039;s young people vulnerable to decay, especially in parts of east London, including Hackney, where literacy is not so high, population turnover is high and we have a number of migrant communities.

I am delighted to have foreign-born dentists working in London and in my constituency, and I rather shocked that a London Member should raise that as an issue of concern. Clearly, we also need to secure places at home to train dentists, wherever they were born, which the Government are doing.

 I have listened with interest to the contributions from both sides of the House. Like many other hon. Members, I am disappointed by the way in which the Cheadle by-election seems to have hung over so much of the debate. That has done the subject a grave disservice. Every time the Liberal Democrats have been asked to provide details of their policy with regard to dental provision, they have offered nothing but evasion and dissemblance.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50629-17_para2">
<a name="stpa_158">Dental provision in my constituency, Copeland, is a problem, but there can no doubt that the Government&#039;s approach to tackling the problem is the right one. I am grateful for that. The West Cumbria primary care trust, within which Copeland falls, has seen some 2,600 new registrations in the past year alone. That is to be welcomed. In addition, the number of children being registered is 64 per cent. throughout the primary care trust, which is excellent.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50629-17_para3">
<a name="stpa_159">In my experience, many dentists in my constituency are committed to the principles of the health service and everything that goes with that. However, it is clear that comprehensive dental provision, not only in my constituency but throughout the UK, cannot rely on the unique professionalism and philanthropy found by my hon. Friend the Member for Denton and Reddish (Andrew Gwynne) in his constituency. There needs to be some kind of compulsion in any new contract for dentists with regard to NHS provision. Would the Minister consider a golden handcuffs clause in any new contract, such as that commonly found in business, whereby a large investment in training individuals requires them to repay the organisation that provides that training?
</p>





<p><a name="st_142"><a name="50629-17_spnew3"><b> Mr. Walker: </b> 
 Is the hon. Gentleman suggesting that, when dentists graduate from dental school, they should be required to spend perhaps five years providing dental services in the NHS before they start taking on private patients?
</p>





<p><a name="st_143"><a name="50629-17_spnew4"><b> Mr. Reed: </b> 
 An element of compulsion should be considered. It is reasonable and realistic to expect that any organisation which invests so much time and taxpayers&#039; money in the provision of a public service should expect some recognition and repayment of that service when it is required.

 I should like to tell the House about one family in my constituency who contacted me during the general election campaign. The son had had persistent toothache for months. The family was on a relatively low income, although not on benefit, so they found the typical charges of a private dentist unaffordable. The son&#039;s toothache persisted and eventually they were able to get NHS treatment by being referred for emergency dental treatment. By that stage, and after months of discomfort and pain, the son was recommended to have three teeth removed. That is the state of NHS dentistry for some people in my constituency.

<br>&nbsp;<br>That is still the case in Cheltenham. This morning, I looked at the primary care trust website, which lists all the dental practices not only in my constituency, but in the whole PCT area. There is page after page of dental practices not accepting any new NHS patients for treatment. Out of 30 practices in the PCT area, 27 are not accepting any new NHS patients at all, two are registering only children up to the age of 18, and only one is also accepting some adults, but only charge-exempt adults.

 Has my hon. Friend had the same experience as I have had in my constituency? Although there are a few NHS dentists who will accept adult patients, there are virtually none who will do the more sophisticated treatments, such as dentures, porcelain veneers, bridges and crowns. That is an aspect of the failure of dentistry that is seldom discussed but is an acute problem for my constituents.
</p>





<p><a name="st_146"><a name="50629-17_spnew7"><b> Mr. Horwood: </b> 
 I thank my hon. Friend for highlighting that additional complication. In Cheltenham, apart from charge-exempt adults who qualify for that single dental practice, there are no NHS dental practices that will accept adult patients at all.
</p>





<p><a name="st_147"><a name="50629-17_spnew8"><b> Mr. Andrew Turner  (Isle of Wight) (Con):</b> 
 Does the hon. Gentleman recall that, in questions on the subject on 14 June, my hon. Friend the Member for North-East Milton Keynes (Mr. Lancaster) referred to children being accepted on NHS lists only on condition that their parents agreed to go private with the same dentist? Has he had that experience in Cheltenham?
</p>





<p><a name="st_148"><a name="50629-17_spnew9"><b> Mr. Horwood: </b> 
 I have not had that specific experience but I am alarmed to hear about it. It shows the extent to which NHS dentistry has collapsed, although as my hon. Friends pointed out, it was the last Conservative Government who were at the root of the problem when they changed the NHS contract in the first place.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50629-17_para5">
<a name="stpa_161">The primary care trust is struggling hard to redress the situation. It increased funding for the number of dental chairs and the St. Paul&#039;s dental practice will consequently have more chairs. It has recruited two Polish dentists to start work in Cheltenham.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50629-17_para6">
<a name="stpa_162">The problem is not the number of dentists. A recent study in <i>The International Journal of Health Geographics</i> revealed that Cheltenham and Tewkesbury primary care trust had one of the highest densities of dentists per head of the population in the country. The problem is the NHS contract. Unless those two Polish dentists are bad either at dentistry or economics, they will find the same position as in all other dental practices: if they try to pursue the NHS contract, they will ultimately face overdrafts and insolvency. That happened to dental practices in the early 1990s, when the previous Conservative Government first made the changes. The problem was not dentists being greedy, inefficient or trying to charge too much, but the increasingly large overdrafts that they built up as businesses. They simply could not sustain themselves.
</p>





<p><a name="st_149"><a name="50629-17_spnew10"><b> Ms Rosie Winterton: </b>

 It would be nice to know when the new contract will be introduced. This morning, I spoke to the chair of my local dental committee, who has waited for eight years under a Labour Government for something to be done about the NHS contract. It was promised two years ago.
</p>





<p><a name="st_151"><a name="50629-17_spnew12"><b> Ms Winterton: </b> 
 If the new dentists are being brought in by the primary care trust through international recruitment, I suspect that they will work under the new   personal dental services pilot contract, not the traditional general dental services contract. I hope that they find it reassuring that they are likely to work in that new way and will not therefore face the problems that the hon. Gentleman mentioned.
</p>





<p><a name="st_152"><a name="50629-17_spnew13"><b> Mr. Horwood: </b> 
 I am somewhat reassured but the proof of the pudding will be in the eating, if that is not yet another dentistry joke.

<a name="50629-17_para7">
<a name="stpa_163">We have one of the highest densities of dentists per head in the country. The hon. Member for Hackney, South and Shoreditch (Meg Hillier) said that we should accentuate the positive, but there is little positive to be found. NHS registrations in the Cheltenham and Tewkesbury PCT have fallen below 40 per cent. That is a fall of some 30 per cent. since 1992, when the Conservative Government made the changes. The position under the Labour Government has got increasingly worse.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50629-17_para8">
<a name="stpa_164">Moreover, according to the chair of my local dental committee this morning, the situation is set to deteriorate because Gloucestershire dentists are threatening to start deregistering NHS patients. Even if the two Polish dentists provide some NHS registrations, the increase is likely to be offset by other dentists in Gloucestershire deregistering NHS patients. The overview and scrutiny committee in Gloucestershire recently said that there was a genuine risk of NHS registrations deceasing even more unless something is done about the fundamental problem of the NHS contract. It was introduced by the Conservatives, but the Labour Government have done nothing about it for eight years. We have waited two years for a new NHS contract but it has not been provided. The time has come for something to be done.

<a name="stpa_165">Many concerns have been expressed about a shortage of access to NHS dentists.

As the Minister agreed, more than half the population are not registered with an NHS dentist. As she also conceded, dentists continue to drift away to the private sector.

I welcome the fact that the Department will publish its response to the charging review, but I ask the Minister to publish the report so that we can see to what exactly the Department is responding.

<a name="stpa_168">The access problems have been shown by contributions from hon. Members of all parties. I should like to add my experience to that of other hon. Members. Like my hon. Friend the Member for Cheltenham (Mr. Horwood), I tried to find a dentist in my area who could offer me treatment under the NHS. I thought that I would ascertain whether the Prime Minister&#039;s pledge held up and whether I would be referred to an NHS dentist if I phoned NHS Direct. I gave NHS Direct a call and looked at the NHS website. Of a total of 15 practices in my constituency, only four are accepting new NHS patients. None offers occasional or emergency treatment for non-registered patients. Three were ruled out because they accepted new NHS patients from only their immediate area, where I do not live. I live in Camborne and there was only one option for me. I rang that practice directly and was told that I would have to wait between two and eight months. The person to whom I spoke said that they were very sorry, but they could not tell me how long I might have to wait to be registered. If I put my name down, they would try to get back to me. That would depend on what vacancies came up and when they were advised by the primary care trust to register more people.
</p>





<p><a name="st_156"><a name="50629-18_spnew3"><b> Mr. Walker: </b> 
 Does the hon. Lady agree that if one had a massive toothache it would be disastrous to be told that one had to wait four or eight months?

<p><a name="st_157"><a name="50629-18_spnew4"><b> Julia Goldsworthy: </b> 
 Yes, it is worrying. When I spoke to NHS Direct, I asked about the provision for emergency treatment. I was told that there was one dental access centre 11 miles away and that I would not be given a contact number because I would have to be triaged over the telephone to determine whether it was appropriate to give me access even to try to book an appointment. I am not sure how it is possible to triage over the telephone.

 Unfortunately, I do not think that I shall be able to move to Swindon to receive such treatment.

<a name="stpa_169">The Government&#039;s amendment to the motion states that there has been extra investment and that the head count of dentists has increased. I would be interested to know how those dentists are splitting their time between NHS and private work, and what the full-time equivalent is of NHS dentistry provision. I am concerned that there appear to be mismatches between the Government&#039;s figures and people&#039;s real experiences on the ground, such as those highlighted by my hon.

In contrast, the reality that my hon. Friend has experienced on the ground is completely different. He has been contacted by a practice in Ripon that has had to take 1,000 registered patients off its books because the PCT cannot provide the additional funding that it needs to recruit another dentist. So the Government&#039;s figures might appear warm and encouraging on paper, but they bear no relation to people&#039;s experiences on the ground.

For example, we do not yet know when all the dentists will be switching over to the personal dental services contracts, as negotiations between the British Dental Association have broken down once before. Furthermore, it is not yet clear whether the switch over to the new contracts will result in improved capacity for dental services, or whether the dentists who have already moved over to the PDS contracts have increased their ratios of NHS patients and treatments. Surely it will be vital to know whether the new contracts will help to address the problems that I have outlined.

The NHS website states that none of the 18 practices registered in Cheadle is accepting new NHS patients, yet a ring-around revealed that two of them actually are. The concern is that the facts are not right. How many patients looking to register with a dentist will go to the trouble of ringing dozens of practices to see whether, on the off chance, the facts might not be right? That needs to be addressed.

</p>

<p>
<a name="50629-19_para5">
<a name="stpa_180">Among the contributions that we heard was the opening speech of the hon. Member for Northavon (Steve Webb), which boiled down to two points: the progress made and how to put in place capacity for the future.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50629-19_para6">
<a name="stpa_181">I noted that when referring to progress, the hon. Gentleman again used figures relating to the key year&#151;1998&#151;in which the registration rules changed, and the registration period was reduced from 24 to 15 months. The figures for the succeeding years show a very different pattern. They show an increase of 180,000 in the number of registrations, compared with a 2.1 million drop under the last Conservative Administration.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50629-19_para7">
<a name="stpa_182">The hon. Gentleman also spoke of establishing capacity for the future. I hope he agrees that the Government&#039;s approach&#151;investment coupled with devolution of commissioning to local health professionals, international recruitment coupled with investment in training places for the future, and, most important, the creation of new contractual arrangements allowing NHS and private dentists to increase the capacity that they offer the NHS&#151;represents the way ahead.
</p>





<p><a name="st_178"><a name="50629-19_spnew11"><b> Steve Webb: </b> 
 Let me ask the Minister a serious question about accountability. He mentioned the 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>29 Jun 2005 : Column 1351</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>devolution of commissioning to PCTs. On a number of occasions during the debate when we criticised Government action the reply was &quot;It&#039;s the PCTs&quot;. We do not elect the PCTs; we elect Ministers. Where will the democratic accountability in dentistry be when commissioning is decentralised?
</p>





<p><a name="st_179"><a name="50629-19_spnew12"><b> Mr. Byrne: </b> 
 We need only remind ourselves of what was said by my hon. Friend the Member for South Swindon (Anne Snelgrove) to understand the impact that can be made by working in partnership with PCTs. My hon. Friend the Member for Plymouth, Sutton (Linda Gilroy) made a similar point.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50629-19_para8">
<a name="stpa_183">The hon. Member for Mole Valley (Sir Paul Beresford) made an extremely well-informed speech, characterised by an enduring commitment to the principles of NHS dentistry. He was right to emphasise the importance of fluoridation: areas with fluoridated water have experienced declines of around 15 per cent. in tooth decay among children. He also emphasised the importance of the new contract, recognising the opportunity that it represents. I hope that during the      consultation and the affirmative-resolution procedure in both Houses, he will do his best to make his views known.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50629-19_para9">
<a name="stpa_184">The hon. Members for Rochdale (Paul Rowen) and for Cheltenham (Mr. Horwood) described some of the access problems in their constituencies. I think that their speeches implied the same conclusion that the hon. Member for Manchester, Withington (Mr. Leech) appeared to reach. I think that they were all arguing in favour of the new contractual arrangements that my hon. Friend the Minister of State will announce next week. I take issue only with the allegation by the hon. Gentleman that the Government had done nothing to address the inheritance of 1997. An extra &#163;250 million is not an empty promise; the recruitment of 1,000 extra dentists is not an empty promise; a 20 per cent. increase in the number of training places is not an empty promise. All those things make a difference, not just in the country generally but in the hon. Gentleman&#039;s constituency. For a start, he will have an extra &#163;144,000 in access money.

<p>
<a name="50629-20_para0">
<a name="stpa_186">Members on both sides of the House spoke of the differences made to access throughout the country. My hon. Friend the Member for Hackney, North and Stoke Newington (Ms Abbott) explained how our reforms would benefit urban areas. I thank her for her recognition of the record investment in the NHS and NHS dentistry. I join her in celebrating the availability of dentists in Hackney. She too mentioned the important issue of fluoridation, to which I will alert my hon. Friend the Member for Don Valley (Caroline Flint), the Under-Secretary of State for Health.

<p>
<a name="50629-20_para1">
<a name="stpa_187">My hon. Friend the Member for Selby (Mr. Grogan) has not been to Cheadle for some reason, but I welcome his endorsement of our strategy. As he said, his constituency is benefiting from the changes. His local PCT has eight new recruits, and registration has increased by more than 8,000. That is a good example of the difference that can be made&#151;not least in the widening of access&#151;by transferring commissioning to PCTs, which are now in control of &#163;1.6 billion. He concluded with some sage advice on contract consultations in the months to come, which will doubtless be of great benefit to my hon. Friend the Minister of State. My hon. Friend the Member for Copeland (Mr. Reed) added to those thoughts with a helpful contribution of his own.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50629-20_para2">
<a name="stpa_188">My hon. Friend the Member for Plymouth, Sutton also congratulated the Government on the progress that has been made. I thank her for that, and in turn congratulate her on engaging with her local PCT. I am sure that its hitting its targets is not unrelated to the strong interest that she takes in local matters. She underlined the strength of her city&#039;s claim to be host to a new dental school; I am sure that my hon. Friend the Minister of State will have listened very carefully to what she had to say. What a welcome change to be debating where to open dental schools, rather than mourning their closure.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50629-20_para3">
<a name="stpa_189">My hon. Friend the Member for South Swindon highlighted the sharp contrast in her constituency between the situation now and before 1997. Some of the innovation that she highlighted was especially useful. Her constituency has indeed benefited considerably. Her PCT has a growth in registrations of 4,500 coming its way. Her strategic health authority has nearly &#163;2 million extra in capital and revenue resources, as well as an access centre. I must congratulate her on taking a close interest in dental matters in her constituency&#151;so close that she was drawn into a little personal research in what sounded like the most pressing of circumstances. She highlighted the need to publicise the new dentistry services that are available, and I can only agree. She also raised a specific case, on which I shall write to her.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50629-20_para4">
<a name="stpa_190">I want to conclude my survey of this afternoon&#039;s contributions with that of the hon. Member for Westbury (Dr. Murrison), who opened with some excellent jokes and then proceeded to tell some that were slightly less amusing. I was especially intrigued by his idea that, on the basis of evidence, dental schools will close. I was not sure which evidence he meant. Was it the number of registrations falling by 2.1 million, or treatments falling by 600,000? He did not say. He did, however, underline the need for an NHS commitment to dentistry, with which I can only concur.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50629-20_para5">
<a name="stpa_191">The hon. Gentleman also underlined the importance of a personal touch, but he said that he was unsure about our commitment to delivering it. Well, the best way to guarantee it is by recruiting more dentists, not by encouraging them to drift away. The best way to guarantee it is by training new dentists for the future, not by closing down dental schools. He emphasised the importance of registration, which intrigued me slightly. The hon. Member for South Cambridgeshire (Mr. Lansley), who is not in his place, has said that the Conservatives&#039; own plans do not guarantee patients&#039; ability to register, even in cases where they have secured insurance.

</p>

<a name="50629-20_para6">
<a name="stpa_192">In conclusion, I celebrate the House&#039;s resolve time and again to address itself to the vital issue of the nation&#039;s oral health. This is our third debate on this issue in the past 12 months. Once again, we have spent an afternoon counting the cost of clearing up the Conservatives&#039; legacy. Once again, we have heard of the damage done by their calamitous contract of 1990. Once again, we have heard of the price paid for their decision to close down dental schools. And once again, we have heard from the Liberal Democrats a solution&#151;
</p>





<p><a name="st_182"><a name="50629-20_spnew1"><b> Mr. Walker: </b> 
 After eight years, is it not about time that Labour started taking responsibility for this issue?
</p>





<p><a name="st_183"><a name="50629-20_spnew2"><b> Mr. Byrne: </b> 
 Let us look at the figures. The number of dentists is up by 20 per cent.; the number of adult registrations is up by 180,000 since 1998; the number of treatments is up by 6 million. So I have absolutely no apologies to make for this Government&#039;s record in office. It is a record of which we are proud.
</p>





<p><a name="st_184"><a name="50629-20_spnew3"><b> Linda Gilroy: </b> 
 A little earlier, I mentioned that one issue that the Conservatives perhaps have difficulty in getting their heads round is that in 1997 we inherited a situation in which some 42p in every new pound of taxation was being spent on the cost of economic failure, unemployment and the national debt, which had got out of control. I did not mention that that figure has now dropped to some 11p in the pound, which means that we have the money to invest in a sustainable way. Does my hon. Friend agree that that is a key point, and that it should give us confidence in future?
</p>





<p><a name="st_185"><a name="50629-20_spnew4"><b> Mr. Byrne: </b> 
 I agree entirely with my hon. Friend. We can be very proud of the fact that investment in NHS dentistry is increasing by 19 per cent. over the next year.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50629-20_para7">
<a name="stpa_193">That leads me to the question of finance. Once again, we heard from the Liberal Democrats a solution, the delicate foundation of which appears to rest on spending money spent once or twice before. The right hon. Member for Ross, Skye and Lochaber (Mr. Kennedy) has told the newspapers that his party is embarked on a great adventure. It is embarked on a policy review without precondition or presupposition, a clean sheet and a move away from

</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="50629-20_para8">
<a name="stpa_194">which I can only assume is a reference to the Liberal Democrat annual conference. I hope that what the Liberal Democrats have heard this afternoon has put them off writing on that blank sheet a break-up of the national health service, as proposed by some of their number in &quot;The Orange Book&quot;. What this country wants is NHS dentistry rejuvenated by the reforms outlined by the Minister of State earlier this afternoon. These are the most ambitious reforms since 1948, which promise to accelerate the increased number of dentists, increased number of treatments and increased number of registrations already delivered in the last Parliament.
</p>





<p><a name="st_186"><a name="50629-20_spnew5"><b> Dr. Murrison: </b> 
 Before he finishes, will the Minister confirm whether it is his intention to publish Harry Cayton&#039;s report next week in part or in full?
</p>





<p><a name="st_187"><a name="50629-20_spnew6"><b> Mr. Byrne: </b> 
 We will publish it in full, even though it is unusual to publish the full details of reports constructed

The principles and the details set out next week will be extremely important and I hope that both sides of the House will join in a constructive debate on them. The Minister of State has set out a strategy this afternoon and the next steps will be set out next week. I commend the Government amendment to the House.

<a name="stpa_196">I am very pleased that we are able to have this opportune debate, initiated by the Liberal Democrats, on climate change in the run-up to the G8 summit. It is only a pity that, yet again, we have to rely on our Opposition day time for these major debates, rather than having Government time allocated. For the record, in the past four years there have been four Liberal Democrat debates on climate change in our limited Opposition time, only one Government debate on climate change and none at all from the Conservatives. I hope that the right hon. Member for West Dorset (Mr. Letwin) will attempt to rectify that&#151;provided that he is on the Front Bench long enough, given the quick succession of spokesmen representing the environmental interest for the Conservatives.

<a name="stpa_197">The right hon. Member for West Dorset made an interesting contribution on beauty, sunlight and daffodils, to which I listened with great interest. It was the sort of debate that I would have been delighted to take part in, perhaps in a study overlooking an Oxford quadrangle. I hope that he will be able to move on to climate change and other more serious issues before very long&#151;which is not to say that beauty is not important, but climate change is perhaps more important still.

<a name="stpa_198">The priorities that the Prime Minister has set for the G8 are, as we know, Africa and climate change. Liberal Democrat Members certainly very much welcome those two priorities. They are completely correct, and the Prime Minister is right to consider what he can do through his presidencies of the G8 and the European Union to take those matters forward.

</p>

<p>
<a name="50629-21_para4">
<a name="stpa_200">It a common view among hon. Members on both sides of the House that climate change is the greatest threat facing the planet, especially Africa. In January 2004, Sir David King, the Government&#039;s chief scientist, said:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_25">&quot;In my view, climate change is the most severe problem we are facing today, more serious even than the threat of terrorism.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="50629-21_para5">
<a name="stpa_201">Yet, shortly afterwards, the Prime Minister said:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_26">&quot;It&#039;s the single biggest long-term problem we face.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="50629-21_para6">
<a name="stpa_202">He appears to be at odds with his chief scientist about the urgency of the matter.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50629-21_para7">
<a name="stpa_203">I make it very clear that the Liberal Democrats regard climate change as a problem today, not one for the long term. It is a problem that requires action now, both internationally and domestically. Everyone knows that climate change is kicking in. I do not need to rehearse the science&#151;it is all very well documented&#151;and people need only look at the weather in this country to see how it has changed in the past 20 years to know that climate change is here and is having an increasing effect on our country and the planet.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50629-21_para8">
<a name="stpa_204">We believe that combating climate change and helping Africa are two inextricably linked goals. Indeed, we go so far as to say that we could sort out Africa&#039;s debt problems if only we could sort out the aid problems and even the trade problems. Unless we deal with climate change, the good work on the Africa agenda will be significantly undermined because Africa is in the front line when facing problems from climate change, desertification, extra flooding and changes to crop harvests.

<a name="stpa_205">Archbishop Desmond Tutu said:
</p>

<a name="stpa_207">If the Prime Minister wants to make progress on Africa, that is good, but he must make progress on climate change as well, otherwise he undermines his own case.

<p>
<a name="50629-21_para12">
<a name="stpa_208">I commend to the House and the Minister the recent report, &quot;Africa: Up in Smoke&quot;, which looked at some of those issues in detail. The report made it plain for us all to see that the G8 nations have failed to join the dots between climate change and Africa. It made it clear that unless global warming is checked, development gains will disappear. Fourteen African countries are already subject to water stress or water scarcity, and they will be joined by a further 11 in the next 25 years. Rainfall is predicted to decline in the Horn of Africa and some parts of the south by as much as 10 per cent. by 2050. The land in Africa may warm by as much as 1.6&#176;C, which can affect crop harvests for hundreds of millions of people. Aid policy for Africa needs to be recast to take account of climate change. Greater resources need to be given to adaptation, so that Africa is capable of withstanding some of the effects that are coming down the track towards it very quickly.

<a name="50629-21_para13">
<a name="stpa_209">Sadly, most G8 nations, including the United Kingdom, are dragging their feet in paying aid to the third world for climate change. The UK has pledged &#163;10 million to a special climate change fund, but so far has paid nothing. Japan, the United States and Russia, which ostensibly signed up to some degree to the aid agenda, have refused to offer any cash at all. Germany has so far paid nothing to the special fund.
</p>





<p><a name="st_194"><a name="50629-21_spnew1"><b> Colin Challen  (Morley and Rothwell) (Lab):</b> 
 I am pleased to say that the hon. Gentleman was one of the Members who came to the launch today of the parliamentary all-party group on climate change. Many Members from both sides were present. The hon. Gentleman referred to the contribution of other countries. Does he think that during our presidency of the G8, those countries will take the Prime Minister&#039;s view that climate change is as important as it is?
</p>





<p><a name="st_195"><a name="50629-21_spnew2"><b> Norman Baker: </b> 
 I will come to the other G8 members and climate change shortly, but the quick answer is that there is a commonality of view among many countries on the need to act. Unfortunately, that view is not shared by the United States Administration, and we need to overcome that problem if we are to make progress. The hon. Gentleman leads me on to the strategy for the G8 presidency but, first, may I congratulate him on his efforts this morning to set up the all-party group? I hope that it will do good work.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50629-21_para14">
<a name="stpa_210">The Government&#039;s diplomatic strategy has been sensible. As far as I can tell, it has been based on four prongs. The first is to persuade President Bush and his acolytes of the scientific case for action on climate change; the second is to tie down the rhetoric on new technologies so that something actually materialises, rather than simply talking in a vacuum about what might be done; the third is to aim towards a communiqu&#233; that signs up everyone to a successor regime for Kyoto in some shape or form; and the fourth is to find a way realistically and fairly to bring China, India and other such countries on board. Those are sensible diplomatic objectives for the arrangements that the Prime Minister is entering into.

However, President Bush still denies the basic science that everyone else in the world accepts. His spokesman, Harlan Watson, said a couple of months ago:

</p>

<p>
<a name="50629-22_para2">
<a name="stpa_213">We have reached the stage at which the only people who do not appear to believe that climate change is with us are President Bush and Lee R. Raymond, the chairman and chief executive of ExxonMobil. They could fit into a telephone box and discuss the subject. That reminds me of the old adage about Liberal Members of Parliament back in the 1960s, who, it was said, would all be able to fit into a taxi. Fortunately, those days are now long gone, and I imagine that they went when Cyril Smith won a by-election in Rochdale. We have moved on, so let us hope that President Bush can move on with his best buddy the chief executive of ExxonMobil.
</p>





<p><a name="st_198"><a name="50629-22_spnew2"><b> Mr. Graham Stuart  (Beverley and Holderness) (Con):</b> 
 Does the hon. Gentleman agree that it is hard for us to apply the moral pressure on the United States that we all seek to apply when our Government talk tough about climate change and carbon dioxide emissions, set an ambitious target of 20 per cent. and then cut it to 13 per cent? They are failing to deliver. Does he agree with the recent report that suggests that this country now has a worse environmental record than that of the United States, which everyone seems to want to criticise? We all need to change.
</p>





<p><a name="st_199"><a name="50629-22_spnew3"><b> Norman Baker: </b> 
 I do not agree that we have a worse environmental record than the United States, but I accept that we need to ensure that our house is in order before we attempt to lecture others. There is a lot of work to be done on the domestic scene, to which I will come later. One of the joys of these debates is that Members are always keen to anticipate the comments that I shall make. I busily scribble them out as I go through my contribution.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50629-22_para3">
<a name="stpa_214">We have to ask why President Bush takes the view that he does. Does he genuinely not believe that the science is proven&#151;in which case, he is in a very small minority&#151;or is there some other reason? We need to look at other elements of the US Administration to answer that question, and I look no further than Phillip Cooney, who was a chief of staff for the White House council on environmental quality. Leaked memos that have appeared in the press show that he consistently watered down official scientific warnings and intervened to blur the conclusions of Government scientists before they were published so as to minimise, as far as possible, their views on the threat from climate change.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50629-22_para4">
<a name="stpa_215">Phillip Cooney is not a scientist; he is a politician working for President Bush. He was formerly a lobbyist for the American Petroleum Institute, the oil industry&#039;s largest trade group and a lobby group vocal in denying that climate change results from man-made emissions. He resigned over the weekend 11&#150;12 June, having taken a job with ExxonMobil that he will start shortly. I can do no better than quote Henry Waxman, a Democratic Congressman who sits on the committee on government reform, who said:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_30">&quot;At a minimum it creates a terrible appearance . . . This is one of the fastest revolving doors I have seen.&quot;</p>

<a name="50629-22_para5">
<a name="stpa_216">That is not a unique example of an individual in the US putting forward views based purportedly on science but actually on their interests or the interests of those they represent.

<a name="stpa_218">Interestingly, ExxonMobil gave that organisation $280,000. Tech Central Station has also been leading the charge against the science of climate change. It received $95,000 from ExxonMobil. Can Members detect a pattern emerging among those US spokesmen?
</p>

<p>
<a name="50629-22_para8">
<a name="stpa_219">Where does that leave the Prime Minister at the G8 summit? What should he do? I feel genuinely sorry for him. He has tried to move things forward with President Bush and the United States through that international forum, but he has been completely rebuffed. All the favours that the Prime Minister has given over Iraq and everything else count as nothing with President Bush. They have been contemptuously swept aside in the one-way street that is our special relationship. It looks as though the Prime Minister will return empty handed from the G8 summit as regards the American Administration. That will of course be only the latest in a long line of rebuffs from best friend President Bush. Whether it is the International Criminal Court, debt relief or Iraq&#151;the list is endless&#151;President Bush says no, no, no.

<a name="stpa_220">It is important to realise, however, that when we talk about President Bush we are not talking of the American people&#151;those in America who understand climate change and are arguing strongly for real action. Evidence of a sensible and understanding approach in the US is becoming common.In the Senate, there were the efforts of the Republican Senator McCain to set up an emissions trading scheme by 2010, in a reasonably close vote on 21 June, only a few days ago. There are the actions of US states such as California, where Arnold Schwarzenegger said that the debate on climate change &quot;is over&quot;. He has announced a climate change plan with targets to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases to 2000 levels by 2010. As a Republican, he is taking action in the fifth or sixth biggest economy in the world, and he is moving Republican opinion in the US behind the need to take action on climate change.

 There is no question about the need to deal with aviation emissions. All the projections show that they will rise hugely in the next 20 or 30 years. Obviously, an aviation fuel tax would require international agreement and, as the hon. Gentleman will realise, that may not be forthcoming. However, there is the EU emissions trading scheme and my party&#151;and, indeed, the Government, support the inclusion of aviation in that scheme.

It is not a perfect solution and we need collectively to consider others, but there is a major problem that must be dealt with, so we should listen carefully to well-intentioned proposals from other countries that want reductions in climate change gases.

<a name="50629-22_para10">
<a name="stpa_221">I was talking about California, but other US states and cities have taken action. A pan-US initiative has been founded by Seattle&#039;s mayor, Greg Nickels, and dozens of cities have signed up to taking action on climate change. Most, but not all, are Democrat and each has the tough target of cutting its emissions by 7 per cent. Each mayor wants to take a different path, which is fair enough because of local circumstances, but they are all taking the problem seriously and doing something. The EU emissions trading scheme is being mirrored, or shadowed, by nine north-east states, so when the US Administration in Washington come to their senses, they will be able to plug into the scheme. A lot of good things are happening in the US, so the attitude that President Bush takes on the world stage does his country no good whatsoever.

Let me make it clear that getting the US into an agreement would be infinitely preferable to having it outside an agreement. It is a major polluter and a major world player, so we want it signed up as part of a deal to tackle climate change. The Government are right to try to push the button and see whether we can get there, but unfortunately I do not think that we will be able to achieve it. Given the diplomatic objectives that I mentioned earlier, perhaps we can make progress with President Bush on technology. There is investment in the US in areas such as the hydrogen economy, renewables and carbon sequestration.

 I understand that one of the objections of the Bush Administration to Kyoto is that it does not cover the emerging economies of China and India. Given that it will be necessary to deal with them as part of any overall attack on climate change, will agreement among the G8 be enough? Surely we need a wider agreement over and above the G8 to deal with the problem. Will not the Prime Minister have to move the matter forward in other spheres after the G8 summit?

<p><a name="st_203"><a name="50629-23_spnew1"><b> Norman Baker: </b> 
 Absolutely. The G8 is only a start, but it is an important start. We will also be able to use the EU presidency, but ultimately we need a system that is seen to be fair and equitable throughout the world, which means that we must get not only the US but developing countries on board. Perhaps a system based on contraction and convergence, which would be attractive to all countries due to its fairness, is the way in which we will get agreement in the longer term. However, China and India will not come on board if the biggest polluter in the world is outside any agreement, which is another reason why it is important to sign up the US. The sad reality is that President Bush will not even accept the science, so there is no likelihood of him accepting Kyoto or its successor.

Will they water down the agreement available to such a degree that the US signs up to it, in which case the agreement will not be worth having because it will be so weak, or will an agreement be signed among willing partners to allow them to plough ahead, even though the US is not on board at that stage?

<p><a name="st_229"><a name="50629-25_spnew6"><b> Mr. Morley: </b> 
 Emissions have increased only marginally since 1997. I shall explain the reasons for that shortly. It is true that the dash for gas contributed to the fall in CO <sub>2</sub>  emissions and I would not pretend otherwise. However, the measures that we have introduced over the years mean that the percentage contribution of the dash for gas has fallen from 40 per cent. to 30 per cent. It will fall further to around 25 per cent. as other measures kick in. One of the other contributions was the destruction of jobs and industry under the Conservative Government. Perhaps the hon. Gentleman does not like to be reminded of that.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50629-25_para2">
<a name="stpa_243">The UK has demonstrated clear leadership in tackling climate change by reducing greenhouse gas emissions and showing that that need not affect our economic competitiveness. Although there has been a small increase in CO <sub>2</sub> &#151;generally due to increased coal burn&#151;we have had the strongest economic growth in the EU, yet CO <sub>2</sub>  emissions have risen in every other mainstream EU country by a much greater rate than in the UK. I say that to put matters in perspective. It is not an excuse because we intend to tackle the problem. However, it is wrong to suggest that the UK is out of sync with other industrialised nations. Our record remains one of the best.

 Does the Minister agree that there has been uneven development in that pattern of growth? Does he know how many manufacturing jobs have been lost during the Government&#039;s tenure? Does he agree that, if manufacturing is declining, CO <sub>2</sub>  emissions should decline with it?
</p>





<p><a name="st_231"><a name="50629-25_spnew8"><b> Mr. Morley: </b> 
 Manufacturing jobs have declined in the UK, as has been well documented, although not as much as previously. They have also declined in other European countries.

<a name="stpa_244">There are a number of reasons for the increase in CO <sub>2</sub>  emissions&#151;transport and energy are the biggest contributors. I shall return to that point in a moment. The 2003 figures show that the UK has reduced its greenhouse gas emissions by 13.6 per cent. since 1990, while the UK economy has grown over the same period by more than 36 per cent. I do not think that any other country could demonstrate such a record of economic growth while keeping emissions down.

One of those commitments was that we would recognise the fact that, if we did not take further action, we would not reach our target in 2010. We conceded that.

Without the measures introduced in the climate change programme in 2000, involving energy efficiency, domestic targets, changes in company car taxation, the climate change levy and the UK carbon trading scheme&#151;the first national scheme of its kind in the world&#151;we would probably now be producing about 15 per cent. more than the 1990 level of greenhouse gas emissions, rather than producing about 14 per cent. below that level, as we were in 2003.

<br>&nbsp;<br>promote international consensus on the need for further action to control emissions. It is fair to say that some people still need to be convinced of the need for further action, although I am glad to say that their number is declining. Nevertheless, we need to make that case.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50629-25_para9">
<a name="stpa_250">We have set ourselves some more detailed, and no less ambitious, objectives. First, it is important that, at the Gleneagles conference, we come to a better understanding of the science involved, which means addressing some of the doubts that have been raised. We very much welcomed the statement from the national scientific bodies of all G8 countries, including the American Academy of Sciences, which was important.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50629-25_para10">
<a name="stpa_251">Secondly, we want to ensure that the G8 agrees to a package of practical measures focused on technologies with significantly lower greenhouse gas emissions than traditional technologies&#151;such as clean fuels and the hydrogen economy, as has been pointed out&#151;on which a great deal of work is taking place within the G8 and which requires co-operation. There is also a need for technology transfer to emerging economies and developing countries.

That is why I am pleased that China, Brazil, South Africa, Mexico and India have deliberately been involved in the G8 process, as we must bring those major economies on side. Incidentally, China emits more greenhouse gases than the whole European Union put together, and is now the world&#039;s second biggest emitter. I was pleased at the positive response from the Chinese when we discussed those issues in the environment and energy round table meeting as part of our G8 process, which 20 Ministers from around the world attended, including Chinese and Indian Ministers, which was useful.

The statement on 7 June from all the science academies backs that up. The science academies also called on G8 nations to

<br>&nbsp;<br>hon. Friend examine closely new environmental technologies? In terms of the further research that is needed and the action plan, will he examine what opportunities might exist for collaboration between companies and Government in this country and in China and India? For example, new kilns in the ceramics industry, which are currently being fitted, do not receive full tax concessions, but a collaborative exercise could make a huge difference in terms of combating global warming.
</p>





<p><a name="st_237"><a name="50629-26_spnew1"><b> Mr. Morley: </b> 
 My hon. Friend makes a good point. There is scope not just for collaboration with some of the emerging economies, which will reduce emissions, but for collaboration that will be beneficial to our industries, improve innovation and help companies that have new technologies and new ideas. We should not forget that environmental technologies will create jobs, and that dealing with climate change also provides opportunities&#151;it is not all about restrictions and costs. I shall make that point as well.
</p>





<p><a name="st_238"><a name="50629-26_spnew2"><b> Mr. Hurd </b> 
: On the subject of partnership with emerging economies, the Minister will be well aware of the importance of rain forest and forest vegetation in terms of storing carbon. He will also be aware that Brazil is the major steward in the world of such forest vegetation, and that forest stripping has returned to 1995 levels, despite the best efforts of President Lula. Does he expect that the G8 agenda will include discussions on the role that the international community can play in helping Brazil combat that problem, possibly by giving it some financial credit for the assets on which it sits?
</p>





<p><a name="st_239"><a name="50629-26_spnew3"><b> Mr. Morley: </b> 
 I am sure that those issues will be discussed. They have already been discussed in the United Nations forum on climate change and the United Nations forestry forum. There are serious questions to be asked about how forests can be used as carbon sinks, and the possibility of carbon credits. I think that the appropriate forum is the climate change forum, because this is a global, international issue. Some people believe that the G8 should set targets, but it would be very arrogant for just eight of the world&#039;s richest countries to decide what everyone else in the world must do. The G8 countries must give a lead and give encouragement, but the commitments must involve the international community as a whole, and that must take place in the UN framework. The G8 cannot short-circuit the process.

: My hon. Friend speaks of costs and opportunities. When the price of oil was $30 a barrel, it was understandable that business should think costs were involved in adapting to climate change. As the oil price reaches $60 a barrel and moves inexorably to $100 a barrel, that&#151;more than anything that we could do&#151;will concentrate minds on the opportunities and benefits.
</p>





<p><a name="st_241"><a name="50629-26_spnew5"><b> Mr. Morley: </b> 
 That is a good point. Moreover, with prices at those levels, some technologies and developments that were not viable when the price was $30 a barrel are viable now, when the price is unlikely to return to the lower levels of the past. There are many reasons for seeking non-fossil fuel alternatives, but now there is that additional incentive.

It could give certain countries a huge carbon allocation, which would remove any incentive for carbon efficiency. I recommend to the hon.

It brings us back to the point that some people internationally still believe that taking action on the climate will damage their economies, but that is not necessarily the case, so we must emphasise the opportunities. The message from those companies proved to be a strong one: they said that we must take action now and that Governments must send a strong policy signal to the markets to take into account the long periods over which investments in infrastructure are made. They highlighted the need for rapid commercialisation of new technologies, many of which are already developed; they dismissed the notion that climate change causes harm; and they pointed out the economic benefits, on which we should all focus.

Those are all steps towards building consensus, raising the issues, getting support internationally and moving forward to the crucial next COP in Montreal of the United Nations framework convention on climate change.

<a name="stpa_271">But so is the Conservative party, and that has been the case for a very long time. Indeed, my right hon. and learned Friend the Leader of the Opposition persuaded the US to join the framework convention by means of a piece of shuttle diplomacy that is one of the most important elements in the evolution of this debate. Therefore, this is not one of those issues that divide the three main parties.

<a name="stpa_273">I agree with the hon. Gentleman about the Government&#039;s delivery on the domestic agenda. The Minister made a typically mellifluous, comprehensive and knowledgeable contribution, in which he sketched many of the steps that the Government have taken. Although the Government have taken a great many such steps, various hon. Members pointed out that they have not proved sufficient to achieve a persistent reduction in carbon dioxide emissions.

<a name="50629-27_para10">
<a name="stpa_274">Indeed, I stood at this Dispatch Box recently and said that there had been a serendipitous fall in the nitrous oxide emitted as a result of the use of adipic acid in nylon production, and that farmers had done very well in reducing methane emissions and the use of nitrous oxide in fertilisers. Without those factors, the Government would not merely be in danger of not meeting their Kyoto targets but, as the hon. Member for Lewes correctly pointed out, but nowhere near fulfilling them. There is therefore an underlying problem.

<a name="50629-27_para11">
<a name="stpa_275">Leaving aside the fact that Ministers must always present a good front, I am sure that this Minister is perfectly aware of the difficulties facing the Government in meeting the Kyoto objectives. That is not unique to this Administration: all British Governments face the same problems, as this is a very difficult matter. The nation&#151;and Government Departments&#151;must be led to adopt policies that consciously reduce national income. We have to admit to ourselves that a cost is involved. Most of the things that the Government&#151;like most Governments before them&#151;wish to do are aimed at increasing national income. Therefore, having a set of policies that are consciously designed to reduce national income&#151;in some respects&#151;is a difficult proposition and it is no surprise that the Government have encountered some difficulties. However, it is also unhelpful if Ministers pretend to themselves, perhaps through fear of political partisanship from the Opposition, that they can continue to persuade the public that we are going to make progress on&#151;not present policy, because I accept the Minister&#039;s point that the review is imminent&#151;what is likely to be policy.

<a name="stpa_276">All parties will have to admit that, not only for the next four or five years but for the next 40 or 50 years, the nation will need a framework for the approach to the reduction of carbon dioxide emissions and thus the prevention of rapid global warming, or at least our contribution to it, that is parallel to the process that the Chancellor successfully achieved through the transfer of monetary policy to the Bank of England and the establishment of fiscal rules. The Chancellor created an external discipline. It is not perfect and, in previous roles, I have proposed amendments to it, but it has been on the whole successful in creating fiscal discipline that would otherwise be lacking. We do not, as yet, have an analogous external discipline on the behaviour of this and future Governments in relation to climate change. Until we have such a framework, I am convinced that no   Government&#151;not this one nor, as I hope, a Conservative Government in due course&#151;will be able to resist the pressure from many quarters to diminish the speed with which we address the problem, because of the economic costs. I hope that we will reach the point when we agree about that.

<p><a name="st_251"><a name="50629-28_spnew0"><b> Helen Goodman  (Bishop Auckland) (Lab):</b> 
 Is not the right hon. Gentleman confusing the costs of tackling climate change and making the investment to become more efficient with the notion that those costs will reduce national output? Tackling climate change will not necessarily be a dampener on the rate of growth of the economy. Indeed, it could be an economic opportunity.
</p>





<p><a name="st_252"><a name="50629-28_spnew1"><b> Mr. Letwin: </b> 
 To a degree, the hon. Lady is right. Parts of the wide portfolio of measures that need to be taken to get anywhere near the 60 per cent. target by 2050 have present value advantages and, almost certainly, long-term economic gain attached to them. A classic example is home insulation with fibreglass. There is no doubt that, for most householders, that is already an economic proposition. Part of my case against the Government is not that they have not sought to promote such insulation but that they have not found an effective means of doing so. Most of our countrymen do not know how they can insulate their lofts, do not know what the economics look like and therefore do not recognise or realise that economic advantage.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50629-28_para0">
<a name="stpa_277">We should not delude ourselves. The number of cases in which early economic gains would be made as well as climate change gains is limited. In many other cases, there would be social and economic costs, many of which would last for a long time as well as having a short-term impact. If we were to run the electricity supply industry as cheaply as possible, it would persistently fail to contribute to climate change goals. There is a contrast between what the economics of the situation would dictate and the dictates of climate change. Of course, those relationships alter from time to time, sometimes adversely and sometimes favourably. At the moment, gas prices are rising and coal prices are falling, and that has an adverse effect on a climate change strategy. At other times, technology and other changes will have a different effect.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50629-28_para1">
<a name="stpa_278">My point is that we must not delude ourselves. If we are serious about the issue, as opposed to merely playing with it, we need a range of measures over the next 50 years that will have economic costs. We should not 

<br>&nbsp;<br>

<br>&nbsp;<br>think that we can get away without such costs and we have to recognise that, therefore, in a democracy considerable pressure will be felt against such measures. There will also be social costs, such as people having to live next to things that they may not want to live next to, or people having to see things in the countryside that they might not want to see. Those costs also have to be overcome. We therefore need a clear-minded, effective external framework that constrains democratic politics where there is a consensus, in order that we can make real progress over a sustained period.

 Will the right hon. Gentleman clarify exactly what that would be called?

 The hon. Gentleman asks a good question and the honest answer is that I do not yet know. I am in discussion with my hon. Friends to come up with a view about this. Friends of the Earth is promoting a climate change Bill that will advance a view that may or may not be similar.

But what is clear to my mind is that we cannot simply rely on constantly hoping that the Government of the day will do everything that needs to be done, hang the democratic effects, because we live in a democracy and there are democratic pressures and we would be asking our population to take present pain for future benefit, which is a difficult thing to achieve, so we shall need a very special mechanism if we are to do it over the sustained period that is required in as consistent a way as is required.

I refer to the letter sent by my right hon.

</p>

<p>
<a name="50629-28_para3">
<a name="stpa_280">Let me turn to the main point that the Liberals are making in their motion, and with which I also agree. This is not in the spirit of criticism of the Government but in the spirit of offering a constructive way forward. <i>[Laughter.]</i> That is not an ironic remark. I mean that genuinely. The spokesman for the Liberals said, and I understand his motivation in saying it, that the Prime Minister was right to go into the G8 saying that his two priorities were global poverty and climate change. I agree with the hon. Gentleman that, as an objective assessment of the problems facing the world, the Prime Minister was right. Given that we are reasonably prosperous and reasonably at peace, those are the two great issues facing the world that probably most need tackling. I am not so convinced that the Prime Minister was necessarily wise to include climate change if he could not achieve more than it currently looks&#151;I take the Minister&#039;s point that we do not yet know the outcome&#151;as if he may emerge with. I want to explain why, and then I want to make a proposal about what the Minister and the Secretary of State might recommend to the Prime Minister that he might entertain as a possible way out of the impasse as he participates in the negotiations in the next few days.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50629-28_para4">
<a name="stpa_281">I accept that the Minister is right to describe the international negotiations as a long-running process that will run through to the Montreal meeting and beyond. Indeed, it dates back many years to the formation of the original framework convention. I agree that that process exists, but the business of those negotiations is best described, roughly speaking, by the analogy of a large boulder being pushed up a steep hill. It needs a constant effort to go up.

 It is not quite like everything, because if we stop moving forward with some cases of public policy, we just stay stationary. This process is not like that. If the boulder if not being pushed up, it will roll down. In fact, if the G8 summit is seen as a reverse, it will be a reverse. As I found when I was negotiating the Intelsat agreement, there is a terrible tendency in international negotiations for the parties to decide that, if the thing is too difficult, they will turn their attention elsewhere. There is a real risk that, by elevating climate change as a major component of the G8 negotiations, the Prime Minister will have created the basis for a negative impact from the G8 summit that might not have occurred if he had not originally so elevated it.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50629-28_para5">
<a name="stpa_282">The Minister was engaged in a subtle and rather elegant manoeuvre to persuade us that, after all, the G8 summit was no more than a small part. That may be a useful part of the rhetoric of avoiding the problem, but I fear that there is great expectation not just in the UK press, but in the world&#039;s media, and if the G8 summit

Certainly, the Minister and the Liberal spokesman will be as aware as I am from meeting the non-governmental organisations that there is widespread scepticism and concern among the NGO community, which will be reflected into the media.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50629-28_para6">
<a name="stpa_283">How then can the Prime Minister and the Secretary of State, even at this late stage, hope to make some significant progress from the G8 summit? In answering that question we must admit, of course, that it is not the case the US will sign up suddenly or, indeed, at any time to the current Kyoto agreement. Nor is it the case&#151;I very much take this point&#151;that the US will sign up until and unless it believes that China, India and probably Brazil will also come into the fold.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50629-28_para7">
<a name="stpa_284">I accept therefore that this is a jigsaw puzzle and it is a mighty difficult jigsaw puzzle to get right. It is difficult to find the pieces that lock together in the right way. I also accept that that will not occur at the G8 meeting. That need not be fatal if&#151;this is what the Prime Minister ought to try to negotiate&#151;what comes from the G8 summit is not just, for example, a commitment to a nugatory investment in certain kinds of technology or warm words, but rather a definitive process, with a timetable attached, so that people can see that&#151;between the G8 summit and what happens at Montreal and, indeed, beyond&#151;the US, together with China and India, has been brought into a process that stands the chance of creating a new agreement within the framework convention. In principle, that seems an achievable goal.

A process could well be agreed&#151;that is not unreasonable&#151;but it would be arrogant for the eight richest countries to start to agree timetables on a global issue without involving the rest of the world community.

Let us have a process, and not a timetable. What is important is that we make the shift between not achieving a substantive goal that cannot be achieved at the G8 to achieving a process goal that, in principle, can be achieved at the G8.

 I would like to bring my right hon. Friend back to the important point that he made about accountability. At the time, he seemed to restrict his comments to the UK&#039;s performance but, in the context of what he has just said about the international process, does he agree that part of the failing of Kyoto was the lack of international accountability for hitting the targets? Would he support a greater role for an organisation such as the United Nations Commission on Sustainable Development in monitoring and publishing national CO <sub>2</sub>  reduction targets?

<p><a name="st_263"><a name="50629-29_spnew3"><b> Mr. Letwin: </b> 
 There will have inevitably have to be a role not just for more conspicuous national mechanics to constrain democratic Governments into behaving in the long-term interest of their nations but more conspicuous international mechanics for constraining those Governments who do not have sufficient domestic mechanics to achieve that goal. Whether it is the commission that my hon. Friend refers to or another is a matter that must be negotiated and considered, but I am clear that there needs to be a multilateral framework and a unilateral framework within each country. That means that, together, progress is regularly and sustainably made.

<a name="50629-29_para2">
<a name="stpa_288">In effect, we are talking about a curve and it is not the curve itself but the area under it that matters. People sometimes talk as though CO <sub>2</sub>  emissions were a matter of how much is being emitted 50 years from now, but it is not. It is a matter of how much is emitted between now and 50 years from now, and it is important that the area under the curve is right over that period. That will certainly not be achieved unless there is international monitoring of some kind and a seriously enforceable series of mechanisms.

<a name="stpa_289">I wish to make a final point. There is no doubt that there are sceptics about climate change.

Many people regard it as a test of sanity, mainstream political allegiance or whatever that people sign up to the science. 

<br>&nbsp;<br>

But I think there is a severe danger that most of us&#151;I include myself&#151;who have no scientific expertise will try to persuade ourselves that what really matters is whether we buy into the science. It does not matter two hoots whether I buy into the science. I know nothing about the matter, so my adherence to it is of no more interest than whether my 12-year-old son believes that two and two equal four. They do equal four and if he does not know that fact his education is in trouble, but it tells us nothing about the truth or otherwise of the matter, and my adherence or otherwise to the science is equally irrelevant to the truth of that science.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50629-29_para4">
<a name="stpa_290">Moreover, there are plenty of examples in history of establishment views about science proving in the long run to be wholly fallacious. There are cases in which 99 per cent. of all the then scientists took a view and turned out to be wrong. I do not base my absolute belief that we must take the problem seriously, to the extent of actually doing something about it, on an adherence to a view of the science, but on a kind of Pascalian wager. It seems clear to me that if the great bulk of the scientific community who believe that a terrible problem is about to inflict us turn out to be wrong and&#151; notwithstanding the costs that I was debating with the hon. Member for Bishop Auckland (Helen Goodman)&#151;we have invested in a number of harmless and, in many cases, for other reasons, positively useful devices, we shall have wasted a little of our national income. To take her point, even then not all of it would be a waste in economic terms. We could probably organise things so that, in the meanwhile, the place is a little nicer to live in as a result. I do not think that anybody in the world would suffer dramatically from that. If, on the contrary, we do not take the problem seriously&#151;even if we go around saying that we believe in it&#151;and we do not actually do anything about it, and what the great bulk of scientists is telling us is about to occur begins to occur, the costs, in social and economic disruption will be immense. That is a risk not worth taking.

I hope that in my party, and more generally across the nation, we quit that debate and get on with the business, in which we have been engaging&#151;usually constructively&#151;this evening, of trying to work out how we make things happen across the globe and in this country.

In tackling climate change, it is important that the rhetoric of politicians is matched by their actions and I have to say that, on too many occasions, Liberal Democrat rhetoric is not matched by action. That needs to be emphasised. The headline policies are good, but the specifics on how they are to be implemented are not so good.

Of course, they were not against congestion charging per se&#151;they were in favour of it in principle&#151;but they said that that particular scheme was not quite right and had not come forward at the right time. The Liberal Democrats had the perfect opportunity to promote their green credentials, but when it came to actual nitty-gritty politics, their policy had the opposite effect on the environment to the headline policies that they proclaim in debates such as this.

<a name="stpa_297">I intervened on the hon. Member for Lewes to make the point that a national road user charging scheme would undoubtedly require a system to monitor the time at which drivers made their journeys and every journey made. A national system of information collection would be required so that people could be sent bills that reflected the number of miles that they had driven. I then contrasted that with the views of the Liberal Democrats on what would be a much less intrusive national identity register. I make that point because if we ever get to a stage at which we legislate for a national road user charging scheme, I suspect that the Liberal Democrats will be the first to find reasons to oppose it, just as they found reasons to oppose the congestion charging scheme in Edinburgh.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50629-30_para1">
<a name="stpa_298">That is precisely what I think would happen in practice, so I have a lot of reservations about going down the road of thinking that national road user charging would be a panacea. If we were to follow that policy in the immediate five or 10 years, there would be a risk that measures that could otherwise be introduced to try to tackle the growth in vehicle traffic would not be implemented because we would be putting all our eggs in the basket of national road user charging. We have not been able to get consensus on policies such as motorway tolling and urban congesting charges, so I wonder whether we would get consensus on national road user charging. I have reservations about the policy; not perhaps because of the scheme itself, but because I wonder whether we would ever obtain the political consensus to make it possible.

 We are listening to a non-stop attack on the Liberal Democrats. Has that been triggered by the massive fall in the hon. Gentleman&#039;s majority and the fact that he now has a very marginal seat?

 My comments are not motivated in that way. The hon. Gentleman knows full well that I have taken this line of argument on many occasions in the past few months.

<br>&nbsp;<br>introduced, as though it will be the panacea for all our transport problems and the environmental problems caused by excessive transport growth. In fact, the hon. Gentleman is in favour of motorway tolling&#151;a controversial policy in many quarters.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50629-30_para3">
<a name="stpa_300">As well as examining the Liberal Democrat manifesto earlier today, I took a quick look at an interesting website&#151;the hon. Gentleman&#039;s. The section entitled &quot;Norman&#039;s Views&quot; is interesting&#151;and pretty long; he has lots of views on many subjects. On transport, he says:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_39">&quot;on our roads we need to do what we can to persuade people out of their cars and onto public transport, without penalising those who have no alternative. That could for example mean road tolls on some of our motorways where a rail or air alternative exists. Someone driving from London to Edinburgh has a choice to use public transport.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="50629-30_para4">
<a name="stpa_301">I take it that he is suggesting introducing a toll on the roads from London to Edinburgh. It could not be a motorway toll, because we do not have motorways going all the way from London to Edinburgh; obviously he is not aware of that fact. None the less, it is an interesting policy. I am not sure that it is supported by the Liberal Democrat Transport Minister in the Scottish Executive, or even by his hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, West. I do not know whether motorway tolling between London and Edinburgh is Liberal Democrat policy, but I pay tribute to the hon. Member for Lewes for his bravery in suggesting it. He is, however, not so brave as to suggest road tolls in his own constituency&#151;in fact, on his website he says that road tolling would not be possible there. Perhaps that speaks for itself.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50629-30_para5">
<a name="stpa_302">In an intervention, I raised the proposal emanating from the French and German Governments and now being taken forward in the G8 for a tax on air travel. I should have thought that the Liberal Democrats would support that proposal. In view of the criticism that they have levelled at the Bush Administration&#151;much of which I support&#151;surely we must seek other ways of advancing the international agenda. I expected to hear positive support for&#151;or at least interest in&#151;the German and French proposal from the hon. Gentleman, but as hon. Members who were present for his speech will have noticed, he quickly skipped over my invitation to discuss emissions trading and did not endorse the proposal for an aviation tax.
</p>





<p><a name="st_271"><a name="50629-30_spnew4"><b> Norman Baker: </b> 
 Let me correct the hon. Gentleman. I am sympathetic to the aims of the French and the Germans. He is concerned that road user charging might mean that nothing else is done in the years leading up to such a scheme being introduced&#151;which is not our policy, by the way. Equally, if we put all our eggs in the aviation kerosene tax basket, regardless of whether that is the right environmental policy, nothing will happen in aviation until that is achieved&#151;and it is highly unlikely that we will get international agreement on aviation fuel tax. We have to find measures that, in the short-term at least, will be more effective.
</p>





<p><a name="st_272"><a name="50629-30_spnew5"><b> Mark Lazarowicz: </b> 
 I am glad to hear that the hon. Gentleman regards the airline tax proposal with some sympathy, but that sympathy does not appear to be shared by some of his Scottish colleagues. A headline in <i>The Scotsman</i> a couple of weeks ago read &quot;Scots MPs hit

</p>

<p>
<a name="50629-30_para6">
<a name="stpa_303">Interesting though it is to go through their websites, I do not intend to spend all of the limited time available to me attacking the Liberal Democrats. I shall not refer in detail to the website of the hon. Member for South-East Cornwall (Mr. Breed), which mentioned the &#163;700 million investment programme in new roads in the south-west by the Department for Transport. I thought that he would oppose such a programme, but he appears to congratulate the Government on that major new road programme. The Liberal Democrats may have one headline policy, but there are different policies on the ground.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50629-30_para7">
<a name="stpa_304">I am making those points to emphasise that everyone, if we are to tackle climate change, must recognise that the environment is not just a headline policy. We must be prepared to follow through and accept the consequences of policy choices. I accept some of the arguments for differential changing on air routes to the Scottish islands. There is a case on certain occasions for new roads. I am not against all road development, but as politicians we must be more consistent in our approach to those issues if we wish to try to change public opinion and achieve the consensus for which the hon. Member for Lewes and the right hon. Member for West Dorset called. If the Liberal Democrats genuinely want to achieve consensus with the Government they must do more to achieve the conditions in which it will be possible to develop it.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50629-30_para8">
<a name="stpa_305">Having done all that party political stuff, I was going to adopt a less partisan approach but, in view of the time, I shall have to skip that part of my speech. Hon. Members will be relieved to hear that, but unless they would like to hear it, I shall simply make one point. The environment is an unsung success of European policy. Undoubtedly, the European project is under attack from various quarters, but we should not forget that a combined European approach on environmental issues has enabled the 25 countries to reach an agreement on targets for CO <sub>2</sub>  emissions. That would have been unthinkable without the European Union as it has developed in recent decades. Everyone in the Chamber broadly supports the same policy direction on climate change, and most of us support a more effective Europe, so that agreement is one of Europe&#039;s most encouraging achievements in the past few years. It emphasises the fact that there are alternatives to following in the wake of whatever decision is made by the US Administration. The Government have a good international record on providing leadership on climate change, which is recognised in Europe and beyond.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50629-30_para9">
<a name="stpa_306">My hon. Friend the Member for Morley and Rothwell (Colin Challen) said that individuals need to make choices about what they can do to try to tackle climate change. The Government must show leadership, but as politicians we must show leadership both locally and nationally. My earlier excursion on the failings of the Liberal Democrats was a little longer than I

</p>

<p>
<a name="50629-30_para10">
<a name="stpa_307">Finally, I remind hon. Members that they will have an excellent opportunity to display consensus on practical measures to tackle climate change, monitor this country&#039;s performance in controlling greenhouse gas emissions and advance practical measures to promote renewable energy, microgeneration and renewable heat when the private Members&#039; Bills promoted by my hon. Friend the Member for Southampton, Test (Dr. Whitehead) and myself receive a Second Reading on 11 November. I hope that across the House there is support for my Climate Change and Sustainable Energy Bill and my hon. Friend&#039;s Management of Energy in Buildings Bill. Notwithstanding my criticism of the Liberal Democrats, I hope we will have their support. I hope that we will have support from the Conservatives and from the Government for those measures, which will give us an opportunity to take forward in a constructive way the agenda upon which, at heart, all Members who have spoken in the debate today agree.

<p><a name="st_273"><a name="50629-31_spnew0"><b> Mr. Nick Hurd  (Ruislip-Northwood) (Con):</b> 
 I am grateful for the chance to make a brief and, I hope, constructive contribution to the debate. I congratulate the hon. Member for Lewes (Norman Baker) on securing it.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50629-31_para0">
<a name="stpa_308">On the issue of climate change, we are discussing arguably the most demanding test of political leadership that the world faces. As my right hon. Friend the Member for West Dorset (Mr. Letwin) mentioned, the science has moved on to the point where every science agency that matters is telling its Government that action is required. It is time to move the debate on.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50629-31_para1">
<a name="stpa_309">The imperative is to understand better the likely impacts of climate change and to focus on the response. Do we try and control it, or do we focus on adapting to   it? The political difficulties are immense. There remains huge uncertainty about the impact of climate change and the acceptable limits of greenhouse gas concentrations. The need to take out an insurance policy is clear. All insurance policies carry a cost. For that cost to be acceptable, there needs to be acceptance of the risk, not just by the scientists and the politicians who &quot;get it&quot;, but by the public out there who tend still to see the problem as being &quot;out there&quot;. They may be increasingly aware that the climate is less stable, but they are less clear about the link with the choices that they make in their day-to-day lives.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50629-31_para2">
<a name="stpa_310">To be effective, any insurance policy on climate change needs to be global, requiring a degree of international co-operation that has never been achieved. Given these difficulties, it is perhaps not surprising that there is a vacuum of leadership on this key global challenge, a sense of drift reinforced by a lack of accountability. The superpower is clearly not engaged, at least at the federal level and at least until 2008. I shall argue today that there is an extraordinary opportunity for the European Union to fill that void, to leverage the power of the single market, to play a constructive and possibly decisive role in building the coalition of the willing that the hon. Member for Lewes mentioned, and to find a path beyond the first, very small step that was Kyoto.


<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>29 Jun 2005 : Column 1391</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>

<p>
<a name="50629-31_para3">
<a name="stpa_311">It must be for Britain to goad the EU into that role. We are uniquely placed to do so given our relationship with the United States, given that we are one of the few countries likely to meet the Kyoto targets, courtesy of the dash for gas led by a Conservative Government, and because we should see it as the right response to the current crisis in the EU. At the heart of the crisis is the need to redefine the relevance of the EU and to prove its value to a new generation. I would argue that that means giving priority to two things: first, re-establishing the EU&#039;s credentials as a force for prosperity, and secondly, proving that the EU can take an effective lead on some of the issues that we cannot tackle on our own. Climate change should be at the top of that list as an issue of growing salience to the people of Europe.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50629-31_para4">
<a name="stpa_312">What the world lacks, as my right hon. Friend the Member for West Dorset eloquently pointed out, is a framework that takes us beyond 2012. The EU can take a lead in shaping and selling that framework. There is considerable merit in the contract-and-converge principle, but there are difficulties with it and it requires serious consideration. What is clear is that any agreement needs to be acceptable to the United States and the emerging giants.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50629-31_para5">
<a name="stpa_313">To be successful, we need to win the argument that lower CO <sub>2</sub>  emissions need not come at the expense of growth if we act now. In policy terms, that means focusing intensely on more efficient use of energy and the development of technology that cleans up the supply side. It means bringing the world of business and its customers with us, which in turn means talking less about cost and more about opportunity. We must build into any framework much greater accountability and transparency at individual country level and at the international level.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50629-31_para6">
<a name="stpa_314">In building that coalition, there is a great deal that the EU could do to set a lead. I shall give three brief examples. The first is emissions trading. As a Conservative, I believe that emissions trading should be at the heart of a global market-led solution to the problem. The EU emissions trading scheme should be seen as an opportunity to develop a model for a global scheme. It needs to be robust and it needs to be seen to be robust. Critically, it should include aviation. The Minister sounded optimistic about that, but early signs are not encouraging on either front. Real political will needs to be applied to make an emissions trading scheme work and be seen to work.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50629-31_para7">
<a name="stpa_315">The second example is the Prime Minister&#039;s favourite topic, the common agricultural policy. If the taxpayer is to subsidise farming, let us ensure that we get more bang for our buck. The link has been made with protecting the environment. Why not use the subsidies to incentivise the production of crops for biofuels, which have the capacity to transform the environmental impact of road traffic?
</p>

<p>
<a name="50629-31_para8">
<a name="stpa_316">The third matter on which the EU could take a lead is developing technology, for example, clean coal. I congratulate the Government on their recent carbon capture and storage initiative, but we must acknowledge that its impact on the global problem will be marginal. Let us consider the huge coal reserves in the United States and China and face the fact that coal is here to stay. The challenge is to develop clean coal. Rather than mucking around with small, unilateral initiatives, it is 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>29 Jun 2005 : Column 1392</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>time for the EU to take a bold step and gather international support for a large-scale demonstration project of a clean-coal power plant in India or China.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50629-31_para9">
<a name="stpa_317">The Prime Minister rightly identified climate change as a priority. He is in a position to show the same leadership as Mrs. Thatcher when she put the issue on the political agenda. Britain can be a role model in showing the world that emissions can be cut at little or no cost to economic growth. However, before anyone listens to us we must set our house in order.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50629-31_para10">
<a name="stpa_318">The Government have rightly set ambitious targets, but carbon emissions have risen on the Prime Minister&#039;s watch and that stark fact undermines our credibility and makes it unlikely that we shall hit future targets. We need a coherent policy framework, which is supported by a process that is more robust in making the Government accountable. Politicians arguably talk too much about processes, but we need a credible road map to reach the long-term targets. It is sensible to break down the targets into shorter-term milestones, backed with a more transparent plan for achieving them.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50629-31_para11">
<a name="stpa_319">I should like humbly to recommend three priorities for domestic policy. First, energy efficiency appears the least controversial aspect on which to focus. Who could argue with the proposition of saving money and the planet at the same time? There is huge scope for improving the energy efficiency of our relatively old and inefficient housing stock, out of which seeps approximately 25 per cent. of our emissions. The Government can play a crucial role in breaking through consumer apathy, which is genuine, by a combination of education and compelling incentives to invest in making our homes and offices more energy efficient. Ideally, those incentives should extend to landlords in the private rented sector and small businesses, for which the climate change levy appears to be an ineffective stick.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50629-31_para12">
<a name="stpa_320">Many people were disappointed by the Treasury&#039;s failure in the previous Parliament to devise new economic instruments to promote energy efficiency. Conservative Members tried to be creative by proposing a reform and extension of the energy efficiency commitment. It is imperative that we find common ground in this Parliament on the way forward on that crucial policy.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50629-31_para13">
<a name="stpa_321">My second priority would be to send stronger signals to businesses, whose attitudes are critical. They need to understand that the environmental agenda can bring opportunities as well as costs. For example, let us consider the motor car. I am convinced that new technology provides the solution to road transport emissions. Rather than trying to force people off the road, the right long-term approach for the Government is to go with the grain of public preference and encourage British motorists to make greener choices by making the least polluting cars cheaper to own through the tax and grant system and establishing a coherent long-term framework of fuel differentials to support the greenest fuels.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50629-31_para14">
<a name="stpa_322">The current market share for the greenest cars and the greenest fuel remains below 0.5 per cent. and that must be too low. It is imperative that we accelerate technology and incentivise the key manufacturers to recognise a global market opportunity, not least when China is on track to be the largest car market in the world in a generation. Britain has a role to play in that process and we are not meeting that challenge.


<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>29 Jun 2005 : Column 1393</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>

<p>
<a name="50629-31_para15">
<a name="stpa_323">The third priority must be to educate consumers and bring them with us. Their day-to-day decisions will make the difference. In that context, I congratulate <i>The Independent</i>, which has been especially effective, not least in its recent expos&#233; of the way in which our standby culture contributes to emissions.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50629-31_para16">
<a name="stpa_324">The link between aviation and climate change presents another opportunity to educate. In 2002, a Department for Transport survey showed that only one in eight people make a connection between flying and climate change. That must cause concern, given the growth in aviation emissions. The motor industry showed a positive example by giving consumers more information on emissions from the cars that they buy. Is not it time to put pressure on the aviation industry to follow that example, perhaps by putting information about emissions per journey on all relevant travel documentation? I stress the importance of consumer education because if we are forced in future down the route of a more aggressive tax regime, which the Liberal Democrats favour, to affect behaviour, it can be sustained only if hearts and minds are won first.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50629-31_para17">
<a name="stpa_325">It is time for Britain to put its house in order and the issue that we are considering should cross party lines. It is time for Britain to lead the EU in seizing an historic leadership opportunity. If it takes the opportunity, the EU will take a critical step in redefining its relevance to the people that it serves.

 I have listened intently to this afternoon&#039;s debate. The forum in which it is taking place&#151;the parliamentary Chamber of the House of Commons&#151;is normally completely unsuited to the topic that we are discussing, yet it has been striking that speaker after speaker&#151;with the possible exception of my hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, North and Leith (Mark Lazarowicz)&#151;has stressed the importance of consensus and the building of coalitions. I do not criticise my hon. Friend for taking the opportunity to expose some of the political inconsistencies in one part of the Opposition, however.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50629-32_para0">
<a name="stpa_326">In my view, climate change is of such overwhelming significance&#151;in the opinion of the chief scientific adviser, it represents the most significant threat that we face and a far greater threat than terrorism&#151;that the conventional forms of debate and parliamentary procedures to which we are all accustomed are increasingly irrelevant if we are to rise to the challenge of formulating policy on the matter. It is striking, too, that I should follow a Conservative speaker, the hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood (Mr. Hurd), who could have delivered his speech from the Labour Benches. With the exception of the three words &quot;as a Conservative&quot;, everything that he said could have been delivered by one of my colleagues or, conceivably, by anyone on the Liberal Democrat Benches.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50629-32_para1">
<a name="stpa_327">I want to dwell a little on how we can do more to build such consensus.

If we continue along the path that we have taken since 1997, with each party remaining nervous of

</p>

<p>
<a name="50629-32_para2">
<a name="stpa_328">I was very taken by the remarks of the right hon. Member for West Dorset (Mr. Letwin) about the need for an external framework within which to operate, and which had public support. His analogy of the sub-contracting of responsibility for interest rates to the Bank of England was an interesting one. I do not know whether we could get an independent body to establish a national carbon budget or achieve all-party agreement on such a budget or some other framework, but the right hon. Gentleman made exactly the right analogy and pointed us in the right direction.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50629-32_para3">
<a name="stpa_329">There are already good examples of cross-party agreement and working on this issue. Only this morning, several of us here attended the inaugural meeting of the all-party group on climate change, whose chairman is my hon. Friend the Member for Morley and Rothwell (Colin Challen). We launched the 25-5 challenge, in which Members are urged personally to commit to an annual 5 per cent. reduction in their own CO <sub>2</sub>  emissions. I think that that is imaginative, that it will take off and that it will gain an increasing measure of public support.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50629-32_para4">
<a name="stpa_330">In addition, the all-party globe group, of which I am the secretary and the hon. Member for Gordon (Malcolm Bruce) is the chairman, will hold an important conference here this weekend that will bring in parliamentarians from all across the globe, including China, India, Russia and south America, and which will be addressed by my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State. The guest of honour on Sunday evening will be Senator John McCain, a potential presidential candidate. These coalitions and alliances are forming and a huge amount of work is being done to reach consensus.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50629-32_para5">
<a name="stpa_331">If, however, we are to continue to build consensus, we have to redefine the nature of the problem. To date, it has been defined as a conventional domestic political issue of redistribution. The whole argument is about who will gain and who will lose, and what are the consequences of any change of policy or redistribution. Hence, when the issue of the role of fuel duty arises, the problem is defined as one of hitting the long-suffering motorist; when the question of the climate change levy arises, the problem is defined as yet another burden on business. We must move away from that.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50629-32_para6">
<a name="stpa_332">To support my argument, I want to introduce the other issue of fossil fuels apart from the science of climate change. The right hon. Member for West Dorset made the point that it did not really matter whether the science was 100 per cent. accurate, as it made sense in its own right to start to make the move to renewable energy sources and a renewable energy system&#151;whether the transfer is from a carbon economy to a hydrogen economy remains to be seen. However, there is another problem that is hardly discussed at all&#151;the whole question of the finite nature of fossil fuels. The purpose of making the shift away from fossil fuels is not merely because of the threat of climate change, although that is the primary reason at the moment, but because we all know that fossil fuels are finite and will one day be exhausted.

<a name="stpa_333">It is remarkably interesting to see in the press in the last two, three or four weeks the increasing number of articles not only about the rising price of oil, but about the onset of peak oil&#151;the concept of the peak of global oil production, after which oil production will inevitably decrease. Many Members will be familiar with the work of various scientists on peak oil. There is now an Association for the Study of Peak Oil, and that Colin Campbell is the leading exponent of the theory. The argument put forward by that association is that the peak will be reached in 2010&#151;far earlier than was previously thought. That does not mean that oil will be exhausted by 2010, but it does mean that from 2010 onwards oil will inevitably be in shorter supply, and as current consumption increases new discoveries of oil will decline and the price of oil will continuously increase.

As a result, the public mood is now far more receptive than ever before to more radical policies to respond to the threats of climate change and the finite nature of fossil fuels.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50629-32_para10">
<a name="stpa_336">To do that, however, we cannot argue among ourselves about punishing motorists or putting more burdens on business&#151;we have to identify the problem as one of national security, and we therefore need a framework that will work in the national interest and help to move us towards self-sufficiency in energy.

 I agree with much of what the hon. Gentleman is saying, and especially with what he is saying about the need for consensus. He mentioned the need for fuel security. Given the shift in the public mood, is this not the time for the Government to make a decisive move on the biofuels obligation?

<p><a name="st_276"><a name="50629-32_spnew2"><b> Mr. Chaytor: </b> 
 I can only agree. Later I will specify aspects of domestic policy about which more could be done. It has been argued that biofuels are not the whole solution and that the acreage of land required to generate the amount currently consumed by our transport fleet would be enormous and unsustainable, but biofuels make an important contribution. It is regrettable that in my part of the country, the north-west of England, there does not seem to be a single filling station that sells biodiesel. I have raised that with the Minister more than once.

<br>&nbsp;<br>external threat and we need to respond to what the public are saying. I think that in many areas of environmental policy the public have moved ahead of the Government. There is an analogy with waste issues. There is now a general understanding of the waste crisis: ordinary citizens recognise that it is impossible to go on putting more and more waste into the ground and they seek a lead from the Government on recycling. We are moving in the right direction in that regard. I believe that the public are ready to accept a lead on climate change and fossil fuel production as well, and we must respond to that readiness. The difficulty arises with the question of costs and benefits. We must redefine the problem. If we define it as something that will simply impose more costs on individual households, businesses and motorists, we cannot win the argument.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50629-32_para12">
<a name="stpa_338">That brings me to areas of policy in which the Government have made great progress, but could do more. Arguably, the most controversial area of domestic policy related to climate change in which progress is needed is transport, and aviation is central to that. The aviation lobby is mounting a huge campaign to resist duty on aviation fuel. It supports emissions trading, but emissions trading is not the solution. The Government have committed themselves to including aviation in the EU emissions trading scheme that will begin by 2008. I do not think that any Minister believes that aviation will be part of the scheme by then. I suspect that it will not happen until many years later.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50629-32_para13">
<a name="stpa_339">According to the Environmental Audit Committee report published earlier this year, or perhaps late last year, if we do nothing aviation will contribute 60 per cent. of our carbon dioxide emissions by 2030. The situation cannot continue and the public know that. While benefiting from and enjoying the amazing increase in the number of cheap, sometimes free, airline tickets, the public understand that the situation is unsustainable. From experience, I would say that they are prepared for the Government to take a stronger fiscal line.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50629-32_para14">
<a name="stpa_340">Biofuels were mentioned earlier in connection with transport. In the Budget, the Government took important steps on the taxation of alternative fuels. They reduced duty on liquefied petroleum gas and also on biofuels, which brings it down to the level of duty on conventional diesel. Again, however, there is much more to be done. The Government have tried to introduce a banded system for vehicle exercise duty. I am not sure how many bands there are now, but the system is designed to encourage people to use more fuel-efficient vehicles.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50629-32_para15">
<a name="stpa_341">The reality is that the existing fiscal incentives to trade down to a more fuel-efficient vehicle are derisory. For anyone currently running a larger-engined, more inefficient vehicle, a saving of &#163;80 to &#163;90 a year in vehicle excise duty is an insufficient incentive to encourage them to trade down. The public understand the principle behind that idea; they are waiting to be given a lead in terms of greater fiscal incentives to trade down. Exactly the same analogy applies to domestic energy efficiency. Grant schemes exist that provide incentives for making greater use of insulation, but those incentives do not yet send sufficiently strong signals to encourage people to make the change.

 I want to join the consensus that was building&#151;with one notable exception&#151;in the Chamber. The exception in question has clearly spent many hours surfing Liberal Democrat websites, and long may he continue to do so.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50629-33_para0">
<a name="stpa_343">The G8 summit in Gleneagles will focus on two themes: climate change and Africa. This time, the public are more involved than ever before, partly because of the celebrities involved, but also because of what happened 20 years ago, when we saw&#151;for many people, it was the first time&#151;the drought in Ethiopia on our television screens. When Michael Buerk brought those images into our homes, we saw the harsh reality of life on the edge: men, women and children suffering from malnutrition, with those who managed to survive the journey trekking miles to camps for a meagre food supply. These events triggered Live Aid, which connected many people, through television and music, to this vitally important issue. Twenty years on, we have to ask, what has changed?
</p>

<p>
<a name="50629-33_para1">
<a name="stpa_344">To coincide with the G8 we have the Live8 concert in Edinburgh, which is taking place at the Murrayfield stadium in my constituency. The Make Poverty History march will also take place in Edinburgh, on 2 July. We are expecting in excess of 100,000 people to march through the city centre, and to make a &quot;white band&quot; of people to send a message to the leaders at Gleneagles. I invite others to join that march.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50629-33_para2">
<a name="stpa_345">When we saw those images in Ethiopia 20 years ago, a drought was expected once every 10 years; now, a drought is expected approximately once every three years. Fewer Ethiopians are dying from malnutrition, but more are on permanent food aid. We now see humanitarian disasters unfolding elsewhere in Africa. Many factors are contributing to the disaster in Darfur, in Sudan: tribal conflict, Government corruption, too many guns in the country and no clean water supply. But one vital factor that is directly linked to the troubles is the increasing size of the deserts, and the battle for scarce resources such as water and fertile land. We in this country think that we are witnessing extreme changes in our weather, but those who will suffer most are the most vulnerable, who live in the world&#039;s poorest countries. Many young children in such countries will never see adulthood.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50629-33_para3">
<a name="stpa_346">At the other, extreme end of the scale, approximately 100 million people in the United States are overweight. Interestingly, Paul Higgins, an earth systems scientist from the university of California, reckoned that if the food energy used to feed excessively those 100 million Americans were turned into an exercise regime, and if the basic resources spent on producing that food were spent differently, that in itself would impact on the climate.

Friend the Member for Lewes (Norman Baker) will be pleased to hear that I gave up my four-wheel drive car and went instead for a fuel-efficient model.

<a name="stpa_348">Global warming is not an abstract or distant threat. It is real and current, and must be dealt with as a matter of urgency. The G8 nations at Gleneagles account for 47 per cent. of global CO <sub>2</sub>  emissions, so it goes without saying that the G8 nations themselves, acting globally, can make a real difference. Tougher international action is crucial to combat climate change and it is time to wake up to the threat before it is too late.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50629-33_para6">
<a name="stpa_349">Climate variation is now an accepted part of the natural cycle of our planet. We know that, historically, temperatures have been both higher and lower than they are now. However, what makes the current pattern of climate change so worrying is the pace of change. Projections predict an increase in the average surface temperature of between 1.5o and 6o over the period from 1990 to 2100. That is between two and 10 times larger than the value of observed warming over the 20th century and it is without precedent during the last 10,000 years. Global warming will affect us at home and abroad and it will have social and environmental impacts. Indeed, it will impact on almost every aspect of our lives. It is not surprising that our own chief scientific adviser said that the threat from climate change was greater than that from global terror.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50629-33_para7">
<a name="stpa_350">The Kyoto agreement was a good and positive first step towards tackling the issue, but even if the US signed up to it tomorrow, it would not solve many of the problems. We have to remember that the agreement is very much a first step&#151;and a modest one at that. For example, it does not include many developing countries and the largest polluter of all has not signed up to it. Furthermore, many scientists believe that even if the countries producing CO <sub>2</sub>  emissions signed up and kept to the limits, it would still not be enough to tackle the problem. The agreement aims to reduce emissions from industrialised countries only by about 5 per cent., whereas the consensus of many climate scientists is that in order to avoid the worst consequences of global warming, emissions may have to be cut up to the order of 60 per cent. across the board. That is why we should not put all our eggs in the Kyoto basket.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50629-33_para8">
<a name="stpa_351">With that in mind, it is disappointing that so many countries have still failed to meet even those most modest targets. Indeed, it seems increasingly likely that the UK will miss its own Kyoto targets. It does not give the Prime Minister the strongest platform from which to argue for greater efforts from others to combat climate change when we seem unable to put our own house in order. I very much hope, though, that our own failings will not have an adverse effect on the Prime Minister&#039;s chances of brokering an agreement on climate change at the summit.

It is unacceptable that the US&#151;the world&#039;s largest polluter, responsible for more than a third of the world&#039;s pollution&#151;refuses to take its responsibilities seriously. It is unacceptable that the US President, George W. Bush, simply ignores the advice of his own scientists and continues to refuse to take action to deal with pollution or to accept his responsibility under the Kyoto treaty. There is a serious risk that the US President will prevent the summit from agreeing to realistic and timely actions on climate change and that the rest of the G8 will let him get away with it. While the Prime Minister likes to believe that he can sway the President&#039;s judgment on these matters, I believe that, when it comes to climate change, he may have little or no influence at all.

</p>

<p>
<a name="50629-34_para0">
<a name="stpa_359">I wanted to dwell on the Government&#039;s record in this area, which has been one of lamentable failure. I apologise to my right hon. Friend the Member for West Dorset (Mr. Letwin) for breaking the consensus, but my generation cares passionately about climate change and we feel that this Government have missed a golden opportunity to make the changes that are so desperately needed in the fight against it. This country is still woefully behind the rest of Europe in our attitude to energy conservation and recycling.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50629-34_para1">
<a name="stpa_360">I want to make four brief points. First, I support my hon. Friend the Member for Ruislip-Northwood (Mr. Hurd), who said that it is essential, when we debate climate change, to work with the grain of human nature rather than against it. People will always want to use their cars and go on cheap holidays, and we must be aware that great scientific strides will be made as technology develops. Many fuel-efficient, low-emission cars are already available, and they will get better; British Airways has already given up some of its carbon allowance because it uses more fuel-efficient planes; and people are already changing their lifestyles by working at home using the internet. Energy use will change and be reduced through the use of technology. Mention has also been made in the debate of the use of biofuels. Science will find a way.

<a name="stpa_361">Every type of major energy source is available in my constituency. Harwell is the site of the first nuclear reactor to be built in Britain, and Didcot is dominated by the large power station that supplies most of the energy for the south-east.

<p><a name="st_283"><a name="50629-34_spnew4"><b> Mr. Vaizey: </b> 
 The costs are incurred by the construction and running of power stations and by the disposal of nuclear waste. Nevertheless, two of the chandeliers above us in this Chamber are powered by electricity from nuclear power, either our own or bought from France&#151;

We should apply the maxim &quot;Never about them without them&quot;. In other words, we should not talk about the poorest countries&#151;perhaps we could call them the P8&#151;without inviting them to be present.

As people leave the rallies in Edinburgh and the concerts in London, at the Eden project in Cornwall and elsewhere, I hope that they will carry on the campaign. I hope that they will go to supermarkets and ask, &quot;Where does the food come from?

<br>&nbsp;<br>the right hon.

When we bring a hammer down on our finger we can see the connection between the hammer, the finger and pain. We learn from that and we make future judgments on that clear relationship. However, when we turn on the ignition of our car or decide to go on holiday, we do not necessarily see the immediate connection between that choice and some meteorological catastrophe elsewhere in the world or some unwelcome climate change that undermines our efforts to eradicate poverty in developing countries. But, as the right hon. Member for West Dorset argued&#151;I think fairly&#151;we need to apply a precautionary principle to this matter before it is too late. If we are wrong, at least we will have achieved some improvements in the way that we live. On the balance of scientific opinion, however, I feel comfortable with the line that we are taking, and it is clear from the Government&#039;s line and the policies of all parties that we are going in the right direction in tackling this issue, about which, to be fair, there is still some uncertainty.

Member for Exeter (Mr. Bradshaw), who will wind up the debate in a moment, that those words are not a sign that we are going to see the politics of the lowest common denominator.

I do not say that simply because he announced that Conservative Members would support the Liberal Democrats in the Division Lobby this evening, although on that basis I shall resist attacking some of the past Conservative policies and what they have achieved.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50629-34_para13">
<a name="stpa_372">The right hon. Gentleman made a significant point: we in all three parties, as well as other parties, agree that we must face up to some very difficult economic challenges in persuading our electorates that we must make progress. In fact, we need to sell such messages to our electorates. I hope that we can stick together and help each other to sell these difficult decisions and conclusions. Having gone from the sunlit uplands of conciliatory debate, we went to the depths of partisanship with the hon. Member for Edinburgh, North and Leith. However, it is a pity to end on that point, and I look forward to the Under-Secretary of State&#039;s response, but I urge the House to support the Liberal Democrat motion this evening.

<p><a name="st_289"><a name="50629-35_spmin0"><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs  (Mr. Ben Bradshaw): </b> 
 This has been an excellent debate. I cannot recall a debate on an issue of such importance that has commanded such consensus across the House. We heard good contributions from my hon. Friends the Members for Bury, North (Mr. Chaytor) and for Edinburgh, North and Leith (Mark Lazarowicz)&#151;perhaps his speech was not so consensual as others, but he can claim as an excuse provocation by the Liberal Democrats in Edinburgh about the congestion charge there.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50629-35_para0">
<a name="stpa_373">We heard a good contribution from the hon. Member for Edinburgh, West (John Barrett), who should be commended for his action in getting rid of his 4x4 vehicle. He might like to know that my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs often refers to me, only half in jest, as a one-man Government carbon-offsetting scheme, because I gave up my car 12 years ago and now rely mainly on my bicycle.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50629-35_para1">
<a name="stpa_374">There was a good contribution from my hon. Friend the Member for Copeland (Mr. Reed), who set an example to the House in his brevity. I am sure that the debate will continue and he may wish to make a longer speech in future on the issue that he mentioned. We also heard a good contribution from the hon. Member for Wantage (Mr. Vaizey).
</p>

<p>
<a name="50629-35_para2">
<a name="stpa_375">It is invidious to single out a Member for praise in such debates, and I do so at the risk of ruining what otherwise I suspect would be a promising career, but the contribution from the hon. Member for Ruislip-

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>29 Jun 2005 : Column 1404</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>Northwood (Mr. Hurd) was particularly impressive. It was most refreshing to hear a Conservative Member say that the European Union could play a positive leadership role in a major policy issue. <i>[Interruption.]</i> I apologise to the hon. Gentleman if that has damaged him, but it was not meant in that spirit.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50629-35_para3">
<a name="stpa_376">Let me bring the House back to the focus of the debate: next week&#039;s very important summit at Gleneagles. The House recognises that that meeting in itself has stimulated debate and provided a boost to the vital work that is happening at regional, national and international levels. Indeed, the hon. Member for Lewes (Norman Baker) acknowledged that in what he said about the real progress that is being made at state level in the United States, partly as a result of the British Government giving the issue such a high profile.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50629-35_para4">
<a name="stpa_377">We always knew that addressing climate change during our G8 presidency would be tough. There are real differences of opinion about the best way to respond to the challenge. That is why the summit is so important and shows how the G8 functions best when taking on the big issues of the day and reaching out to other key nations.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50629-35_para5">
<a name="stpa_378">Our aims for the summit are threefold: first, to secure agreement about the importance of the issue and the need to cut greenhouse gas emissions and to take urgent action; secondly, to find practical ways to speed up the development and deployment of new technologies, both in the G8 and in developing countries, using a comprehensive Gleneagles plan of action, covering energy efficiency, power generation, research and development, investment and financing, as well as adaptation to climate change; and, thirdly, to reach an agreement to continue dialogue on climate change, clean energy and sustainable development that will complement the existing UN process.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50629-35_para6">
<a name="stpa_379">There has been much debate this afternoon about the position of the United States and whether we should try to persuade the US to sign up to the Kyoto protocol. That has never been our aim. We remain committed to the Kyoto protocol, as do the other signatories. The US, at national level, takes a different line&#151;that is a matter of fact&#151;but there are significant areas of common ground. Just because we have different views on the Kyoto protocol, it does not mean that the US cannot work with Europe and the emerging economies on measures to tackle climate change. The G8 summit provides an opportunity to discuss with the US and those emerging economies what we can do to bring together energy, environment and development policies to create the political will necessary to succeed.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50629-35_para7">
<a name="stpa_380">On this issue, some of the consensus that built up in the rest of the debate was challenged. Although stressing the importance, as he saw it, of getting the United States on board for an agreement, the hon. Member for Lewes seemed to suggest that he would rather have a better agreement without the US than a weak one with it. However, he acknowledged that we can continue to do the good work that we have been doing on the basis of a coalition of the willing. We will continue to do that.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50629-35_para8">
<a name="stpa_381">The right hon. Member for West Dorset (Mr. Letwin) used his vivid analogy of pushing a heavy boulder up a steep slope to suggest that it was important that Gleneagles results in our going an inch up the slope. He appeared to say that he was worried that we were being 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>29 Jun 2005 : Column 1405</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>too ambitious. I do not accept that we are being too ambitious and therefore face the risk of failing, which would be seen as a defeat. We have charted a wise and careful course and, by and large in the debate, hon. Members resisted the temptation, based on misleading press reports that appeared a few days ago, to prejudge what is likely to be achieved at Gleneagles.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50629-35_para9">
<a name="stpa_382">There was also not the degree of consensus that I would have liked on what the UK Government have achieved in terms of showing the leadership at home that we can deploy internationally. It is important to remind the House that, as my hon. Friend the Minister for Climate Change and the Environment said in his opening remarks, we are the only country apart from Sweden that is on course to meet our Kyoto obligations&#151;and not just to meet them, but to exceed them. We are not on course to meet our own much more ambitious domestic targets for CO <sub>2</sub>  emissions, but we are reviewing our climate change programme with the specific aim of getting back on track to meet those targets. As my hon. Friend also pointed out, Labour was the only political party at the last general election to have a specific pledge in our manifesto to that 20 per cent. cut by 2020.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50629-35_para10">
<a name="stpa_383">The right hon. Member for West Dorset made an interesting contribution to the debate about environmental gain and economic growth. This is an important debate to develop further even though we do not have the time to do so now. I urge him to look at the speech made by the hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood, who said that he wished that we would talk more about opportunities and not costs. As my hon. Friend the Member for Bury, North pointed out, this country has achieved cuts in our emissions while having robust economic growth, and we are now beginning to achieve a similar situation on waste. We are cutting waste production while growing our economy. It is no accident that the two countries that have done best on climate change&#151;Sweden and the United Kingdom&#151;have strong records on economic growth. I do not think that environmental gain and economic growth are incompatible; the opposite is true. It is only through sustainable development that we will protect the environment and achieve the sustainable economic growth that we all want.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50629-35_para11">
<a name="stpa_384">My hon. Friend the Member for Bury, North made several constructive suggestions about potential fiscal incentives. Many of us on both sides of the House agree that more fiscal incentives have a positive role to play in helping us to get our own and international targets back on track.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50629-35_para12">
<a name="stpa_385">Hon. Members understandably concentrated on Gleneagles but, as several pointed out, this issue is not just about the G8. It is also about the EU, and its leaders are already showing leadership and setting objectives based on the need to limit temperature increases to 2&#176; C. We want to lead the international debate. We also recognise that the EU cannot do it alone. The international effort to tackle climate change will not succeed unless we get the US and the emerging economies talking. That is why we want Gleneagles to be the start of a new dialogue complementary to the UN process.

 As you know, Mr. Deputy Speaker, I have long been a strong advocate of the city of Liverpool, and tonight will be no exception. Even though I take issue with the conduct and procedures of Liverpool city council, I wish to place on the record the fact that Liverpool as a city is making tremendous progress in its regeneration, which is due in no small measure to initiatives emanating from this House and the present Government. That is to its credit. I also give credit&#151;<i>[Interruption.]</i>
</p>





<p><a name="st_299"><a name="50629-36_spmin1"><b>Mr. Deputy Speaker:</b> 
 Order. I am sorry to interrupt the hon. Gentleman, but will all hon. Members who are not taking part in the debate please leave the Chamber now, quickly and quietly? We must listen to the debate.
</p>





<p><a name="st_300"><a name="50629-36_spnew2"><b> Mr. Kilfoyle: </b> 
 I pay credit to the many local businesses and organisations that have taken advantage of the opportunities presented by Government initiatives and our status as an objective 1 area to reinvent themselves and turn the city&#039;s image and substance around over the past 20 years so that it is now a 21st-century city that, to use a clich&#233;, is meeting all the challenges of a modern economy. The House may therefore wish to know why I have taken issue with the city council. I have many reasons for doing so, but I am particularly concerned about the way in which it conducts itself. While it is doing very good work in some areas&#151;no one can take that away from it&#151;it is manifestly failing the people of Liverpool in other areas. I shall give a few examples, focusing on people who most need the city council&#039;s help, including the poor, the homeless, council tenants, and voluntary sector organisations that depend on the council&#039;s assistance.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50629-36_para0">
<a name="stpa_389">There is a litany of mismanagement so that, in local eyes, the city has changed from a city of culture&#151;a role that Liverpool will officially play under the present Administration in 2008&#151;into a city about which the council could not care less. That tendency is particularly marked in the areas that I have the privilege to represent. I wish to put it on the record that two of the most deprived SOAs&#151;super output areas&#151;in the matrix of indices of deprivation produced by the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister are in my constituency. The whole constituency is in the top 1 per cent. of combined deprivation indicators, and it relies extremely heavily on council intervention and Government initiatives to ensure that the people there can share in the opportunities enjoyed by many people in Liverpool and on Merseyside as a whole.


<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>29 Jun 2005 : Column 1412</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>

<p>
<a name="50629-36_para1">
<a name="stpa_390">The council continues to treat shabbily the people who most need its help. I shall give a few categories of people it ought to target, and pick out one or two recent examples to demonstrate the way in which they have been treated. This week, we learned of the classic case of Mrs. Janet Whalley, a badly disabled lady who dropped off her severely disabled son outside an after-school club&#151;an initiative that the Government are rightly promoting. Because of a technical dispute over her blue-badge entitlement to disabled parking she was hauled before the courts. The magistrates were outraged, and threw the case out, saying that it should never have been brought. Mrs. Whalley was awarded &#163;500 costs. That was not good enough for the council, which sacked her for gross misconduct&#151;behaviour which no one in their right mind would attribute to a fair-minded employer.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50629-36_para2">
<a name="stpa_391">I came across the even better example of Nicola Foster, whose case falls into the homeless category. The homeless are always under pressure, but they are under particular pressure in Liverpool because of the city&#039;s regeneration, including new build and the Pathfinder project. The city is going through a period of transition, so we need to deal sensitively with cases at the margins or at the extremes that deserve help. Nicola Foster, unbelievably in modern times, has nine children. For two and a half years, she lived in a hostel near Sefton park. The council offered to rehouse the family in a hostel in Inverness. It wanted to deport a father, a mother and nine children to Inverness, because for two and a half years it had failed miserably to fulfil its duty of care towards those children. By the way, one of the children was offered a place at a local school where my wife used to teach, St. Finbar&#039;s, but because of the domestic situation the child has not been to school for two years. We should not be surprised at the indifference of Liverpool city council towards the child&#039;s schooling.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50629-36_para3">
<a name="stpa_392">Another area in which the council abuses the sensible procedures set up by central Government is in the statementing of children with special needs. Each Liverpool MP has a caseload that would stretch from one side of the Chamber to the other concerning people who cannot get a statement of their child&#039;s special needs. What makes the situation even more pernicious is that the council argues that there is no demand for special needs places in special schools, and closes down special schools so that it can realise the capital assets. The Government&#039;s policy has always been that children with special needs ought to be catered for in a setting appropriate to them. If inclusion is appropriate, that option should be chosen and we would not dissent from it. But if a special needs place in a special school is the appropriate setting, that is what should be offered.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50629-36_para4">
<a name="stpa_393">Many of our children are not getting that. I am dealing with the case of the child of a drug addict brought up by the grandmother, who got him into a secondary school. Because of his special needs, the school could not handle him&#151;not that he was a bad kid, but he was hyperactive. That kid is now in a pupil referral unit for two hours a day, so not only is he not getting help from the very people to whom he ought to look for help, but his condition is being worsened daily by their neglect.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50629-36_para5">
<a name="stpa_394">I mentioned council tenants when I referred to Nicola Foster&#039;s case. Sometimes I despair of a city council that fails lamentably to look after its own stock and fiddles its figures by transferring the stock out and then 

<br>&nbsp;<br>

<br>&nbsp;<br>claiming great success in upgrading the homes in its council stock. Government policies were designed to encourage more tenant involvement. No doubt the Minister would agree that we all want tenants to have&#151;metaphorically, if not literally&#151;a sense of ownership of the changes going on around them. We had a longstanding Liverpool Federation of Council Tenants and Residents Associations, which sent out a letter&#151;I assume to my colleagues, as well as to me&#151;on 17 June. The letter announces the closure of the federation and states:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_42">&quot;This is a serious decision taken by our tenant members and tenant management board as it considered that tenant participation is currently so gravely undervalued by our city council that it severely impacts upon the wellbeing and functioning of a vibrant, independent tenant federation.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="50629-36_para6">
<a name="stpa_395">The letter goes on to list the manifold problems that the federation has faced. It continues:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_43">&quot;A strong, vibrant, informed and independent tenants movement is an asset to any city&quot;&#151;</p>
</ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_44">&quot;The climate in this city does not foster a spirit of empowerment but relies upon a culture of repeated rhetoric of &#039;intentions&#039; without ever considering the means by which &#039;intentions&#039; are merely the first step of the organic process of change&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="50629-36_para8">
<a name="stpa_397">That is eloquently put. That ought to be the case but, sadly, it is not so under Liverpool city council.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50629-36_para9">
<a name="stpa_398">The council has done some good things and there have been some good investments. There have also been some terrible failures, from the millennium centre on Chavasse park to the King&#039;s dock project to the Fourth Grace. Everywhere that the dead hand of the Liberal Democrat city council rests itself, one can guarantee that there will be confusion leading to failure. My great fear, which is shared by people in Liverpool, including business leaders, is that that will bring about the stagnation of ongoing projects.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50629-36_para10">
<a name="stpa_399">Indeed, only today, a newspaper headline read &quot;Paradise &#039;Delayed&#039;&quot;. It refers to the Paradise street project, which is the biggest of its kind in the country. It is a regeneration scheme into which Grosvenor&#151;no mean operator in its own right&#151;is putting &#163;920 million. However, the man in charge of Grosvenor is now asking, &quot;How can you deal with a council that repeatedly obfuscates and delays?&quot; Those are the sentiments of a developer who has put a massive amount of money into the city.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50629-36_para11">
<a name="stpa_400">To show how far the city has come, I say in passing that I recall the Duke of Westminster commenting that he was happy for his daughters to go on a night out in Liverpool because he felt that they were safe there. That is another nail in the coffin of the myths about Liverpool that prevailed for many years. Happily, we have disposed of them. Liverpool is a relatively safe city. It is a good city for business to invest in and it is a prosperous city, which is evolving rapidly. However, the council is acting as a brake on such progress.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50629-36_para12">
<a name="stpa_401">That brake is felt most keenly in the areas where the good citizens of Liverpool who are least able to look after themselves could, in the past, turn to the council for succour. I wanted to be objective about the matter and I examined Liverpool city council&#039;s document &quot;Improving performance&#151;leading to excellence&quot;. It is subtitled &quot;Achievements in 2004/05 against the corporate plan published in June 2004&quot;.

<a name="stpa_417">Most recently, in addition to the neighbourhood regeneration funds and other money that central Government have made available, Liverpool&#039;s successful European capital of culture bid for 2008 will add further impetus to the regeneration process. Indeed, it is already doing so. It is expected to generate some 14,000 jobs and lever in an additional &#163;200 million in tourism in the run-up to the European capital of culture year. There is therefore a success story in Liverpool, as my hon. Friend rightly said.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50629-37_para3">
<a name="stpa_418">In December 2004, the Audit Commission&#151;which is of course independent of Government, and rightly so&#151;awarded a grading of good on its comprehensive performance assessment rating, which was no change from the 2003 rating. The Audit Commission acknowledged, as my hon. Friend has done, that the council had made some improvements, which it identified in education, libraries and the use of resources. Other improvements are expected in those areas, based on the Audit Commission assessment, in the next 12 months.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50629-37_para4">
<a name="stpa_419">In other areas, however, such as social care services&#151;which my hon. Friend has highlighted&#151;housing and the environment, the council&#039;s performance is much more mixed. A number of underperforming areas remain, such as housing, recycling, highways, supporting people and social care. Investments in services are showing some signs of improved outcomes, however. The Audit Commission&#039;s assessment is that the council should be well placed to continue to improve in those areas, in the way it works and in the services that it provides to local people&#151;generally, that backs up the points made by my hon. Friend.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50629-37_para5">
<a name="stpa_420">Let me briefly indicate to the House how far Liverpool has to go in its regeneration strategy by examining the floor targets for neighbourhood renewal funding that the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister makes available. On education targets&#151;the percentage of pupils achieving five or more GCSEs or GNVQs at grades A to C&#151;Liverpool&#039;s most recent figure is 41.4 per cent., whereas the figure for the north-west as a whole is 49.4 per cent. and for the UK overall it is 52.9 per cent. Liverpool is therefore some 10 per cent. behind. If we compare the health floor targets, the life expectancy of the male population of Liverpool is 72.5 years, whereas the national average is 75.9 years. By accident of birth, therefore, the people of Liverpool have a shorter life expectancy from the outset. Those are statistics and real-life facts that we cannot afford to ignore.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50629-37_para6">
<a name="stpa_421">The crime figures show, for example, that burglary dwelling offences per 1,000 households in Liverpool in 2003&#150;04 were at around 30, as opposed to the national average of 18.5. Those are the sorts of problems that we are addressing through neighbourhood renewal and regeneration. Perhaps most tellingly, my hon. Friends who represent the city of Liverpool have constantly referred over the last few years to the target of achieving full employment. The 2002&#150;03 overall employment rate in Liverpool was 59.7 per cent., compared with 74.5 per cent. for the UK as a whole. On education, health, crime and employment, Liverpool&#039;s performance was below the neighbourhood renewal fund floor targets. The situation is therefore serious, and the Government are right to monitor it, as my hon. Friend has asked us to do.

<a name="stpa_422">Let me address directly the question that my hon. Friend has asked me in correspondence and in this debate relating to the reports of the dispute between the council leader and the chief executive of the city council. Two key factors can be considered: either it is an employment matter in which the Government have no jurisdiction and which should be dealt with internally by the council as part of its responsibility for staff management issues, or it is an issue of political ethics and conduct for which the local government Standards Board for England is responsible. It was with such situations in mind that the Government established the board in the first place. As my hon. Friend will know, we are still trying to ensure that it works as effectively as possible. We are working closely with the Graham committee and the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister Committee, which has reported on the matter.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50629-37_para8">
<a name="stpa_423">I understand my hon. Friend&#039;s concern and his desire for Government to be seen to intervene in what is a worrying situation for him, for other Members with an interest in Liverpool and, no doubt, for the people of his city. I must tell him, however, that the Government do not intervene in the affairs of democratically elected councils lightly. The intervention powers that we have are under the best-value regime. They are a weapon of last resort, to be used in the worst cases of performance failure when problems are deep-seated and endemic. As my hon. Friend will know, in the six years for which the powers have been in the statute book, we have used them only twice: in Hackney and, more recently, in Hull. When we do use them, we do so in accordance with a protocol that we have agreed with the Local Government Association.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50629-37_para9">
<a name="stpa_424">In the two cases in which the powers were used, there was strong evidence of failure in service quality and governance. Even then, the Government explored a number of options before using their legislative powers. When they use the powers, they must be certain that they have strong evidence to support intervention and that they are behaving reasonably; otherwise, they are at risk of judicial challenge.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50629-37_para10">
<a name="stpa_425">The Liverpool case now throws itself into the limelight. As I have said, the Audit Commission has rated the council as good. Although its services are not uniformly excellent&#151;far from it, as I hope my statistics

<br>&nbsp;<br>have made clear and as we have heard from my hon. Friend&#151;they have achieved a good rating in some respects, and the Audit Commission&#039;s latest statements about its overall direction have been positive. There are currently no performance grounds on which any reasonable Minister could act under the legislation.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50629-37_para11">
<a name="stpa_426">That is not to say that we will not be taking a close interest in how Liverpool fares. My officials and their colleagues from the Government office for the north-west have been monitoring the situation to determine what effect, if any, it has had on the council and in the city. In the immediate future, we will keep a close eye on the council&#039;s performance on key services and the governance that it offers local people.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50629-37_para12">
<a name="stpa_427">There is no doubt that the events that precipitated the debate are worrying. As has been said, they may well damage the council&#039;s image&#151;the way that it is seen by its partners and potential investors in Liverpool. Like my hon. Friend, I greatly regret what has happened, but it seems to me that the most sensible thing for the Government to do in the short term is give the key players a chance to sort out the problems. I welcome the appointment of Sir Michael Lyons to facilitate arbitration between the leader and chief executive of the council, but we must watch the situation carefully.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50629-37_para13">
<a name="stpa_428">As I have said, our powers of intervention rest on best-value legislation. The Minister can insist on some relatively minor procedures, but the four main powers are to direct the council to take specified action in respect of specified functions, to direct that specified functions be exercised on behalf of the council by the Secretary of State or his nominee, to hold a local inquiry into the way in which a council is carrying out its functions&#151;I think that my hon. Friend referred to that in the correspondence&#151;and to allow the Secretary of State to direct the Audit Commission to carry out a best-value inspection.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50629-37_para14">
<a name="stpa_429">As the main issues highlighted recently appear to be related to leadership generally, and to relationships within the council leadership, I doubt at this stage whether a satisfactory case could be made for use of either of the first two powers. The third&#151;
