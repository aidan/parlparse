<p><a name="stpa_o3"><a name="70302-0001.htm_para3"><a name="07030262000125">Before I start talking about the Bill, I would like to say that I was offered a choice by the Whips Office between harbour revision legislation, which would have been worthy and would probably have become law, or something that I believe is in the interests of my constituents and virtually every hon. Member: the registration of off-road vehicles. Although it will be difficult, I hope to persuade the House, and eventually the Government, that the registration scheme is worth supporting.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o4"><a name="70302-0001.htm_para4"><a name="07030262000126">I have had a terrific amount of help and support from different organisations. I would like to thank Greater Manchester police and the Greater Manchester police authority for helping me to draft the Bill. They have been extraordinarily diligent and helpful in the drafting of the Bill and by giving examples of how and why the current legislative framework does not work. The chief constable has been particularly helpful, as have the chair and deputy of the police authority and many of their officials.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o5"><a name="70302-0001.htm_para5"><a name="07030262000127">I have had a great deal of support from the press. The<i>  Daily Mirror</i> has helped, as have GMTV and the <i> Manchester Evening News </i>in the north-west. My local papers, the Middleton<i> </i>and Blackley <i> Guardian</i> and the north Manchester<i>  Advertiser</i>, have put in a great deal of time and support to help the campaign. The <i> Daily Mirror </i>campaign involved a coupon that people could send to No. 10 or hon. Members if they agreed with the Bill. It showed that there was widespread support for the Bill among the public in urban, suburban and rural areas throughout the country, as hon. Members have also made clear to me. Although I know that many hon. Members are present in order to support the next Bill that will be considered&#151;I will thus not speak for too long&#151;they have said that they have a great deal of time for my Bill and that they will also support it. I was shocked when the Prime Minister came up to me in the Lobby on Wednesday evening, because that is not a regular occurrence for me, or for any other hon. Member. He said to me, &#147;Graham, it would be crazy not to support your Bill.&#148; With such support, the Bill should get its Second Reading.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o6"><a name="70302-0001.htm_para6"><a name="07030262000128">Perhaps my biggest thanks go to Alan Turner, whose son, Jack Turner, was killed in Leigh on one of those wretched mini-bikes. Mr. Turner, who, obviously, was traumatised and deeply upset by that event, has taken the time and effort&#151;and had the considerable courage&#151;to go on television to make the case for supporting the Bill. I thus pay particular thanks to him, and I hope that we can reward him by giving the Bill a Second Reading.</p>

 I suspect that we will have considerable disagreement about the merits of the Bill throughout the day. However, let me set out one point of difference. My hon. Friend said that trikes were one of the reasons for the complaints, but is he aware that the Bill would not even apply to them?</p>

<p><a name="st_o7"><a name="07030262000131"><a name="70302-0001.htm_spnew5"><a name="07030262000951"><b>Graham Stringer:</b>
 I think that my hon. Friend is wrong on that. However, I am sure that we will come back to that point in Committee.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o8"><a name="70302-0001.htm_para8"><a name="07030262000132">These bikes are responsible for one death a month. Just over a fortnight ago, a young man in Greater Manchester&#151;in Oldham, I think&#151;was mown down by one of the machines and was dead on arrival at hospital. The problem is not diminishing; if anything, it is intensifying.</p>

 When I was a member of the Committee that considered the Bill that became the Anti-social Behaviour Act 2003, there was barely any mention of the problem. I realise that there are considerations of not just antisocial behaviour, but safety. My hon. Friend says that he thinks that the problem is growing. Given that we did not recognise the problem in 2003, but we do now, does he have any statistics to show what is causing it?</p>

 My hon. Friend the Member for Chorley (Mr. Hoyle) says that the answer is sales, and my next point was to have been that the sales of these machines have increased by 225 per cent. That is one indication that the problem is getting worse.</p>

 Let me help my hon. Friend in trying to indicate the growing extent of the problem. In the ward in which I live, nine such vehicles have been seized in just the past six months. Councillor Jonathan Knott has organised a major campaign in my ward to get these wretched things off our roads.</p>

 I do not think that any hon. Member has any doubt that the problem is serious, acute and chronic.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o9"><a name="70302-0001.htm_para9"><a name="07030262000138">These machines cannot be taxed or insured because they are not meant to go on the road, but let us not be in any doubt: virtually all these machines end up on the road at some time. It is estimated that there are between 100,000 and 200,000 of them in circulation.</p>

 I congratulate the hon. Gentleman on introducing the Bill, because these bikes create a nuisance in my constituency&#151;I am sure that the same is true in all hon. Members&#146; constituencies&#151;and are an absolute menace to residents. Although the Bill might not be perfect at this stage, may I, unlike the Government, urge hon. Members to let the Bill go into Committee so that it can be improved, because it could make a considerable difference to tackling this antisocial behaviour in all our constituencies?</p>

 I am grateful for the hon. Gentleman&#146;s support. I hope that some of his colleagues will turn up later in the morning and give their support.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o10"><a name="70302-0001.htm_para10"><a name="07030262000141">Part of the problem lies at the start of the process of buying and selling these machines. Anyone in the country can order a crate load of them from China or elsewhere and make a fast buck. There is no control over the process. If anyone has any doubt about people&#146;s intentions, they can look at several websites, perhaps the most provocative of which is called annoyyourneighbour.com. One could contact that website to buy one of these machines. It is not the case that people are acting in good faith, or that they do not know how to use the machines. Some of the vendors and purchasers have the direct intention of causing a nuisance.</p>

<p><a name="st_o15"><a name="07030262000142"><a name="70302-0001.htm_spnew13"><a name="07030262000959"><b>Anne Snelgrove (South Swindon) (Lab):</b>
 My hon. Friend will be aware that I introduced the Mini Motos (Regulation) Bill in the past Session. There are also problems involving the sale of cheap mini-motos at open markets and car boot sales. Has he also considered the regulation of such activity?</p>

<p><a name="st_o16"><a name="07030262000143"><a name="70302-0001.htm_spnew14"><a name="07030262000960"><b>Graham Stringer:</b>
 The Bill would mean that a person selling a bike would have to ensure that it passed certain registration standards. It would also require a person purchasing the bike to be registered as its keeper. That could not be done if people were giving them away as prizes, which happens at present. The Bill would stop many of the problems at source.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o11"><a name="70302-0001.htm_para11"><a name="07030262000144">The case about nuisance and danger to the public has been well made. At a reception in the House last week, Chief Inspector Hayden Roberts made the point that the machines also destroy areas of space that have been given over to the public. He gave an example of a disused area in Salford that had been reclaimed for public use. It had effectively been turned into a recreation area for children and adults, but as soon as it opened, the ground became rutted by these machines and the environment became extremely dangerous because the people riding the machines took over the area.</p>

 My hon. Friend has returned to the subject of the police. I understand that the Association of Chief Police Officers is, for some reason, opposed to the Bill. Will he speculate on why that might be the case and tell us his response to its objections?</p>

 My hon. Friend referred to the way in which these bikes ruin our natural environment. He will be familiar with the Medlock valley, which is in our city of Manchester, and the complaints that those who ride these bikes recklessly are making that reclaimed natural beauty spot a place that is no longer safe for those who want to use it. That is exactly why my constituents, like his, want these bikes to be properly regulated and kept off such areas of natural beauty.</p>

 My hon. Friend makes a perfectly valid point. I know the Medlock valley well, and he is right. I suspect that every hon. Member could give similar examples from their constituency, whether it is rural, urban or suburban.</p>

<p><a name="st_o21"><a name="07030262000149"><a name="70302-0001.htm_spnew19"><a name="07030262000965"><b>Barbara Keeley (Worsley) (Lab):</b>
 My hon. Friend will be aware that I introduced a similar Bill under the ten-minute rule on 1 November. On that occasion, I talked about a junior football team and its coach, who was effectively prevented from coaching the young players by the different types of bikes that raced up and down the pitch. The bikes not only churned up the pitch but made the situation dangerous for that young football team. There are insurmountable problems preventing us from fencing off land&#151;that was the solution that my constituent, Mr. Higgins, suggested. That takes me back to the point made about the incidence of antisocial behaviour. Does my hon. Friend agree that the problem is not just nuisance and the police time spent dealing with the bikes, but the fact that communities face having to fence off open areas? That is a cost and a nuisance, but they may not even be able to do it.</p>

<p><a name="st_o22"><a name="07030262000150"><a name="70302-0001.htm_spnew20"><a name="07030262000966"><b>Graham Stringer:</b>
 I agree completely with my hon. Friend. The problem is not dealt with by the current legislative framework.</p>

<p><a name="st_o23"><a name="07030262000151"><a name="70302-0001.htm_spnew21"><a name="07030262000967"><b>Mr. Robert Flello (Stoke-on-Trent, South) (Lab):</b>
 Does my hon. Friend agree that the problem is not just the churning up of ground, particularly in the winter months when the rainfall makes the ground damp? In summer, people whose homes look out on to green space cannot have their windows open and cannot sit outside because of the noise. That nuisance often emanates from off-road bikes, which are used in an antisocial manner on green spaces that are there for local children to play on.</p>

<p><a name="st_o24"><a name="07030262000152"><a name="70302-0001.htm_spnew22"><a name="07030262000968"><b>Graham Stringer:</b>
 I agree with my hon. Friend&#146;s point completely. Such bikes are a danger to the public and a nuisance, but in many ways the people most at risk are the riders. Tameside metropolitan borough council recently launched an attack on the bikes. It took a number in, and its trading standards section looked at them. It found that none was compliant with the British Standards Institution&#146;s specification, BS 7407, and that the bikes were extremely dangerous. As we are pushed for time, I will not detain Members by reading out the 10 ways in which Tameside found the bikes to be dangerous, but the bikes are extremely dangerous to the rider. The fuel tanks are not safe and the chains on the machines can take people&#146;s legs off. They fall apart, because they are not made properly.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o12"><a name="70302-0001.htm_para12"><a name="07030262000153">Before I come to the details of the Bill, I ask why our communities should be held to ransom by such bikes. When Ministers, particularly Home Office Ministers, say that crime is falling, the claim is met with scepticism not just by Opposition Members but by the public. That is not because of the statistics that Ministers give, but because people who are surrounded by an environment of noise, threat and antagonism simply do not believe that their lives are getting better, and that the Government, local authorities and police authorities are doing what they should to protect communities. That is the top and bottom of the matter.</p>

 I thank my hon. Friend; he is generous with his time. Does he recognise, as I do, that the registration system for which he is pushing will deal with part of the matter? The fact that the bikes are not insured makes a difference, because it means that the NHS does not benefit when an accident involving such vehicles takes place, whereas if a motorbike or car has an accident, there is a claim against the insurance companies. When it comes to these bikes, the NHS is a loser, too.</p>

 Is my hon.

If the bikes were registered, police could identify the owner easily and quickly. It is nonsense for someone to argue against registration and still say that they have sympathy with people whose lives are being made difficult.</p>

 My hon. Friend makes a point that I was just about to make. The Bill is not a total solution; there is no total solution to antisocial behaviour and nuisance, but we can reduce it. Laws do not prevent people from murdering each other, and they do not prevent theft or burglary, but laws can help to reduce crime, because of the threat of penalties and the likelihood of getting caught.</p>

 I am grateful to my hon. Friend, who is kind in giving way again. He has not yet mentioned the issue of educating parents who buy mini-motos for their youngsters. Does he agree that one benefit that may result from his Bill is that it may make parents realise what they are buying? As he has made clear, for a variety of reasons the bikes are often death traps for the young people who use them. Does he agree that the Bill may lead to better education for parents who buy the machines?</p>

<p><a name="st_o38"><a name="07030262000167"><a name="70302-0002.htm_spnew4"><a name="07030262000982"><b>Graham Stringer:</b>
 Again, my hon. Friend makes a point that I shall make. Many parents buy the machines believing that they are toys, but they are not; they are dangerous machines that can travel at up to 60 mph. Having to register as keepers and having to register the machine would be part of that education, as it would make it clear that the bikes are not toys.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o13"><a name="70302-0002.htm_para0"><a name="07030262000168">The Bill is not a complete solution, but it would amend the Vehicle Excise and Registration Act 1994 so that the current system of registration for vehicles on the road were extended to off-road vehicles. It is not a licensing scheme; a licensing scheme is, in effect, a road tax, but the machines that we are talking about are not meant to go on the road. The Bill would amend the 1994 Act so that the machine and its keeper were required to be registered at the time of sale. In a sense, the Bill is retrospective, because it would also oblige current users to register at some time, and, as I said, there are between 100,000 and 200,000 such machines in circulation. That time can be defined in regulations. Clearly, there would have to be an amnesty before that obligation were implemented.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o14"><a name="70302-0002.htm_para1"><a name="07030262000169">Registration would require the manufacturers to put registration marks on the machines. Some of those marks would be recognisable to the public, but others would be secret&#151;similarly, we cannot find all the registration marks on our cars&#151;and the regulations would require both kinds. My hon. Friend the Minister may say that that is not covered by the Bill, but it could be covered by changing the relevant regulations. There are many powers in the 1994 Act that could be used to cover registration. A moot point is whether there should be a registration plate, as there are arguments for and against that. I have not come to a final decision&#151;on balance, I think that it is helpful to have a registration plate&#151;but the matter could be debated in Committee. Clause 2 amends section 59 of the Police Reform Act 2002, and effectively gives police officers the right, if they have due cause, to stop a bike without warning and if it does not comply with registration  <br>

measures&#151;I know that this will raise a cheer&#151;take it away and squash it. Most hon. Members are in favour of squashing those machines when possible.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o15"><a name="70302-0002.htm_para2"><a name="07030262000170">It is worth going through the arguments that have been made against the Bill by the Government and the Association of Chief Police Officers, to which my right hon. Friend the Member for Knowsley, North and Sefton, East (Mr. Howarth) referred. The Government&#146;s position, which is made clear in a document circulated to all hon. Members, is that all the necessary powers are provided by the current legislative framework in several different Acts of Parliament. I accept that the Government are acting in good faith, but if police authorities had to use all those powers, they would take up so much time and resources that they probably would not have much time to do anything else. It is true that powers are available to deal with one bike in one situation, as long as the police have a handy helicopter, a police car, and police officers trained on off-road bikes, as well as the necessary information to show that the bike belongs to the person riding it, who cannot argue that it belongs to their mate, so it can be taken away. However, if that law is in place, why were 26,000 complaints made in Greater Manchester last year? Greater Manchester police authority is one of the best equipped authorities to deal with the problem, as it has a dedicated unit. It has dealt with the problem in certain places, but it cannot eradicate it, as the law is not effective.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o16"><a name="70302-0002.htm_para3"><a name="07030262000171">My hon. Friend the Minister told me in private that ACPO&#146;s position formed the basis of the Government&#146;s position; if ACPO changed its position, the Government would change theirs. However, after all the discussions, I am not sure whether ACPO&#146;s position reflects the Government&#146;s or whether the Government&#146;s position reflects ACPO&#146;s, so it is worth examining ACPO&#146;s comments in detail.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o17"><a name="70302-0002.htm_para4"><a name="07030262000172">Fortunately, ACPO representatives appeared before the Select Committee on Transport on 7 March, so we had the opportunity to discover what they believed. In written evidence, ACPO said that it was satisfied with the law, and asked what was the point&#151;I urge hon. Members to ponder this&#151;in making something that was unlawful more unlawful. I was not quite sure what that meant and, having examined its representatives, I am not sure that they know what it means. It is a way of saying that ACPO does not want to consider more effective measures to deal with the problem.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o18"><a name="70302-0002.htm_para5"><a name="07030262000173">In its written evidence, ACPO qualified its opposition by admitting that a registration scheme could have long-term benefits and could save resources. The Select Committee examined the ACPO representative, Mr. Griffin, in detail, and asked him whether it would be beneficial to do what most hon. Members want, and allow police officers to stop and seize a bike without warning. He accepted that that was right. We then asked whether a registration scheme would be helpful in cases in which the police did not know the owner, and the rider said that the bike was not theirs. He accepted that it probably would be helpful, as that was a problem. We then asked him about registration plates. Police forces have tried to tackle the problem, but it has escalated and intensified, as people using such bikes simply drive off. There is a limited number of off-road-trained police, so those people often get away, as officers are simply not available. We asked Mr. Griffin whether a registration  <br>

plate would be helpful in preventing chases, as officers could go to someone&#146;s home and find out whether they were the bike&#146;s registered keeper. If the bike did not have a registration plate, it could be confiscated. He said, &#147;That is true.&#148;</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o19"><a name="70302-0002.htm_para6"><a name="07030262000174">As I suggested to my hon. Friend the Member for Stoke-on-Trent, South (Mr. Flello), the bikes are not toys. If someone registers their vehicle and pays a sum of money, they have important responsibilities as a keeper, including responsibility for the safety of the machine. We asked whether it would be helpful to make that point when the bike was sold, and we were told in unequivocal terms, &#147;Yes, it would.&#148; Although ACPO&#146;s headline position is against the Bill, when one looks at the evidence in detail one can see that it accepts that the scheme would work rather well.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o20"><a name="70302-0002.htm_para7"><a name="07030262000177">As there is still a problem, we asked ACPO what the solution was. It accepted that certain areas could be targeted, but in many cases in which that had been done, there was often a resurgence of the problem after the initial removal of machines. It said that it could provide facilities such as those provided for skateboarders. We asked about the cost of doing so, and whether it would solve the entire problem. Would there be a special area for the mini-bikes in every constituency or part of a constituency? Of course not: there are no resources left to deal with that. Finally, in a rather despairing way, the ACPO representative said that hula hoops and skateboards had disappeared, so perhaps mini-bikes would disappear, too. That was an expression of hope that the problem will go away, rather than an attempt to tackle the problem by making the law more effective so that it can deal with people who refuse to reveal identification of ownership. </p>

<p><a name="stpa_o21"><a name="70302-0002.htm_para8"><a name="07030262000178">I accept that setting up a scheme involves costs, but I urge my hon. Friend the Minister in what, I suspect, will be a lengthy response, to explain why, if registration is a bad idea, the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency operates a voluntary scheme? That scheme helps owners and keepers, as it deals with the problem of stolen vehicles&#151;at present, that is the only way of dealing with the problem&#151;and the Bill would assist with that. As the voluntary scheme is already in place, registration would be sensible, even if there is a cost. To be blunt, it could be self-financing&#151;I am sure that my hon. Friend will offer some horrifically high registration fees that will wind up the motorcycling lobby&#151;and I am not convinced that a scheme that is added on to the DVLA scheme would require a large fee. However, I hope that the vast majority of these machines will not get through the registration process&#151;that it will get rid of them. If that happens, any overhead costs of the scheme will obviously have to be met by the Government and the DVLA. I would say that that is a cost well worth paying.</p>

 I shall not detain the House long. I suspect others will seek to do that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o23"><a name="70302-0002.htm_para10"><a name="07030262000181">In broad terms, the Liberal Democrats support the Bill. The hon. Member for Manchester, Blackley (Graham Stringer) does the House and his community a great service by introducing the Bill. Earlier this week, he organised for Members a helpful briefing by the Greater Manchester police authority and officers of that authority that established very effectively the case that he expanded on today.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o24"><a name="70302-0002.htm_para11"><a name="07030262000182">For the reasons that the hon. Gentleman outlined, we can all agree that the machines are a social menace. Many safety implications have arisen from the explosion in their use. According to a briefing from the Motor Cycle Industry Association, the number of mini-motos alone, quite apart from other off-road motorcycles, has risen from 10,000 in 2002 to 100,000 in 2005. That is the scale and nature of the problem. There is doubtless an element of fashion in that, but the phenomenon seems to be enduring, and even if it is not, that is no reason for failing to act in the way that he suggests.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o25"><a name="70302-0002.htm_para12"><a name="07030262000183">The hon. Gentleman spoke from his constituency perspective. I have a very different constituency perspective. I am delighted to say that, as yet, there is not a marked problem in my constituency; no doubt it will come to us eventually, like everything else. However, I have some experience to bring to the debate, having worked as a prosecutor and a defence agent in the criminal courts before coming to this place. As a prosecutor in particular, I formed a view over a number of years that the most effective legislation for the prosecution of road traffic offences is section 172 of the Road Traffic Act 1988.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o26"><a name="70302-0002.htm_para13"><a name="07030262000184">The purpose and effect of section 172 is to require the registered keeper of a vehicle under the Vehicle Excise and Registration Act 1994 to give information about who was driving the vehicle at a time when it was seen to be committing an offence under the Road Traffic Act. In terms of the antisocial nuisance, that is the real benefit of a registration scheme. If we bring these off-road vehicles, in particular mini-motos, within the ambit of the Vehicle Excise and Registration Act, we allow police officers investigating their use to employ section 172 of the Road Traffic Act.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o27"><a name="70302-0002.htm_para14"><a name="07030262000185">In practical terms, that means that, if the parent has registered the vehicle, it is the parent to whom the police officers will go in the first instance to say, &#147;This mini-moto was being driven in this place at this time in this way. Who was driving it?&#148; That brings responsibility right back to the door of the parent and means that they are required to co-operate with the police. Failure to do so is a further offence.</p>

 I am following the logic of the hon. Gentleman&#146;s argument, which seems sound. Presumably that would cover the full range of potential offences, including manslaughter.</p>

by dangerous driving and causing death by careless driving, so to all intents and purposes, the hon. Gentleman&#146;s supposition is correct.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o28"><a name="70302-0002.htm_para15"><a name="07030262000188">Section 172 is one of the most important tools that police officers have for road traffic enforcement. As I know from experience, what constitutes a road can be a lot more than just a stretch of tarmac. The hon. Member for Manchester, Blackley said that there were problems about police officers not being able to pursue people in the way that they would wish. The provision means that they would have the opportunity of using section 172.</p>

 In my part of Scotland, there is a major problem. I stay on the biggest council estate in Midlothian and every day these cycles run up and down the park destroying the life of everybody round about. As a police officer told me, a major benefit of registration would be that people could take a photograph with their mobile phone camera. They would not need to get involved with the individual riding the cycle, which is another problem or need to challenge them. They could simply take a photograph and give it to the police, who could follow it up if there was a registration number.</p>

 That is exactly the point. If the police were given a photograph of a bike being used in that way, or perhaps even a short video of it, that would give them grounds to employ section 172, leading to the investigation and apprehension of the person who was responsible.</p>

I do not understand even that point. If hon. Members have regard to the Bill&#151;when all else fails, it is a good idea to read the Bill&#151;it states that the</p>

 If the Bill defined vehicles in the way that the hon.

Tricycles have been specifically missed out of the Bill for some reason, although I entirely accept that, if the Bill went into Committee, we could include them, but we would have to put in a vast amount of other things to make the measure even remotely work in the way that is intended.</p>

One was sent by a young couple who could not sit in their garden with their baby daughter all last summer because a nearby field that was once filled with children playing and families walking their dogs contained these monstrously noisy machines. The couple first approached me in despair after one Sunday in June, when the bikes made continuous and uninterrupted noise for seven consecutive hours. Another constituent from Davenport said that youths were deliberately driving at people in the fields.</p>

The youths ignored a polite request from the woman to switch off their bikes until the horses had passed. Instead, they rode their bikes quickly towards the horses three times. On the third occasion, one bike went up the banking while the other two were driven straight at the horses.</p>

 It is an irony that, during proceedings on the Natural Environment and Rural Communities Act 2006, we spent some time discussing how to prevent pathways such as the Ridgeway from being churned up by off-road vehicles, yet the Government oppose this Bill, which would help to regulate off-road vehicles on bridlepaths.</p>

 I entirely agree. It is important to encourage horse riding in urban areas, such as the area which I represent. If riders feel that they cannot ride safely on open space, it will discourage people from taking up a very good sport. The woman told me that she doubts whether she will ever use that bridlepath again, which illustrates my hon. Friend&#146;s point. It is wrong that people are being frightened away from our public open spaces by selfish youths on noisy machines. We must reclaim those spaces for our communities.</p>

It is no exaggeration to say that, in the wrong hands, they have the lethal potential of a loaded gun.

 I agree with my hon. Friend. Off-road motorcycles are used by young adults&#151;18-year-olds, 19-year-olds and people in their early 20s are involved.

Blackley pointed out, however, the police could immediately confiscate the bikes when they catch such youths under the Bill.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o38"><a name="70302-0003.htm_para2"><a name="07030262000211">Last summer, I was concerned about the level of nuisance in my constituency and wrote to residents urging them to report every incident to the police. I also met the police and urged the local crime partnership to explore the use of antisocial behaviour orders to ban individuals from using such bikes, and I still believe that that is a long-term solution.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o39"><a name="70302-0003.htm_para3"><a name="07030262000212">Last year, I was pleased when the Home Office initiated a six-week summer campaign against the bikes, which led to tough enforcement action by the local police. In Stockport, 43 people received warnings and 20 cycles were subsequently seized, which is the central point of the Bill. Greater Manchester police have said that they cannot seize a bike causing nuisance without first issuing a warning, and although they are putting up notices at the entrance to public spaces warning that it is illegal to ride cycles there, it is untested in law whether that satisfies the requirement to give a warning. As I understand it, vehicles need to be insured only if they are used on a public highway, so the power of immediate seizure without warning in relation to uninsured vehicles would not apply to off-road motorcycles being used on public open space.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o40"><a name="70302-0003.htm_para4"><a name="07030262000213">One reason why I support the Bill is because it will strengthen the law to allow the police to seize unregistered bikes or bikes on which the markings have been erased, without having to give a warning, which would deal with the Minister&#146;s point. The people involved go to certain areas and know that they are breaking the law&#151;they mask themselves to disguise who they are. Under the Bill, the fact that they have taken the markings off their bikes would give the police the ability to confiscate them immediately, which would make it easier for the police to get more bikes that are causing a nuisance and breaking the law out of action more quickly. Those who persistently break the law by riding in public places are also likely to be riding unregistered bikes. The Government gave that power to the police in relation to uninsured vehicles to allow those vehicles to be taken off the road more quickly, so why not give the same power in relation to bikes?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o41"><a name="70302-0003.htm_para5"><a name="07030262000214">A registration scheme would make it easier to arrest dangerous and illegitimate drivers. As my hon. Friend the Member for Manchester, Blackley said, the DVLA already has a voluntary registration scheme, which is a good thing. It would be interesting to hear from the Minister how many people have registered. If he thinks that the scheme is a good thing, how would he encourage more people to register? The way to get everyone registered is to make it compulsory. The registration scheme offers protection to motorcycle owners against theft. The Bill would establish a registered keeper and provide better protection for legitimate owners.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o42"><a name="70302-0003.htm_para6"><a name="07030262000215">The Bill would also target suppliers. Customers have no way of knowing whether they are buying stolen property, as there are no requirements to provide documentation. A registration scheme would ensure that keeper records were logged and traceable. At last, it would begin to make those adults who are thoughtless enough to buy potential killing machines  <br>

in the shape of mini-motos as Christmas presents to be held responsible for how the bikes are used. Registration would send out a message to parents that these machines are not toys and that they require control. At the moment, it is difficult to track these bikes&#151;13,000 new off-road bikes were officially imported and sold in the past 12 months, and 40,000 were illegally imported.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o43"><a name="70302-0003.htm_para7"><a name="07030262000216">During my research, I was shocked to come across a website selling such pocket bikes that had an unsavoury and aggressive title and logo. If you will excuse the language, Madam Deputy Speaker, I shall tell the House its name: &#147;StreetBastard.com&#148;. I found it interesting, because the title itself makes it clear that the company targets its products at a clientele who want to glory in making a nuisance of themselves on the streets. Incidentally, I also discovered from the website that a new so-called dirt bike will be hitting the streets in May 2007.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o44"><a name="70302-0003.htm_para8"><a name="07030262000217">I was pleased to hear that a Stockport-based firm called Dealer Channel, which brought thousands of dangerous mini-motorbikes to Greater Manchester, has been put out of business. The company boss was hauled before the courts and fined after he admitted supplying unsafe bikes. The business went into liquidation and about 2,000 bikes have been confiscated and crushed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o45"><a name="70302-0003.htm_para9"><a name="07030262000218">As my hon. Friend the Member for Manchester, Blackley said, complaints about mini-motos and off-road bikes account for 40 per cent. of calls to the police about antisocial behaviour. However, the police tell me that off-road bikes and mini-motos are also at the heart of antisocial behaviour in other, more sinister ways. Mini-motorbikes are routinely found at the houses of drug dealers when police conduct raids. Many drugs drop-offs are done using such bikes, which are very manoeuvrable. Furthermore, a scarf wrapped around the rider&#146;s helmet provides anonymity.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o46"><a name="70302-0003.htm_para10"><a name="07030262000219">The Bill would give the police the power to seize unregistered bikes from the homes of drug dealers immediately; under current legislation, they have that opportunity only if the bikes are being ridden illegally on the road by a drug dealer. They would not be able to confiscate the bikes if they were lying idle.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o47"><a name="70302-0003.htm_para11"><a name="07030262000220">Currently, there is little chance of establishing the ownership of a particular bike, as most who buy them do not log the frame or engine numbers. If all off-road bikes, including go-peds, mini-motos, petrol scooters and quad bikes, were registered compulsorily with the DVLA and had to carry a visible registration number, it would rob the riders of their anonymity and help prevent them from treating the police and their fellow residents with contempt.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o48"><a name="70302-0003.htm_para12"><a name="07030262000221">I hope that the Bill will have a Second Reading and that, following further consideration in Committee, the Minister will be convinced of its merits.</p>

Members for Rhondda (Chris Bryant) and for Worsley (Barbara Keeley) have also done so. That shows the weight of concern on the Labour Benches.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o49"><a name="70302-0003.htm_para13"><a name="07030262000223">I should say to other hon. Members that one way of getting mini-motos off the streets of their constituencies is to introduce a ten-minute Bill on them. I received many complaints from my constituents between shortly after my election in 2005 and 25 October last year, when I introduced my ten-minute Bill. By December, the complaints had dropped remarkably. I commend my local police and the antisocial behaviour teams for their work on the issue. However, we need regulation.</p>

<p><a name="st_o58"><a name="07030262000224"><a name="70302-0003.htm_spnew7"><a name="07030262001002"><b>Dr. Ladyman:</b>
 Does my hon. Friend&#146;s point not prove that the powers are there and that it is just a matter of getting the police to make use of them?</p>

 I thought that my hon. Friend might say that, so I was going on to say why I specifically support the Bill. I agree with the Minister that there are powers to seize and ways in which antisocial behaviour teams, the police and local councils can work together. Labour Members encourage that. I work very hard in my constituency to knock heads together, when necessary, to make it happen.</p>

<p><a name="st_o60"><a name="07030262000226"><a name="70302-0003.htm_spnew9"><a name="07030262001004"><b>Mr. Flello:</b>
 Might not one reason for the decline in the number of incidents reported in December be the fact that, as the summer months pass and winter comes, the misuse of off-road bikes decreases as it gets colder?</p>

<p><a name="st_o61"><a name="07030262000227"><a name="70302-0003.htm_spnew10"><a name="07030262001005"><b>Anne Snelgrove:</b>
 That is possible, although this winter&#146;s weather has not been particularly bad. There have been a lot of incidents involving young people out on the streets of Swindon, so I think that the decline was due to our local crackdown.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o50"><a name="70302-0003.htm_para14"><a name="07030262000228">I turn to the three reasons why I particularly support the Bill. One important issue is that regulation would mean that there would be information at the point of sale and curbs on irresponsible salesmen and women and on irresponsible parents buying the bikes. That is extremely important. We want to cut the number of such bikes on or off road and to regulate those that come through rigorously.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o51"><a name="70302-0003.htm_para15"><a name="07030262000229">Safety is another issue. My hon. Friend the Member for Manchester, Blackley gave numerous examples of that. At his reception on Monday night, I saw with my own eyes some accidents involving off-road vehicles. I spoke to representatives of his local police, who thought that they had not found one off-road vehicle that was safe. That is shocking. It is important that regulation should ensure that such vehicles are safe on or off the roads. That is what regulation is for.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o52"><a name="70302-0003.htm_para16"><a name="07030262000230">A third issue has not been mentioned: the legitimate racing of mini-motorbikes and other uses of off-road vehicles. When I first came across mini-motorbikes, I thought them ridiculous things. People, particularly young men in their 20s, looked stupid riding them. They looked absolutely daft, and I did not know why they wanted to ride them, although that was their choice. The bikes were also causing the problem mentioned by my hon. Friend the Member for Stockport (Ann Coffey). They were causing trouble in my constituency for those, the elderly in particular, who wanted a quiet lifestyle and to enjoy their gardens.  <br>

I thought that we should ban the bikes&#151;what was the problem? The council agreed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o53"><a name="70302-0003.htm_para17"><a name="07030262000231">Following discussions with organisations such as Honda, which has a successful factory in Swindon that does not make mini-motorbikes, and the British Motorcyclists Federation, I have realised that there is a legitimate industry in racing mini-motorbikes. The vehicles can cost up to &#163;3,000. I accept that that is a legitimate sport and that we need not ban young people from having fun. If we regulate, ensure that the vehicles that they are riding are safe and provide them with off-road areas so that they do not churn up local parks or other green spaces that other people enjoy, there is a way ahead for those young people.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o54"><a name="70302-0003.htm_para18"><a name="07030262000232">I recently visited the Fun-E-Farm, a quad biking track that also accepts mini-motorbikes, in Blunsdon, just outside my constituency. I met parents of young people who rode mini-motorbikes. They were grateful to the organisers for starting the track so that the vehicles could be used safely and legitimately. That is the way ahead. I hope that hon. Members will accept that there is a legitimate way ahead if the proposals for regulation are accepted by the Minister.</p>

 I do not know whether my hon. Friend is using the word &#147;regulation&#148; deliberately, but she has just made the speech that I would like to make. She has identified three areas in which we need to improve the regulation of the vehicles: how they are sold, used and made. However, regulation and registration are different. Changing the regulations would be outside the scope of the Bill. That is why I argue that we need to work to identify what changes to the law are really needed, rather than introduce the changes proposed in the Bill, which are not needed and would have nugatory value.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o57"><a name="70302-0003.htm_para21"><a name="07030262000238">The scale of the problem and its effect on local communities was brought home to me last August by local residents at a neighbourhood meeting in an area of my constituency called Norton. Residents of a very long road, The Broadway&#151;60 to 70 separate families&#151;complained to me about how the misuse of mini-motos was making their lives a misery. There was support from the police but it was difficult to identify who the perpetrators were. They were racing up and down the road and preventing people from coming out of their homes. They were often not only unable to enjoy their gardens but physically frightened to go out on to the pavement. As we have heard, these vehicles are not toys&#151;they can reach speeds of up to 60 mph and have, as we all know, loud engines. They cause profound noise pollution to my constituents at all hours of the day and night, in addition to the damage that they cause not only to open spaces but, in my constituency, people&#146;s gardens.</p>

You may well have had the same people come to you, Madam Deputy Speaker, as that farmland borders both our constituencies. The young people involved damaged the winter crop and were abusive to ramblers and people walking their dogs. It became a no-go area. The farmer estimated that just in the area by the pathway, one incident caused &#163;500-worth of damage. The group appeared to be doing their level best to frighten people. </p>

as young as 10. That can have disastrous consequences, because children are the least well equipped to deal with high-powered engines.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o62"><a name="70302-0004.htm_para1"><a name="07030262000245">I welcome the Bill because a compulsory registration scheme would be a common-sense approach to tackling this nuisance. It would approach the problem at the first point of contact between new buyer and bike, ensuring that riders are aware of the responsibility they are taking on from the beginning and alerting parents to the fact that these bikes are not toys but potentially dangerous pieces of machinery. It is important that parents are aware of what their children are buying, or what they are buying for them. I have two sons of 16 and 13 who have asked for mini-motos because they see them as exciting. I explained, as a responsible parent, that their use, particularly in the areas where they would want to go with their friends, is illegal. It is difficult to explain to young people where and when they can or cannot use them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o63"><a name="70302-0004.htm_para2"><a name="07030262000246">A compulsory registration scheme would mean that bikes would be subject to appropriate safety evaluation. Nobody could sensibly argue that rigorous safety checks can be anything but beneficial given that we are dealing with such powerful machines. Furthermore, I support the argument that such a scheme would significantly increase the efficiency of police action, as a clearer system of ownership would make illegal riders more easily identifiable. The person riding a mini-moto will not always own it, but it would establish a better link whereby the police could take action.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o64"><a name="70302-0004.htm_para3"><a name="07030262000247">I am aware that powers already exist for police to seize and crush vehicles if they are used in a manner causing alarm, distress or annoyance. I completely agreed with those changes, which were a good step forward. However, a registration scheme would make it much easier to identify the offenders. Although some riders may remove their registration plates, there would still be the link with the original buyer, enabling the police to crack down on illegal use. When one is dealing with potentially dangerous vehicles that can reach high speeds, it makes sense that there should be a form of registration to keep track of their ownership, as for cars or motorbikes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o65"><a name="70302-0004.htm_para4"><a name="07030262000248">I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for South Swindon (Anne Snelgrove) that there needs to be an improvement in the facilities available to young people who want to use these machines legally. That is an aspect that we need to explore.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o66"><a name="70302-0004.htm_para5"><a name="07030262000249">Unfortunately, illegal mini-moto use is an increasingly common and distressing form of antisocial behaviour, and with sales of mini-moto-type vehicles increasing tenfold between 2002 and 2005, it does not look as though the problem will go away without action to encourage responsible use and crack down on individuals who are making a nuisance of themselves in certain areas of my constituency. A registration system for off-road bikes would make a real difference to people in Stourbridge. I accept that the Bill would not be a magic cure-all for all mini-moto nuisance, and there will always be people who flout the law, but used in conjunction with existing police powers, better education of purchasers, parents and users about the dangers and responsibilities of using such bikes, and an improvement in the facilities available to riders, it would be a sensible step in the right direction.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o67"><a name="70302-0004.htm_para6"><a name="07030262000251">I want briefly to take up one or two issues with the Minister. He has said that he believes that powers to deal with the problem already exist and that they work. He cited some examples. However, I contend that they do not work and that people who live near every green space in my constituency, including Eltham park, Middle park, Horn park, Shooters Hill park, Eaglesfield park, Plumstead common, the Course, Altash way and Woodlands farm, face a problem with the bikes week in, week out.</p>

 No, I shall not give way to the Minister because he has plenty of time to respond to all the issues that we raise. With all due respect, he can just sit and listen.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o68"><a name="70302-0004.htm_para7"><a name="07030262000254">The problem has grown out of all proportion since the introduction of new powers, including section 59 of the Police Reform Act 2002 and a plethora of road traffic measures. According to Revenue and Customs figures on a Government website, there has been a 20-fold increase in the number of Chinese imports of mini-motos. The number has rocketed from 7,000 in 2001 to 144,000 in 2005. Similarly, the Motor Cycle Industry Association estimates that the sale of mini-moto vehicles has increased from 10,000 in 2002 to 100,000 in 2005. We are not, therefore, considering the position that existed when we introduced section 59 of the 2002 Act to tackle antisocial behaviour.</p>

If the Association of Chief Police Officers had to rely on being re-elected, as we do, perhaps it would take a different attitude to the Bill. The Home Office is targeting &#163;200,000 in 28 areas to try to tackle the problem. If the Minister believes that current legislation is working, let me list those areas: Manchester, Mansfield, Liverpool, Sunderland, Birmingham, Harlow, Southend on Sea, Tendring, Reading, Gloucester, Derby, Coventry, Hodge Hill, Blackburn, Chester, Oldham, Salford, Gateshead, Newcastle upon Tyne, South Tyneside, Hull, Wakefield, York, Camden, Kent, Cheshire, West Cumbria and Newport.

bike on open space. Indeed, police officers are lucky if they manage to stop one because they often cannot chase them. Health and safety regulations restrict their ability to do that because the bikes might rush out of a park on to a road, and that poses danger to the public or the individual on the bike. When they stop bikes, they can issue the rider with a warning notice under section 59. However, if they stop a bike for the second time, they cannot identify it as the same one. That is a key factor in trying to tackle the problem.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o72"><a name="70302-0004.htm_para11"><a name="07030262000260">I can give examples of residents who have complained about noise nuisance on open space and the police have dealt with it. Yet residents have told me, &#147;We phoned the police and they did nothing.&#148; I have then contacted the police to tell them that people had complained of noise nuisance but that the police had let it go on all day. The police have replied that they had been there, issued notices and dealt with culprits, but that the problem is so vast that somebody else was there in the afternoon, and the residents get the impression that the nuisance had continued all day unchecked. In addition, there is no way of knowing whether the same bike went back in the afternoon. Registration would deal with that key point.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o73"><a name="70302-0004.htm_para12"><a name="07030262000261">I understand the Minister&#146;s point when he says that the people who are most likely to use the bikes in an antisocial way are least likely to register them and keep registration plates on them. I accept that. However, if there has to be an engraved registration number or a plate on the bike, and the consequence of its removal is the immediate confiscation and destruction of the bike, that deals with the individual and the problem.</p>

Not only Back Benchers, but the police and the communities that suffer from the plague of mini-motos are calling for it. There is no lack of determination on the part of the police to use the powers about which my hon. Friend the Minister is so confident. However, those powers have loopholes. We have new circumstances and a new machine that is being used antisocially that we did not consider when we drew up previous legislation. A registration scheme that requires those bikes to have a number on them, so that failure to register and number the bike means its immediate removal and destruction, is a tool that will give the police powers to deal with the problem without delay. The public are demanding that it be tackled and I urge my hon. Friend the Minister to listen.</p>

allow the police to apprehend people properly and the local community to monitor the problem effectively. In my area, the police are demanding precisely those powers. The absence of Tory Back Benchers is therefore extraordinary. Perhaps they are hiding, waiting for other subjects to be discussed. <i> [Interruption.] </i>My hon. Friend the Member for Newcastle-under-Lyme (Paul Farrelly) prompts me to suggest that they are waiting to rush in to discuss the measure on temporary and agency workers. The Tory Whips should send a clarion call to get them back in here because the subject greatly affects rural communities. Shame on them that they are not here to vote for the Bill. Their failure to do not only that but to come and speak about it should be recorded.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o76"><a name="70302-0004.htm_para15"><a name="07030262000265">Not only rural communities but golfers, cricketers and footballers are affected. Clearly, Labour Members are their friends. In my community, it is precisely those unregistered bikes&#151;quad bikes, off-road bikes and mini-motos&#151;that cut up the golf courses, destroy the cricket pitches and damage the football pitches. Those are major issues for people, because those things form a key part of the new, healthier way of living that the Government are rightly promoting.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o77"><a name="70302-0004.htm_para16"><a name="07030262000267">I am sure that four Departments&#151;the Department for Culture, Media and Sport, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs and the Home Office&#151;have great concerns and want to ensure that the Minister is making sure that these issues are fully protected. However, another issue has been referred to briefly, but it needs an additional comment. I have done a lot of research into it, to find out how it works. How do hon. Members think that drugs are transported across communities? Do hon. Members think that drug dealers go in registered cars, so that the police, knowing whom to look for, can watch, monitor and apprehend them? Well, the thick ones do, and they get apprehended, but that is not the way in this country that drugs are moved in and out of communities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o78"><a name="70302-0004.htm_para17"><a name="07030262000268">Drugs are moved in and out of communities by depositing them, not usually in people&#146;s houses, but in forested areas, so that if the police find them they cannot directly link them to the dealers. Drugs are moved in vehicles that are not registered. A key way in which that is done is by using this kind of vehicle. Therefore, the problem is not one just of antisocial behaviour, but actual crime and the way in which it is committed. So I strongly recommend this Bill and the following Bill to the House, as they deal with key concerns for the country, and they are clearly concerns that only resonate on the Labour Benches.</p>

currently little scope to establish the owner of a bike, there is no way of knowing the size of the illegal market in stolen off-road bikes and consumers have no way of knowing whether they are buying stolen property, as there are no requirements to provide documentation.

<p><a name="stpa_o85"><a name="70302-0004.htm_para24"><a name="07030262000279">We in the Conservative party acknowledge that there is a substantial problem with mini-motorbikes. Noise nuisance can be substantial and highly aggravating, wrecking the peace of a neighbourhood. Mini-moto use intimidates walkers and riders, as the hon. Member for South Swindon (Anne Snelgrove) said, and in some cases causes real danger to members of the public, as well as to those who ride the mini-motos, which can get up to 40 mph. They can be especially dangerous when they are not properly maintained, and we are fully aware of the tragic case of David Spence, aged four, who was killed in February 2006 after a teenager took him for a ride on a 50 cc mini-motorbike.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o86"><a name="70302-0004.htm_para25"><a name="07030262000280">We accept that Government statistics might not fully reveal extent of the problem. Northumbria police received 3,000 complaints about off-road issues in 2005. Manchester has identified it as one of its top five priorities in an antisocial behaviour crackdown. In Reading, 44 per cent. of &#147;It&#146;s Your Call&#148; antisocial behaviour reporting line calls related to mini-motos. That clearly reflects the twentyfold increase in the number of mini-motorbikes sold since 2001. If the estimates that about 144,000 of them are now in circulation are accurate, that suggests a sizeable problem. However, the Motorcycle Industry Association believes that up to 300,000 machines might be in circulation, with many imports retailing at prices as low as &#163;100, which suggests a problem of considerable magnitude.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o87"><a name="70302-0004.htm_para26"><a name="07030262000282">Funnily enough, perhaps success has caught up with us. Members have cited numbers. The Motorcycle Industry Association has given me figures on imports from China. In 2000, 2,181 units were imported, rocketing to 45,515 in 2003 and an amazing 144,905 in 2005. But in 2006, there was a 58.67 per cent. fall, down to 59,885 units.I wonder whether some of the programmes that local and central Government have undertaken have begun to have some effect.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o88"><a name="70302-0004.htm_para27"><a name="07030262000283">Perhaps such vehicles are starting to go out of fashion. Perhaps the illegality surrounding them is getting through to people. Perhaps parents are becoming more aware. Perhaps some of the police crackdowns and the crushing of bikes have had an effect. Perhaps, in fairness, the Home Office&#146;s summer campaign in 2006 had an effect. The motor cycle industry, particularly the Auto-Cycle Union, has done good work in highlighting the problem, as have local authorities, the police and other associations.</p>

Repeat offenders could be covered with antisocial behaviour orders under the Anti-social Behaviour Act 2003. The local authority has powers under the Environmental Protection Act 1990 to take action on noise nuisance. It may be possible under the Noise Act 1996, as amended by section 42 of the Anti-social Behaviour Act, to seize the offender&#146;s motorcycle and to take prosecution proceedings.

 I think that I made it clear that I have not. I will say for the third time that I come from an extremely rural area. I read the rural press and this issue has not been brought to me with the strength of feeling that the hon. Gentleman has. It appears to me to be a problem of small vehicles sold as toys mainly in urban areas. That is what we should be addressing. That appears to me to be the main problem.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o107"><a name="70302-0005.htm_para18"><a name="07030262000320">Parallel to the enforcement of existing law, I would recommend another course and finish on a positive note. I draw attention to the Auto-Cycle Union local authority support unit which argues for turning this social problem into a sporting opportunity. It states that in the 1960s some terrible drownings in gravel pits encouraged swimming pool building. In the 1970s, roller skate parks sprung up to cater for that craze. Then came skateboards and most recently BMX cycle parks. All were first seen as social problems. All were embraced. Provision was delivered and the social problem disappeared. Now we have mini-bikes and off-road cycling. The ACU offers an incredibly cheap solution. The support unit provides advice to local authorities on how to identify the problem, its size and nature. It has a formula for establishing a facility, a network and venues, which can be community owned and run. What is exciting about the idea is that any tarmac area about the size of two tennis courts, which is incredibly cheap to provide, can be temporarily or permanently converted into a legitimate mini-bike venue for very little expense.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o108"><a name="70302-0005.htm_para19"><a name="07030262000321">The mechanism that the ACU recommends is extremely cost-effective when contrasted with the sums being spent monthly by local authorities on enforcement. I talked to Dave Luscombe yesterday, who told me that Durham police have set up a recreational mini-bike project using the empty police headquarters car park on Saturdays. All that is needed is an area of tarmac the size of a couple of tennis courts, as I said. There are a couple of car parks in virtually every town that are probably unused at certain times. A few old cones mark off the track. In Durham, the children pay &#163;5 for membership and &#163;2.50 per day. Parents must escort the bikes to the venue and stay all day, and they have since become involved as marshals, turning the sessions into social events. The police work with shops that supply the bikes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o109"><a name="70302-0005.htm_para20"><a name="07030262000322">As the hon. Member for Manchester, Blackley (Graham Stringer) said, these machines are incredibly dangerous when they are badly maintained. The shops are getting involved&#151;some of them are sponsoring equipment such as helmets and gloves. When these machines are used in an extremely dangerous manner around the streets, no one checks the tyre pressures, the brakes and the accelerator cable. Under the conditions in Durham, those who supply the bikes are closely engaged and the machines are safe. The result has been dramatic.</p>

There has been another ratcheting up between 2004 and 2005: in 2004, there were 68,295 MUPPs&#151;not all ridden by &#147;muppets&#148;, I am sure&#151;whereas in 2005 there were 144,905. It is interesting that there have been such increases. Will the Minister share with us any thoughts that he might have about the reasons for those increases between 2002 and 2003 and 2004 and 2005? The hon. Member for North Shropshire has addressed some of the reasons why MUPPs have started to go out of fashion, and it might be for that reason that their numbers declined in 2006, the last full year for which we have figures. Certainly, MUPPs can, when ridden by &#147;muppets&#148;, cause nuisances and problems, and they have steadily increased. That is still a cause for concern.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o120"><a name="70302-0006.htm_para6"><a name="07030262000336">The issue of fixing number plates to such vehicles has not been sufficiently addressed by us. If the intention of registration&#151;or a possible offshoot of having vehicles registered&#151;is that the bikes must have a registration plate, the Motor Cycle Industry Association rightly raises concerns about when MUPPs are used in competitive sport. It makes the point that a plastic plate could shatter. Therefore, there might be a constant need throughout a race day to repair and replace number plates if they are plastic. It also raises the point that if the plates were not plastic but metal, what would happen if one of them came off or broke? What would be the potential dangers of that? Off-road motorbikes are dangerous at the best of times, and if they are not used properly they can cause many  <br>

difficulties. There are injuries even at the most carefully organised and controlled competitive events. If there were metal plates, which can be sharp-edged and might fly off, that could cause greater injuries&#151;even fatalities&#151;and if there were plastic plates, shards could fly off and cause injuries, not only to those taking part but to the many spectators.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o121"><a name="70302-0006.htm_para7"><a name="07030262000337">The Motor Cycle Industry Association raises the matter of enforcement as its greatest concern. How do we tackle the hardcore antisocial elements? Such people would view any extra law with cynicism: they might simply dismiss it, and it certainly might not have an impact. I shall return to that issue shortly.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o122"><a name="70302-0006.htm_para8"><a name="07030262000338">The comments of the Association of Chief Police Officers have been mentioned, and I will not rehearse them other than to say that it clearly feels that parts of road traffic legislation can be used to address this problem. If the powers exist and can be used, why are they not being used to the extent that they should be? Many Members have said that in certain areas of the country they are being used&#151;and that they are used very well&#151;but that is not the case across the country. ACPO therefore must be asked the following question: what pressure is it putting on its membership to make sure that best practice is spread throughout the country and that the powers are used properly?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o123"><a name="70302-0006.htm_para9"><a name="07030262000339">I found the &#147;Respect&#148; document, &#147;Tackling mini-moto misuse: a guide&#148;, to be interesting and useful reading, and I wish briefly to go through some of its very important points, while also ensuring that we get on to the Bill promoted by my hon. Friend the Member for Newcastle-under-Lyme. In the first part of the first section of that document the question of where mini-motos can be ridden legally is asked. That is a good point. As I said earlier in an intervention on my hon. Friend the Member for Stourbridge (Lynda Waltho), I have seen mini-bikes being used in appalling ways. I have already commented on the man in his mid-20s with the baby perched on the handlebars collecting another older child from school. Sadly, on that occasion I was a passenger in a passing vehicle and was therefore unable to take any action myself. The document asks whether they can be ridden on private land, and the answer is that they can, but with exceptions. We have already heard about the requirement for legal sites, and I will address that shortly.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o124"><a name="70302-0006.htm_para10"><a name="07030262000340">In one part of my constituency there is a park that runs behind a number of houses. Young people&#151;and not so young people&#151;tear through that park, causing a nuisance, and that brings the whole area down, not simply in terms of antisocial behaviour in the park but in terms of the knock-on effects. There is noise, so people cannot sit out in their gardens on a nice summer evening. When the weather turns warmer&#151;because of climate change, we seem over recent years to have been blessed, if I can use that word in this context, with some very good summer weather&#151;parents might wish to keep their children&#146;s bedroom windows open to let in some fresh air. Of course, if a &#147;muppet&#148; is tearing up and down outside on an off-road bike having no regard whatever for the community, the noise will keep the children awake. That will have a knock-on effect on their performance at school next day, and could give rise to other antisocial behaviour issues. As a result of suchbehaviour, the park becomes a no-go area.  <br>

Legitimate users of that parkland are deterred from using it, and might take a wide detour to avoid walking through it because idiots are riding their bikes in an antisocial&#151;in many cases, almost criminal&#151;manner. The park therefore becomes a haven for other antisocial&#151;and, indeed, illegal&#151;activity.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o125"><a name="70302-0006.htm_para11"><a name="07030262000342">That is not to say that we should roundly condemn everybody who sells mini-motos and other such vehicles. A vendor in Fenton, in my constituency, is taking a very responsible attitude to sales by making sure that the people buying such vehicles are responsible and understand the legislation and where mini-motos can and cannot be ridden legally.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o126"><a name="70302-0006.htm_para12"><a name="07030262000343">Section 2 of the guide deals with education and engagement. We need to educate people not just on the use of MUPPs, but on the general use of pavements, parks and roads. Organisations such as the Blurton Dads group, in my constituency, are doing excellent work teaching young people&#151;and their fathers&#151;about riding safely and responsibly.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o127"><a name="70302-0006.htm_para13"><a name="07030262000344">Several Members have mentioned the use of legal sites, but sadly, there is an element of nimbyism that we have to be very careful about. A lot of constituents will rightly say, &#147;An excellent site and facilities should be provided for such people. They should be supervised and proper care and control should be provided&#151;but please don&#146;t put the site near my house.&#148; That is understandable in cases where noise has proved a problem, and it is particularly understandable if such people have been plagued for many years by the nuisance caused by the misuse of off-road vehicles. However, we need to locate such sites in accessible areas, while not putting them so close to people&#146;s back yards as to cause a nuisance.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o128"><a name="70302-0006.htm_para14"><a name="07030262000345">Of course, that creates all sorts of dilemmas. If a site is located too far away, it simply will not be used. The young people&#151;and the slightly older people&#151;who want to use their mini-motos and MUPPs for recreational purposes will be unable to do so because they cannot travel that far. We have already heard how difficult it can be to get a mini-moto to such a site for those who do not have a small van to load it into. They might have to push it there, and as the hon. Member for North Shropshire said, pushing such a vehicle along the road can of itself contravene road traffic legislation. We need to locate such venues sufficiently far away from residents so as not to cause them a problem, but close enough to users to make them accessible. The local authority in my constituency is working hard to find suitable venues. The deputy elected mayor, Councillor Paul Shotton, is doing a lot of valuable work in trying to resolve this problem, as is another constituency colleague, Councillor Terry Doughtey.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o129"><a name="70302-0006.htm_para15"><a name="07030262000346">Section 3 of the guide refers to taking action against the misuse of mini-motos and the tools and powers that are available. Reference was made earlier to seizing such vehicles and crushing them, and that might well be the answer in cases where that can be done. Section 87(1) of the Road Traffic Act 1988, which makes it an offence for a person to use a motor vehicle of any class on a road unless they hold a driving licence, would allow for vehicles to be crushed if they are used by unlicensed riders. However, a MUPP that has been seized with the intention of destroying it might well not be the legal property of the person riding it. They  <br>

might have stolen it, and if they are apprehended, it might emerge that it is not their legal property, which gives rise to the question of whether it can be destroyed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o130"><a name="70302-0006.htm_para16"><a name="07030262000347">Of course, the vehicle might well be that person&#146;s property, but even then, other problems arise. Police officers tell me that in some cases the person in question simply goes out and buys another one. Many such vehicles are available and their cost has dropped dramatically, so if the offender&#146;s vehicle is seized and crushed, they simply buy another one&#151;or, indeed, steal another one. Whether or not they bought the original vehicle legitimately, they might think, &#147;Well, let&#146;s steal one and use that.&#148; Having spoken to the police, I get the impression that some offenders are indeed repeat offenders and will constantly steal vehicles to use in an antisocial and criminal manner. Therefore, seizing and destroying vehicles is not always the answer.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o131"><a name="70302-0006.htm_para17"><a name="07030262000348">When someone misuses such a vehicle, the police often issue a warning, but many of my constituents are saying, &#147;They have broken the law or antisocial behaviour legislation, so why issue a warning? They have done something that they should not be doing.&#148; As we all know, ignorance of the law is no excuse; the vehicle in question should be seized there and then. Some councils try to get around issuing warnings, because they might have to go to court and pay legal costs if they are challenged. We should not have to find ways around the legislation; the law should be clear. I hope that the Minister takes particular note of that point and responds to it when he winds up the debate.</p>

 I will indeed deal with that issue when I wind up. However, the point that I am trying to make to colleagues is that I fully accept that there might be deficiencies in the law and things that we want to fix, but we can fix this one without introducing a registration system. Why have a burdensome registration system that will not be cost-effective and will not get to the root of the problem, when we might be able to do the things that would really make a difference, such as changing that particular rule?</p>

Whether or not there is a requirement to register such a vehicle, perhaps there should be a requirement that anybody who rides one&#151;be it on road or off road&#151;has some form of insurance. That might more easily solve the problem, in that anyone found using a MUPP would immediately have to prove that they are insured. If they are not, they are running a vehicle without insurance, for which there are penalties. If the vehicle is their own, it could perhaps be seized and destroyed. Hopefully, we can discuss in Committee whether a clause could be added to the Bill requiring that anybody who uses a MUPP should have insurance.</p>

we have heard, the perception among a lot of people&#151;including my own constituents&#151;is that the police are taking no action when in fact they do apprehend offenders. However, as soon as the police leave, other offenders come along and start misusing off-road vehicles. As a result, the perception is that this has been happening all day and the police are doing nothing, when in fact, quite the reverse is true.</p>

My understanding&#151;although my local chief constable may be sitting, pen poised, to write to me to correct me&#151;is that the Staffordshire police do not use off-road bikes because of health and safety concerns regarding their officers.

If the Bill requires the vehicles to have a plate and a vehicle does not have one, it is fairly safe for officers to assume that it is being used illegally and therefore to seize it. However, if it does have a plate, how will they know whether the vehicle has passed appropriate MOT tests and has a certificate of road worthiness? There would need to be some way of differentiating the number plate&#151;it could be a different colour or have a different type of registration number&#151;so that somebody could not buy an off-road vehicle that was not certificated for use on the public highway and then, because it was registered and they had a plate on it, decide to use it on the public highway because nobody would be any the wiser. A passing police officer or city council enforcement officer would see the bike, see a plate on the back, and think, &#147;Oh, that&#146;s okay. It&#146;s legal.&#148; Without having some way of differentiating the number plate, there would be no way of knowing whether the vehicle was legal for use off road or on road.

speeches we have heard the Government can be in no doubt of the importance of the matter to our constituents.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o148"><a name="70302-0007.htm_para6"><a name="07030262000385">It is fair to say that Hackney does not have the reputation it deserves and I feel that it is important to redress that every time I speak. I want to highlight the fact that crime in Hackney has dropped overall by 22 per cent. since the neighbourhood police teams were introduced 18 months ago. It is the first London borough to achieve its three-year crime reduction target, and it has done so within 18 months&#151;a significant improvement. However, antisocial behaviour is still raised many times when I am on doorsteps with local councillors and others in the constituency. Neighbourhood policing has done much to help people to tackle antisocial behaviour. When I knock on doors now, I find that people feel that, when they raise such issues, there is an opportunity to work with the police, the council and other members of the community to tackle them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o149"><a name="70302-0007.htm_para7"><a name="07030262000386">That true partnership between the community, the police and the council has made a difference and I was delighted to welcome my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary on his visit to Hackney, South and Shoreditch, when we walked around the Queensbridge ward with its neighbourhood team&#151;Sergeant Nick Smith and his colleagues&#151;and the Metropolitan Police Commissioner last Friday, so that they could see for themselves the important work that has been done. We have seen substantial reductions in crime, but I shall not say any more about that, given the time.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o150"><a name="70302-0007.htm_para8"><a name="07030262000387">Mini-motos are a widespread problem in Hackney, as in other areas. I am heartened to hear that we in Hackney are not alone in experiencing the problem and that they are an issue throughout the country, in rural areas, cities and elsewhere. The figures back up the interest in mini-motos. I know that the hon. Member for North Shropshire believes that the import figures from China demonstrate that the trend might be disappearing. The fact that 144,000 were imported in 2005 and that that figure has dropped to only 60,000 in 2006 does not mean that interest is dropping but only that we have more second-hand and used vehicles on the road. I would not say that the decrease was that big in Hackney, given the anecdotal evidence I have heard as the local MP.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o151"><a name="70302-0007.htm_para9"><a name="07030262000388">The Bill raises the important issue of registration. It is interesting that the Government argue against it, because I think that it provides two main benefits. First, it forces owners to stop and think twice before purchasing one of these vehicles. There have been education programmes and so on that have told people that they are dangerous for their children, pointing out the other 12 pieces of legislation, but have they had much impact? We have heard that they have where there has been an attempt at a crackdown, but those laws exist everywhere and there has not been a uniform reduction in the use of these dangerous nuisance vehicles. The cost and effort of registration will make people realise that what they are buying is a vehicle, not a toy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o152"><a name="70302-0007.htm_para10"><a name="07030262000389">Crucially, a registration plate would allow the public to report such vehicles. One of the benefits of working with neighbourhood police teams in Hackney is that the public feel involved. Hackney councillors have brought in residents as street wardens to report what is going on in their area, which makes it much easier for police to identify theft and misuse. Registration also  <br>

has the advantage of allowing for instant action. Although seizure is an option in some cases now, registration would mean that penalties could take place immediately, which is a real advantage.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o153"><a name="70302-0007.htm_para11"><a name="07030262000390">It warrants a moment of my time to mention that the motorcycle industry argues that the 12 existing laws covering the use and abuse of mini-motos send a powerful message to parents. However, the very act of registering will surely make parents think twice, and perhaps the cost will put them off. I would be interested to know whether the Minister has had any discussions about the issue with Treasury Ministers&#151;perhaps he can address that in his remarks. I would have thought that a lot of the discussion about registration concerns its cost. Surely we could make the registration scheme self-financing and I hope that that might be debated if the Bill reaches Committee. Perhaps we could even tax vehicles&#151;this may be controversial for those who use them for sport&#151;to an extent that makes people think about whether it is sensible to buy them in the first place. Perhaps it would be best not to debate that matter now, even though it is important, given the time available. The 12 laws are not doing the job, so we need to consider other approaches, which is why the Bill is important.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o154"><a name="70302-0007.htm_para12"><a name="07030262000391">I know that there are genuine users of off-road vehicles, such as the people of Hackney who use their vehicles in the Lea valley area, which is just outside my constituency. There is an argument that registration plates on vehicles being used off road could get damaged and cause a danger, as my hon. Friend the Member for Stoke-on-Trent, South (Mr. Flello) said. However, that is not an argument against registration itself. We would need to consider exactly how registration would work.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o155"><a name="70302-0007.htm_para13"><a name="07030262000392">My hon. Friend the Member for Eltham (Clive Efford) rightly highlighted the impact on our parks. I will not go over the points that he made, with which I totally agree, but a small problem is created by attempts to tackle the nuisance of bikes in parks by introducing narrow gates to stop people going through on their motor bikes. Those gates are a pain in the neck for people with a buggy, wheelchair or bicycle. We are having to tackle the problem by implementing solutions that cause more difficulties for the legitimate users of our parks and other facilities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o156"><a name="70302-0007.htm_para14"><a name="07030262000393">The nuisance needs to be tackled in Hackney, South and Shoreditch and, as we have heard today, elsewhere throughout the country. The argument that there are 12 existing laws is not an argument against the Bill, but an argument for it, because that legislation is not working, given that we have a problem while it is in place. The Bill would create disincentives to purchase a vehicle in the first place and give those who suffer from this antisocial behaviour more power to ensure that they did not have to live with such a scourge on our society.</p>

I included in that group children with learning difficulties or those on the autistic spectrum, and people with very limited eyesight, all of whom could be distressed by the danger and thus have their lives limited by it. I also talked about injuries and fatalities. However, given that I do not have time, I will not emphasise any of those points, although I would have liked to have done so.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o157"><a name="70302-0007.htm_para15"><a name="07030262000395">The police in Greater Manchester are asking for these powers.

<p><a name="stpa_o158"><a name="70302-0007.htm_para16"><a name="07030262000396">Considerable political benefits could arise from supporting the Bill. As we have heard, the constituents of many hon.

Friend the Member for Eltham (Clive Efford) gave us an impressive list of the parts of the country that are most affected&#151;the problem occurs all across the country. There have been petitions and three ten-minute Bills, and two early-day motions on the problem were tabled by Labour Members after the summer recess. If the Bill were passed, it would bring great relief to many thousands of people, if not hundreds of thousands. That would help them to feel that the Government were on their side.</p>

considerable source of antisocial behaviour and we entirely agree that we should crack down on their misuse. We entirely understand the distress of people who have suffered because of the misuse of those vehicles, and we want to deal with the issue.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o160"><a name="70302-0007.htm_para18"><a name="07030262000401">We will deal with the issue by making sure that there are powers in place that give the police the authority that they need to deal with it effectively. As has been pointed out by many Members, there are already at least 12 laws that the police can use, and in some parts of the country, they use them extremely effectively. As a consequence, those parts of the country are not requesting any further powers; nor is the Association of Chief Police Officers, because it believes that the powers are in place.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o161"><a name="70302-0007.htm_para19"><a name="07030262000402">I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Manchester, Blackley (Graham Stringer), who introduced the Bill, on coming so high up in the ballot, and on his enthusiasm for the issue. Given the number of raffles at Labour party events, one would think that we would be a bit better at them, but on this occasion, the best that we Labour Members could do was take fifth place. None the less, I welcome his enthusiasm for the Bill.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o162"><a name="70302-0007.htm_para20"><a name="07030262000403">At the outset of his remarks, he talked about the choice that he was given, but I gave him another choice, and I want the House to know about it. My problem with the Bill&#151;I will, no doubt, deal with it in depth in the minutes to come&#151;is that, in my analysis, the solution that it proposes would have very little benefit and would not be cost-effective. I agree that it would have some value, in certain cases, but the value would be nugatory, and nowhere near sufficient to justify the cost involved.</p>

If we allowed the Bill to proceed to Committee, it would take considerable resources, effort and time to amend it there, just to ensure an effective registration system that did not cause problems. If we put resources into that, we would come out of Committee with a Bill that still simply provided for a registration system. Do not forget that the primary purpose of the Bill is to create a compulsory registration system, and it is not possible to amend the primary purpose of a Bill in Committee. The Bill would go into Committee providing for a compulsory registration system, and would come out of Committee providing for a compulsory registration system. If a compulsory registration system is not the answer to the problem, then no matter how hard we worked in Committee, we would come out of it with something that would not solve the problem. We would still have to face the fact that we would have to vote against the Bill on Third Reading. The offer that I made to my hon. Friend was&#151;</p>

the police think are missing. My hon. Friend the Minister for Policing, Security and Community Safety and I further suggested to my hon. Friend that we create an inter-departmental committee, and we even said that he could chair it. It would have ministerial involvement, not just from the Home Office and the Department for Transport, but possibly even from the Department of Trade and Industry, the Department for Culture, Media and Sport and the Department for Communities and Local Government, all of which have an interest in the issue. That committee would drive forward the identification of the powers that are genuinely missing, and the Government would come back to the House on the issue and introduce those powers, instead of my hon. Friend&#146;s private Member&#146;s Bill. I said, too, that if as a result of that research it was clear that a registration system would have more than nugatory value, we would bring back such a system. We could not do that work within the framework of a private Member&#146;s Bill, given the timescale and the nature of such Bills. My hon. Friend turned down that offer.

 I am struggling to understand why my hon. Friend does not believe that blanket registration for such vehicles would dent their popularity.

If we introduced that piece of work and charged a registration fee sufficient in the first year to cover the registration of all off-road vehicles, and their sale collapsed as she suggests, the entire cost of registration and running costs of several million pounds a year would fall on law-abiding users of off-road vehicles, who are not a problem at the moment, but who would find the registration fee going up from between &#163;50 and &#163;100 to much, much more. I urge my hon.

 I thank my hon. Friend for that response. Stratford magistrates court was one of the first to take action against traders who sell these motorbikes.

 That is exactly why I am asking my hon. Friend not to agree to Second Reading but to allow us to conduct a root-and-branch review of the legislation. The stakeholders group would consist not just of the Department for Transport looking at transport issues and the Home Office looking at antisocial behaviour issues. It would include the Department of Trade and Industry looking at trading standards and safety, the Department for Communities and Local Government looking at the use of open space, and the Department for Culture, Media and Sport looking at both the provision and loss of sporting facilities. We would do that root-and-branch work, and we would identify the issues which, as my hon. Friend rightly pointed out, are a problem. However, they are outside the scope of the Bill.

 My great apologies, Mr. Deputy Speaker. I was getting carried away.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o167"><a name="70302-0008.htm_para2"><a name="07030262000419">I discussed the problem with ACPO early in my ministerial career to try and identify how it could be resolved. One of the reasons I did so was that my hon. Friend the Member for Stockport (Ann Coffey), who was the Parliamentary Private Secretary of the then Secretary of State, brought these very issues to the Secretary of State at that time. As a result of those representations, he was keen that we made sure that we had an effective solution to the problem. I consulted ACPO and asked what was needed. ACPO, without pressure from me, came back and said, &#147;We have some colleagues who think a registration system is the way forward, including colleagues in Manchester, but we don&#146;t believe that to be the case. We believe we have the powers.&#148;</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o168"><a name="70302-0008.htm_para3"><a name="07030262000420">At the same time, the Home Office started to look at the issue in terms of antisocial behaviour. As well as identifying the powers in general that the police could use, which was a piece of work that we did in the Department for Transport, our colleagues in the Home Office put together what became the respect agenda, which was implemented last summer and had considerable impact. Those two pieces of work took us further forward.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o169"><a name="70302-0008.htm_para4"><a name="07030262000421">It may be that despite those two pieces of work, we still need to do more work and we still need more powers. That is the work that I am prepared to do now. I can give my hon. Friend the assurance that I put no pressure on ACPO to follow my views. ACPO told me what it wanted, and we did our best to follow that advice. If it so happens that its advice is wrong, and if it so happens that when we do the stakeholder work we identify further powers that are needed, we will provide them. I have said that if it turns out that ACPO was wrong about a registration system, the Government will introduce one. But we cannot do that within the framework of my hon. Friend&#146;s private Member&#146;s Bill or the time scale that that would impose on us.</p>

 I am sure my hon. Friend can sense the impatience in the House today from us and from our constituents for the issue to be dealt with. Can he give the House an indication of the time scale for the cross-departmental work that he proposes, and the first possible date on which we might see some change in legislation and some action that would rid our constituents of the problem?</p>

 The ACPO work is already under way, and it has been going on for some time. I have not received an indication from ACPO when it expects to complete the work, but I do not expect it to be long delayed. A cross-departmental stakeholder group to examine the issues can be implemented relatively quickly. I do not want to be too optimistic, but I would be surprised if we had not identified the significant issues by September. We would then be able to decide which of the measures can be implemented without legislation, which of them need primary legislation and which need secondary legislation. We are talking about that kind of time scale.</p>

the respect agenda to drive the matter forward and the Department for Transport is also willing to act. Best practice is being identified in the various police authorities around the country. Working together, I suspect that we can make significant further inroads into the problem, even before we identify further gaps in the legislation. Throughout this year, I think that my hon. Friend will see significant improvements in the situation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o171"><a name="70302-0008.htm_para6"><a name="07030262000425">This is the Government&#146;s position: we are not hostile to the intention behind the Bill, and we are not ruling out a registration system for ever, but we think that there is a better, more thorough and more effective way to deal with the issue which will impact on the lawless rather than law-abiding people.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o172"><a name="70302-0008.htm_para7"><a name="07030262000426">I will deal with the points made by my hon. Friends and Opposition Members before I turn to the body of my comments. As I have said, paragraph 1 does not include trikes, and I have had an exchange with my hon. Friend the Member for Manchester, Blackley and the hon. Member for Orkney and Shetland (Mr. Carmichael) on that subject. That provision would be amendable in Committee, but a vast range of other provisions would have to be amended in Committee, too. If the Bill were passed as it stands, all the racing bikes in next year&#146;s British grand prix would have to display number plates. Amendments would be needed to make it clear that superbikes in a formal racing environment or people racing scrambler bikes in properly organised off-road events do not have to display number plates. All such issues would need to be identified, and the necessary amendments would need to be drafted and introduced into the legislation. I suggest that such work should be done within the framework of a Government Bill, where we will have the time and the leisure to do it. I may be wrong about this, but I have been told that because only one private Member&#146;s Bill has been committed upstairs so far, this Bill would be in Committee at a very early date, so we would not have time to do the study, which is another reason why the Government should be given the flexibility and the time to do the work properly.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o173"><a name="70302-0008.htm_para8"><a name="07030262000427">When my hon. Friend the Member for Manchester, Blackley introduced his Bill, he pointed out that virtually all these bicycles are illegal on the road, which is correct, and that virtually all of them go on the road, which is also correct. I put it to him that that means that they can all be confiscated at some point, because people have only to break one road traffic law for the police to be able to confiscate bikes with no warnings and none of the other problems. If the police catch someone doing something on-road, the bike can go there and then, which is another reason why I am not convinced that the Bill will take us much further forward.</p>

police officers are becoming very fit in the pursuit of mini-motos, but that approach is not as effective as it might be. The best approach is to get mini-motos off the street to begin with, rather than pursuing young people when they are engaged in illegal activity driving around the streets of Plaistow.</p>

<p><a name="st_o135"><a name="07030262000429"><a name="70302-0008.htm_spnew9"><a name="07030262001079"><b>Dr. Ladyman:</b>
 I entirely agree. My hon. Friend&#146;s point relates to one made by my hon. Friend the Member for Manchester, Blackley, who said that he was in favour of the bikes being registered and having to display a number plate. Frankly, whatever benefits the Bill would deliver would come only if the bikes had a number plate. I see that my hon. Friend the Member for West Ham (Lyn Brown) agrees. However, are law-abiding people, who register their bikes and are prepared to put a number plate on them, the sort to drive away from a policeman when he asks them to stop?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o174"><a name="70302-0008.htm_para9"><a name="07030262000430">The fact is that the people who would disobey the proposed law are those whom the police officers in the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for Manchester, Blackley are chasing. They would still be chasing them if the Bill was enacted. How we go about safely apprehending miscreants is a key point that we need to investigate. Several hon. Members have said that, and I agree. There is a weakness there; a kid, who may be very young, cannot be chased because they might have an accident and the officer might also have one during the pursuit. However, a registration system is not the answer, because that kid will not be displaying a number plate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o175"><a name="70302-0008.htm_para10"><a name="07030262000431">One reason why I want to take this issue offline and let the Government address it properly is that I want to sit down with the police and ask them what techniques, powers and instruments they really need if they are to tackle the problem safely. My hon. Friend the Member for West Ham identified a problem, but the Bill is not the way to solve it.</p>

 Does my hon. Friend agree that if the vehicles were issued with number plates, the ordinary man and woman in the street would be able to identify wrongdoers and report them to the police? In Hove and Portslade in my constituency, there are altercations between residents and people riding such off-road vehicles on the roads, often late at night. Those altercations and dangers would be prevented if the residents were able to take down an identifying feature of the bikes and thereby report them to the police.</p>

 That would be the case if miscreants and people who disobey the law obeyed the law being proposed and put number plates on their bikes. I am saying that they will not. As we heard, some people riding the bikes wear balaclavas or masks over their faces to hide their identity. Does my hon. Friend seriously think that someone who puts a balaclava over their face to hide their identity so that they could not be caught would put a number plate on their bike?</p>

I just do not accept that; it does not make sense. However, I come back to the offer that I made to my hon.

 The Minister has mentioned that offer several times. He told us he was confident that he would be able to resolve the issues by the end of the year. I suggest that he could allow the Bill a Second Reading. In Committee, he could insert a new clause that required a statutory instrument to bring the Bill into force. If, after the great canvass of opinions that the Minister proposes, it is demonstrated that the scheme is needed, he could bring forward that statutory instrument, saving subsequent Government time. If it was demonstrated that the power was not needed, he would not bring forward the statutory instrument and there would be no argument from any of the other hon. Members here.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman knows perfectly well that the Liberal Democrats would be the first to complain if I took that sort of preparatory power for things that I cannot prove are really needed. In recent days, Liberal Democrats made that very argument about preparatory powers that the Government were taking in other areas. I am, personally, profoundly unconvinced that this system would have anything more than nugatory value, but I am making an honest offer in good faith that if we do this piece of work and it turns out that it would have value, we would bring it back to the House.

 I want to push my hon. Friend for one last time. Following his answer to my hon. Friend the Member for Hove (Ms Barlow), does he agree that if a bike was sold with a number plate, like my car, it would be much more likely to be kept in its place, intact, on the back of the bike, to enable the identification of people who are breaking the law? I know that there are difficulties in London and elsewhere with people stealing number plates, replacing the number plates on the cars they are driving, and engaging in all kinds of criminal activity. Nevertheless, we would stand a better chance of identifying people and catching them if number plates were on bikes at the point of sale.</p>

There is a whole raft of legislation about the size, shape and lettering of number plates. The rear number plate specified in the Bill would be nearly as big as some mini-motos&#151;it would be like having a sail on the back. That might be dangerous in itself, and the owner might be encouraged to take it off because it looks so silly and gets in the way. Would we insist on people having those big number plates, or would we redesign the number plate system and have smaller number plates? Then, who would sell them? Under the Road Safety Act 2006, number plates can be bought only from certain designated stores. Would they have to tool up to make redesigned smaller number plates for mini-motos? Number plates are the size they are because they work with automated number plate recognition cameras. Smaller number plates would not, so we would have to redesign the software for those cameras. If someone wanted to make a note of such a number plate, they would need to be a lot closer in order to be able to see it.

 Yes, but in every case my hon. Friend talked about the need for regulation, not registration. We can regulate without introducing a very expensive registration system. I agree entirely that, with a registration system, activities would need to take place at the point of sale, and they might or might not include providing information. We would still need to include powers to require people to provide information at the point of sale.

So we would need to introduce a series of regulations and new powers to ensure that that information was provided, but we have not identified them.

 That is simply not the case. The Government have already identified the various powers that the police can use, and has disseminated that information to the police. The Department for Transport has done considerable work on that, as has the Home Office. The respect agenda was published last summer. A concerted effort has been made to co-ordinate the work of the police and to ensure that they know what powers they have. Work has gone on with ACPO to ensure that everybody has the information that they need about the powers available.</p>

If there are still problems in Members&#146; constituencies, however, and if the police genuinely cannot use the powers that they have to cope with them&#151;we will identify that when we do the research&#151;we will bring back the measure as Government legislation, not as a half-baked piece of legislation, which is the best that we could have in a private Member&#146;s Bill, even with all the resources of Government trying to amend it to make it an appropriate measure in the time frame under discussion.</p>

The fact is, however, that they are not offering to pay for the scheme.

 May I return to the analogy that my hon. Friend drew with his experiences of buying a car from a garage? When a garage sells him a car, I presume that it has a responsibility&#151;certainly, if it is a new car&#151;to ensure that it is roadworthy and that it will not cause him distress while driving. Unfortunately, these bikes are being sold new to my constituents and they are neither roadworthy nor safe. Many of the problems that we are experiencing are with tracing unsafe vehicles back to the vendor and prosecuting the vendor. A registration scheme would enable us to trace back such unsafe, illegal vehicles to the point of purchase, and to prosecute.</p>

 My hon. Friend is absolutely right. The garage that sells me my car has a responsibility to ensure that it is roadworthy and safe for use on the road, but the responsibility to make sure that I have a roadworthy vehicle of merchantable quality does not fall to it under the vehicle excise legislation or under registration legislation; it falls to it under trading standards legislation. That is why we need to do a piece of work across Government to look at all those issues and to come forward with a package of changes that can deal with those problems. The registration system alone will not do it. If we introduce that alone, it will make a nugatory contribution to the safety issue that she has rightly identified.</p>

Perhaps it is because everyone who wants one now has one. It is more likely to do with the fact that the work that the Department of Trade and Industry and trading standards have already done has got over to parents how little legal use can be made of the vehicles and they have simply stopped buying them. The trend might continue. Without doing any of the things we have discussed today, these machines might disappear in a year or two. I certainly hope so. Despite that, I am not advocating that we do nothing. I am advocating that we continue to do this work and do not rely on a further collapse of sales.

For instance, he asked why we would want to have a prescriptive system, the burden of which would fall mostly on law-abiding people.

I am on the side of the people who are suffering as a result of these machines, but to suggest to them a solution that will not take us any further forward will not do them any good. The simple fact is that if we go into Committee with a Bill whose primary purpose is a registration scheme, we shall have to come out of Committee with a Bill whose primary purpose is a registration scheme, and all of the steps that the hon. Gentleman has identified as potentially reasonable steps to take will not be in the Bill, while the one measure that he has identified as a burden will be in the Bill.

That is absolutely right and this is a real problem, which is why local councils would have to be involved in identifying suitable sites. The other problem is that these vehicles have to be able to get to such sites without using a road, because, as we have heard, they cannot go on roads; the vast majority of them are not road-legal or road-safe. They are certainly not licensed or insured for use on a road.</p>

That issue has to be addressed, but the fact is that nothing in the Bill requires that these bikes be insured, so even if we went ahead with it, the health service would still get no benefit from it.</p>

However, I doubt whether that case can be made within the framework of a private Member&#146;s Bill, and in my view they have not made their case so far.</p>

I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for Manchester, Blackley for at least stimulating the debate and for engaging in the issue. As I said, I fully support the intentions behind the Bill, which are doubtless supported by all Members of the House. The irresponsible use of these vehicles is a real and serious problem. I am only too aware from my own area of the serious distress caused by the noise, environmental damage and safety problems associated with the irresponsible use of these vehicles. They have become popular as gifts for children and sometimes as fun vehicles for adults. We should remember that when used responsibly, these vehicles can give a great deal of harmless pleasure. There is nothing intrinsically wrong in principle with small motorcycles designed for off-road use, especially when used under supervision on private property, with the landowner&#146;s permission and with appropriate safety precautions. Many young people use their vehicles responsibly in that way and few of us, if any, would have a problem with that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o211"><a name="70302-0010.htm_para2"><a name="07030262000492">However, widespread concern remains about the irresponsible misuse of such vehicles, which can be dangerous to the rider and others and can cause serious noise problems and other nuisances. There has been in recent years something of a craze for these vehicles, sustained by a flood of imports, often available at remarkably low prices. The majority of the products are produced in China by general manufacturers that are more used to turning out toys and other cheap mechanical goods, not by mainstream motorcycle manufacturers. I have heard of their being offered for sale for as little as &#163;40, and some have even been given away for nothing as bonus items in mobile phone contracts.</p>

More usually, they are sold by newly established retailers, often with little experience. As I pointed out to the Transport Committee when I appeared before it on this subject, in my constituency they were sold until recently by second-hand washing machine shops as a sideline. I doubt whether such shops would engage positively with a registration process.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o213"><a name="70302-0010.htm_para4"><a name="07030262000494">Unfortunately, mini-motos have often been marketed by retailers irresponsibly. As one of my hon. Friends mentioned, one retailer sells the products through a slick website, annoyingtheneighbours.co.uk. I am not sure that I should give that company any publicity by mentioning it, but it gives some indication of the attitude to society taken by some people involved in the trade. Many users of mini-motos seem to share that attitude. They often seem to revel in their bad behaviour and the annoyance that they cause. That attitude can appear very intimidating to the wider community, helping to contribute to feelings of social  <br>

isolation and helplessness. The House has heard examples today of the problems that misuse of the vehicles can cause. I sympathise deeply with everyone whose life is blighted by this menace. It is a major problem of antisocial behaviour.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o214"><a name="70302-0010.htm_para5"><a name="07030262000495">We also know, as several hon. Members have said today, that there are safety concerns about some of the products, especially those at the cheaper end of the market. Indeed, because the vehicles are so cheap, some users probably take additional risks with them. After all, if they break their mini-moto through irresponsible use, they can easily and painlessly get another one. However, if they break their legs, backs or skulls, it is not so easy or painless. As we have heard, some young lives have tragically been lost. Other safety problems arise from the poor quality construction that accompanies the low prices. The many safety faults reported include sharp edges on fairings and windshields, inadequate guards on chains and sprockets, and poor welding.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o215"><a name="70302-0010.htm_para6"><a name="07030262000496">This is a large problem. The briefing sheet for the Bill produced by the Motor Cycle Industry Association, the MCI, contains an estimate that no fewer than 145,000 were imported from China in 2005 at the height of the craze. We can assume, therefore, that there are at least 250,000 mini-motos in the country. However, the MCI has also estimated that imports collapsed in 2006 to only 60,000. If that is a lasting and confirmed trend, it may be a sign that the mini-moto craze is passing, as other crazes have passed before. It may also be partly due to tougher action by the Government, local authorities and the police, and I shall talk about some of those efforts later.</p>

Friends are shaking with anticipation and enthusiasm for my continued analysis of the problem. I can give them the encouragement that they seek: I have plenty more to say on this important subject. The Bill seeks to address this serious and widespread problem by bringing a range of vehicles designed for use off the public highway within the scope of the existing mandatory vehicle registration system for road-going vehicles. It also seeks to address the problems identified by some police forces in using their existing powers to stop and seize vehicles that are being misused.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o217"><a name="70302-0010.htm_para8"><a name="07030262000498">As I will explain, although the intentions behind the proposals are good and although the Government share them, we cannot support the core proposal for mandatory registration of off-road vehicles under the existing vehicle registration scheme. During my speech, I will set out why we think that alternative means of tackling the problem are more likely to deliver the results that we all want.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o218"><a name="70302-0010.htm_para9"><a name="07030262000499">First, I will explain the current legal position and the powers that are available to deal with the misuse of the vehicles. The legislation governing the registration and licensing of motor vehicles in the UK is the Vehicle Excise and Registration Act 1994, as amended. The Act was designed to promote an effective and safe road transport system. It was never intended to regulate off-road leisure activities. In the Government&#146;s view, the Act is not well suited to the proposed new task.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o219"><a name="70302-0010.htm_para10"><a name="07030262000502">The Vehicle Excise and Registration Act imposes registration requirements only on keepers of vehicles used on the public roads. For these purposes, a public road means a road maintained at the public expense. The definition of a public road includes footways, grass verges and ground adjoining the public carriageway. Any mechanically propelled vehicle that is kept or used on a public road must comply with the registration requirements. Drivers of those vehicles must also comply with the relevant licensing requirements in order to use those vehicles legally on the public road.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o220"><a name="70302-0010.htm_para11"><a name="07030262000503">The registration and licensing process plays an important part in identifying vehicles and their keepers for the effective enforcement of the rules of the road and vehicle safety requirements. It also enables the collection of vehicle excise duty. Every vehicle used on a public road in Great Britain must be licensed and registered. If a vehicle is kept or used on a public road, it must display a valid tax disc at all times. The only exception is that a vehicle may be driven, untaxed, to and from a testing station for a pre-arranged test, as long as the vehicle is insured.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o221"><a name="70302-0010.htm_para12"><a name="07030262000504">On the issuing of a first licence, a vehicle is registered. The process of registration enables the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency to provide each vehicle with a unique registration mark and to issue a registration certificate. Those requirements do not apply to vehicles used only off road. Any vehicles used on the public road must have relevant type approval and comply with all road traffic law requirements. These include: approved construction standards, lights, indicators, insurance, MOT testing and so forth, as well as registration and road tax. A few mini-motos achieve those standards, but the vast majority do not and are thus effectively banned from road use.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o222"><a name="70302-0010.htm_para13"><a name="07030262000505">The law governing the registration and construction of vehicles and the licensing of drivers applies to vehicles used or kept on the public roads, but the requirements do not apply to vehicles used off road. However, other laws apply to vehicles off road. During 2006, the European Commission gave the opinion that such vehicles were within the scope of the machinery directive and that certain provisions of the general product safety directive would also apply. In addition, the Commission noted that such products cannot be considered as toys because the toy directive specifically excludes any items powered by internal combustion. The machinery directive is a technical regulation harmonised across the European Union with the intent  <br>

to ensure that only safe products can be marketed and used. In the UK the legislation is the Supply of Machinery (Safety) Regulations 1992, which cover the essential health and safety regulations of products within their scope. It is unlawful to supply unsafe products within the EU, and where appropriate, a wide variety of measures can used against unsafe mini-motos or other products.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o223"><a name="70302-0010.htm_para14"><a name="07030262000506">Trading standards departments of local government authorities have the responsibility for enforcing consumer safety legislation. They have a wide range of enforcement powers to tackle the problem, which include withdrawal notices, forfeiture orders and criminal prosecution. They also ensure that enforcement activities are targeted only against unsafe products, leaving legitimate traders unaffected. In the second half of 2006, the European Commission attempted to establish the extent of the problem throughout the EU. Each member state was asked to report on market surveillance measures taken on mini-motos. We await the Commission&#146;s assessment and conclusions, but one thing that was apparent in the UK&#146;s response to the Commission&#146;s request was the large amount of work that various trading standards departments throughout the country have been doing to address the problem.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o230"><a name="70302-0010.htm_para21"><a name="07030262000661">On my 45th birthday, I am privileged to introduce the Bill and I thank my 11 Labour sponsors, who represent our nations and regions, as well as many trade unions that have long campaigned on behalf of thousands of vulnerable agency and temporary workers. I thank in particular all the unions that support the campaign, including the Transport and General Workers Union, Amicus, the Communication Workers Union, the GMB, Unison, the Union of Construction, Allied Trades and Technicians and other unions such as Unity, which is my local community union for north Staffordshire, as well as the TUC and TULO, the trade union and Labour party liaison organisation that does a great deal of valuable work for the Labour party.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o231"><a name="70302-0010.htm_para22"><a name="07030262000662">I thank, too, all my colleagues and other hon. Members who have given up not just a valuable Friday but a one-line Whip Thursday and important constituency engagements to vote for the closure motion, thus allowing this important issue to be aired. If they had not done so, it would not have received a billing in the House today. Most of all, however, I thank the 50 or so agency workers who came to Parliament this week to lobby their MPs and put their heads bravely above the parapet to tell their stories and speak about the discrimination that they and their families have suffered.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o232"><a name="70302-0010.htm_para23"><a name="07030262000663">For example, Jane was employed by an agency to drive a street sweeper for Salford council. For three years, she worked for &#163;5.75 an hour, which is 30 per less than the rate for a permanent employee doing the same job, but she was recently sacked by telephone, without any warning or recourse. Steve has worked for nine years at a call centre run by Manpower for British Telecom in Scotland on half the pay, with less holiday and no prospects of promotion or job security, so he finds it difficult to secure a mortgage for his family. Bartek from Poland was recruited by an agency to work for a Woolworths distribution centre near Manchester and Wigan. He was promised decent pay, accommodation and working conditions but, like many other migrants, he found himself badly paid, discriminated against, sharing a small room with others and subject to unreasonable charges that the agency deducted from his pay. Those workers are subject to tensions, because fellow UK workers fear, understandably, that they and their families will be undercut by such employment practices.</p>

implemented by that blue chip company that allows it to absolve itself of responsibility for many employees. After a long campaign on behalf of those workers, this speech will be mercifully short. I hope that colleagues will be disciplined as well, because we want to hear the Minister&#146;s response.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o233"><a name="70302-0010.htm_para24"><a name="07030262000666">First, to dispel some myths, I want to say what the Bill is not about. It is not about regulating flexibility out of our economy. It is not anti-business. It is not about reducing job opportunities. Many of the same arguments were made against the minimum wage, and we have seen over the years that they were plainly wrong. The Bill aims to achieve a better balance for some of our most vulnerable people and their hard-working families between so-called flexibility and pay, treatment, job security and basic human worth.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o234"><a name="70302-0010.htm_para25"><a name="07030262000667">The Bill creates no great regulatory or licensing superstructure. Like the minimum wage, it creates a more level playing field. It protects responsible employers from being undercut and adds an extension to the floor that we have already provided with the minimum wage to stop the state picking up the tab in the form of benefits that subsidise poor employers. In short, it is not just a trade union Bill. It is a Bill for vulnerable working people and it is entirely in tune with the Labour Government&#146;s agenda to help hard-working families.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o235"><a name="70302-0010.htm_para26"><a name="07030262000668">There are more than 1.4 million agency and temporary workers in all industries in the UK, many in areas such as mine, north Staffordshire, which need regeneration, a better mix of skills and, most of all, greater aspiration, especially for our children. Many people work for agencies or temporarily by choice. Many are well treated and rewarded. Many, however, suffer from lower wages, poorer working conditions, lack of sick pay, fewer holidays and workplace bullying because of their temporary and insecure status.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o236"><a name="70302-0010.htm_para27"><a name="07030262000669">Recently in the UK, it has become clear that the issue is not just a domestic one, as the example of Bartek showed. Many agencies recruit proactively overseas to fill low-paid jobs, creating tensions and undercutting wages and conditions. This tension is exploited by the likes of the British National party. Action to help vulnerable agency workers is not only right and fair, but was specifically promised as a key part of the Warwick agreement between Labour and the trade unions before the 2005 general election.</p>

 As vice-chair of the national policy forum at the time, I can vouch for the fact that that was part of the Warwick agreement and that the Government promised in our manifesto to deliver the Warwick agreement in full, so I hope they will revisit the directive.

 My hon. Friend the Member for Hendon (Mr. Dismore) asked when the Government intend to act on our commitments in our manifesto and to our party and affiliates, as arrived at in Warwick. We published our consultative document on temporary, agency and vulnerable workers on 20 February, so we are clearly indicating that we are living up to our manifesto commitments, and that we will legislate domestically where that is possible.

 Does my hon. Friend agree that although the Government&#146;s moves to introduce flexible working are welcome, they have left us in a bizarre position on employees and flexible working?

 Indeed. The situation has left us with a permanent two-tier work force.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o238"><a name="70302-0011.htm_para1"><a name="07030262000683">I thank the Minister for confirming at this week&#146;s meeting that, in line with commitments made at Warwick, the UK will look at domestic legislation, which is what the Bill seeks to achieve. It is difficult to understand the hostility of the Department of Trade and Industry and its officials to the Bill.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o239"><a name="70302-0011.htm_para2"><a name="07030262000684">To dispel another myth, this Bill tracks the principles of the directive nigh on word for word. It defines basic working and employment conditions, which are contained in article 3 of the draft directive. Clause 5 replicates the wording of the directive with one clarification, which is that pay should include an entitlement to sick pay. This week, we heard, through the lobby, from Maeve, an agency worker in Blackburn who has worked for BT through Manpower for the past two years. She told us that it was a them-and-us situation between agency and permanent employees&#151;the haves and the have-nots. Maeve became very ill with pneumonia, but she could only afford to take 10 days off, because after two years of employment, she had no entitlement to sick pay. That is the reality for many workers in our economy today.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o240"><a name="70302-0011.htm_para3"><a name="07030262000685">Why does the DTI object so strongly to the Bill? That is a very good question, and this is what we have heard from the Minister this week and again today. The DTI objects to agency workers qualifying for equal rights from day one. That has been one of the main issues stalling the directive. If the Government want to negotiate a qualifying period of six weeks, like the Commission, or nine months, which is their latest condition, then they should do it in Committee. If they have signed up to the principles behind the Bill and the directive, there is no reason to oppose the Bill on Second Reading. Any Whip, as the Minister formerly was, would tell any recalcitrant Back Bencher that they can argue about the detail in Committee.</p>

 My hon. Friend has made a fair point about the role of Committees, notwithstanding the Government&#146;s support for the principles behind the Bill I understand the frustration of people who are employed for long periods of time and who are still classified as temporary workers, which is why the qualifying period in the draft directive is important. The qualifying period should be set reasonably and people should not be taken advantage of. That negotiation is taking place in Europe and not upstairs  <br>

in the Committee corridor. We are happy to look at any abuses in respect of temporary and agency workers, which is what the consultation document addresses. I invite my hon. Friend and the trade unions that are supporting him to submit evidence to allow us to move forward in this important area.</p>

<p><a name="st_o182"><a name="07030262000687"><a name="70302-0011.htm_spnew10"><a name="07030262001265"><b>Paul Farrelly:</b>
 The trade unions will certainly submit evidence. Like many of my hon. Friends, I say that the discussions should not take place behind closed doors in Brussels but in the open here in London.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o241"><a name="70302-0011.htm_para4"><a name="07030262000688">This week, we heard a couple of other objections&#151;for example, an alleged difficulty in identifying those with work comparable to that of agency workers. Jane in Salford, Steve in Scotland, Bartek from Poland and Maeve, recovering from pneumonia in Blackburn, would have no trouble identifying someone doing exactly the same job in their workplace. Furthermore, their union reps would say that the concept is well understood in other equal pay legislation from our own Government. If a reasonably comparable worker doing the same or a similar job in the firm or industry could not be found, such people simply could not take a discrimination case to an industrial tribunal. Again, do not object to the issue on Second Reading.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o242"><a name="70302-0011.htm_para5"><a name="07030262000689">The other objection that we have heard this week&#151;we have heard only three, really&#151;was that there are difficulties over the meaning of &#147;equal treatment&#148; for agency workers in respect of maternity rights. The Government have been very good in progressing the agenda for pregnant women; if we want more precision, we can get it in Committee. If the Bill goes to Committee, it is not beyond the bounds of possibility that we might help the Government clarify their case.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o243"><a name="70302-0011.htm_para6"><a name="07030262000690">I want to conclude with the positives of the campaign. The Bill has had an airing, albeit brief. A Department of Trade and Industry consultation saw the light of day last week; it is too narrow and does not touch on the main issues and basic principles of the Bill, as signed up to at Warwick, but at least it gives the workers the chance to highlight further abuses.</p>

<p><a name="st_o183"><a name="07030262000691"><a name="70302-0011.htm_spnew11"><a name="07030262001266"><b>Jim Fitzpatrick:</b>
 Does my hon. Friend accept that page 49, section E of the consultative document states that we will listen to and pay attention to any evidence that is taken? I do not understand how he can describe the consultation as too narrow, given that an open question at the end of the consultation document says, &#147;Give us the evidence&#148;.</p>

 I welcome the Minister&#146;s assurance, which repeats what he said in the meeting this week, that he will listen to the evidence. Frankly, we find it worrying that most of the evidence cited so far has come from employers&#146; organisations. However, there is plenty of evidence for the trade unions, and we shall encourage them to submit it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o244"><a name="70302-0011.htm_para7"><a name="07030262000693">Finally, I should say that Jane, Steve, Bartek and Maeve and many thousands like them would like to hear from the Minister now the real reasons why the Government are opposing Second Reading of this sensible Bill. I hope that Members will give the Minister the opportunity to make a more detailed response.</p>

 I congratulate the hon. Member for Newcastle-under-Lyme (Paul Farrelly) on doing well in the ballot; as a birthday present to him, I shall be extremely brief. We all want to hear what the Minister has to say.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o245"><a name="70302-0011.htm_para8"><a name="07030262000695">It is important that we get the balance right between protecting employees and providing employment. We support the Government&#146;s intention to address bad practices that affect agency workers, but this Bill contains provisions that would change the principles of existing employment and contract law. The effect of those changes would, I believe, be to the significant detriment of job creation in our country.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o246"><a name="70302-0011.htm_para9"><a name="07030262000696">Contracts with temporary workers are formed under specific circumstances for specific reasons. We should be cautious about allowing the Government to interfere with the ability of employers and employees to contract in such circumstances. Limiting the ability of employers to take on employees on a flexible or temporary basis has the potential to stifle business. It would also restrict opportunities for those who can work only on a temporary basis. Despite the Government&#146;s commitment to introducing measures to ease the administrative burden on agencies, the Bill contains a number of provisions that would increase the administrative burden on any business wishing to employ someone on a temporary basis.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o247"><a name="70302-0011.htm_para10"><a name="07030262000697">Obviously, that would have a serious impact on businesses that by their nature rely on being able to employ workers on a temporary and flexible basis. Businesses with seasonal fluctuations, or those that rely on market demand to decide staffing levels, are heavily dependent on being able to staff their businesses efficiently through temporary or agency workers. There seems to be a risk that the more restrictions that are placed on such contracts, the more difficult it will be for agencies to maintain the fluidity of supply so crucial in that area of employment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o248"><a name="70302-0011.htm_para11"><a name="07030262000698">There is also the risk of a knock-on effect by which the increased liability and administrative burden placed on businesses by the Bill would force employers to stop taking on agency workers. That would massively restrict the options open to those able to work only on a temporary basis&#151;for example, students or those looking after young children.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o249"><a name="70302-0011.htm_para12"><a name="07030262000699">It is necessary to ensure that we achieve a proper balance between the rights of the employer and the employee, and we are currently considering the whole policy area of employment rights with a view to coming up with proposals that will get the balance right. This Bill, however, is not the answer.</p>

 I agree that not all employment agencies and employers exploit people. Nevertheless, I should like to refer my hon.

Because they are vulnerable and their English is not very good, their wages are being docked by way of a whole list of methods. I have reported this to the police and to Revenue and Customs. It is a detailed example in a real place&#151;I have met many of the people involved personally&#151;that he may wish to take on board when he considers the outcome of the consultation.

 I certainly would not reject a request from a colleague on either side of the House to discuss issues of importance to themselves as constituency MPs, particularly when it involves people being abused or maltreated or relates to Government regulations on health and safety, the minimum wage, paid time off, paid rest breaks, or whatever.

Friend the Member for Eccles, who asked about employment agencies that do not observe the protocols and regulations or best practice as regards the people for whom they are supposed to be finding work. As I said, the recruitment agencies themselves are in the process of drafting a code of conduct. When agencies undermine people&#146;s rights, they tarnish the reputation of the whole industry and undermine decent agencies for temporary and agency workers that are doing the right thing in trying to ensure that their recruits are treated favourably. I accept that there are problems but I emphasise that we have an inspectorate, we investigate complaints and, if my hon. Friend has information and details about cases, I am happy to ensure that the appropriate officials receive them.</p>

However, we want to ensure that no one is exposed to unfair treatment because of gaps or loopholes in our employment law. Much is happening. My hon. Friend the Member for Newcastle-under-Lyme referred to the agency workers directive. It is fair to say that that has stalled in Europe for some time. However, Department of Trade and Industry officials were in Brussels on Wednesday to raise the prospect of progress on detailed negotiations.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o254"><a name="70302-0011.htm_para17"><a name="07030262000712">My hon. Friend said that the details in the Bill mirror the wording of the directive and asked why we could not simply transpose it into United Kingdom law. I acknowledge that he emphasised that he does not want to disadvantage the UK compared with our colleagues in other European Union member states. However, the directive&#146;s text is a draft and will be subject to amendment. It would therefore be difficult to deal with the current text in isolation now.</p>

There are 1.6 million such workers, of whom 52 per cent. say that they are entirely happy with the way that they conduct themselves and the job that they do and 26 per cent. say that they do not want permanent jobs and that they prefer the jobs that they have. I agree with him that thousands of workers are being taken advantage of, as my hon. Friend the Member for Newcastle-under-Lyme said in quoting a number of cases this week. The intention of the intervention is to suggest that we need to protect those people, and I accept that we need to do so, which is why we have issued the consultative document and demonstrated that we are prepared to do something about it as soon as possible.</p>

My right hon. and hon. Friends know that the Warwick commitment is for the duration of this Parliament, which is not due to finish until 2010.

 I take that answer to mean no. I am interested in when proposals might be introduced. The Minister has suggested that European Union presidencies, particularly the Portuguese presidency, might be important. We have a three-month consultation period, followed by some internal gestation period, followed by consultations with the Portuguese. That probably takes us past the next Queen&#146;s Speech. As we are coming towards the end of the period to which the manifesto applies, and proposals are to be introduced before we get to that point, when will they be introduced? If they are not to be in the next Queen&#146;s Speech, in which one will they be?</p>

We have what I perceive to be a Government quango, the transport innovation fund, which is linking vital transport infrastructure with congestion charging. Basically, we are being told as a community that, if we want the north-west relief road to be built, which is the last remaining link in the ring road around Shrewsbury, we will have to have congestion charging as part of the package.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o282"><a name="70302-0012.htm_para26"><a name="07030262000768">That is wrong. I believe that that is getting Shrewsbury residents to pay for road building and other transport schemes by charging them to come into their own town centre. Transport schemes and improvements to transport infrastructure should come from the Government and from central funds, rather than imposing that new stealth tax on the community.</p>

Congestion charging is one thing in London&#151;in fact, I think that it works quite well in London&#151;but it is a different thing in an historic county town such as Shrewsbury.</p>

Does he share the concern of constituents of mine and of my neighbouring Members in south-east London that there is apparently a proposal to impose a congestion charge on the Blackwall tunnel?

 I totally concur. It is my understanding that Conservative party policy is to listen to local communities, and I very much hope that the Minister and the Government will do likewise.</p>

We do not have high-speed rail links to nearby airports. We have a relatively poor train service, which does not run very well, and poor connections. We do not even have a direct rail link to London. We are one of only a few county towns in England without a direct rail link to London, and although I am working very hard to try to secure that link for Shrewsbury we now hear that Arriva and Virgin Trains are trying to block it. We do not have the alternatives that London has in respect of encouraging movement into and out of Shrewsbury, whether for business or tourism. That is why my constituents rely on the motor car so much more than Londoners do; the alternatives simply do not exist.</p>

The problem with being a guinea pig and having this measure tested on us is that in the short and medium term there will be huge fiscal downsides for my community. Business will be driven away. Many companies have said to me that they will go to Telford, a big modern town to the east of us, nearer to Staffordshire. The Government are already subsidising Telford massively. It receives more than &#163;80 per household more from the local government settlement scheme than my community receives for every household. By taking this step, the Government will be helping Telford even more to the detriment of my constituency. Many people come to Shrewsbury from Wales&#151;they come from mid-Wales and all over Herefordshire. That trade will simply go to Telford, rather than come to our historic county town.</p>

devastating impact on tourism in Shrewsbury. His hotel is in the town centre, and he often says to people who stay there, &#147;We are very pleased to have you, but, out of interest, why have you come to stay in Shrewsbury for two or three days?&#148; Many people reply, &#147;Actually, we were passing through Shrewsbury and we thought we&#146;d stop and have a look.&#148; As it is such a beautiful town, they always then think, &#147;Right&#151;we&#146;ll come back another time for a longer holiday.&#148; That is how Shrewsbury gets a lot of its tourist trade: people passing through, seeing how beautiful the town is and coming back. Mr. Matthews said to me unequivocally, &#147;These people are not going to come into Shrewsbury, stop for a few hours to have a look and come back again if they know that there is congestion charging.&#148; We will lose a lot of trade because people will be put off. They will not pay the congestion charge merely to have a quick look at the town with a view to visiting it in future.</p>

Many of the senior citizens and people with mobility problems who come to see me point out that Shrewsbury is a very hilly town. Anyone who drives on Shrewsbury&#146;s roads will see that it is not like a pancake. It is a very steep, historic town, and people with mobility problems will have difficulty in getting into the town centre if they do not have use of a motor car. If we introduce congestion charging, we will make life more difficult for senior citizens and people with mobility problems.</p>

that genuinely needs a congestion charging scheme, but not Shrewsbury. The local chairman of Campaign to Protect Rural England&#151;a gentleman of great standing in my community who has lived in Shrewsbury for many years&#151;told me that there is less congestion in Shrewsbury now than there was in the 1960s and 1970s, due to our excellent park-and-ride scheme. Shrewsbury and Atcham borough council, which is an excellent council, has some very exciting plans for a cultural and educational quarter in Shrewsbury town centre. I have great aspirations for the very heart of Shrewsbury; I want it to develop and become a magnet for tourists and inward investment. Securing that inward investment is not necessarily easy for a place such as Shrewsbury, because it is a historic town. It does not have a modern layout. That is why it is difficult to compete against new towns, such as Telford and others. We have to fight doubly hard to secure that business investment.</p>

Only when it has done a proper business analysis, based on the real situation, will it make a decision about whether to bid for funding from the transport innovation fund&#151;TIF. In order to do that, the council will have to take the public of Shrewsbury and&#151;I guess&#151;the hon. Gentleman with it and demonstrate the value of the scheme.</p>

We have said clearly that we will not proceed with a national scheme until we have seen it working in local areas that have introduced it on a voluntary basis. Only then would we make a decision about a national scheme. No national scheme has been designed and nothing will happen unless we can take with us the 1.8 million people who signed the petition that the hon. Gentleman mentioned.</p>

That will have an impact on his constituents as much as it will on mine. What will he and his Department do to ensure that the scheme will not be introduced unless it takes with it people who do not live in the immediate locality of Greenwich, given that the Mayor imposed a congestion charge in west London that manifestly did not take the people with it? What will the Minister do to ensure that his constituents and mine do not have such a scheme imposed on them against their will?</p>

 Those factors will be considered should any such scheme be put to us. At this stage, we have seen no business case for such a scheme. Transport for London may or may not be thinking about it. It will be for TFL and the Mayor to consult local people and to see whether they are interested in the potential benefits that such a scheme could offer. It will then make a bid for TIF funding, in just the same way as any other local authority would, and we will all have our say then. However, we should wait until we see some proposals before we panic too much about them.</p>

I am coming to hear about it, but it is for the local council and people to decide whether road charging might be part of the solution to their problems and to bring a scheme forward. I am simply making a private visit to meet politicians, both local authority and national, to hear for myself about their ideas.</p>

I emphasise again, as I emphasised all through that speech, that no system has been designed and that there are various ways in which we could design systems that protect people&#146;s privacy.

because of the huge interest that the issue has given rise to in my community. People are keen for me to raise the issue in the Commons. He says that the county council will make the decision. May I ask for clarification on that point? As I mentioned at the beginning of my speech, my understanding and that of my constituents is that TIF is telling us that, if we want the north-west relief road, which is the last quarter link in our ring road, we have to have congestion charging. Is it possible for TIF to make those specific demands in relation to funding or can we reject them and still have the north-west relief road?</p>

<p><a name="st_o230"><a name="07030262000793"><a name="70302-0013.htm_spnew6"><a name="07030262001313"><b>Dr. Ladyman:</b>
 Shrewsbury can indeed reject demand management and still make bids for the north-west relief road through the normal channels. The TIF congestion money is in addition to all the sources that are normally in place for transport infrastructure funding. If Shrewsbury decides that it does not want to go ahead with demand management&#151;if demand management is not part of the package and therefore Shrewsbury feels that it is not eligible to apply for money from TIF&#151;it can make its application through the regional funding allocation process in the same way as it would normally. If the project is prioritised by the region, it will go ahead. If it is not, it will wait until it is prioritised by the region.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o299"><a name="70302-0013.htm_para15"><a name="07030262000794">Potentially, the TIF congestion fund gives Shrewsbury the opportunity to move more quickly on that. There is a sum of money that we want to use to create packages&#151;part of which will involve demand management. We can use that to demonstrate to the public how demand management will work in practice, as part of a process of taking the debate forward. If demand management is not an obvious part of the solution in Shrewsbury, or if it is not popular in Shrewsbury and Shrewsbury does not want to go in that direction, it can use all the existing avenues of funding that would normally be available anyway. I hope that that gives the hon. Gentleman the assurance that he sought.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o300"><a name="70302-0013.htm_para16"><a name="07030262000795">I am sure that we all agree that congestion is bad for everybody. It affects quality of life and business. The Eddington report recently set out the long-term challenges and options ahead of us. It is clear that congestion is going to get worse and impose substantial costs on business. Eddington shows us that as the economy and prosperity grow, people can afford new choices about where they live and shop, and how they engage in leisure activities. Congestion is predicted to rise by 25 per cent. by 2015. There are 6 million more vehicles on the road now than in 1997 and that trend is going to continue. Unchecked, congestion would mean that journeys would take longer and be less reliable. The costs of that would be real. Sir Rod estimated that if we did nothing, by 2025 congestion could cost an extra &#163;22 billion a year in wasted time. Around half of that &#163;22 billion would be direct costs on business.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o301"><a name="70302-0013.htm_para17"><a name="07030262000796">There is not a single magic fix to the congestion problem. We are, of course, improving public transport and the road network. We have doubled investment since 1997. We are spending &#163;2.5 billion on buses and &#163;4 billion on trains this year alone, with the result that more people are using them than have done for decades. We will continue to invest and we plan to deliver &#163;140 billion in sustained investment in transport over the 10 years to 2015.</p>

We are developing smarter travel arrangements by encouraging flexible working, sustainable travel-to-school initiatives and active traffic management. We are putting in place that panoply of measures to keep traffic moving, but despite all of that, and despite the &#163;140 billion we will spend, congestion will get worse&#151;increasing by 25 per cent. by 2015.</p>

There will be local pilot schemes, and only when we have seen whether they are successful will any decision be made about a national scheme. The Liberal Democrats, who are not in their places, also support the principle of road pricing.</p>

 I have said on the record that we recognise that the price mechanism can work, but it is a huge leap from that to a national scheme.

<p><a name="stpa_o304"><a name="70302-0013.htm_para20"><a name="07030262000800">In other countries, such as Holland, there is a clear, transparent programme laid out in Parliament; there are parliamentary gates in the Dutch Parliament that the process has to go through.

 Perhaps that is my failing and I have not explained it well enough, but I believe it has been well set out. We said that we will spend the next two years carrying out technology demonstrations to show people how the process would work. We will then set up local pilots with volunteer authorities. We are expecting the first of those in four to five years&#151;it may be Shrewsbury, or not, depending on how people there feel about it. It is only when we have seen whether those local pilots are a success that a decision will be made about national road pricing.</p>

Those will be included in a draft local transport Bill that will be published this year. Next year, there will be a parliamentary opportunity either to accept or reject that Bill. It will give us the powers relating to local schemes only. If those schemes are a success, and we as a nation, and the Government, decide to progress to a national scheme, a new Bill will have to be introduced to Parliament to grant powers relating to a national scheme. Therefore, we cannot progress to a national scheme without at least two parliamentary processes, and given the time scale involved, there will be at least two general elections during which those matters can be sounded out with the public. That is why we say that it will not happen if we cannot take everyone with us.</p>

I have not seen the business case yet, so I cannot comment on any specific proposals. The authority&#146;s clear vision for Shrewsbury was set out in the initial discussions. I understand that the idea is to relieve the historical and attractive town centre of choking traffic, thus making it a more pleasant environment for tourists and shoppers.
