 The Secretary of State for Health and I have today written to all Members of the House following the announcement that we made on 6 June of a &#163;142 million fund to help local authorities in England to offer free swimming to people aged over 60 and under 16, in support of a longer-term ambition to offer free swimming for all by 2012.</p>

 I welcome what the Secretary of State will confirm in writing to us. I was about to buy a new pair of swimming trunks, when I realised that in the borough of Fylde, the problem would not be accessing a swimming pool. The financially hard-pressed borough is committed to closing one of its two municipal pools. The borough is not isolated in the pressures it experiences in maintaining publicly available swimming facilities. In pursuance of the answer that the Secretary of State has just given, may I ask whether the right hon. Gentleman will work with the Local Government Association to investigate the financial pressures that hard-pressed district councils such as mine face in maintaining their swimming facilities?</p>

 I thank the right hon. Gentleman for his question. I should not want to dissuade him from purchasing his swimming trunks&#151;we want to get as many people active as possible in time for 2012. Local authorities must make a judgment about providing enough pools for the local population. His council must take its own decisions on that. The scheme that I announced gives incentives to councils that are prepared to do the most to make swimming more accessible to people, including giving them the opportunity to access capital funding to support their swimming pool stock. I hope that he will talk to Conservative colleagues on his local council so that they can come up with proposals to get more people into pools, rather than let them decline, ensuring that more people are active in time for the Olympic games.</p>

 I welcome the announcement by my right hon. Friend. In 2005, Wigan metropolitan borough council&#151;a Labour borough&#151;introduced free swimming for under-16s, and in the following year it did the same for the over-60s. There have already been some 300,000 free swims, and tens of thousands of young and older people are taking up sport and leisure for the first time. In April 2009, the scheme is to be extended to all citizens of the borough. As a consequence, we will improve health opportunities for all in sport, and people like me will start swimming rather than end up having triple heart bypasses to save their lives.</p>

That is the best use of public money in my view&#151;getting people healthy and happy, and getting them out of their homes to lead an active and independent life. My right hon. Friend puts it so well; I am proud that Wigan is one of the first councils that want to make swimming universally free by next year. I hope that will set a path for others to follow. He is right to say that in the long term the policy can relieve pressure on the national health service, and social services, too.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman is right to say that there are different models of swimming provision throughout the country, and in some cases community organisations own swimming pools. The idea is that the council is in the driving seat. We want councils to make swimming as available as possible and to remove the barriers. Whatever people say, for many families throughout the country, entry charges are still a significant barrier to going to the pool. We will announce more details before the summer recess, but the hon. Gentleman makes a good point. We want to be as flexible as possible in helping councils throughout the country come with us on this journey of removing entry charges for swimming.</p>

 I have been concerned about some of the local plans in Bradford and the area, where, it has been brought to my attention, five pools were earmarked for closure. The whole idea of the scheme is to stop councils managing a process of decline in swimming&#151;in pools, stock and use&#151;and get them thinking more positively about the contribution that swimming can make to people&#146;s sense of well-being, happiness and activity. I have made the judgment that swimming is universally popular&#151;something that everyone can imagine themselves doing and that different generations of families can do together. I believe that, if councils take a positive view of the contribution that swimming can make to managing other costs, they will reach different decisions. However, I am happy to talk to my hon.

 I am not sure whether the Secretary of State appreciates the significance of what he has said.

Yet the Secretary of State claims that the lottery would be a good source of money, and the Under-Secretary said in a parliamentary answer last week that he would discuss with Sport England a lottery contribution this summer. When will Ministers leave the lottery alone and stop using it to fund Government Olympic budget incompetence?</p>

I said that I was open minded about whether it could have a role if we wanted to take the initiative further, but it is wrong of the hon.

People who already swim will get free swimming, which is very nice for them, but that will not encourage swimming. In fact, let us be blunt: the Government are just spending money on an eye-catching gimmick.</p>

What I am beginning to hear, floating up, as it were, from the Opposition Benches, is a negativity and cynicism that is not shared by the public at large, who like the initiative and want the Olympic games to improve the way the country embraces sport and physical activity. The evidence is clear. My local authority has seen a nearly 50 per cent. increase in the number of young people going swimming. Trevor Barton, who was chair of Wigan borough sports council, and Rodney Hill, the chief executive of the Wigan leisure and culture trust, have said and proven that if we go down that path, people will take up swimming and new people will be brought into the pool. The hon. Gentleman might be cynical about that, but I most certainly am not.</p>

In the past four years, more local authority pools have opened than have closed in this country, contrary to popular belief. In the local area agreement process, which my right hon.

Anyone who saw the world cycling championships recently will know that Great Britain got 10 of the 17 gold medals available. Cycling is a progressive sport, and the organisation will perhaps consider my hon. Friend&#146;s bid in the light of the new sports plans.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman makes a good point. In the past few years, many private sector pools have opened, and making the best possible use of them is a matter for local decision making. As I said earlier, more local authority pools have opened than have closed, which is in itself a positive statement. In constructing the scheme, we want to provide the capital that is available to those local authorities that are prepared to do most. If the hon. Gentleman will accept the logic, the more that people use pools, the more that such local authorities deserve help with the maintenance and improvement of facilities. He makes a good point: some councils&#146; pools are run by private organisations on a contractual basis. I am prepared to be flexible to help all councils make the best possible use of the pools located in their areas.</p>

 May I say to the Chairman of the Culture, Media and Sport Committee that the Government often conduct a consultation on the back of a preference&#151;a clearly stated view&#151;and that is what I did in this instance?

I further take the view that, especially when we contemplate the pressures that commercial television may face in the future, we in this country should think about allowing the space between programmes to be sold, and not the space within them. I do not believe that British viewers want to think that the hand of the ad sales director might have been at play in editorial decisions.

That is as it should be, because the arts change and it is important that the Arts Council reflects that in its distribution of moneys. I share the hon.

 With respect to my hon. Friend, I think that he might be referring to the figures for the Olympic village, not the figures for target pistol shooting, which have not been published. The figures for the Olympic village have been subject to some coverage. They have been fully disclosed at this stage to the National Audit Office and are on the public record. The important thing is that the deal is a matter for commercial negotiation and as such, it is not right nor possible&#151;neither is it the best way to protect taxpayers&#146; money&#151;to make every step of the negotiations available.

 With permission, Mr. Speaker, I should like to make a statement about the European Council held in Brussels that I attended with the Foreign Secretary on 19 and 20 June. The main business of the Council on Thursday and Friday evening was to focus on the economic challenges ahead&#151;the triple challenge of rising oil prices, rising food prices and, because of the credit crunch, the rising cost of money&#151;and, in the wake of the US downturn, on measures to keep the European economy moving forward.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o9"><a name="80623-0004.htm_para0"><a name="08062311000154">Important conclusions were also reached on the Irish referendum, on climate change, on the millennium development goals and on the European response to the deteriorating situation in Zimbabwe. On Thursday evening, in the discussion on the Irish referendum vote, the Irish Taoiseach, Brian Cowen, offered to the Council meeting in October a report on the next stage for Ireland. The Council held that other member states will continue with their ratification processes and I was able to report for the UK that&#151;like in 18 other countries&#151;the Lisbon treaty had completed its parliamentary process and that the Bill received Royal Assent on Thursday. Once we have received the judgment in the ongoing legal case, we will move to ratification.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o10"><a name="80623-0004.htm_para1"><a name="08062311000155">This time last year the price of oil was about $65 a barrel. At the last European Council in March it stood at $107. At the June Council, the oil price had risen further still to more than $135 a barrel. The global challenge that we face is a rising demand for oil&#151;particularly from China and the other emerging economies now and in the future&#151;that has so far been only partly met by an increase in supply, driving up fuel bills for families across the whole of Europe. Governments are taking action domestically to help&#151;including our winter allowance and the new agreement that we have signed with utility companies for low-income households&#151;but we know that those are ultimately global problems that require global solutions. The shared European view is that we must take action to reduce our dependence on oil and to improve our energy efficiency.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o11"><a name="80623-0004.htm_para2"><a name="08062311000156">The new technology of carbon capture and storage will help us continue to use coal, oil and gas in a way that avoids harmful emissions, so earlier this year we reiterated our commitment to move forward with up to 12 commercial scale carbon capture and storage plants by 2015. Last week, accepting UK arguments about the importance and urgency of the matter, the Council called on the Commission to bring forward an incentive mechanism to achieve that goal. Britain is ready to have the first such plant in Europe.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o12"><a name="80623-0004.htm_para3"><a name="08062311000157">Transport will account for two thirds of future increases in oil demand so improving fuel efficiency and exploring alternatives to petrol and diesel is essential to incentivise innovation among car manufacturers. The UK will continue to push for a commitment to an EU-wide car emissions target of 100 g per kilometre by 2020&#151;down from 160 g, and a 40 per cent. reduction&#151;saving the British family about &#163;500 a year in fuel costs. At Britain&#146;s urging, the Council also agreed to explore the scope to accelerate the introduction of commercially viable electric vehicles and the infrastructure that their widespread use  <br>

would require across the EU. Generating electricity is significantly less carbon intensive than using oil, and with all major car manufacturers&#151;including all UK-based ones&#151;now close to developing commercially viable hybrid and electric vehicles, they have the potential to reduce our dependency on oil and our carbon emissions as well as to create thousands of jobs in the British automotive industry.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o13"><a name="80623-0004.htm_para4"><a name="08062311000158">All those measures will help to meet our overall target of reducing carbon emissions by 20 per cent. by 2020&#151;or by 30 per cent. as part of a wider international agreement&#151;but these decisions are made in the context of a dialogue between oil producers and consumers, where both should commit to greater transparency and a better balance between supply and demand. The Council therefore welcomed Saudi Arabia&#146;s high-level meeting between oil producers and consumers, which I attended, in Jeddah this weekend. I am today writing to all European leaders to inform them of the results of the Jeddah process, which will lead to a follow-up summit in London later this year. I can tell the House that the summit discussed measures to deliver a more sustainable global oil price, to reduce the risks and uncertainty that can increase prices and to ensure greater investment in oil production as well as energy efficiency and alternatives to oil.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o14"><a name="80623-0004.htm_para5"><a name="08062311000159">I proposed that Britain and other oil consumers should open up our markets to new investment from oil producers in all forms of energy, including renewables and nuclear, providing all producers with a long-term future in non-oil energy. In return, oil producers should be open to increased funding and expertise in oil exploration and development through co-operation with external investors, providing increased oil supply in the medium term while growing economies adjust to a less oil-intense long-term future. The House will know that Saudi Arabia announced at the summit its increases in oil production.</p>

Higher food prices cause concern to many of us here at home, but in poor countries, where food often accounts for more than half a family&#146;s spending, they can be even more devastating. To tackle rising prices both here and overseas and to help boost agricultural production, the Council agreed to implement the conclusions of the Rome food summit. It also agreed to assess the evidence of the indirect impact of biofuel, and the UK&#146;s Gallagher review on the indirect impact, due to report shortly, will be part of that process.</p>

That is something that I have discussed with President Bush, President Lula, Chancellor Merkel and President Barroso as well as with the European Trade Commissioner, Peter Mandelson, in recent days. I believe that while we are at the eleventh hour in getting a trade deal, a trade deal is definitively within our grasp.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o18"><a name="80623-0004.htm_para9"><a name="08062311000163">As part of the year of action on the millennium development goals, and ahead of the G8 in July and the United Nations meeting in September, the European Council signed up to an agenda for action that reaffirms EU aid targets and sets specific milestones for the developing countries, to be achieved by 2010: increased European investment of &#8364;4 billion to recruit 6 million more teachers, and, on health, an extra &#8364;8 billion to help save 4 million children&#146;s lives and provide for 75 million more bed nets against mosquitoes in Africa. I will be pushing the G8 in July to ensure that we have as a world the 120 million nets that we need, so that every child in every family in the world is able to sleep safely at night. The Commission has also agreed to establish millennium development goal contracts, linking European Union spending to specific and agreed outcomes by developing countries, that will secure value for money. I am pleased to announce a British contribution of &#163;200 million to that fund.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o19"><a name="80623-0004.htm_para10"><a name="08062311000164">The Council also discussed the deteriorating political and humanitarian situation in Zimbabwe. In recent weeks under Mugabe&#146;s increasingly desperate and criminal regime, Zimbabwe has seen more than 80 killings, 2,700 beatings, the displacement of 34,000 people and the arrest and detention of Opposition leaders, including Tendai Biti and Morgan Tsvangirai. In the face of that unacceptable situation, the European Council reiterated its readiness to take further measures against those responsible for the violence. We will seek to impose travel and financial sanctions on those in the inner circle of the criminal cabal running the regime.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o20"><a name="80623-0004.htm_para11"><a name="08062311000165">The House knows that since the Council met last week, the situation has deteriorated further still. As a number of African Presidents and Ministers have already stated, the regime has made it impossible to hold free and fair elections in Zimbabwe, and state-sponsored terror and intimidation have put the Opposition in an untenable position. Our thoughts are with the people of Zimbabwe, who are facing an unprecedented level of violence and intimidation from the regime. The whole world is of one view: that the status quo cannot continue. The African Union has called for the violence to end. The current Government&#151;with no parliamentary majority, having lost the first round of the presidential elections and holding power only because of violence and intimidation&#151;are a regime who should not be recognised by anyone.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o21"><a name="80623-0004.htm_para12"><a name="08062311000166">The UN Security Council will meet later today. The Foreign Secretary will make a detailed statement in a few minutes following the discussions that he and I, and my right hon. Friend the Minister for Africa, Lord Malloch-Brown, have held with African leaders. Today, I have talked to the United Nations Secretary-General, Ban Ki-moon; to the president of the African Union, Mr. Kikwete; to the President of South Africa; and to Morgan Tsvangirai himself. Members of the Southern African Development Community and the African Union leadership will want to meet to discuss the emergency. We understand that there are plans for meetings very soon, and we support that happening quickly.</p>

the truth about what has been happening. We urge that the UN and the African Union work together with SADC to send envoys and a mission to Zimbabwe to discuss the situation on the ground and the way forward. We believe that the UN envoy should be allowed to return immediately to examine the human rights violations. The international community must send a powerful and united message: that we will not recognise the fraudulent election rigging and the violence and intimidation of a criminal and discredited cabal. We are ready to offer substantial help for the reconstruction of Zimbabwe once democracy has been restored.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o23"><a name="80623-0004.htm_para14"><a name="08062311000168">The Council also expressed its ongoing concern about the humanitarian situation in Burma in the aftermath of the cyclone and called for a return to democracy and the immediate release of Aung San Suu Kyi and other political prisoners.

Vitally&#151;he hinted at this, but perhaps he could go further&#151;will he set out a detailed rescue package for the post-Mugabe era to make it absolutely clear that when Mugabe goes we will do all that we can to breathe new life into that country and into those people who have suffered so much? But is not there something else that we can do? Should not we now make it clear that we are prepared to withdraw international recognition from Mugabe&#146;s regime to say to him and his henchmen: &#147;You are no longer the legitimate Government of the country you are terrorising&#148;? The Foreign Secretary shakes his head, but the Prime Minister&#146;s statement was so opaque that perhaps he can be a little bit clearer in his reply about withdrawing recognition. If he rattles these things off like a machine gun, it is extremely difficult for people to follow things. Let me take this nice and slowly so that he can concentrate.</p>

On that basis, was not the European Council a huge disappointment? On free trade, there was nothing more than platitudes. There was no new action on the common agricultural policy, and not a mention of the EU keeping its own costs under control. Meanwhile, at a time of rising living costs, have not our own Government given up &#163;7 billion of our rebate&#151;taxpayers&#146; hard-earned money&#151;with nothing in return?</p>

We welcome what he says about the 100 g carbon dioxide target for new cars by 2020&#151;that is, I can announce, another Conservative policy introduced by this Government. Given his enthusiasm, though, why is he going ahead with the Kingsnorth coal-fired power station without carbon capture and storage, why has he done so little on tidal and wave power, and why is he dragging his feet on feed-in tariffs? Clearly, the supply of crude oil is important, but what is he proposing to do about the danger that prices are being driven higher because financial institutions are investing so heavily in commodities, including oil?</p>

I have spoken to the other African leaders, as has the Foreign Secretary and the Minister for Africa. Many of those leaders signed a statement last week, calling for democracy in Zimbabwe, and they, too, are appalled by the recent turn of events and understand the frustrations that have led the opposition party to pull out of the elections, but they want a positive way forward that avoids an extension of the violence. I call on the African Union and the Southern African Development Community, working with the United Nations, to send a mission to Zimbabwe so that we can see a way forward from today&#146;s events.</p>

The Irish Government made it clear that they were not seeking to persuade other countries not to ratify the treaty. That is why the Leader of the Opposition is isolated in Europe; he claims that other European Governments are with him, but every other country is moving ahead with the ratification process because, unlike him, they believe the first words of the declaration of Brussels almost a year ago: the constitutional concept has been abandoned and the reform treaty is very different from the original treaty, which has been forsworn. He asks whose voice has been heard&#151;this Parliament&#146;s voice has been heard and he should respect the fact that the House of Commons and the House of Lords both voted in favour of the treaty; otherwise it could not have received royal consent.</p>

He wants to tackle poverty in Europe, but refuses to support the social chapter and wants to repatriate social policy. He wants a world trade deal, but that can happen only through Europe working as Europe to make that possible. He wants action on food prices, but that, as well as action on issues related to the economy, can be best done by being part of the European Union. I sometimes think that the Conservative party forgets that nearly 60 per cent. of our trade is with Europe and that 3 million jobs depend on our membership of the European Union. The Conservative party is isolated not only in Europe, but in the perverse view that blames everything on Europe, when Europe is delivering many good things for the British people.</p>

In truth, it was more about catching up with fast-moving developments than about setting the pace for the future. Rather than being their master, the summit was in many ways a slave to events, whether the aftermath of the Irish vote on the Lisbon treaty or the unscheduled spat between the French President and the Prime Minister&#146;s good friend, the EU Trade Commissioner.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o45"><a name="80623-0005.htm_para7"><a name="08062311000195">On the Lisbon treaty, the Prime Minister is right, of course, that we need to respect the need for the Irish Government to consider their next steps before October. However, as a supporter of the treaty, I none the less worry that we might soon make the best the enemy of the good. Uncertainty beyond October would genuinely raise the spectre of a paralysed European Union, unable to deliver concrete benefits to European citizens. So will he give some assurance that the treaty&#146;s fate, whatever one thinks about it, will be sealed one way or another in October and that we will not be pitched into months of further uncertainty about the treaty?</p>

I hope that the international community will consider all the options available, including the case for stopping foreign currency remittances into Zimbabwe, restricting electricity supplies from South Africa and Mozambique, and encouraging the Southern African Development Community to take more action. However, does the Prime Minister agree that there are more things that he could do now, here? Will he, for instance, consider allowing asylum seekers who are fleeing Mugabe&#146;s brutal regime to live and work temporarily in the United Kingdom, until such time as Zimbabwe is more stable and they can return home?</p>

at home, too. So will he emulate the example of other European Union countries, such as Spain, whose Government have clawed back some of the massive subsidies that energy-generating companies have been handed on a plate through the European emissions trading scheme, to compel energy companies to help the fuel poor and to promote energy efficiency in our homes on the scale that is now urgently needed?</p>

 I agree with what the right hon. Gentleman said about Zimbabwe. All of us are appalled by the violence taking place, and all of us are looking for a way forward. Each asylum case is dealt with on an individual basis, but I will consider what he has said about that. However, he must agree that the priority is to see an end to the violence in Zimbabwe and a way forward that allows democracy to be properly in existence there, and then, once democracy is restored, to see how we can help with the reconstruction of that country.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o49"><a name="80623-0005.htm_para11"><a name="08062311000200">The right hon. Gentleman mentioned carbon capture. We are leading the rest of the European Union in seeking to have the first demonstration plant, and then the first commercial plant, for carbon capture. We want the EU to provide a mechanism by which that will be possible, because it is an expensive thing to do. We are urging the Council&#151;I hope that he would support this&#151;to ensure that, from the budget of the European Union, there is a means by which carbon capture can be given some support.</p>

I agree with him that they are the major problems that many households up and down the country face, with the cost of food in the supermarket and the cost of petrol at the petrol pumps, as well as gas and electricity bills being higher as a result of the oil price. However, he underestimates the extent to which we have raised the winter allowance. We have provided additional help for insulation, which was billions of pounds in previous years and will be billions of pounds in the years to come, to help people insulate and draught-proof their houses, and to make energy-efficient and environmentally sensitive adjustments. When the right hon. Gentleman talks about the utility companies, I think that he has forgotten that we have just negotiated a deal that gives us &#163;150 million a year after next year&#151;the deal will go for many years&#151;to provide extra money to give help to low-income households.</p>

We have said to the Irish Government that it is for them to come forward with their proposals. It is for them to suggest, as they have done, that they need time to look at this. They will then submit a report to the Council in October. At a time when we have 26 other countries moving towards ratification, the Irish will come to us with their views about what can be done, and we will look at the matter in October. It is fair to give the Irish Government the time to assess the situation and then bring their proposals forward to us.</p>

There is now a threat to the stability of the whole of southern Africa. Does the Prime Minister agree that perhaps the only key to progress lies with the African Union and with SADC? Will he try to impress upon the leaders in southern Africa, who are now speaking out more eloquently than they have done before, that the answer is not simply a mission to Zimbabwe but a withholding of recognition of Mugabe&#146;s Government by the African Union and SADC, and a threat to the Zimbabwe Government that they will be suspended from the African Union and SADC, if they do not embark immediately on the necessary reforms?</p>

I sense that the surrounding leaders are becoming increasingly angry and appalled by the events that are taking place, and that they are now prepared to speak out against them. He is also right to say that we should discuss all possible measures to ease the situation there. I agree with him that a mission to Zimbabwe in itself is only the first stage in dealing with the problems that exist. I also agree that none of the African states should recognise the legitimacy of the Mugabe regime, and they should certainly not recognise any elections&#151;if they go ahead&#151;that take place at the end of the week.</p>

He is in good company in saying that the whole world must speak out and give no legitimacy to that regime. It is time that we supported the people of Zimbabwe, who want democratic rule and a return to prosperity.</p>

 I would like to ask my right hon. Friend many questions about the policy issues, but I am afraid that there is a great barrier between my wish and the reality. That barrier is the Irish referendum. It is quite clear from all the legal advice and the Crotty decision that Ireland would require another referendum or amendments to be made to the constitution, the Lisbon treaty&#151;[<i> Interruption.</i>] You know what I said about that in the past.

I think that he would agree, however, that in the situation in which we find ourselves, when 26 countries are moving ahead towards ratification, but one country after a referendum is unable to do so, we should give that country time to consider the position. There are many reasons that the Taoiseach will want to look at in reflecting on the result of the referendum and many issues were not exclusively concerned with the treaty itself. There are reasons such as the state of the economy and other matters in Ireland, as well as the provisions of the treaty, that could have contributed to the result&#151;[Hon.

 It was a decision made by the Saudi Government as the right decision to increase oil production around the world. All oil producers are sensitive to the fact that demand for oil is rising very quickly, as a result not just of what is happening in China, India and Asia, but of the growth in the oil-producing countries themselves. Supply will have to adjust to meet that demand. There are many ways of doing that: to find alternative sources of supply than oil, such as nuclear and renewables; and to make the use of oil more efficient, through improved technology for running vehicles and other means of conserving energy. One way forward will be that those oil suppliers who have the capacity to do so should use that capacity to increase their production of oil. The Saudi Government are aware that many people have argued that it is important that they increase their production where they can, and that is what they announced yesterday.</p>

The problem is that there has been insufficient investment in capacity and refining in previous years, and another problem is that some oil-producing countries get their oil to the marketplace in inefficient ways. These forces should be examined. That is why British oil companies, and oil companies from outside the region, should be allowed to invest, so that we have higher production and better refining in these areas.

Thousands of teachers and public servants who had volunteered as presiding officers in the first round withdrew their names for fear of violence and intimidation in the second round. By Sunday, only 84 election observers had been accredited, when more than 10,000 had applied. It is also a matter of public record that Morgan Tsvangirai has been detained five times in the last 10 days, and that the secretary-general of the Movement for Democratic Change, Tendai Biti, has been in prison and charged with a trumped-up treason offence since arriving back in Harare.

This is surely the time for those to be seriously extended and rigorously enforced. In particular, should they not include extending the EU visa ban and assets freeze to associates and relatives of regime members, many of whom currently travel and study in Europe with impunity?

They held out the possibility that democratic practices might be deepened on that continent. However, the recent use of violence, intimidation and politically motivated harassment of various forms to retain power in Kenya, Uganda, Ethiopia and now, so spectacularly, in Zimbabwe have undermined that trend. Is it not therefore more crucial than ever that we send a message of unity and clarity to the criminal regime of Mugabe and those who may be tempted to use intimidation and brutality against their own people that that can never be accepted as the norm, and that the people of Africa deserve the rule of law and freedom just like the rest of us?</p>

Sometimes calling for such things makes it more difficult to gather support for them, but we certainly believe that all aspects of international law should be used where appropriate. We will not shy away from using the tools that are at our disposal, although as the Prime Minister made clear, Zimbabwe is not a signatory to the International Criminal Court, and any action on that level would therefore require a UN Security Council resolution.</p>

Certainly it was gut-wrenching to see him turn up at a summit to discuss food, of all things, but it is not possible to ban him from attending the UN summit until he is no longer the President of Zimbabwe. In respect of Mugabe&#146;s legitimacy, the right hon. Gentleman raised an important point about the need, even in the first 24 hours after Mr. Tsvangirai&#146;s decision not to contest the second round, of southern African countries not to throw in their lot with Mugabe&#146;s rule. As the right hon. Gentleman said, those countries should refuse to recognise the Government as a legitimate expression of the will of the Zimbabwean people.</p>

Government of national unity should be formed under Morgan Tsvangirai. In order to ensure that those demands are met, are the Government willing to take three further steps on a temporary basis until the regime complies? First, will they act to stop the remittances that provide the hard foreign currency that sustains the regime in power? Secondly, will they pressure the Governments of South Africa and Mozambique to be willing to restrict or cut off the supply of electricity to Zimbabwe? Thirdly, will they exceptionally allow asylum seekers from Zimbabwe to work in this country should they seek refuge here? Those are drastic steps but they would remove the only resources that now sustain this evil regime. The Government must show now that they are prepared to take such steps.</p>

 Of all right hon. and hon. Members in the House, my hon. Friend has played a long-term role in standing up for decent values in Zimbabwe.

We should speak plainly of our own views, but we should engage with those countries, and whatever the levels of frustration, the worst signal to send would be that the leading industrialised countries had lost interest in talking to, in this case, those countries&#146; democratically elected leaders.

There is also a short-term need for the UN to play its proper role.

However, there is a precedent for taking individual action. For instance, the British Government took action on Bosnia before there was international agreement. I heard what Lord Malloch-Brown said about taking action against individuals who support the regime around Robert Mugabe to prevent them from moving and about freezing their assets. Is there any possibility of the Government taking action of that kind, to send those people around Robert Mugabe the strong message that after the situation is over, they will still face action?</p>

 The issue of EU sanctions on travel or finance, which I think is what Lord Malloch-Brown was talking about, is rightly on the agenda and is part of the drive.

Morgan Tsvangirai would obviously have won an overwhelming victory in the presidential election, had it been free and fair.

However, Morgan Tsvangirai himself has made it clear that he does not seek to replace one one-party rule with another one-party rule, but is seeking support from across parties. ZANU-PF splintered, in a way that led to Mr. Makoni running in the first round of the presidential election and securing 8 per cent. of the vote.

Friend the Member for Manchester, Central (Tony Lloyd), who is no longer in his place, mentioned earlier. Economic and social reconstruction, rather than military reconstruction, is what is needed. The issue of Zimbabwe is discussed at the UN, and was discussed in the debate on post-conflict reconstruction that I chaired in New York last month. We are determined to play our part, but recognise that this is a multilateral issue, not just a bilateral one. The more that it is recognised as such, the better.</p>

 Before I start on the detail of the amendments, I should like to place on record my appreciation of the constructive way in which hon. Members have contributed to the development of the Bill. Opposition Members will recognise among the amendments topics that we first discussed in this House, on which further debate followed in another place. The positive engagement across all parties in both Houses, but particularly between the two Front Benches, has helped fundamentally to improve the Bill, which meets our shared aim of providing an effective framework for a continuing programme of loan sales and offering full protection for borrowers.</p>

 May I take this opportunity, even though it is very early in the Minister&#146;s speech, to pay him the compliment of saying that he has dealt with these matters with great professionalism?

Lords amendments Nos. 1 and 4 cover the notification of sales to borrowers and, as I underlined in Committee, we have always intended to let borrowers know when their loan has been sold. Having listened to the arguments, we have strengthened that intention&#151;in Lords amendment No. 1&#151;into an obligation for the Secretary of State to take reasonable steps to let all affected borrowers know within three months that their loan has been sold.</p>
<br>


<meta name="Date" content="23 Jun 2008">

<notus-date day="23" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>23 Jun 2008 : Column 58</b><br>

<p><a name="stpa_o103"><a name="80623-0009.htm_para3"><a name="08062324000103">Lords amendment No. 4 would mean that, in the unlikely event of an onward sale of the legal title to the loans, the initial loan purchaser would be obliged to take reasonable steps to let the borrower know that their loan had been sold on. Lords amendment No. 5 also relates to onward sales. As I said in earlier stages of these proceedings, the borrower&#146;s primary protection in the sales programme lies in the fact that purchasers cannot change the repayment terms, which remain governed by regulations. That is an important protection, but we want the added safeguard that the Secretary of State can enforce any protections contained in the sales contract, including after any onward sale, however unlikely that might be.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o104"><a name="80623-0009.htm_para4"><a name="08062324000104">The Bill has from the outset enabled the Secretary of State to insist on being a party in some form or other to onward transfers. Having listened to the arguments put by hon. Members here and in the other place, we have made it a requirement in amendment No. 5 for the Secretary of State to ensure in the initial sales contract that he is party to any subsequent contract transferring legal title to the loans.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o105"><a name="80623-0009.htm_para5"><a name="08062324000105">Amendment No. 6 clarifies how the Bill addresses onward sales, putting it beyond doubt that the provisions of clause 3 relate only to the transfer of legal title of the loans. Without that clarification, potential purchasers and investors may be deterred from participating in loan sales in the mistaken belief that the Secretary of State will need to be a party to all transfers and the onward transfer of equitable rights that can take place in the context of a securitisation. That has never been our intention. Seeking to regulate this division of equitable interests would be unnecessary and unworkable, given the complexity of the structures. Only the legal owner has a relationship with the borrower and the student finance system as servicer, so the Secretary of State only needs to be able to regulate the legal owner&#146;s dealings with the loans.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o106"><a name="80623-0009.htm_para6"><a name="08062324000106">Amendments Nos. 8 and 9 will mean that, when making or amending the loan regulations or regulations under section 186 of the Education Act 2002, the Secretary of State must seek to ensure that borrowers will not as a consequence of the amendments be in a worse position simply because their loan has been sold. This provision will apply to all changes in regulations after any loans have been sold, not just where an undertaking may have been made. That represents a strengthening of the statement already made on the record that borrowers will not be adversely affected by their loan being sold. It will, I believe, give borrowers confidence that the commitment is intended to stand the test of time.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o107"><a name="80623-0009.htm_para7"><a name="08062324000107">Finally, amendment No. 10 is a minor drafting improvement, expanding a cross-reference in clause 5(4) into a reference to the whole of clause 2 rather than just clause 2(2). That will indicate more clearly that the transfer arrangements in general may provide for exceptions to the presumption that all moneys relating to sold loans should be paid to the purchaser. Such an exemption could cover, for example, penalties relating to compliance with the tax system.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o108"><a name="80623-0009.htm_para8"><a name="08062324000108">I am also aware of the Opposition amendment to Lords amendment No. 8, tabled by the hon. Member for South Holland and The Deepings (Mr. Hayes). I know that the Opposition wish to speak to that amendment, so I will respond to what is said about that later.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o109"><a name="80623-0009.htm_para9"><a name="08062324000109">Overall, the amendments in the group represent valuable strengthening and clarification of how we will ensure that the borrowers&#146; interests in the loan sale programme are protected. On that basis, I commend the amendments to the House.</p>

<p><a name="st_o209"><a name="08062324000110"><a name="80623-0009.htm_spnew5"><a name="08062324000234"><b>Mr. Rob Wilson (Reading, East) (Con):</b>
 It seems quite a long time ago that we were last here debating this Bill. In fact, it was last January. It was such a long time ago that my hon. Friend the Member for South Holland and The Deepings (Mr. Hayes) has advanced another year&#151;in fact, he does so today, so I hope that everyone will join me in wishing him a very happy birthday.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o110"><a name="80623-0009.htm_para10"><a name="08062324000111">The long time for which the Bill has been in the other place seems to have been extremely well spent, as it appears that there is much for us to agree on today. I think that we can largely welcome what is before us, although, as would be expected of a diligent Opposition, we will wish to explore a few issues in further detail. I hope that I will not detain you for too long, Mr. Deputy Speaker; after all, lengthy periods of detention are Government policy, not Opposition policy, are they not?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o111"><a name="80623-0009.htm_para11"><a name="08062324000112">Let me deal first with Lords amendments Nos. 1 and 4 together. They were proposed in response to another amendment tabled in the other place by Baroness Sharp. In moving Government amendment No. 1, Baroness Morgan said that it had</p>
<a name="80623-0009.htm_brev0"><a name="08062324000168"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;always been our clear intention to let borrowers know when their loans are sold. Having reflected on the argument that it would be better to strengthen that intention into an obligation, we propose Amendment No. 1. The Secretary of State would have to take reasonable steps to let all affected borrowers know that their loans have been sold within three months of the transaction.&#148;&#151;[<i> Official Report, House of Lords,</i> 2 June 2008; Vol. 707, c. 47.]</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o112"><a name="80623-0009.htm_para12"><a name="08062324000113">Conservative Members have raised these matters on several occasions, so it would be extremely churlish of us not to welcome these amendments. They build the Government&#146;s intention to inform borrowers directly into the Bill, exactly where it should be, and they also give the purchasers of the loan an obligation to do the same. Letting those affected by changes know within three months is appropriate and welcome. However, it would be extremely helpful if the Minister clarified what will constitute &#147;reasonable steps&#148; in those circumstances, both for the Government and indeed for the loan purchasers.</p>

<a name="80623-0009.htm_brev1"><a name="08062324000169"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;would oblige the Secretary of State to ensure that initial sale contracts contain provision for the Secretary of State to be party to any onward sale contract.&#148;</p>

The Minister will acknowledge that it follows considerable pressure from us, not least from my hon.

have to be party to onward sales. A similar amendment was tabled by the hon. Member for Hayes and Harlington (John McDonnell).</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o115"><a name="80623-0009.htm_para15"><a name="08062324000116">As my hon. Friend the Member for South Holland and The Deepings said during the debate back in January:</p>
<a name="80623-0009.htm_brev2"><a name="08062324000170"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;There are legitimate concerns about collateralised debt...History has taught us that loans can easily be repackaged and, in the end, involve a large number of different purchasers, some of whom, if they are known at all, could be outside the jurisdiction of the Secretary of State.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o116"><a name="80623-0009.htm_para16"><a name="08062324000117">The logic of such wisdom from my hon. Friend was so powerful that obviously the Minister could not resist.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o117"><a name="80623-0009.htm_para17"><a name="08062324000118">Although the Minister expressed the need for flexibility in those matters, he conceded that if an amendment tabled in the other place could be worded in such a way as to ensure that the Secretary of State was party to any onward sale, while maintaining flexibility as to the specific mechanism,</p>
<a name="80623-0009.htm_brev3"><a name="08062324000171"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;we would certainly consider it.&#148; .&#148;&#151;[<i> Official Report</i>, 23 January 2008; Vol. 470, c. 1558, 1570.]</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o119"><a name="80623-0009.htm_para19"><a name="08062324000120">The explanatory notes make it clear, as the Minister did in his opening remarks, that amendment No. 6 is essentially a technical measure. I therefore do not propose to dwell on it and shall move directly to amendment No. 8. I will also speak to amendment No. 9, and to the amendment in the name of my hon. Friend the Member for South Holland and The Deepings.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o120"><a name="80623-0009.htm_para20"><a name="08062324000121">Let me be frank: our amendment is probing and it aims to tease out a little more reassurance from the Minister. We would like further explanation on the record about how those loans might end up in circumstances in which a particular loan structure changed. The explanatory notes state:</p>
<a name="80623-0009.htm_brev4"><a name="08062324000172"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Lords Amendments 8 and 9 would require the Secretary of State to give consideration to borrowers whose loans have been sold in making or amending loan regulations, and in making or amending regulations under section 186 of the Education Act 2002, so as to&#148;&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o121"><a name="80623-0009.htm_para21"><a name="08062324000122">this is the important bit&#151;</p>

</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o122"><a name="80623-0009.htm_para22"><a name="08062324000123">Essentially, the Secretary of State must make a comparison to ascertain whether a borrower is worse off as a result of any proposed amendment to regulations. That must be compared with no change at all&#151;that is, with what would have been the situation if the loan had never been sold.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o123"><a name="80623-0009.htm_para23"><a name="08062324000124">Lords amendment No. 8 is specifically concerned with the financial impact on borrowers, about which Conservative Members have expressed unease during previous debates. The Minister said on the record, early on in the process of considering the Bill, that the Government</p>
<a name="80623-0009.htm_brev6"><a name="08062324000174"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;want to be able to demonstrate, and for the reality to be, that a graduate repaying their loan finance will see not one iota of difference in the way in which that process is handled, whether their debt is owned by the Government or by the private sector.&#148;<i> &#151;&#151;[Official Report, Sale of Student Loans Public Bill Committee, </i>4 December 2007; c. 14, Q33.]</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o125"><a name="80623-0009.htm_para25"><a name="08062324000126">However, Lords amendment No. 8 was tabled in response to concerns that Lords amendment No. 2 to clause 2 might leave borrowers worse off. In moving the amendment in the Lords, Baroness Morgan stated:</p>
<a name="80623-0009.htm_brev7"><a name="08062324000175"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;No borrower will be in a worse position for their loan having been sold and, in developing the amendment on undertakings, we have reflected on the importance of borrowers being fully reassured on that fact.

<a name="80623-0009.htm_brev8"><a name="08062324000176"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;will mean that, when amending the regulations, the Secretary of State must seek to ensure that borrowers will not be in a worse position as a consequence of their loan being sold.&#148;&#151;[<i> Official Report, House of Lords,</i> 2 June 2008; Vol. 702, c. 54.]</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o127"><a name="80623-0009.htm_para27"><a name="08062324000128">We welcome the amendment and the noble Baroness&#146;s comments, but we have some concerns about the effectiveness of her assurance, and that of the Minister, to borrowers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o128"><a name="80623-0009.htm_para28"><a name="08062324000129">In particular, we are concerned about the wording of the amendment, which does not appear to be as strong as it could be. Our amendment would give further certainty by leaving out the words &#147;aim to&#148;. We are uncertain what the Secretary of State would achieve by &#147;aiming to&#148; ensure that no borrower whose loan was transferred would be in a worse position. I would appreciate some clarification from the Minister on what exactly is meant by &#147;aim to&#148;. Would it, for example, be possible under the amendment for borrowers to be objectively worse off, so long as the Secretary of State had aimed to prevent that? Having read the certainty in the Minister&#146;s words, and in those of the noble Baroness in the other place, I notice that Lords amendment No. 8 does not give the same level of reassurance and commitment. Why not? Will the Minister explain fully to the House why that was not possible?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o129"><a name="80623-0009.htm_para29"><a name="08062324000130">I am also keen to learn the legal status of the current wording. What has the Minister been advised about the steps that would have to be taken to ensure that he had fulfilled his duty under the amendment? What advice has he been given about the possible legal interpretation of the amendment if a transfer were subject to judicial review? By removing the words &#147;aim to&#148;, our amendment would give a copper-bottomed guarantee to borrowers that they would not be worse off as a result of their loan being transferred.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o130"><a name="80623-0009.htm_para30"><a name="08062324000131">Our main concern is for those who hold loans. We want to ensure that the exercise has no detrimental impact on them whatever. I urge the Minister to consider our amendment carefully and to fulfil his and the wider Government&#146;s earlier reassurances to the House.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o131"><a name="80623-0009.htm_para31"><a name="08062324000132">Finally, on amendment No. 10 to clause 5, the Government have conceded that the original wording in the Bill was not as clear as it should have been. As Baroness Morgan stated in her letter to Baroness Verma, dated 4 April, the amendment clarifies what the Government had always originally intended, and is &#147;a minor drafting change&#148;. That implies that the matter does not need much debate. But will the Minister put it on record that the provision is what the Government always intended, and that it is indeed &#147;a minor drafting change&#148;?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o132"><a name="80623-0009.htm_para32"><a name="08062324000133">As the Minister has agreed, there is no doubt that the Bill has been much improved by Her Majesty&#146;s Opposition&#146;s thorough inspection and the Lords amendments. Therefore, I thank the Minister and his colleagues for the professional and constructive way in which they have engaged with us.</p>

 May I associate myself with the outbreak of friendly relations between the Government and Conservative Front Benches? All our debates on Department for Innovation, Universities and Skills matters, whether on this Bill, in Question Time or on the speaking circuit outside the Chamber, are conducted in a friendly and well-informed manner.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o133"><a name="80623-0009.htm_para33"><a name="08062324000135">I welcome Lords amendment No. 1, which was tabled in response to an amendment moved by my colleague Baroness Sharp of Guildford in another place, calling for the borrowers to be included among those who are notified of the change of circumstances and the accompanying information, about which the House will be informed, once a sale has taken place, and for that notification to take place within three months.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o134"><a name="80623-0009.htm_para34"><a name="08062324000136">Lords amendments Nos. 4, 5 and 6 concern further transfers and onward sales, and stipulate that the Secretary of State should be a party to them to ensure that the Treasury&#146;s interests are safeguarded. They also clarify the fact that the onward sales are of the legal title rather than equitable interest resulting from, for instance, securitisation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o135"><a name="80623-0009.htm_para35"><a name="08062324000137">Let me raise again an issue that was raised by me and by others back in January, on Report. I assume that in all these cases the agency that will issue the various notifications on behalf of the Secretary of State will be the Student Loans Company. I do not think we want the borrower to receive multiple notifications about different aspects of his or her accumulated debt from different agencies such as the purchaser of the debt, the Department, the Student Loans Company and, indeed, Her Majesty&#146;s Revenue and Customs. I should welcome the Minister&#146;s comments on how it can be made clear to borrowers what has happened to their loans on graduation.</p>

 An audit trail will be necessary. The position could become quite convoluted over time as debts are sold and resold. Good records are important, not just for the borrower but for everyone.</p>

 I agree that it is important to have accurate records&#151;and also for them not to be lost by anyone. However, we do not want a large number of agencies to have to keep accurate records of the addresses, income and circumstances of borrowers. Once young people graduate and their incomes start rising, they tend to move about a good deal. Certainly that was my experience after I graduated. Retaining the Student Loans Company as the primary agency to continue the relationship with the borrower seems to me to make good sense.</p>

I am sure that such clauses are always carefully drafted on the basis of good advice from Treasury or other Government draftsmen. No doubt there is a good reason for the Government to &#147;aim to ensure&#148; that graduates are not put in an adverse financial position, rather than to ensure that they are not.</p>

It implies that they cannot be too precise about the conditions. I think that the hon.

 We have had a constructive debate. First, let me confirm that the proposition in Lords amendment No. 10 was always the Government&#146;s intention, and that this is a minor drafting amendment. We have throughout the passage of the Bill also made clear our current intention that the Student Loans Company will take on the responsibility of the ongoing relationship with the borrower, and that it will take the &#147;reasonable steps&#148; to inform all affected borrowers on behalf of the Secretary of State. On the point about the importance of clarity in that relationship, and the need not to create a multiple set of relationships, we need to be clear that the SLC will carry out that function, and that we do not expect onward sales to take place. Under amendment No. 4, there is the further proposition that the initial loan purchaser will also be obliged to &#147;take reasonable steps&#148; to let borrowers know that their loan has been sold. That is there as a belt-and-braces response, but I do not envisage that way forward as ever being necessary.</p>

We would expect a letter to be written to each affected borrower at the current address held by the SLC. That is an appropriate response because, importantly, borrowers are under an obligation to keep the SLC informed of their up-to-date address&#151;a fact that is relevant to a point made by the hon.

Member for South Holland and The Deepings (Mr. Hayes) to Lords amendment No. 8. As I have said, throughout the passage of the Bill it has been a key Government commitment that the borrower will not be disadvantaged as a result of any sale. It must be appreciated that we are dealing with a complex and technical regime that interacts with the tax system, and where there are a large number of moving parts there may occasionally be unintended consequences, which we would, of course, seek to rectify as soon as we became aware of them. Given that set of circumstances, it would be wrong to render changes unlawful because of a possible minor or technical infringement that it had been impossible to predict. I want to stress that amendment No. 8 does not give Ministers scope to weaken their commitment to the borrower. Under the duty it puts in place, no Minister could knowingly make an amendment to the regulations to the detriment of a borrower whose loan had been sold.</p>

 If there is a technical infringement that puts the borrower in a worse position, the Government will have to respond; in those circumstances, they will have to make clear their commitment to borrowers. However, the key point is that under the duty this amendment puts in place, no Minister could knowingly amend the regulations to the detriment of a borrower whose loan had been sold.</p>

 I shall intervene before the hon. Gentleman moves on, as he might want to amend what he is about to say. It seems to me that the argument he is developing is that the obligation will be to ensure that the Government&#146;s intent was appropriate. What we are concerned about is the outcome. The intent might well be appropriate but if the outcome was detrimental to borrowers, the Government&#146;s intentions would not be of much comfort, would they?</p>

 In those circumstances, the Government would have to respond very quickly and put that right. In dealing with this amendment, I asked officials to envisage for me the circumstances that might pertain in such a situation. We find it very difficult to envisage such a situation and to identify the problems that might occur. However, this is a belt-and-braces response that makes it clear that there would be a responsibility on the Government, in those unforeseen circumstances, to put the situation right, but the purpose of the wording  <br>

is simply to ensure that if any unintended consequence of an amendment to regulations had such an effect, the repayment regime would remain lawful pending correction of the unintended error, which would clearly be a responsibility for Government. Otherwise, there is a risk of potentially important aspects of the intended and proper repayment regime being rendered unlawful because of minor errors. That would not be in anyone&#146;s interests.</p>

 Perhaps I might start by again echoing the spirit evoked by the hon. Member for Bristol, West (Stephen Williams), who leads for the Liberal Democrats, and indeed by the Minister: a determination to ensure that the Bill does what it is supposed to, but, equally, to proceed in a spirit of co-operation wherever possible.

It was a significant addition to the Bill and is therefore worthy of detailed scrutiny here. By its nature, it has not been discussed here until now, and I think we might say unusually so.

Members present will have read with some care the record of that debate, but what they may not have been privy to is some of the correspondence surrounding this matter. In a letter to Baroness Vermer dated 4 April, Baroness Morgan, who leads for the Government in the Lords on these matters, indicated that the amendment was principally about value for money. Following discussions with the Government&#146;s adviser on the loan book sale, Deutsche Bank, she argues that it has become necessary for the Government to think again about the precise nature of the likely sale and its circumstances. She says in the letter:</p>
<a name="80623-0010.htm_brev1"><a name="08062329000034"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Because we are legislating for a long-term programme of sales&#148;&#151;</p>

</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o149"><a name="80623-0010.htm_para12"><a name="08062329000011">Let me put that into rather clearer terms for the benefit of the House and, indeed, the record. The gist of it is this. If potential purchasers of part of the loan book were able to suggest that they were buying an unquantified risk, they might well drive the price down, and they might do so in circumstances in which they felt that the Secretary of State could change the loan terms, even though they had bought the product. It is perfectly acceptable for the Government to say, following advice, that that would make the whole process untenable, and that a potential purchaser would&#151;if I may put it in the terms sometimes used in these circumstances&#151;have the Government&#146;s hand twisted up behind their collective back. No salesman wants to be in that situation, and in these terms the Minister is indeed the salesman for the Government, trying to sell the loan book at the best possible price. That is certainly in the interest of taxpayers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o150"><a name="80623-0010.htm_para13"><a name="08062329000012">However, having made the judgment that that was perfectly arguable and would justify the kind of amendment that the Government have tabled, Ministers indicated in subsequent discussions in the Lords that the reason for their amendment was rather different. They actually indicated that the amendment concerns the uncertain status of the loan book after sale and whether it would be counted as sold by the Office for National Statistics. In other words, on the one hand we were being told that this is a necessary change to facilitate the best commercial relationship with potential purchasers&#151;to secure the best deal, if I might put it that way&#151;and on the other, we were being told that it is a technical requirement to ensure that the asset had been shifted, so far as the ONS was concerned, from the public to the private sector.

The essence of my point is to discover which is the more important to the Government: is it, as we have now been led to understand, the technical change that they claim that they have to make to satisfy the ONS&#151;that position is perfectly feasible and supportable&#151;or is it, as we were first led to believe, that the Government fear that they will not be able to sell the loan book, in part or as a whole, at an attractive price unless they make the product altogether more agreeable from the perspective of potential purchasers? If that is the reason driving the Government, the spectre&#151;I do not want to be alarmist in any way, because that is not in my character&#151;of the loan book being sold off at a price that would not be in taxpayers&#146; interests, at a time that would not be optimal and in a fashion that would not be agreeable to this House or to those whom we represent begins to hover over our otherwise agreeable proceedings.</p>

Concern was expressed in the Lords about the permissive nature of the Government&#146;s amendment, and I have made reference to that. Our amendment (a) would enable the Minister to give undertakings that are enforceable in law and that bind the hands of his successors. It would enable Ministers not only to give undertakings that the loan regulations will not be changed, but to give undertakings so as to achieve a specific result. Our amendment (a) proposes to remove paragraph (a) from Lord amendment No. 2, but it is essentially a probing amendment, which doubtless comes as a relief to Ministers. It aims to ascertain what undertakings may be made by Ministers in this regard. Could the undertakings have an impact on the threshold for loan repayments or the interest rate for repayments?</p>

 There are two ways of securing a more attractive selling price.

That would involve allowing the buyers to up the amount of money that they take off the students. The Government are desperately trying to balance those matters, so I would be intrigued to learn whether my hon. Friend has had the benefit of any advice from those acting for the potential vendor as to how one maximises the price within those constraints.</p>

 The tension between those two imperatives lies at the heart of the matter. I do not wish to complicate our considerations, but may I also add a third: that the Government are obliged to deal with these things rather more hurriedly than they or the House would wish? They have made it clear&#151;Ministers have been straightforward about this&#151;that they need to sell the loan book pretty quickly, because they factored income from that sale into their spending plans.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o155"><a name="80623-0010.htm_para18"><a name="08062329000021">My right hon. Friend will know, given his extensive business and City experience, that it is not always wise to sell something at an inappropriate time and it is not always&#151;perhaps never&#151;wise to let potential purchasers know that one is going to do so. That drives the price down, because they then say that the Government have to sell, because if they do not, they will be short of brass. That is what this boils down to. We have a fear about the Lords amendment, so our probing amendment&#151; I reassure the Minister about its nature&#151;aims to ensure that he has the opportunity to clarify, on the record, the nature of the sale that will doubtless ensue as a result of this enabling legislation. My right hon. Friend is right to say that the interests of borrowers and taxpayers have been at the heart of our considerations. We would complain bitterly if, after this period of friendly co-operation, the Government used this legislation at the wrong time and got a lousy deal. If we did not complain in such circumstances, we would not be doing our duty to this House or to taxpayers.</p>

That would not be a satisfactory outcome. The additional permissiveness at the heart of the amendment may be warranted, but at the very least, we need to know what the Government are thinking, why they are thinking it and who has advised them. I know that the Minister will be anxious to clarify his and the Government&#146;s position at the earliest opportunity.</p>

Friend the Member for Wokingham (Mr. Redwood): the fact that it is crucial that we obtain good value for money and, moreover, that this House is able to test that in an empirical way. The House deserves proper information about where a sale was made, how it was made, why it was made at a particular time, the prevailing market conditions and so on.</p>

 Has my hon. Friend put it to the Minister that selling a book of loans in the middle of a credit crunch is not the normal way to maximise value for the taxpayer?

 My right hon. Friend&#146;s lucidity is matched only by his assiduity. He makes his point with a force that I would be reluctant to use. I mentioned the possibility of inappropriate sales at an inappropriate time, but as ever he draws the issue into sharp focus. It is entirely possible that the Government might be forced to sell part of the loan book at the least desirable time, in the circumstances that he describes. That would be scandalous, because the loan book is an important public asset. It is right that we should consider selling it&#151;that has been Conservative policy for some years&#151;and we welcome the spirit that lies behind the Bill, but the devil is in the detail.

Members should have access to that so that they can test the Government&#146;s adoption of the powers in the Bill against the circumstances in which the loans are sold. I am delighted that the Minister has moved a considerable way towards our position on that point by adding an amendment that makes the report a statutory requirement and requires it to be laid within three months of the date on which the Secretary of State enters into transfer arrangements.</p>

We are delighted that this amendment was tabled. We first raised our concerns on Second Reading and in Committee, and pointed out that it would be &#147;useful&#148; to have a provision on value for money that was set in stone. On Report, my hon. Friend the Member for Reading, East (Mr. Wilson) moved an amendment that would have placed value-for-money criteria on the face of the Bill. At the time the Minister described the amendment as unnecessary and I am glad that, following detailed discussions and correspondence, we have been able to find a way forward.</p>

I hope that he will be able to give us some idea of the Government&#146;s immediate intentions. Do they intend to sell a third of the loan book over the next six months to a year? If they do not intend to sell a third, what proportion do they intend to sell? We would also like some idea of the timetable, given that these amendments deal with value for money, and it is difficult for us to understand the scale of the issue unless we understand the detail of the Government&#146;s intentions.</p>

It would be useful to know whether any subsequent valuation of the loan book has been made, because it may well be that the Government need to sell more than a third to raise the stated &#163;6 billion. It could be less, of course&#151;I do not want to be too pessimistic.</p>

(Mr. Redwood), has already well rehearsed the arguments about how the Government must weigh up the interests of the taxpayer while at the same time protecting the interests of the graduates who have borrowed from the Student Loans Company.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o180"><a name="80623-0011.htm_para21"><a name="08062343000021">I understand that to secure value for money for the taxpayer and to get the best possible circumstances for a successful sale, the Government might want to reduce the uncertainty for any potential purchaser but, none the less, I am worried that Lords amendment No. 2, inserted by the Government, perhaps limits the scope for future Parliaments&#151;or, indeed, for future Governments, as the Government probably have a defined life that may well end quite soon&#151;to alter the terms of loan repayments.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o181"><a name="80623-0011.htm_para22"><a name="08062343000022">There are four aspects of loan repayments that graduates have to face and it would be entirely valid for this Government or future Governments to reconsider them. There is the threshold for the commencement of loan repayments, which is set at a salary level of &#163;15,000. That threshold has been in place for several years now and, unlike virtually all other effective aspects of the tax code, it is not indexed each year, alongside the personal allowance and higher rate tax bands. It has been left frozen at &#163;15,000 for some time and is therefore quite regressive in its impact. It would be legitimate for a future Government or this Parliament to reconsider that threshold. The repayment rate of 9 per cent. is effectively a flat-rate tax&#151;I understand that there are enthusiasts for flat-rate taxes on the Opposition Benches.</p>

 It should certainly be considered. The Minister will be aware, as I am&#151;I represent a constituency with many graduates who face these punitive loan repayments&#151;that concerns have been expressed by individuals and by the National Union of Students about the repayment terms. The rate of repayment, which is 9 per cent. of earnings, is a hefty flat-rate tax to face early on in a graduate career. The cut-off period of 25 years is a progressive part of the loan regime, which we would want to protect, but none the less the discretion of a future Parliament to review it should not be fettered.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o182"><a name="80623-0011.htm_para23"><a name="08062343000025">The terms of the rate of interest, its calculation and whether it is related to the consumer prices index or the retail prices index has, as I am sure the Minister will know, been the subject of much discussion in student circles in the past couple of years as those rates have deviated from each other. The Government choose one measure of inflation to calculate people&#146;s salary increases&#151;particularly of people in the public sector, who include many graduates&#151;but choose another to uprate the terms of their underlying graduate debt. A future Government may wish to consider all those things; I hope that the Minister is not fettering the scope of such deliberation.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman&#146;s intervention anticipated my next point. As I said on Report back in January, we assume that the transaction is of such magnitude that the National Audit Office will want to consider it retrospectively to make sure that the Government have obtained value for money for the taxpayer. In the ordinary course of events, that will lead to a hearing in front of the Public Accounts Committee, of which I used to be a member, and to another report. Will there be an additional external audit, independent of the National Audit Office, of the report that will come to Parliament? There is often a significant gap between a transaction resulting from a Government action, the National Audit Office&#146;s consideration of that transaction, the Public Accounts Committee&#146;s consideration of it and the publication of the PAC report; often there will 12-plus months in between. It is important that the report that comes to Parliament within three months should be independently verified.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman has made an extremely strong point. Will the Government encourage the National Audit Office and the Public Accounts Committee to take a look after the sale of each tranche of the book? The Minister may want to say something about that today. It seems appropriate for the PAC to do that, given the potential delay mentioned by the hon. Member for Bristol, West (Stephen Williams). If we are to have a report to Parliament in three months, why should the National Audit Office and the Public Accounts Committee not scrutinise each report?</p>

 The hon. Gentleman&#146;s point is helpful, I am sure. None the less, the independence of the Public Accounts Committee is an important part of parliamentary procedure; perhaps it should not take suggestions from the Government on when it is or is not appropriate for it to consider a particular transaction. I shall, however, be interested in the Minister&#146;s reaction to the hon. Gentleman&#146;s suggestion.</p>

In three months&#146; time, I shall probably be in Bournemouth and the Minister may well be preparing to go to wherever his conference is this year. How flexible will the period be?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o186"><a name="80623-0012.htm_para0"><a name="08062343000033">I turn to the general question of value for money. As Conservative Members have said, this is not a terribly good time for the Government to sell off part of their underlying assets. The Government may well be so desperate to make a sale at the moment that they are seeking to put terms into the Bill that are drafted to be in the interests of potential purchasers. To meet their obligations under the comprehensive spending review, the Government need to raise the proceeds that have already been referred to. In this financial year of the three-year CSR, I understand that the Government have a target to raise &#163;3.4 billion, before the end of March 2009. Will the Minister confirm that? They aim to raise &#163;6 billion overall in the three-year CSR period. Government finances are in a parlous state so will the Government be pressurised into selling this asset, which currently belongs to the taxpayer, to meet short-term financial embarrassments, rather than to make long-term investments in higher education? Such investments would be a much better use of the proceeds that will be realised once the student loan book is partially sold.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o187"><a name="80623-0012.htm_para1"><a name="08062343000034">I shall not dwell for too long on amendments Nos. 11 to 14; the hon. Member for South Holland and The Deepings (Mr. Hayes) has already diligently read out the guidance notes on the Bill. However, I share his concern that we should make sure that proper data protection procedures are in place so that the data that belong to individuals are not in any way compromised and are held only by those with a direct interest in the individual and their ability to make repayments, and not by any prospective purchasers or any people associated with them.</p>

<p><a name="st_o242"><a name="08062343000035"><a name="80623-0012.htm_spnew0"><a name="08062343000123"><b>Bill Rammell:</b>
 This group of amendments deals with the process by which the Government may give undertakings concerning amendments to regulations, with how the Government will report on each sale and with how information about borrowers will be handled. Let me start by being explicit about the value-for-money framework. Throughout the proceedings on the Bill, we have made it clear that the sales would not take place unless we could demonstrate value for money. The Government have published forecasts of anticipated receipts of some &#163;6.3 billion from the proposed sales programme over the comprehensive spending review period. However, the key point is that the amounts are forecasts rather than commitments. The Government are committed to the student loans sale programme, but only if any sale represents good value for money. That should be a significant reassurance.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o188"><a name="80623-0012.htm_para2"><a name="08062343000036">I turn specifically to amendments Nos. 2, 3 and 15, which are about undertakings. They respond to expert advice that we have received from our sales arranger, Deutsche bank, which was engaged after Report and Third Reading in the House. For us to achieve good value for money on behalf of the taxpayer, potential purchasers must understand what is being sold. Financial institutions can model the economic and credit risks that we wish to transfer away from the Government, but not the political risk of Ministers using their powers to change the conditions of repayment&#151;and, consequently, predicted cash flows to the purchaser. If potential purchasers believed that the Government might alter an asset in an unpredictable way after selling it, that would seriously reduce what those purchasers would be prepared to pay.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o189"><a name="80623-0012.htm_para3"><a name="08062343000037">The Bill already provides the option of offering compensation if future policy changes compromise the value of the transferred asset. However, we have been advised that the Government might achieve better value for money if they could give undertakings about how regulations governing student loans may or may not change terms and conditions in future. The impact that a compensation mechanism may have on the size and timing of future cash flows may contain too much uncertainty for investors. Having the power to give undertakings also gives flexibility to cater for possible changes in the classification rules, which are currently being redrafted by EUROSTAT.</p>

<p><a name="st_o243"><a name="08062343000038"><a name="80623-0012.htm_spnew1"><a name="08062343000124"><b>Mr. Hayes:</b>
 The Minister has been clear about the reasons. If a Minister acted in the way that he describes, terms could be fixed on the part of the loan book that was being sold, but not on the part that was not being sold. That would mean that borrowers in the same circumstances, borrowing the same amount for the same reason, had very different arrangements. Is the Minister uncomfortable about that?</p>

<p><a name="st_o244"><a name="08062343000039"><a name="80623-0012.htm_spnew2"><a name="08062343000125"><b>Bill Rammell:</b>
 As I have made clear throughout the proceedings on the Bill, we expect the terms and conditions to be the same regardless of whether the student loan has been sold. The impact on the borrower should be exactly the same.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o190"><a name="80623-0012.htm_para4"><a name="08062343000040">I was referring to the EUROSTAT redrafting process. Changes in the rules, which occur from time to time, can have a material impact on the ability to offer compensation. It would be unwise to have only one means of addressing the issue that might, under rules updated after the current redrafting or a future alteration, prevent a true sale. That would negate part of the purpose of transferring the loans from the public to the private sector. I can give the response that the hon. Member for South Holland and The Deepings (Mr. Hayes) asked for in respect of the comments of my noble Friend Baroness Morgan. She made it clear in the other place that the amendment that gives powers to make undertakings aims to ensure that a sale can yield good value for money and that a true sale can release resources for use on Government priorities. It provides an option for the Government to use in realising both those aims.</p>

<p><a name="st_o245"><a name="08062343000041"><a name="80623-0012.htm_spnew3"><a name="08062343000126"><b>Mr. Hayes:</b>
 I think that the Minister may have misunderstood my first intervention; perhaps I did not make it clearly enough. If the terms were fixed for the tranche of the loan book that was being sold, which is precisely what the amendment gives the Government power to do, it is entirely possible that borrowers whose loans had been sold would have fixed term loan rates whereas borrowers whose loans had not been sold might be subject to the decisions of a subsequent Minister in this Government, or indeed in a different Government, regarding their loan rate. Is that something that we should sanction?</p>

 I think that I answered the hon. Gentleman&#146;s point. We have made it clear throughout that we expect borrowers&#151;graduates&#151;to be treated in exactly the same whether their debt has been sold to the private sector or remains with the Government. There should be&#151;and there will be, as far as this Government are concerned&#151;equality of treatment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o192"><a name="80623-0012.htm_para6"><a name="08062343000046">The right hon. Gentleman suggested that we were seeking to make the product more agreeable by allowing purchasers to take more money from students. It is important to put that point right&#151;the Bill is about ensuring that the product does not become more disagreeable. It gives investors the certainty that we will not sell them one product and then legislate to turn it into another product. It is categorically and explicitly not about allowing purchasers to take more money from borrowers, as we made clear with amendments Nos. 8 and 9, which we have already discussed. Amendments Nos. 2 and 3 enable the Secretary of State to give undertakings about the power to make or amend loan regulations under section 186 of the Education Act 2002.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o193"><a name="80623-0012.htm_para7"><a name="08062343000047">On the Opposition amendment to Lords amendment No. 2, it may help if I say a little more about how we expect the undertakings, which would be included in the contract for the sale of the loans, to work. The aim of any such undertakings would be to provide a degree of certainty to potential purchasers that the Government will not amend regulations after a transaction in a way that would affect the nature of the asset and decrease the value of the asset that had been sold or do so in a way that was not set out at the time of the sale. No one buys a product in the expectation that it will turn into something completely different. Purchasers will be concerned to guard against that, not to seek to improve their position. The undertakings that we envisage will not be about changing or promising to change loan terms to improve the lot of the purchaser but about giving certainty about the current position and the Government&#146;s intentions over time. The exact wording of such undertakings, if given, would have to be worked out as an integral part of the sale documentation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o194"><a name="80623-0012.htm_para8"><a name="08062343000048">Through those contractual undertakings, the Secretary of State can set out his intentions not to make particular amendments to loan regulations after a sale or to limit changes to the regulations in particular ways. For example, he might undertake not to propose an increase in the repayment threshold by more than a certain factor in a given year or to change the regulations only to do something that purchasers could predict. Paragraph (a) is necessary&#151;this goes to the heart of the Opposition amendment&#151;to avoid any doubt that such undertakings can be made. The loan terms will continue to be governed by regulations, which are subject to scrutiny and approval in the House. On that basis, I urge the hon. Member for South Holland and The Deepings to withdraw his amendment.</p>

In this House and in another place, value for money has rightly  <br>

been at the centre of our discussions. Having listened carefully to the arguments, we propose to strengthen the commitment that I gave on Third Reading that the Government would report to Parliament after each transaction. Amendment No. 7 places a statutory obligation on the Secretary of State to report to Parliament within three months of each transaction. He must inform Parliament about the value-for-money assessment that his Department made that led to the transaction going ahead. The report should reflect any Treasury guidance on the required procedures used across the public sector for assessing value for money. The hon. Member for South Holland and The Deepings referred to the role of the National Audit Office and the Public Accounts Committee. The NAO and the PAC have already made clear their intention to report on these matters. The hon. Member for Bristol, West (Stephen Williams) got it right&#151;this is not a matter to be dictated by Government but a matter for the NAO and the PAC, which have made their position clear.</p>

As we have stressed throughout the passage of the Bill, protecting the position of borrowers is one of our key and fundamental objectives. I acknowledge the diligent efforts of Opposition Members to press us on how we will meet that aim. I believe that the safeguards in the Bill, not least those contained in amendments Nos. 8 and 9, mean that the sales transaction, including any undertakings that may be given, will have no detrimental effect on borrowers. We expect that the report to Parliament would confirm that. I hope that the hon. Member for South Holland and The Deepings will agree that the commitment that I have made on the record is the appropriate response to what he has sought and argued for. I hope that he is therefore reassured and urge him to withdraw the amendment.</p>

There must be no doubt about how HMRC information may be disclosed in relation to loan sales. Amendments Nos. 11 and 12 provide a simpler expression that disclosure may relate both to loans being offered for sale and those that have already been sold. Amendment No. 13 describes a class of disclosure of anonymised HMRC financial information, so that it may go to those who have a purpose connected with the loans being offered for sale or that have been sold. We believe that that is the most effective way to ensure that this kind of non-personal data can be given to those who need that information, because across a long-term programme of loan sales we could never create a complete list of the potential purchasers, investors and financial institutions that could provide advice about a transaction. On the much more restricted access to personal data, amendment No. 14 is  <br>

We have had a useful and constructive series of engagements on the Floor of the House, in the other place, in Committee, and, if I may put it this way, behind the scenes. We have exchanged letters between Ministers and shadow Ministers in a manner that was altogether more co-operative than the public might expect or anticipate.

The order before us, therefore, disapplies section 25 of the Terrorism Act 2006 for a period of one year beginning with 25 July 2008, thereby extending the maximum period of pre-charge detention for terrorist suspects of 28 days for a further year.</p>

Indeed, the provision for a specific extension beyond 28 days&#151;in grave and exceptional circumstances&#151;is predicated and built on the annual renewal of 28 days. The measure is important in itself, and in the context of the Bill. Pre-charge detention has been the subject of considerable debate over the past 12 months in this House and, in the broader sense, in the Select Committee on Home Affairs and the Joint Committee on Human Rights. I do not want to go over those debates here, but it is worth reminding ourselves why Parliament agreed to the exceptional 28-day limit.</p>

The safety of the public is, of course, paramount and it is the responsibility of the Government and security and law enforcement agencies to protect our citizens from the threats posed by terrorism.</p>

However, where we do identify those who are engaged in terrorism, we need to ensure that we have the right tools to investigate and prosecute those involved. In much police work, the investigation takes place after a crime has been committed. In such cases there will often be a victim, possible suspects, witnesses to the crime and forensic material from the crime scene. The police will investigate the crime and may arrest the suspect when they have already gathered a considerable amount  <br>

Critically, they may need to intervene at a very early stage in an investigation, before they have had the opportunity to gather any admissible evidence, and on the basis of limited intelligence about who and what is involved.

Indeed, both the police and the Director of Public Prosecutions have made it clear that the 28-day limit is necessary. From when the power came into force in July 2006, six people have been held for between 27 and 28 days, three of whom were charged.</p>

Let us be clear: the application for extension is a rigorous process. A Crown Prosecution Service lawyer makes the application for extensions beyond 14 days, and the senior investigating officer is present. Defence solicitors are provided in advance of each application with a written document setting out the grounds for the application. The applications are usually strenuously opposed and can last several hours. The officer may be questioned vigorously by the defence solicitor about all aspects of the case.</p>

I deprecate the comments of Liberty, which were utterly wrong, on the eve of the recent consideration of the Counter-Terrorism Bill on fact and fiction about the existing 28-day pre-charge detention limit. Liberty spoke rather cleverly, as it does, about the Government and the police&#151;and, I presume, the CPS and the DPP&#151;sexing up the evidence.

 To put the record straight, I cannot speak for anyone but myself, but I have never once questioned the need for 28 days. I proposed it and it was agreed in November 2005.

Fourteen days remains the only permanent, statutory maximum provision for pre-charge detention, and 28 days&#151;the subject of the renewal order&#151;is for exceptional circumstances.

Terrorism is a huge international challenge, but it is a particular challenge for democracies, which must strive to protect individual liberties while ensuring collective security. It is vital to strike the balance between protecting the rights of the detainee and ensuring that an investigation proceeds properly and effectively, thus enabling the police to deal with the complexity of modern terrorism investigations. The order seeks to do that, and it is right to make it the subject of an annual debate. I say with regret that, given the nature of the threat, the absolute need for section 25 of the 2006 Act to be disapplied remains. I hope that hon.

<notus-date day="23" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>23 Jun 2008 : Column 85</b><br>
debate held this time last year, when my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Beaconsfield, now the shadow Home Secretary, stood in my position and debated the issue with the Minister.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o231"><a name="80623-0013.htm_para16"><a name="08062343000095">The first question relates to concerns raised about the operation of what was then the recently introduced code H of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984, dealing with terrorist cases. It seems moderately clear that the rules designed to cover the detention of a person for what is usually 24 or 48 hours are not suitable when someone is in custody for a much longer period. Can the Minister share his thinking, or any evidence, on how frequently individuals have been transferred to prison from police cells during the period of detention, and on how the system has operated in bringing them back to police stations for further interviews?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o232"><a name="80623-0013.htm_para17"><a name="08062343000096">Other concerns were raised about how code H could in theory allow for a person to be questioned for hour after hour, over a period that could extend to 28 days. I am sure that that has not happened in practice. However, can the Minister give us his analysis of how the code is operating? There are, I am sure, breaks for rest. Could he shed any light on that, provided that doing so would not breach any operational or national security considerations?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o233"><a name="80623-0013.htm_para18"><a name="08062343000097">The reason that is important is not a wishy-washy, bleeding-heart liberal reason, as some outside this place might characterise my questions&#151;I am sure that the Minister would not characterise them like that&#151;but because of fears that any statement made in a period running up to 28 days could be challenged by defence counsel at any future trial, on the basis of a suggestion that coercion had been involved in the defendant&#146;s giving of evidence, because of excessive and prolonged questioning, which had perhaps taken place without the benefit of any requisite breaks. That concern is thrown up by what, last year, was the relatively new code H under the 1984 Act.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o234"><a name="80623-0013.htm_para19"><a name="08062343000098">My second and final question also relates to something that was raised in last year&#146;s debate, and is about how longer periods of detention without charge might allow for press speculation that made the prospect of a fair trial difficult or impossible. The Minister said that he hoped that the Crown Prosecution Service would put out a paper on that issue. Can he give us an update on that, and on what his thinking is on the subject?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o235"><a name="80623-0013.htm_para20"><a name="08062343000099">Both my questions concern the operation of the regime to which the order relates. To conclude, I hope that we can get away from the idea that those who propose the longest period of detention without charge are the toughest on terrorists. Her Majesty&#146;s Opposition believe that the House must be robust in doing our best to protect the security of the people in our country. However, that must always be balanced&#151;this is always a difficult judgment&#151;against our British values, parts of which rely on an adherence to civil liberties, as one of our principal weapons in defeating those who wish to harm us. It is in that spirit of friendly inquiry to the Minister that I close my remarks.</p>

Friend the Minister said, it amounted to a compromise. If we are considering extending that exception, we have to proceed with caution and consider the matter properly, bearing in mind that the power has not been used for at least a year since it was last renewed. It is Parliament&#146;s duty to scrutinise the Government&#146;s request, as put forward in the order.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o237"><a name="80623-0013.htm_para22"><a name="08062345000003">I for one would not try to second-guess the Government&#146;s assessment, although that is not primarily because of the reason advanced by the hon. Member for Bury St. Edmunds (Mr. Ruffley) about evidence to support the Government&#146;s case; rather, it is simply that we have practically no evidence at all, one way or the other, of how the 28-day rule has operated in practice, on the very few occasions on which it has been used.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o238"><a name="80623-0013.htm_para23"><a name="08062345000004">Of course, we have plenty of evidence about the general level of the terrorist threat, but that is a red herring in this debate, because the 28-day power comes into effect only once a plot has crystallised and those involved have been arrested, and once it has been shown that the 14-day period is inadequate for their questioning. What we need to consider is not the general level of the threat, but cases where people have been arrested, questioned and ultimately charged.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o239"><a name="80623-0013.htm_para24"><a name="08062345000005">To enable Parliament to review the issues properly and effectively, we need a detailed and meaningful analysis. I had hoped that the independent reviewer would be in a position to provide that. The Government said that it was the intention to provide the independent reviewer&#146;s report before the renewal debate. They are as good as their word, because it was published this morning, although that has not really given hon. Members enough time to scrutinise properly what the independent review has to say, never mind the time for a Select Committee such as mine or the Home Affairs Committee to read what he had to say. I hope that in future the Government will make the report available 28 days before the debate, as we have recommended, so that it can be properly considered. Indeed, it was a pity that the report was not available for the debates a couple of weeks ago, because the independent reviewer has brought forward useful information for both sides of the argument, as it were, on 42 days.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o240"><a name="80623-0013.htm_para25"><a name="08062345000006">We now have the independent reviewer&#146;s report, but he says nothing at all about the use of the 28-day procedure. In his 2006 report, he did not give any detail at all&#151;not even the number of cases&#151;about the 28-day cases in that period. In paragraph 103 of his report, he says:</p>
<a name="80623-0013.htm_brev4"><a name="08062345000044"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;I have not been asked by Ministers to provide a detailed analysis of this system. It would be difficult for me to do so in any meaningful way without becoming effectively embedded in some cases from arrest to verdict, to gain the full picture. This has not been part of the reviewer&#146;s tasks, but could be included if required by Parliament. I should welcome clarity as to whether this is required&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o241"><a name="80623-0013.htm_para26"><a name="08062345000007">I am sure that we would all welcome clarity on that issue.

<p><a name="stpa_o244"><a name="80623-0013.htm_para29"><a name="08062345000010">My right hon. Friend has attacked Liberty for saying that the charges should have been brought earlier. It may well be that those individuals could have been charged within 14 days on the threshold charge basis, but that the Crown Prosecution Service decided to hang on to see whether it could get sufficient evidence to bring a full code charge within 28 days. I am not saying that that is right or wrong as a factual analysis, or indeed whether it is desirable to hold people longer in order to bring a full code charge as opposed to a threshold charge. We simply do not know. In future debates on renewal&#151;assuming that we have such occasions&#151;we need to be able to discuss whether it is better to hold people longer to get a full code charge than to charge them on a threshold basis at the earliest opportunity. That is a debate that we ought to have in Parliament as part of the way in which these cases are dealt with. As Lord Carlile says, one of the problems with a threshold charge is that it could amount to an abuse, although in practice I do not think that that has been the case, as my Committee noted in its previous report on the 42-day issue.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o245"><a name="80623-0013.htm_para30"><a name="08062345000011">We need to know when and how often people are being questioned, although I accept that that is not conclusive in relation to the need to hold someone for a particular period. Most of an inquiry is taken up not by questioning but by other activities such as breaking down computers, analysing phone records and making inquiries overseas. The fact remains, however, that we need to know the answers to these questions. The hon. and learned Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Grieve) gave us some figures on that when we were looking at the post-charge questioning issue a couple of weeks ago. On that basis, people were not questioned for any great length of time in the 28-day period, if his figures were right. We need to know what was going on in that regard. We also need to know what charges were ultimately brought, the reasons those charges were chosen and, ultimately, whether the individuals were convicted. That is the kind of detailed, qualitative analysis that we need when we are having these renewal debates, to ensure that the 28-day power is being used properly and that any exceptional extensions are appropriate.</p>

For example, we could find out what interviewing took place and over what period, and whether the investigation was conducted with the urgency required of the system.

 My right hon. Friend says that it is also the DPP&#146;s assurance, and that might well be the case. However, that does not give the same guarantee as an independent assessment would give, which I think will be necessary in future to ensure public confidence that a case has been scrutinised as effectively and in as much depth as possible. My Committee would like to see an independent review, perhaps by the Metropolitan Police Authority, although the Government&#146;s previous response to that proposal was that it would not be appropriate because of prosecution decisions. Perhaps a review by the CPS inspectorate, working with the MPA&#151;most of these cases end up being prosecuted in London&#151;would be a good way of carrying out a combined analysis of what has been going on behind the scenes.</p>

We know nothing about the impact on the individuals who have been held for 28 days: the three who were released and who were innocent, and the three who were charged. We know nothing about the impact on their mental health, their families or their employment position. The Government told us in their last letter to us that they had obtained no independent medical evidence on the psychological effects on the individuals concerned or, more generally, on what could be expected on an objective view.</p>

It is also interesting to note that Lord Carlile, in paragraph 105 of his report, seems to agree. He says that</p>
<a name="80623-0014.htm_brev3"><a name="08062345000048"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;judges should be permitted to intervene more and make greater demands as the length of detention is extended.&#148;</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o253"><a name="80623-0014.htm_para7"><a name="08062345000049">More importantly, he goes on:</p>
<a name="80623-0014.htm_brev4"><a name="08062345000050"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;The government should consider empowering judges to scrutinise the reasons for detention, and the adequacy of the work done to bring the case to charge, from the 7th day after arrest.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o254"><a name="80623-0014.htm_para8"><a name="08062345000021">So we should be concerned not only with the procedure and the fact that the case has been conducted efficiently, which is what we have already. Lord Carlile is saying that we should also scrutinise the reasons for the detention in the first place, which I have advocated in the House on previous occasions. The last time we debated these issues, a number of amendments were tabled on that point.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o255"><a name="80623-0014.htm_para9"><a name="08062345000022">It is not true to say that these proceedings have not been challenged in the courts. They were challenged in the case of Naseel Hussein, but he was caught in a Catch-22 situation when the High Court said that it would not review the decision of a High Court judge to extend his detention. That could also have the effect of excluding a potential habeas corpus application as an abuse of process. Habeas corpus requires the person doing the detaining clearly, directly and with sufficient particularity to provide the facts relied on as constituting a valid and sufficient ground for the detention of the person concerned. It is pretty clear that the schedule 8 application does not do that, because the focus is not on the reasons for detention&#151;which is what habeas corpus requires&#151;but on the course of the investigation. That reinforces the point about schedule 8 not meeting the requirements of article 5 or habeas corpus.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o256"><a name="80623-0014.htm_para10"><a name="08062345000023">I think that we need to see amendments to the procedure to make sure that we comply. We need to see a statement of the basis of the arrest given to the detainee and the gist of the material forming the grounds of suspicion given to the suspect. We need special advocates for the closed part of the hearing and, importantly, we need entitlement for the judge to look at whether there are reasonable grounds for the belief that the suspect was involved in terrorism in the first place, and reasonable grounds to justify the arrest and the continued detention.</p>

 I am pleased to follow the hon. Member for Hendon (Mr. Dismore), who speaks on this issue with a good deal of sense after looking at it very carefully and thinking about it deeply. We on the Liberal Democrat Benches will not oppose this temporary annual disapplication. No one should underestimate the serious threats from terrorism and terrorists. We need to be resolute and forearmed in meeting them, but we must do so in a way that is seen to be proportionate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o258"><a name="80623-0014.htm_para12"><a name="08062345000026">Our judgment is that 28 days&#146; detention in present circumstances can be viewed as proportionate, given the evidence from Operation Overt, the investigation in 2006 into the Heathrow bomb plot. I accept that that is longer than any comparable common law country: Australia has 12 days&#151;the longest&#151;the United States two days and Canada one day as the traditional period before a writ of habeas corpus can be served. We will not oppose the need for 28 days temporarily in the UK, partly because it is widely accepted that we face a greater threat in this country than in many others&#151;due not least to our misguided participation in the illegal invasion of Iraq, which is this Government&#146;s sad and lasting legacy on this issue. That does not mean, however, that 28 days should be seen as permanent or that we will not oppose this in future.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o259"><a name="80623-0014.htm_para13"><a name="08062345000027">As the Minister said in the debate last year, other developments such as post-charge questioning need to be taken into account in deciding whether 28 days is proportionate and appropriate. Indeed, four developments have taken place since the 28-day period was placed on the statute book in November 2005. First, we now have proposals for post-charge questioning in the Counter-Terrorism Bill. Secondly, the Chilcot report has made recommendations for the admissibility of intercept evidence in court, which our counterparts in the United States and Australia find to be essential. We look forward to Ministers&#146; proposals, particularly in light of the comments of Sir Ken Macdonald, the Director of Public Prosecutions, to the Public Bill Committee on the Counter-Terrorism Bill. I quote what he said, as it is relevant to the temporary extension to 28 days:</p>
<a name="80623-0014.htm_brev5"><a name="08062345000051"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Certainly, in other jurisdictions, they regard that material&#148;&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o260"><a name="80623-0014.htm_para14"><a name="08062345000028">he was referring to intercept evidence&#151;</p>
<a name="80623-0014.htm_brev6"><a name="08062345000052"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;as absolutely indispensable. The Americans told me that they could not remember an organised crime prosecution in the United States that last proceeded without intercept material. The Australians told me that people who did not use this material were not &#145;serious&#146; about prosecuting organised crime&#148;.<i> &#151;&#151;[Official Report, Counter-Terrorism Public Bill Committee, </i>22 April 2008; c. 48, Q124.]</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o261"><a name="80623-0014.htm_para15"><a name="08062345000029">For organised crime, we could certainly read terrorism as well.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o262"><a name="80623-0014.htm_para16"><a name="08062345000030">The third development since we put this provision on to the statute book is that the Government have rightly put more resources into the Security Service and into counter-terrorist policing on a substantial scale. That increase inevitably reduces the need for an extension of the period of detention without charge, as greater complexity can be handled with greater resources.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o263"><a name="80623-0014.htm_para17"><a name="08062345000031">Fourthly, and perhaps most significantly, there has been a substantial development in the flexibility of the threshold test, as Sir Ken Macdonald has pointed out. The Crown Prosecution Service does not need to ensure that there is a 50 per cent. chance of a successful conviction. Moreover, it is relevant in assessing Sir Ken&#146;s margin of manoeuvre to look at the Crown Prosecution Service&#146;s success rate with terrorist charges, which has been running at no less than 92 per cent. since the beginning of last year. Clearly, a 92 per cent. success rate after the event can and must inform the CPS about the chances of conviction before the event. It strongly suggests that the CPS has been somewhat conservative in allowing charges to be brought and can therefore have more flexibility in future. Again, that provides a strong argument for reconsidering even 28 days, let alone extending it further.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o264"><a name="80623-0014.htm_para18"><a name="08062345000032">The Liberal Democrats will not oppose the extension, while recognising that the arguments in its favour are weakening as our other precautions strengthen, and we merely ask Ministers to accept that principle, as did the Minister precisely on this matter last year. Making progress on the four areas that I mentioned can make the need for lengthy periods of detention without charge unnecessary, and whether an extension beyond 14 days is necessary will warrant reconsideration before next year.</p>

 I apologise for arriving a little late and missing the Minister&#146;s contribution, but I was here to hear the hon. Member for Bury St. Edmunds (Mr. Ruffley) speaking for the Opposition. I will be brief. Clearly, the House will pass this order and it is clearly essential that we do so in the interests of this country&#146;s security, but I want to make a couple of points that I hope the Minister will take into account in his reply to this short debate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o265"><a name="80623-0014.htm_para19"><a name="08062345000034">The first is that we are discussing 28 days now because that was the compromise that Parliament agreed to the last time this matter came before the House. It was certainly the case before we discussed and passed 42 days a few days ago. That previous compromise was due to the hard work of my fellow member of the Home Affairs Committee, my hon. Friend the Member for Walsall, North (Mr. Winnick), who tabled the amendment that was to gain the House&#146;s agreement. At that stage, as we all know, this was an extension of existing law. In accepting and passing this order as we doubtless will today&#151;it seems to be agreed by all parties&#151;it is essential that we look to two particular aspects highlighted by the Chairman of the Joint Committee on Human Rights, my hon. Friend the Member for Hendon (Mr. Dismore). I hope that the Minister will respond to both those aspects in his reply.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o266"><a name="80623-0014.htm_para20"><a name="08062345000035">The first is the impact on individuals who have been held by the police for up to 28 days. We in the Home Affairs Committee took evidence from the two gentlemen who were referred to as the &#147;Forest Gate Two&#148; and it is important to try to get a feeling of what it was like for such people to be detained under legislation for a period of time. Their evidence was strong, compassionate and compelling. It is important that we see the impact of this legislation and this House&#146;s decisions on individuals  <br>

detained such as the &#147;Forest Gate Two&#148;, but I would like to go further and consider the impact on communities. I make that point in all our debates on counter-terrorism legislation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o267"><a name="80623-0014.htm_para21"><a name="08062345000036">I know that the Government are very proud of their record in providing &#163;12 million from the Department for Communities and Local Government for proper engagement with communities&#151;by and large, members of the Muslim communities and their organisations. It is important to view our legislation in the light of its impact on communities, as we need to carry communities with us if we are to continue to make the case&#151;as we have to, and as the head of MI5 made when he addressed the Society of Editors last November&#151;for dealing with a growing threat. As we make that case, we need to carry communities with us.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o268"><a name="80623-0014.htm_para22"><a name="08062345000037">The second point, which was made by my hon. Friend the Member for Hendon and which I support strongly, is the need for the Government to provide more information. Obviously, the Select Committee process allows Ministers to come to the Committee and answer questions on issues of fact. I see in the House the hon. Member for Colchester (Bob Russell), another member of the Home Affairs Committee. During that Select Committee process&#151;when we took evidence from, among others, Sir Ken Macdonald, Ministers and those affected by the legislation&#151;we elicited information from the police on the number of people being held for up to 28 days. That was the first time we were told that nobody was held on the dot for 28 days&#151;indeed, people were being released beforehand&#151;but there must be a better way of getting such information to the House. That is especially important in view of Government decisions taken during the debate on 42 days to provide additional information and to seek the views of the Chairmen of the Joint Committee on Human Rights and of the Home Affairs Committee, whoever they may be in future, on any decision to extend the detention period.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o269"><a name="80623-0014.htm_para23"><a name="08062345000038">Once we have accepted the principle of consulting the Chairs of the relevant Select Committees, there is nothing wrong in those circumstances with regularly providing information to the Chairpersons of those Committees, whoever they may be. Therefore, the need for us to table parliamentary questions and to have inquiries on the issue will, in a sense, not be as important, because we will regularly receive that information.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o270"><a name="80623-0014.htm_para24"><a name="08062345000039">I hope that the Minister, rather than wait for another year to go past, will regularly provide that information, some of which was mentioned by my hon. Friend the Member for Hendon. It will better inform members of the relevant Committees of the number of people being detained and the reasons for their detention. I say that in a friendly way to the Minister, because I believe that he and the Home Secretary, in this difficult, dangerous and sensitive area, persisted in ensuring that so many people were consulted on the last piece of legislation to go through the House. In the spirit that the Home Secretary and the Minister have addressed the issue over the last few days, weeks and months, I hope that he will be more forthcoming with the information that he provides.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman is absolutely right. We did indeed take evidence on that very subject when we went to Washington. As the hon. Member for Eastleigh (Chris Huhne) made clear, this was a recommendation of the Select Committee and we said to the Government, &#147;Here is an example of a tool that can be used to find out who these terrorists are so that if you prosecute, you can have a successful prosecution.&#148; That is why we put it forward. The Government have not quite accepted it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o271"><a name="80623-0014.htm_para25"><a name="08062345000042">When the Prime Minister last addressed the House on the issue, I suppose he accepted the principle, but he said that there were lots of practical difficulties, no doubt associated with the security services, which were reluctant to have intercept evidence used in prosecutions, but that is certainly what we were told by the Americans. I will not go down the route of whether they thought 28 days or 42 days was desirable, because that would open up another debate and I think the House has probably had enough of that over the last 10 days. On intercept evidence, the hon. Member for Colchester (Bob Russell) is right, as the hon. Member for Eastleigh pointed out. On post-charge questioning, that is exactly what the Home Affairs Committee suggested and exactly what the Government accepted.</p>

 I am surprised that the hon. Gentleman does not see any principle being involved. Does he not accept that in non-terrorist cases the longest period for which a person can be held&#151;the maximum&#151;is 96 hours, after which they must be released or charged? The increase for terror suspects, which in my view was necessary and justified up to 28 days, is one thing, but it baffles me when he says that going beyond 28 days, perhaps to any figure, makes no difference and that no principle is involved.</p>

I do not see the difference in principle in those extensions. That is the point I was making.

 On the hon. Gentleman&#146;s last point, I can do no better than to paraphrase the hon. Member for Surrey Heath (Michael Gove), who, on page 136 of his excellent little book &#147;Celsius 7/7&#148;, talks about the broad Islamist threat in precisely those terms: as and when the threat increases, it is right and proper that a democracy takes all the power it requires, within its value system, to meet that threat. Equally, as and when that threat abates, so should those extraordinary powers. As I said, without going down the pathway of the Counter-Terrorism Bill, all that we seek to do in going beyond 28 days is predicated rightly and properly on the annual renewal of 28 days&#146; detention. For terrorist cases, 14 days is the norm, 28 days is the exception, and beyond 28 days&#151;I shall not dwell on that debate&#151;is utterly the exception to the exception. Partly to answer the hon. Gentleman&#146;s point further, that is why we did not come back to the House with a proposal for a universal extension beyond 28 days, annually renewed  <br>

or otherwise&#151;we have sought to outline why there are grave and exceptional circumstances in which a period beyond 28 days is required.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o278"><a name="80623-0015.htm_para3"><a name="08062346000011">Broadly, I am grateful to the House for the nature of the debate. It should be a detailed debate. As I said, as and when greater collective awareness of the ins and outs of those detained beyond 14 days is possible, that will happen. I hope that that can happen by next year, not least because a goodly number of those suitably charged beyond 14 days are already in the courts, and some are about to go before them, so matters will be resolved one way or another. None of the 11 charged beyond 14 days has yet been convicted, and to return to the point of my hon. Friend the Member for Hendon (Mr. Dismore), they are allowed due process before we start crawling all over the statistics relating to how they got to that position in the first place. As and when all the information is available on those detained beyond 14 days before charge, it will be right and proper to dissect that information retrospectively.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o279"><a name="80623-0015.htm_para4"><a name="08062346000012">As I said in my opening statement, this is a serious and sensitive matter&#151;we do not depart leisurely, or in anything but a very serious spirit to respond to a threat, from the 14-day norm accepted by the House for terrorism offences. I accept the broad sweep of colleagues&#146; comments that, hopefully, post-charge questioning, intercept as evidence, resources, greater use of the threshold test, and greater use of acts preparatory and other elements put into legislation, will mean eventually that more people are charged as close to arrest as possible. But I am afraid that I do not share the faith of the hon. Member for Eastleigh (Chris Huhne) that any of those elements will eradicate the need to go beyond 14 days, given the nature of the current threat.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o280"><a name="80623-0015.htm_para5"><a name="08062346000013">As I said during last week&#146;s debate, collectively, things such as the broader prevention agenda and the broader battle for hearts and minds&#151;for want of a better phrase&#151;should obviate the need for using such extraordinary legislation, by ensuring, first, that more and more individuals are dissuaded from the path of violent extremism in the first place, and secondly, that they are charged much closer to arrest than is currently possible. However, I cannot guarantee that. It is the Government&#146;s responsibility to make the judgment on the balance between guaranteeing public safety and otherwise.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o281"><a name="80623-0015.htm_para6"><a name="08062346000014">In answer to some direct questions, at least nine of the 11&#151;if not all&#151;were transferred to prison at day 14 and then brought back for interview, principally at Paddington Green, as and when required. In passing, let me say that the detention of individuals beyond 14 days is about not just interviewing them, but as much, if not more, about the investigatory process in which the police need to be engaged to get the evidence in order to put questions to such individuals in the first place. Invariably, as in the code, such individuals are transferred to prison post-14 days and then returned for interview. Code H says clearly that there should be eight hours&#146; complete freedom from questioning on any given day. It is not the case that, other than during those eight hours, there is routine questioning on a regular basis. Often in terrorist cases, the investigation goes on and the individual will not say anything, and there is an iterative-type process. That goes back to the point about the times that individuals were apparently interviewed  <br>

after 14 days&#151;a point made with a degree of sophistry, I would say, by those to whom I referred earlier. Interestingly, there has been no case whatever of an accusation of oppressive questioning by any of the individuals kept post-14 days.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o282"><a name="80623-0015.htm_para7"><a name="08062346000015">On the other point made by the hon. Member for Bury St. Edmunds (Mr. Ruffley), a Crown Prosecution Service paper&#151;I think that it was already published&#151;has set out in detail the extension process, and is still available on the website. We have not done a special paper on the impact of questioning on the right to a fair trial and those other elements of which he spoke, but that might be worth considering.</p>

My right hon. Friend the Member for Leicester, East (Keith Vaz) made an entirely fair point in that regard. Although there are plenty of assertions about the impact post-14 days of the legislation that we are renewing today, there is no significant evidence. But as I said at a conference on stop-and-search powers last Saturday, although we are considering section 44 and the code of practice associated with it, such stop-and-search powers will have more impact on communities than the legislation under consideration. We have published information on numbers held and charged, and will try to prepare more.</p>

Just because one says something often enough, a bit like Dorothy in &#147;The Wizard of Oz&#148;, it does not mean that it comes true. Sue Hemming was very clear that in some cases the process had ex parte elements, but they were very limited. Although the law did not require anything further than the gist of the case, in many instances, certainly beyond 14 days, she was very clear that substantially more than that was provided.</p>

The one thing that I will not forgive the hon. Member for Eastleigh for&#151;it is either sloppy thinking, or if he believes it, he is profoundly wrong&#151;is the notion that we only face a threat, regardless of individuals&#146; position, because of actions taken by this country in relation to Iraq. That is profound twaddle and nonsense of the finest order.</p>

Most of its members are based at Camp Ashraaf, which is in Iraq, and under Saddam&#146;s regime it operated as a de facto wing of the Iraqi military. Although it currently describes itself as a non-violent democratic movement, there can be no doubt that the PMOI was responsible for vile acts of terrorism over a long period, stretching back some two decades prior to 2001. Those were not acts attributed to the PMOI by the Iranian authorities; it expressly admitted responsibility for a number of horrendous crimes carried out against the Iranian people, aimed at both civilian and military targets. The PMOI is not widely supported in Iran, because of those attacks, and because it fought alongside Iraqi forces against Iran in the war between the two countries.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o291"><a name="80623-0015.htm_para16"><a name="08062346000029">The PMOI says that it decided to renounce violence at an internal meeting in 2001, and that it now seeks instead to pursue its objectives by peaceful means. Indeed, it has not conducted any attacks since then, although it has not made any public statement renouncing violence. Until 2003 it maintained an extensive arsenal at Camp Ashraaf, at which point it found itself surrounded by United States forces and surrendered its arms.</p>

Secretary for that organisation to be de-proscribed. The group followed that procedure correctly, and wrote to the Home Secretary requesting that the PMOI be de-proscribed. It argued that it was no longer concerned in terrorism, having renounced violence and disarmed, and that its desire to express its legitimate support for the PMOI and its objectives was being unlawfully curtailed by its continuing proscription.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o296"><a name="80623-0015.htm_para21"><a name="08062346000045">This decision was not taken lightly. The Government share the desire of those 35 Members of both Houses to see the advance of democracy and the promotion of human rights around the world. Given the wide-ranging impact of proscription, we are committed to ensuring that proscription decisions are lawful and proportionate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o297"><a name="80623-0015.htm_para22"><a name="08062346000046">The Terrorism Act 2000 sets out the definition of terrorism and the criteria for considering whether an organisation is concerned in terrorism. The Act does not refer to the motivation or political agenda of those who perpetrate acts of terrorism and, as the Proscribed Organisations Appeal Commission accepted, the Secretary of State is entitled to conclude that there is no right to resort to terrorism, whatever the motivation. We do not condone terrorism anywhere, whatever its justification or its target. These decisions must be evidentially based, however; we must not use this part of the Act to proscribe those whom we do not like. There have been many debates, and many foolish comments have been made from the Opposition Front Bench&#151;although not by the hon. Member for Bury St. Edmunds (Mr. Ruffley), I freely admit&#151;about a particular organisation, and the idea that its remaining unproscribed somehow shows a lack of willingness to engage with, and be tough on, terrorism. Clear criteria and processes are laid down, and the Home Secretary&#146;s refusal to de-proscribe was appealed to POAC, which upheld the appeal and found that the PMOI was no longer an organisation concerned in terrorism. POAC directed that the Government lay an order before the House de-proscribing the PMOI, which brings us to where we are now.</p>

 The Minister has said that the Government had concerns about the PMOI when the former Home Secretary proscribed it and then resisted the application for de-proscription; indeed, the Government resisted that case through the judicial process. Is my right hon. Friend now satisfied that the PMOI is not engaged in terrorism, and that it has not been since 2001, and that there is no prospect of its returning to terrorism? In other words, does he fully and completely accept the findings of the judicial process?</p>

It also stated that the Government were entitled to place little credibility on public statements made by the PMOI as its public statements contained&#151;heaven forfend&#151;&#147;spin&#148;, and the evidence submitted in the course of the hearing was &#147;contradictory and potentially misleading&#148; and demonstrated &#147;a shifting approach&#148;.</p>

 Let me reiterate that simply because POAC arrived at its decision&#151;we accept it in full, which is why the order is before us&#151;does not mean we accept that POAC is right and our original position is wrong; we profoundly do not. Our job is simply to review constantly who is on, and who should be on, the proscribed list. There is nothing in this judgment that leads us to think that we should review all the other organisations on the proscribed list.</p>

 Under part 2 of the Terrorism Act 2000, the Secretary of State has the power to proscribe any organisation that commits or participates in acts of terrorism, prepares for terrorism, promotes or encourages terrorism, or is otherwise concerned in terrorism. Proscription is a tough power. Any organisation that is on the list of proscribed organisations is outlawed in the United Kingdom. It is a criminal offence for a person to belong to, or encourage support for, a proscribed organisation. It is a criminal offence to arrange a meeting in support of a proscribed organisation, or to wear clothing or to carry articles in public which arouse reasonable suspicion that a person is a member or supporter of a proscribed organisation. Proscription also means the financial assets of the organisation become terrorist property and, as such, can be subject to freezing and seizure.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o300"><a name="80623-0016.htm_para2"><a name="08062351000002">For those reasons, Parliament must take its role in scrutinising who is on the proscribed list very seriously. On the one hand, the failure to proscribe an organisation that is concerned with terrorism could allow it to have a foothold in the United Kingdom and also to recruit and raise funds in the UK, ultimately undermining national security in this country and beyond our borders. On the other hand, proscribing an organisation mistakenly or inappropriately could tie up a significant amount of resources&#151;involving our intelligence services and others&#151;which is what a proscription order requires. The resources available to our security services are finite and must be targeted properly.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o301"><a name="80623-0016.htm_para3"><a name="08062351000003">As the Minister has elegantly made clear, the order seeks to remove the PMOI&#151;or the MEK, to use a name that is employed interchangeably, which is how I will be employing it in the debate&#151;from the proscribed list. That will, in effect, legalise it as an organisation, allowing it to recruit members and to raise funds in the United Kingdom. The decision in the Secretary of State for the Home Department <i> v.</i> Lord Alton and others left the Government with no choice but to bring forward this order de-proscribing the PMOI. The Minister set out their position and answered clearly that while he will abide by POAC&#146;s decision, he and ministerial colleagues do not necessarily agree with the merits of the decision. There remain a number of questions to which Opposition Members would like answers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o302"><a name="80623-0016.htm_para4"><a name="08062351000004">I shall not rehearse the history of the PMOI; that has been done in detail elsewhere. However, before framing my questions I would like to summarise the history of its proscription in this country. On 28 February 2001, the then Home Secretary laid before Parliament the Terrorism Act 2000 (Proscribed Organisations) (Amendment) Order 2001, which sought to add the PMOI to the proscribed organisations list. That order was approved by affirmative resolution and the organisation has remained on that list until the time of the order before us. A Home Office press notice issued at the same time described the PMOI as an organisation that</p>
<a name="80623-0016.htm_brev0"><a name="08062351000068"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;undertakes cross-border attacks into Iran, including terrorist attacks. It has assassinated senior Iranian officials and launched mortar attacks against government buildings in Tehran and elsewhere.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o303"><a name="80623-0016.htm_para5"><a name="08062351000005">On 5 June 2001, the PMOI applied to the Secretary of State to be removed from the list.

 I want to pause at this important point in the hon. Gentleman&#146;s speech. The representatives of the Iranian Opposition in exile repeatedly pleaded with the British Government, saying, &#147;What on earth do you want us to do to demonstrate our good faith&#151;that we have abandoned the military struggle?&#148; The British Government did not want to respond; they did not want to tell them how they could prove that. One of the charges against the Government&#146;s stewardship of this matter is that they were determined, for political reasons, not to de-proscribe. They were not prepared to allow this organisation to demonstrate to them&#151;not having to go through the courts&#151;that it had demilitarised.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman also used the word &#147;charges&#148; and in fact made a very specific allegation. I do not myself have a view on that, but in this debate it is certainly worth airing the point that the opportunity for this organisation to prove its renunciation of terrorist tactics was not afforded to it by the Government. I genuinely do not know the answer to that, but I am sure that the Minister will want to respond to a quite serious allegation that, for my part, I have no views on.

 The hon. Gentleman is being most generous in giving way. He rightly refers to the history of the PMOI and the allegation that it used to attack Iran. However, he should also bear it in mind that the people who support the Iranian Opposition who live in Ashraf city, in Iraq, are under daily attack by the Iranians. It is not just British troops who are under daily attack by the Iranians; the Iranian Opposition are also under daily attack by that dreadful regime. So there is the need for some balance in these arguments.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman, from his point of view, has probably supplied that balance through his remarks.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o308"><a name="80623-0016.htm_para10"><a name="08062351000016">The history of proscription gives a strong impression that the Executive of this country have serious and grievous concerns about whether this organisation has in fact renounced terrorist tactics. I make no criticism at all of Ministers in reciting the history; I merely record the fact that the advice they must be receiving from the security services and elsewhere clearly gives them pause when it comes to de-proscription. As I said earlier and as the Minister made clear, this order has been forced upon the Government&#151;rightly or wrongly&#151;because of a decision of POAC and of the Court of Appeal subsequently.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o309"><a name="80623-0016.htm_para11"><a name="08062351000017">I would like to take the argument forward a little by raising some specific questions that arise, given that background. The point of raising the background is to say that over the years, Ministers have, from the tenure of the now Secretary of State for Justice as Home Secretary onwards, tried to act in good faith on what is obviously a sensitive issue. However, the Minister for Security, Counter-Terrorism, Crime and Policing would probably like the opportunity to respond to those questions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o310"><a name="80623-0016.htm_para12"><a name="08062351000018">I am not entirely clear about what the Minister can share with us on the Government&#146;s assessment of the PMOI&#146;s terrorist capability, but it raises a question for me, given that the order will, in all likelihood, be passed tonight. The Minister will wish to know that the Conservatives will not vote against it, and we wait to see exactly how this business is finalised. Mr. Deputy Speaker will not want me to pre-empt things, but the Conservatives will not oppose the order. Nevertheless, a question remains about what understanding the Minister has about the possible reactivation of any involvement in terrorism and of the armed wing of this organisation subsequent to any de-proscribing that will be effected by the order&#146;s being passed.</p>

 I will give way in a moment, but I just want to pin this question down. A report in <i> The Times</i> today indicates that the Prime Minister has taken a view on the issue of de-proscription. I am not clear about this, and I am sure that hon. Members will not be clear about it when they read the report. It states:</p>

 I shall give way in a moment. I would be most grateful to hear an answer on that point, as I know colleagues would, given the numbers seeking to intervene on me. Although the House might be de-proscribing in this order, it raises the question of how other allied bodies, if indeed that is what they are, might be treated by Her Majesty&#146;s Government, because that seems to be a moderately authoritative report that they are seeking to ban this organisation&#146;s armed wing.</p>

 I shall indicate clearly that this is required of the Government. Should we be in their position&#151;we might be in it sooner than the Minister and Labour Members think&#151;we would have in front of us, as he and the Home Secretary have in front of them, a POAC decision. They sought to challenge it in the Court of Appeal, but they did not get leave to fight another day and were thus obliged, by law, to introduce this order. We would be in no different position from the Minister. That is about as clear an answer as I can give the House, and it is a factually accurate, legally watertight answer. <i> [Interruption.]</i> I do not know why the Minister is laughing; I hope it is a laugh of solidarity, because we are supporting him on the basis of the reasons that he has given.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o312"><a name="80623-0016.htm_para14"><a name="08062351000029">The question of the merits, which is probably behind the hon. Gentleman&#146;s question&#151;he is tempting me to opine on the substantive merits of the order&#151;is not something that I shall address tonight, because I do not have to do so. I have to ask some of the questions that those on both sides of the argument want answered, chief of which is the one that I have just asked in relation to the report in <i> The Times</i> about what action may or may not be taken against the armed wing, should it exist, that is the subject of the order.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o313"><a name="80623-0016.htm_para15"><a name="08062351000030">The second question I have for the Minister relates to the posture of the US Government. The PMOI has been designated a foreign terrorist organisation since 1987 in the US, and I wonder whether the Minister can confirm what, if any, discussions he or his colleagues in the British Government have had with the US authorities about the decision to de-proscribe the PMOI. It is important to know whether the US has expressed any concerns about the implication of the UK de-proscription on its efforts to fight and contain terrorist organisations. I am sure that this order would have a knock-on effect.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o314"><a name="80623-0016.htm_para16"><a name="08062351000031">A companion question relates to the position of the European Union, which listed the PMOI as a terrorist group and froze its assets. In December 2006, the European Court of First Instance ruled that the EU had not sufficiently justified its decision on the freezing of funds, although it did not&#151;importantly&#151;rule on the substantive issue of whether the PMOI was a terrorist organisation. The ruling was fundamentally a procedural argument about the basis on which funds had been frozen. I wonder again what the implications of this order will be for the EU-wide proscription of PMOI.</p>

It is worth reminding the House that among those people were Lord Waddington, a former Conservative Home Secretary; Lord Russell-Johnston, from the Liberal party; a former national agent of the Labour party, who is now in the House of Lords; Lord Archer, who was Attorney-General in James Callaghan&#146;s Government; a former Scottish Law Officer; a Conservative Lord; and the former leader of the Labour peers, Lord Corbett. Those people banded together, feeling that there was a need to persuade the Government to lift the proscription on their own initiative and, if they did not do so, to pursue it through the courts.</p>

 I totally agree.

 The hon. Gentleman was talking about the evidence needed for the Home Secretary to come to a view. Does he recall a previous debate on proscription orders in which I said explicitly that it would be wrong to rely on evidence from a foreign power, and that to reach a proper decision the relevant Minister needed evidence from primary sources to make a proscription order? I received a categorical assurance from Ministers that that was the case.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman makes a valid point. This continued proscription has been at the bidding and request&#151;the demand&#151;of the Tehran regime, without any evidence having been produced to justify it. That is not my view, but that of POAC, of the High Court and of the Court of Appeal. After all, the POAC decision states that</p>
<a name="80623-0017.htm_brev0"><a name="08062351000077"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;the only belief that a reasonable decision maker could have honestly entertained, whether as at September 2006 or thereafter, is that the PMOI no longer satisfies any of the criteria necessary for the maintenance of their proscription.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o321"><a name="80623-0017.htm_para1"><a name="08062351000043">That is the position. I have already drawn the House&#146;s attention to the fact that during both the POAC hearing and the Court of Appeal deliberations, there were days of closed session when special advocates were appointed to consider the secret evidence produced by the British Government. The Lord Chief Justice spent that time considering the documents and listening to the case from the Government&#146;s special counsel and concluded that that had only served to reinforce his view that the Secretary of State had acted in a &#147;perverse&#148; manner. I asked a lawyer what that signified. He said, &#147;Saying that people are &#145;perverse&#146; is the nearest the Lord Chief Justice comes to being rude.&#148; Such was the uniqueness of the occasion.</p>

I will be signalling to Tehran tonight that the British House of Commons unanimously passed an order lifting the PMOI from proscription. There will not be a Division; it will be a unanimous decision in the House of Commons. I welcome that, but it needs to be reiterated.

 I am grateful to my hon. Friend for citing what I said, but I do not want him to misrepresent my position, even inadvertently. I said that the Iranian regime is obsessed. However, my assessment is that the PMOI has almost no internal support in Iran. It may be active in this country, Sweden and other parts of the world, but there is a widespread, diverse and complex democratic opposition in Iran and it is a caricature of the politics to say that only one organisation leads them. Unfortunately, this debate could lead to the impression that there is only a choice between the regime in Iran and the PMOI. That is not the reality.</p>

There was considerable anxiety following the report in <i> The Times</i> that the Prime Minister had &#147;instructed&#148;&#151;I think that that was the word&#151;the Home Secretary to re-proscribe another grouping or what is described as its military wing.

Friend the Member for Stroud (Mr. Drew) said, &#147;The military wing of the military wing.&#148; I want a reassurance that we are not going to have a cat-and-mouse act in this respect. In any event&#151;I say this with the greatest respect&#151;the Prime Minister will certainly need to read the decision of the Court of Appeal if he is ever tempted to go down this road. The POAC and the Court of Appeal both said that there are certain tests that the Home Secretary is under a duty to apply. It is now demonstrably clear that political considerations&#151;the appeasement to which I referred&#151;cannot come into that. They are legal tests, not political tests. It would be a big mistake if the Government were tempted to do what has been suggested, and I hope that the Minister can reassure us that the report in <i> The Times</i> is unfounded.</p>

Member for Bury St. Edmunds also said that, under European Union rules, the fact that the United Kingdom had proscribed the organisation meant, ipso facto, that the whole EU had done so. The corollary of this evening&#146;s unanimous vote will surely be that the British Government will communicate to the EU that the House of Commons and the other place have unanimously decided that the proscription should be lifted, and will invite the EU to reassess its position. That would be the sensible and fair outcome of the debate.</p>

They are under repeated attack and in serious danger. To use a simple phrase, they are taking these blows on the chin. They are turning the other cheek. We know that the source of these attacks is in Iran. It is bewildering to many Members that the Secretary of State for Defence has indicated, with great candour, that some of the ordinance used against British armed forces and coalition forces has its roots in Iran, implicitly with the full knowledge and consent of the Iranian regime. The PMOI and related organisations have been a significant source of information and intelligence to the United States and, ipso facto, to the United Kingdom Government and the coalition forces about the nature of the nuclear threat being developed by the Tehran regime.</p>

I want to state for the record that the United States, which has stewardship of that area of Iraq, has done an enormous amount to protect the people of Ashraf, to the extent that it has allowed them to have bank accounts and so on. That is not something we normally facilitate for terrorist organisations. Why has that been allowed? It is because the United States is satisfied about the stand-down of the people in Ashraf&#151;its demilitarisation&#151;and the fact that they are open and  <br>

 I am pleased to follow the hon. Member for Thurrock (Andrew Mackinlay), who stated, with a good deal of passion, what many hon. Members feel about the way in which the Government have proceeded.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o332"><a name="80623-0017.htm_para12"><a name="08062351000059">I will not go over the full history of the way in which the People&#146;s Mujahedeen Organisation of Iran got on to the list of proscribed organisations. Its inclusion was controversial even at the time and its public announcements that it had disarmed and renounced violence were especially clear. It is surprising that the Government maintained their proscription in the face of mounting judicial reviews of the decision, beginning on 12 December 2006, with the European Court of First Instance and continuing with the POAC High Court decision on 30 November 2007. The hon. Member for Thurrock described fairly the Lord Chief Justice&#146;s reaction to the evidence that the Government brought to bear in secret session. Despite all that, the Government persisted in attempting to defend the proscription.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o333"><a name="80623-0017.htm_para13"><a name="08062351000060">That persistence suggests that other forces must have been at work in the decision. Perhaps the hon. Member for Bury St. Edmunds (Mr. Ruffley) is the only Conservative Member to give the Government the benefit of the doubt&#151;a minority position these days. It was even suggested that the Home Office was possibly right&#151;obviously, that is one theory&#151;and that all the judges who examined the matter in the European Court and in the High Court had been bamboozled by the evidence that they saw in public and in secret session.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o334"><a name="80623-0017.htm_para14"><a name="08062351000061">I would perhaps give more weight to the second theory: when Ministers look at a document that is stamped, &#147;top secret&#148;, &#147;highly confidential&#148; and &#147;for your eyes only&#148;, they tend to give it greater weight than the public information that stares them in the face. That has happened in judgments about the middle east, not least those about the illegal invasion of Iraq. We could go back further. Only weeks before the Shah was toppled in Iran, I remember that a Foreign Secretary predicted firmly, on the basis of little evidence, that the Shah would be there for ever and a day. Clearly, that was an exceptional misreading of what was happening. Perhaps we are considering a case of secret information being given far too much weight. However, such information did not persuade the Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales. Given that he is used to sifting evidence, whatever the source, we should give that opinion enormous weight.</p>

It is that, in what is meant to be a quasi-judicial matter laid down by statute, the Government have put foreign policy considerations before an assessment of the evidence. The Liberal Democrats suspect that that happened when the Serious Fraud Office&#146;s investigation into al-Yamamah was dropped, following public and doubtless private pressure from the Saudi Arabian Government. I would like the Minister&#146;s reassurance&#151;if someone could communicate with him, given that he is showing his usual courtesy of not being bothered to listen to speeches&#151;that there was no influence from the Foreign and Commonwealth Office on the ground of Britain&#146;s foreign policy.

 If the Foreign and Commonwealth Office has clear evidence that the PMOI is a terrorist organisation, it should give that evidence. That would be perfectly within its remit. However, I am suggesting that wider foreign policy considerations should not be taken into account in this case, because we are talking about a matter of British domestic law and a fundamental freedom, which we have respected in this country for many years, according to which, if I may paraphrase Voltaire, even if we disagree with what people say, we will nevertheless defend their right to say it. I hope that the hon. Gentleman agrees with me that the House has defended that principle over many years and should continue to do so.</p>

Speaking for the Liberal Democrats, I for one would like an assurance from the Minister on that score. That said, we are happy to support the removal of the PMOI from the list of proscribed organisations. The only question is why it has taken so long, when the evidence has been so great and when the judicial review has been so extensive. At the very least, the Government appear to have been extraordinarily dilatory.</p>

Iran&#146;s quasi-democratic political system is not fully closed and may lead to reform that will result in a more constructive approach on the nuclear issue. We recommend that the Government should be careful to avoid action that could be manipulated by the hardliners such as President Ahmadinejad to bolster their position against the more pragmatic and reformist elements ahead of his campaign for re-election in 2009.&#148;</p>

Friend the Member for Thurrock (Andrew Mackinlay) said, in a kind of limbo in Camp Ashraf. The question that has not been answered in this debate so far is: why are they there? Those people are on that site because, for many years, they were living in Iraq and being protected by Saddam&#146;s regime. I have been told many times, over many years, by many people in the Kurdish political movement that those people were used by Saddam for his own purposes for the repression of the Kurds and other minorities in Iraq. If those people were to be released from Camp Ashraf today, they would face the threat of death if they were returned to Iran. If they were released into Iraqi society they would also face death threats from the many very angry Iraqis who remember them as allies of the brutal Saddam regime. As my hon. Friend the Member for Thurrock has pointed out, the United States and others have a responsibility to find a solution to that problem.</p>

doubt that it is against the mullahs&#146; regime, but let us go back to the history of what happened between 1978 and 1981. It was like the falling out between Stalin and Trotsky in the Russian revolution, involving different elements within a revolutionary process who ended up on the wrong side. There are many other Iranians, including people who came out of the monarchist tradition, the social democratic tradition, or the Islamist tradition, who have not been involved in violent activities. Those people would strongly dispute the claim that the PMOI is the sole legitimate opposition to the regime in Tehran. It would be dangerous if this House were perceived to have given support to one political opposition group and, by making this decision today, we will be doing a disservice to many other Iranian democrats, liberals and secular people, as well as to the moderate Islamists and monarchists who oppose the regime in Tehran.</p>

Member for Castle Point (Bob Spink) pointed out, people change over time. If that organisation is not engaged in terrorist activities today, and does not intend to do so, that is very good. However, we need to be careful that we do not give the impression that we are giving it carte blanche for ever. We need to be sure that any organisation based in this country is involved only in peaceful, democratic activities, and that it is not supporting terrorism in this country or in any other part of the world.</p>

 First, the Government have always argued that the Secretary of State was entitled to take a cautious approach when considering the PMOI&#146;s application for de-proscription. No one, not least POAC, argues that when the original proscription was made in 2001, it was not a terrorist organisation. Indeed, the POAC judgment says that there were reasonable grounds for the belief of the Secretary of State that the PMOI was &#147;concerned in terrorism&#148; at the date that it was originally proscribed, 29 March 2001.</p>

We will discuss with our European Union partners the implications of the United Kingdom de-proscription in the light of the EU list, as my hon. Friend the Member for Stroud suggested.

However, although we do not normally discuss whether groups are being considered for proscription, I can say in response to the <i> Times </i>article that there are currently no plans to proscribe the National Resistance Army of Iran.

Such applications give organisations the opportunity to provide evidence that they are not concerned in terrorism.</p>

 That was not my point. My point was that the PMOI and related organisations had knocked on the Government&#146;s door and said &#147;Dear British Government, what can we do to demonstrate that we have demilitarised? What would you like us to show you?&#148;, and that their request had received no response. That was my point, and it is a simple one. It is history now, because we are going to pass the motion unanimously, but my right hon. Friend should not try to rewrite history.</p>

 It is not the Government&#146;s job to tell a proscribed organisation what it needs to do to be de-proscribed. That is absolute nonsense.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o366"><a name="80623-0018.htm_para26"><a name="08062352000046">POAC concluded that there was no credible support for the assertion that an agreement had been reached with Iran pursuant to which the PMOI would remain proscribed, still less for the assertion that it would remain proscribed even if the statutory criterion for proscription was not fulfilled. My hon. Friend has thrown around wonderful words like &#147;appeasement&#148; and &#147;reckless&#148;. As ever, he has been very nice and very loud, but very wrong.</p>

Member for Southend, West that we shall not be meeting the PMOI, because we do not consider it to be a credible opposition group. We also have no plans to meet members of the National Council of Resistance of Iran. Nor&#151;if I may deal with another of my hon. Friend&#146;s points&#151;do we agree with the assertion that the PMOI/MEK or the NCRI constitutes the Iranian Government in exile. I repeat that the PMOI&#146;s terrorist acts resulted in the deaths of many Iranian citizens. It fought against Iran during the Iran-Iraq war, and we see no evidence of popular support for either organisation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o368"><a name="80623-0018.htm_para28"><a name="08062352000048">The judgment turns on our cautious approach. Given the history of the organisation since 2003, we simply do not believe that its intent is entirely passive and peaceful. POAC&#146;s judgment, to which it is entitled, is that the organisation&#146;s assertions that it is no longer involved in terrorism and taking up arms are genuine and that it should therefore be de-proscribed. In the light of that judgment, we presented the order as quickly as we could. I hope that it will be passed unanimously, as forecast by my hon. Friend the Member for Thurrock&#151;and I do not doubt that Members will rush out of the Chamber and start rewriting history as we speak.</p>

 I thank you, Mr. Speaker, for granting me permission to hold this debate this evening, and I welcome the Minister to his place to listen to the concerns of my constituents, and to respond in due course, on the very important subject of the north Northamptonshire core spatial strategy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o378"><a name="80623-0019.htm_para6"><a name="0806241000015">North Northamptonshire is the biggest single housing growth area outside London. That is the fate the Government have decided is appropriate for my part of the world. Because of their plans, north Northamptonshire, which comprises the districts of Corby, Wellingborough, Kettering and East Northamptonshire, is set to grow to a planned population of more than 370,000 by 2021. That means that it will by then be a community equivalent in population to Bristol today.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o379"><a name="80623-0019.htm_para7"><a name="0806241000016">In that plan, north Northamptonshire is supposed to witness the creation of some 52,100 new homes and 47,400 new jobs. It is a massive development on an unprecedented scale for Northamptonshire, and I have to say to the Minister that it is not a popular development in Northamptonshire. Were these proposals put to a test of popular opinion through a referendum they would be soundly rejected, because local people are rightly worried about the scale of the proposed development and the speed with which it is being rammed through. Local people are also worried that whereas at the start they were clearly promised by this Government infrastructure, jobs and then houses&#151;in that order&#151;what they are actually getting is lots more houses, precious few extra jobs, and infrastructure going backwards instead of forwards.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o380"><a name="80623-0019.htm_para8"><a name="0806241000017">The subject of tonight&#146;s debate is the core spatial strategy, which was officially adopted by the north Northamptonshire joint planning committee at its meeting on 12 June. To the credit of local authorities in the north of Northamptonshire, the joint planning committee is an innovative concept. Rather than having a Government-imposed development corporation making all the decisions about where houses should go and in what numbers, where jobs should be provided and so on, the local authorities in the north of the county got together at an early stage and decided to work on a different model whereby they would co-operate to try to create the best conditions for the new growth coming to the county. That is not to say that they were all in favour of the scale and pace of the development that the Government are imposing, but they felt that the best way to get the job done correctly was to keep the decisions local, so they decided to get together to form the joint planning committee.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o381"><a name="80623-0019.htm_para9"><a name="0806241000018">The core spatial strategy that they adopted at the meeting of 12 June aims to ensure that the plans for the more than 50,000 new homes go hand in hand with the investment in jobs, infrastructure, services and environmental improvements that we have all been promised, so that growth benefits the existing communities in north Northamptonshire, as well as the new residents who have yet to arrive. This is the first strategic plan to   <br>

be agreed in the whole of the east midlands, and the first in the UK to be prepared by a number of councils working together as a joint planning unit.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o382"><a name="80623-0019.htm_para10"><a name="0806241000019">Believe it or not, the plan is the culmination of three years&#146; work by the joint planning unit, involving extensive studies and consultation. It was subject to an independent examination last winter, when a Government-appointed inspector looked at it and at the representations made by both developers and other interested parties. The inspector&#146;s report was published on 15 May 2008 and, not surprisingly, endorsed the overall approach that the plan laid out.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o383"><a name="80623-0019.htm_para11"><a name="0806241000020">The independent inspector was appointed by the Secretary of State on 22 February 2007 to carry out this independent examination. A pre-examination meeting was held on 4 July, and the examination itself was conducted by way of written exchanges and a series of hearings held between 23 October 2007 and 13 February 2008. The inspector&#146;s report contained his recommendation</p>
<a name="80623-0019.htm_brev6"><a name="0806241000112"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;that the submitted Core Spatial Strategy...is sound, pending an early review to provide longer term certainty over infrastructure, housing and employment provision&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o384"><a name="80623-0019.htm_para12"><a name="0806241000021">The point I wish to make to the Minister this evening is that, despite the time that preparation of the core spatial strategy has taken, it is actually a highly flawed document that is causing widespread alarm among residents in north Northamptonshire. I urge the Minister and his Department to ensure that, even though it has been officially adopted by the north Northamptonshire joint planning unit, there is an early review to provide the much-needed certainty about infrastructure, jobs and housing that, sadly, the present document does not provide.</p>

<p><a name="st_o341"><a name="0806241000022"><a name="80623-0019.htm_spnew2"><a name="0806241000143"><b>Mr. Peter Bone (Wellingborough) (Con):</b>
 My hon. Friend is making a powerful case, as usual. The problem as I see it with the new strategy is that some of the fundamentals that local people wanted have been excluded. Wellingborough council wanted a right to strategic gaps between the villages and the urban areas, but that has been removed by the inspectorate. That seems a very strange way of dealing with local democracy.</p>

<p><a name="st_o342"><a name="0806241000023"><a name="80623-0019.htm_spnew3"><a name="0806241000144"><b>Mr. Hollobone:</b>
 My hon. Friend is a powerful champion for his constituency and, as always on this issue, he is spot on. Indeed, the policy of strategic gaps&#151;green areas between major developments in the county&#151;was described in the draft core spatial strategy as &#147;Policy 6&#148;; I am looking at the inspector&#146;s amended report, where that policy has lines all the way through it. That is of great alarm to residents in the north of the county, and it is an issue to which I wish to return later in my remarks.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o385"><a name="80623-0019.htm_para13"><a name="0806241000024">The scale of the development that the Government envisage for my part of the world is truly alarming, although the Minister might think that &#147;alarming&#148; is a strange word to use. I am not against economic development or housing development, but local residents are concerned at the scale and speed of the proposed development, which most of them would argue is simply not sustainable, despite the core spatial strategy&#146;s conclusions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o386"><a name="80623-0019.htm_para14"><a name="0806241000025">Let me illustrate the scale of some of the proposals. By 2021, there are supposed to be an extra 52,100 new houses in north Northamptonshire, of which 16,800 are to be in Corby, 13,100 in Kettering, 12,800 in Wellingborough and 9,400 in east Northamptonshire.  <br>

The quinquennial breakdown of that housing growth is also alarming to local people. They are noticing new houses going up all over north Northamptonshire at the moment, but they may not be aware that, according to the Government plan, the rate of housing completions is meant to increase sharply. Between 2001 and 2006, some 8,190 houses were to have been completed in north Northamptonshire, but in the current period&#151;2006 to 2011&#151;the figure rises to 12,655. For the period 2011 to 2016, the figure rises to 15,560, and there is to be a similar total for the period 2016 to 2021, 15,695. Local people simply are not prepared for that rate of growth in the number of housing completions, and those figures are of alarm to my constituents.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o387"><a name="80623-0019.htm_para15"><a name="0806241000026">I wish to highlight some of the most worrying aspects of the core spatial strategy report, which lead me to conclude that it is a fundamentally flawed document. It is a very big document&#151;fortunately, it is publicly available on the north Northants joint planning unit website&#151;running to more than 90 pages, and it really is a most riveting read. Some of its most important paragraphs are buried away in the detail of the text. I wish to refer not to the final report, as adopted, but, for ease of argument, to the inspector&#146;s amended report before the final document was approved. On page 28 of the report, which was published in May 2008, one finds in item 3.16 this particular gem:</p>
<a name="80623-0019.htm_brev7"><a name="0806241000113"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Due to known constraints on current highways it is essential to seek improvements to enable the anticipated growth. It may not be possible to upgrade the highway network to accommodate all of the proposed growth. It will therefore be necessary for there to be a substantial reduction in the proportion of trips made by private car. This Plan aims for a modal shift away from car use and road freight haulage, towards more sustainable alternatives. For residential development this Plan has a target of a 20 per cent. reduction in car journeys in new developments over 200 dwellings ...and a 5 per cent. reduction for existing areas.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o388"><a name="80623-0019.htm_para16"><a name="0806241000027">I expect that the Minister lives in a sort of rural community like mine.</p>

 Perhaps not; perhaps the Minister&#146;s area is more built up. May I tell him that in north Northamptonshire the idea that car use can be cut by 20 per cent. in new housing developments is simply fanciful? It may be that in an urban area people can be persuaded out of their cars on to public transport, if sufficient provision is made, but I am sceptical that a 20 per cent. reduction in car journeys can be made by people who move into those new developments. It is simply not possible for many people in north Northamptonshire to survive without the use of a motor vehicle. I suggest that that particular aspect of the core spatial strategy is fundamentally flawed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o391"><a name="80623-0019.htm_para19"><a name="0806241000032">That sounds fantastic, but in fact the rail services to and from Kettering and the north will be halved this December, and the additional capacity mentioned amounts to the spare seats on the train service from St. Pancras to Corby.</p>

<p><a name="st_o345"><a name="0806241000033"><a name="80623-0019.htm_spnew5"><a name="0806241000147"><b>Mr. Bone:</b>
 I have fresh up-to-date information on the rail capacity from Wellingborough. My wife travelled up today and had to sit on the floor as all the seats were full.</p>

 I am grateful to my hon. Friend for that observation and I am sorry that his wife had that unfortunate experience. As we know, that is a daily occurrence on services between Kettering and Wellingborough and London. It is an absolute disgrace that passengers from those places have to stand for an hour on a train all the way to London, when they are often paying as much as &#163;73 for a return journey. The additional capacity that has been promised to local people is a huge con trick. In fact, the fast inter-city services will disappear from Kettering, and the additional capacity, such as it is, will be on stopping services calling as far north as Corby, which is just next door.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o392"><a name="80623-0019.htm_para20"><a name="0806241000035">Policy 2 also mentions the road network. Highlighted as a priority is:</p>

That will be horrifying to local people, because the A43 links the county town of Northampton with Northamptonshire&#146;s second town, Kettering. It is the busiest, most congested and most dangerous road in the area. There were plans to dual this road, but they were axed by John Prescott in 1999, who then produced the basis for this housing development plan in the Milton Keynes and south midlands growth area plan.</p>

I have to tell the Minister that unless the eastern bypass is built there will be excessive traffic congestion throughout the town of Kettering and villages to the east will be simply gridlocked. The villages of Weekley and Warkton will be particularly affected by the development. Some 10,000 vehicles a day run through Warkton, and it sits on the busiest C road in the county of Northamptonshire. If those 5,500 houses are built to the east of Kettering, Warkton will have construction traffic going through it all the time and will be an extremely unpleasant place in which to live.</p>

That is extremely alarming, because in north Northamptonshire there are the three main towns of Corby, Kettering and Wellingborough, which sit more or less on top of each other in a straight line. It is very important to local people that those towns remain three distinct and separate communities. That was the purpose of the strategic gaps policy, which, before it was obliterated, stated:</p>

city being created between Corby and Northampton with Kettering and Wellingborough in between. My hon. Friend the Member for Wellingborough will be able to confirm that the phrase &#147;the linear city&#148; comes from an early Government consultee&#146;s report that tried to steer the development of the local area away from that nightmare scenario. Yet here we are, in 2008, and a policy designed specifically to prevent that scenario from happening is being obliterated line by line.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o408"><a name="80623-0020.htm_para2"><a name="0806241000051">And so the document goes on. There is an important section under item D called &#147;Delivering Infrastructure&#148;. Paragraph 3.41 on page 39 reveals that the policy in the draft said:</p>
<a name="80623-0020.htm_brev1"><a name="0806241000125"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;The proposed housing growth is only acceptable if it is accompanied by the necessary improvements to physical and social infrastructure.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o409"><a name="80623-0020.htm_para3"><a name="0806241000052">What is wrong with that? That provides the guarantees that local people want. However, that sentence has been crossed out and replaced with:</p>
<a name="80623-0020.htm_brev2"><a name="0806241000126"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;The proposed housing growth will need to be supported by improvements to the physical and social infrastructure.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o410"><a name="80623-0020.htm_para4"><a name="0806241000053">The wording has been very subtly but importantly watered down, and as a result it does not give local people the confidence that they need that growth will become sustainable in their local area.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o411"><a name="80623-0020.htm_para5"><a name="0806241000054">There should be infrastructure triggers in the document. There should be specific commitments that if the infrastructure is not provided up front or at the same time as the housing growth, extensions to the housing growth targets should be shelved. Those triggers are not in this document. There is further analysis of infrastructure in paragraphs 3.48, 3.49 and 3.50, which come under the title &#147;Phasing of Infrastructure&#148;. Paragraph 3.49 says:</p>
<a name="80623-0020.htm_brev3"><a name="0806241000127"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Key strategic infrastructure constraints identified in North Northamptonshire are the limited capacity of sewerage infrastructure and levels of congestion on the A14.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o412"><a name="80623-0020.htm_para6"><a name="0806241000055">It suggests a number of remedies for those problems. One is the expansion of the Broadholme sewage treatment works. To deal with the road issue, it is suggested that</p>
<a name="80623-0020.htm_brev4"><a name="0806241000128"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;a separate carriageway should be provided to take &#145;local&#146; traffic off the A14 between Junction 7 (A43 Northern Bypass) and Junction 9 (A509), together with widening the A14 to three lanes in the section from Junction 9 to 10&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o413"><a name="80623-0020.htm_para7"><a name="0806241000056">In a way, that is quite encouraging, because the spatial strategy is identifying the infrastructure that will be needed to cope with the housing growth. However, paragraph 3.50 goes on to say:</p>
<a name="80623-0020.htm_brev5"><a name="0806241000129"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Further technical work is needed to prepare and evaluate these projects and each will be subject to the usual statutory procedures including public consultation. The timescales involved in planning, funding and delivering these major infrastructure projects means that, dependent on the rate at which development proceeds, there may be a delay between the need for the improvement and when it can be put in place. For example an expansion of Broadholme treatment works is unlikely to be achieved before 2013 and the first stage of the A14 improvement may not be complete until 2017.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o414"><a name="80623-0020.htm_para8"><a name="0806241000057">That is alarming in two respects. One is that, as my hon. Friend the Member for Wellingborough, whose constituency includes the Broadholme sewage treatment works, knows, those works will reach capacity in 2010. There will therefore be a three-year gap, and that could get very smelly for the Wellingborough constituency. Furthermore, the document says that</p>
<a name="80623-0020.htm_brev6"><a name="0806241000130"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;the A14 improvement may not be complete until 2017.&#148;</p>

That is not what has happened at all. We have not had infrastructure, jobs and then houses, but houses, not many more jobs, and then infrastructure going backwards.</p>

The A43 Kettering to Northampton road, which is the busiest, most congested and most dangerous road in the county, was to be dualled, but that has been taken out of the programme. Strategic green gaps between the major towns and villages in the north of the county were protected by the initial policy, but they have been scrubbed out by the inspector. The limited promises on the phasing and delivery of infrastructure, enshrined in the draft report, have also been axed.</p>

I was at the meeting because of flooding, which my hon. Friend touched on. During three of the last five years, there has been significant flooding, with sewage floating in people&#146;s homes. When I asked local people the reason for that, they told me that it was the result of development of housing in the area without any improvement in infrastructure. It is hard to come to any other conclusion. My constituents fear that with the huge increase in housing that Wellingborough is already committed to, but with no improvement in the sewerage and drainage systems&#151;there are no planned improvements&#151;that issue will become a widespread concern. The problem with infrastructure can only get worse with the north Northamptonshire development.</p>

In my constituency, under a Labour Government and a Labour county council, one of the secondary schools has been knocked down. All the other secondary schools are overcrowded, but we are going to bring in all these new houses with nowhere for the children to go to school. People do not move in without children, but that point does not seem to have been addressed anywhere in the Government&#146;s thinking. They just believe in building new houses. I understand their thinking&#151;they are not evil people. They are thinking that people need homes, but they fail to recognise the need to provide the matching infrastructure.</p>

Sometime in the past, the plans suggested that there should be a new hospital, but that proposal has been lost&#151;it simply will not happen.</p>

Last Thursday, a by-election took place in Wollaston, which is a small village with many open fields between it and Wellingborough. It was announced that there was a danger of building on the fields. On a 33 per cent. turnout, the Conservative candidate got 816 votes and the Labour candidate got 97, and the strategic gaps were the main issue in the election.

he studied his 90-page document in great detail; he read out some snippets to us. I shall try to respond to as many of his points as possible.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o434"><a name="80623-0020.htm_para28"><a name="0806241000080">As the hon. Gentleman said, the north Northamptonshire core spatial strategy was adopted in June this year. It represents a significant milestone in the realisation of the Milton Keynes and south midlands growth area&#151;the wider growth area that he mentioned. It is the first core strategy of its kind to be produced by a joint planning unit and the first to be adopted in the east midlands. Many of the points that both hon. Gentlemen made about their constituencies were addressed not only to me as Under-Secretary, but to the joint planning unit and, I dare say, the local development company, as they do their work locally. It is important to remember that the joint planning unit comprises planning officials from an array of district and county authorities, as they try to piece together all the work on regeneration, infrastructure and, indeed, housing.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o435"><a name="80623-0020.htm_para29"><a name="0806241000081">I hope that both hon. Gentlemen acknowledge&#151;I believe that they do&#151;that housing is a key priority for the Government. In the past 35 years, under all Governments, we have not built nearly enough homes. Pressures and imbalances between supply and demand have resulted from increased longevity and changes in the way we live. We need to build more homes to tackle that imbalance. There are far more households of individuals rather than couples and families, and far more older people. I looked at the statistics as the hon. Member for Wellingborough was speaking and I saw that life expectancy remains above average in Northamptonshire. I am pleased that the indices for employment show that the claimant count is below average.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o436"><a name="80623-0020.htm_para30"><a name="0806241000082">Our housing Green Paper, &#147;Homes for the future: more affordable, more sustainable&#148; makes it clear that we must go further to tackle the housing needs and aspirations of current and future generations. I accept that changes are difficult&#151;in my constituency and in every constituency in the land, including those of the hon. Gentlemen.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o437"><a name="80623-0020.htm_para31"><a name="0806241000083">We have set a new housing target for 2016 of 240,000 additional homes a year nationally to address growing demand and affordability. They will not be just houses; they will be homes, let us remember, in the hon. Members&#146; constituencies. The Green Paper set out proposals to deliver a total of 2 million new homes by 2016 and 3 million by 2020.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o438"><a name="80623-0020.htm_para32"><a name="0806241000084">Milton Keynes and south midlands will provide the highest level of growth in any growth area between 2001 and 2016, delivering 210,000 new homes. I congratulate the hon. Gentlemen on the fact that their constituencies are desirable locations where people want to make their homes. As the hon. Member for Kettering said, north Northamptonshire&#146;s share of that will be 52,100 houses up to 2021, with a further 13,975 identified in the draft east midlands regional spatial strategy, which is to be delivered by 2026.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o439"><a name="80623-0020.htm_para33"><a name="0806241000085">The north Northamptonshire core spatial strategy acknowledges that that proposed housing growth will need to be supported by improvements in infrastructure and recognises that the delivery of that infrastructure is dependent on partnership working between the public and private sectors. Both hon. Gentlemen centred on the importance of infrastructure, which I shall return to in a moment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o440"><a name="80623-0020.htm_para34"><a name="0806241000086">The north Northamptonshire core spatial strategy gives a key role to the North Northants Development Company to work with infrastructure providers to identify needs and secure the timely delivery of facilities and services. The North Northants Development Company is due to submit a development plan to the Department for Communities and Local Government in the autumn. From my experience of working with such companies and seeing what they have done in other parts of the country, I know that they can make a difference. Indeed, I am sure that the company will have tuned into this debate and listened to every word of it, and will be reading it in <i> Hansard </i>tomorrow, too.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o441"><a name="80623-0020.htm_para35"><a name="0806241000087">As well as acknowledging the vital role of local partners, the Government fully recognise the role that we have to play in helping to unlock growth and create sustainable communities by supporting that infrastructure development. That is why we have provided a variety of funding to deliver growth in the Milton Keynes and south midlands growth area and elsewhere. Under the growth area fund, north Northamptonshire has so far received just under &#163;30 million, of which it received &#163;10 million under round 1, between 2004 and 2006, and just under &#163;20 million under round 2, between 2006 and 2008.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o442"><a name="80623-0020.htm_para36"><a name="0806241000088">I hear what the hon. Gentlemen said, and what the hon. Member for Kettering said in particular, about the coming years and the possible strains on infrastructure. Among other things, the money already set aside has been used to help fund the regeneration of key parts of Kettering town centre, a new civic hub in Corby town centre and improvements to Wellingborough high street.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o443"><a name="80623-0020.htm_para37"><a name="0806241000089">The results of the third round of the growth area fund were announced in December 2007. Under that exercise, north Northamptonshire was awarded just under &#163;29 million to fund further work over the three-year period between 2008-09 and 2010-11. Under the first round of the community infrastructure fund, north Northamptonshire received more than &#163;7 million to help fund a Corby northern orbital road, the building of a new road and the upgrading of an existing one, plus improvements to the A45 near Wellingborough.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o444"><a name="80623-0020.htm_para38"><a name="0806241000090">The House has heard the concerns that the hon. Member for Kettering expressed about road infrastructure and further improvements that need to be made. I hope that those involved&#151;the joint planning unit and the development company&#151;will work with hon. Members. It is important that Members of Parliament should have a role, working with development companies to ensure that they tailor the best solutions for their local communities, through the available funds. MPs are uniquely placed to do that, as pillars of their local communities and as people who listen to them, each day and each week.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o445"><a name="80623-0020.htm_para39"><a name="0806241000091">Bids for a second round of the community infrastructure fund are currently under consideration. I understand that north Northamptonshire has submitted several expressions of interest under this exercise. It is expected that decisions on which expressions of interest can go forward to the full bid stage will be made in just a few weeks&#146; time, in July, so hon. Members will not have too long to wait, and the announcement of successful bids will be made in February next year.</p>

plan. Over the period of its first local transport plan, Northamptonshire received &#163;84 million. We are part way through the second local transport plan period, under which the county will receive a further &#163;95 million. I know that upgrading the transport infrastructure is very much a focus of attention for partners in north Northamptonshire, especially on the A14 and A45 trunk roads. I also know that north Northamptonshire has engaged with my ministerial colleagues at the Department for Transport on these issues and that ongoing work is taking place to come up with solutions to the issues posed. I hope that both hon. Members will be keen to continue to ask questions. The hon. Member for Kettering has already had an Adjournment debate on a similar subject a couple of months ago, which was responded to by my right hon. Friend the Housing Minister.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o447"><a name="80623-0021.htm_para1"><a name="0806241000093">I fully recognise that infrastructure is a key issue for north Northamptonshire&#151;and, indeed, all areas engaged in the growth agenda&#151;but I hope that the examples of funding that I have mentioned will help to illustrate that the Government are fully committed to playing their part in resolving these issues, and that we are keen to work with Members of Parliament, local authorities and the development companies to support this process in the long term.</p>

 I sense that we have a little longer for our debate than the Minister was anticipating, and I am grateful to him for giving way. What can he say to the Department for Transport with regard to the A14? Most people in my constituency believe that, if the improvements are not made to the road until 2017, it will be far too late. Tens of thousands of new houses will already have been built by then, and a road that is already congested will have become even more dangerous.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman makes a very fair point on behalf of his constituents. This is about a partnership to decide on the greatest local need. The hon. Gentleman obviously has a clear idea in his own mind of what that is. The joint planning unit and the development company in his constituency are progressing their work and liaising with and talking to the Government. I do not have a magic wand with which to resolve all the problems with different roads, but I hope that that partnership at local level, alongside the lobbying of the Department for Transport, might result in some of the money being focused most relevantly on to the areas of greatest priority and need in his community, including the two roads that I have just mentioned.</p>

 I am very encouraged by the Minister&#146;s remarks, which seem to represent a shift in policy. In relation to the A14 and the A45, my hon. Friend the Member for Kettering (Mr. Hollobone) and I had understood that improvements could be made only if the regional assembly had agreed to them, despite the fact that the Highways Agency, the county council and the local council all thought that they were a good idea. May we be encouraged to think that the money could be spent locally without reference to the regional assembly?</p>

 As the hon. Member for Wellingborough will know, so much of this will depend on local plans and local priorities as pressed for by the county council and his county authority. I have not been privy to those discussions and I am not a Transport Minister, so I will not make up policy on the hoof. What I can say, however, is that they presented their case and it is important that they do so. The relationship with Parliament is important, as is the connectivity between themselves. I am sure that they are well aware of the relevant local officials and local politicians&#151;those involved with the joint planning unit and those who are members of the development company in their own patch. It is important to continue to have that dialogue and I am sure that they will.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o449"><a name="80623-0021.htm_para3"><a name="0806241000099">I know that the north Northamptonshire joint planning unit and its partners, which have had a bit of hard time in the course of this debate, have received congratulations not least from the Minister for the East Midlands, my hon. Friend the Member for Corby (Phil Hope). He recognised that the strategy provides an excellent example of joint working. I would like to add my own congratulations to the unit and all those concerned on producing this important strategy. It is not an easy piece of work. The hon. Member for Kettering has highlighted points 3 and 16 on page 28, but I do not know the wider context. Let me be honest and say that although I have had a flick through, I have not read all 90 pages of the document&#151;<i> [Interruption.] </i>The hon. Member for Wellingborough is shaking his head, but I would not want to misrepresent in any way what is in that document. I am not suggesting that the hon. Gentlemen have either, but it is important to take account of the full context of reports.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o450"><a name="80623-0021.htm_para4"><a name="0806241000100">I acknowledge that there is much more to do. This is the first development plan document&#151;or DPD&#151;to be adopted as part of the north Northamptonshire local development framework. I understand that about 14 further DPDs are currently scheduled in the agreed north Northamptonshire local development scheme. That represents a very significant work load and I would encourage all the responsible partners to look again to find opportunities to streamline the number of DPDs. I offer that encouragement in the spirit of wanting to see north Northamptonshire succeed in realising the ambitions set out in the core spatial strategy and to build on this promising start.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o451"><a name="80623-0021.htm_para5"><a name="0806241000101">Although both hon. Gentlemen have their differences with much that they have seen in the document, I think that they would accept that there are some very important and good things in it. I would strongly encourage those in north Northamptonshire and elsewhere to look closely at the opportunities presented by the revised version of planning policy statement 12 on local spatial planning. My right hon. Friend the Minister for Housing has already acknowledged that the new spatial plan-making system introduced in 2004 has proved to be unnecessarily complicated, but we have taken that into account and listened to concerns, so the revised PPS seeks to create a fairer, more streamlined and, I hope, transparent spatial planning process. In doing that, it places community engagement at its heart, while stressing the need for robust evidence and active engagement with infrastructure providers.</p>
