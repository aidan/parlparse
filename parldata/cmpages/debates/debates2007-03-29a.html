 The proportion of tax taken from national income is lower than in the euro area&#151;lower than in France, Germany and other countries. A single earner on male average earnings with two children will pay 20 per cent. of their income in tax in 2009-10.

 As the Chancellor prides himself on being socially progressive, can he explain why the biggest beneficiaries of his tax changes are extremely rich pensioners and the biggest losers are households of single men or women, or childless couples, on very low incomes?

 If the Liberals had joined us in supporting the minimum wage, they might have had more things to say. According to the Institute for Fiscal Study&#146;s response to the Budget&#151;[Hon. Members: &#147;Read all of it.&#148;] I am very happy to do so. According to it, in terms of direct tax the lowest decile is 0.8 per cent. better off, the second lowest decile is 1 per cent. better off, and the richest decile is 0.5 per cent. better off, so most of the gains are going disproportionately to the poorest and bottom deciles in our community. Without any help from the Liberal party or the Conservatives, since 1997 the position of the poorest decile has improved by 12.4 per cent., and of the second lowest decile by 11.8 per cent. That shows that this Government are on the side of hard-working families.</p>

I hope that at some point the Liberals, who perhaps take a greater interest in these issues than the Conservatives, will come around to our view that the best way to help those in the lowest income groups in our society is through child and working tax credits.

Because of the measures that we have taken, which Opposition Members opposed consistently, we have had the fastest fall in child poverty of any European country since 1997. We on the Labour Benches are proud of that record.</p>

 (<i> Urgent Question</i>): To ask the Home Secretary to make a statement on the reorganisation of the Home Office and the Department for Constitutional Affairs.</p>

<p><a name="st_o127"><a name="07032955000179"><a name="70329-0004.htm_spmin0"><a name="07032955000970"><b>The Secretary of State for the Home Department (John Reid):</b>
 In the past few years, the world and the challenges to which the Government and the Home Office have had to respond have changed dramatically. This morning, we have refocused the Home Office towards the realities of today&#146;s world and the priorities of today&#146;s people. Managing migration and immigration, fighting crime and countering terrorism are now of the highest concern to people in this country.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o11"><a name="70329-0004.htm_para0"><a name="07032955000180">Since the end of the cold war, we have faced a torrent of new challenges: in particular, mass migration, international crime and international terrorism. It is my responsibility as Home Secretary to ensure a response to those challenges that measures up to their extent, scale and character. That is why I have pursued challenging reform programmes across almost all aspects of the Home Office.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o12"><a name="70329-0004.htm_para1"><a name="07032955000181">The House will be aware of measures introduced to improve the National Offender Management Service, to acquire 8,000 more prison places, to rebalance the criminal justice system in favour of the victim, to roll out neighbourhood and community policing, to develop the Respect agenda and to tackle antisocial behaviour. In addition, I have introduced measures to ensure the fair and more effective management of immigration, and the movement of the immigration and nationality directorate towards agency status. All those reforms will continue.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o13"><a name="70329-0004.htm_para2"><a name="07032955000182">In addition, however, in the wake of last August&#146;s alleged terrorist plot, the Prime Minister asked me to conduct a review of counter-terrorism, involving the appropriate Ministers and Departments, as well as the police and security agencies. Arising out of that review, the Prime Minister has today decided to make changes to the machinery of government. The House will be aware of his written statement laid earlier today. The changes outlined there are aimed at producing a step change in our approach to managing the terrorist threat to the United Kingdom and to winning the central battle, which is the struggle for values and ideas. </p>

<p><a name="stpa_o14"><a name="70329-0004.htm_para3"><a name="07032955000183">Among other changes&#151;which I will not outline in detail, as they have already been outlined in the written ministerial statement&#151;we will create a more coherent ministerial committee system for oversight, establish strategic capacity for the longer term, integrate better our joint effort, and establish the capacity to engage in the struggle for ideas and values. We will do that partly by establishing a new unit, the office for security and counter-terrorism, in my Department.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o15"><a name="70329-0004.htm_para4"><a name="07032955000184">I should make it plain that no portfolios&#151;no responsibilities&#151;will be taken from existing Departments. There will be no change in the lead Department responsibility for any of the agencies. My right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary will of course continue to lead on all aspects of foreign affairs. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State at the Department for Communities and Local Government  <br>

similarly will retain her responsibilities in the prevent strand of the CONTEST framework and community engagement. Obviously, my right hon. Friend the Defence Secretary will lead on matters relating to the armed forces and wider defence operations.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o16"><a name="70329-0004.htm_para5"><a name="07032955000185">However, the changes outlined today will add capacity to that which is already engaged in the formulation and carrying through of our security and counter-terrorism policy. It will develop a more strategic, inclusive, integrated and capable response to the current threat. Along with the fight against crime and antisocial behaviour, the Home Office will be refocused towards the challenges of today&#146;s world and will focus on the priorities of today&#146;s people.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o17"><a name="70329-0004.htm_para6"><a name="07032955000186">As a result of those refocused and extended capabilities, and the extended attention of ministerial oversight of those exponentially growing challenges, the Home Office, as is appropriate, should shed some responsibilities. Those will be merged with the Department for Constitutional Affairs in a coherent way to form a balanced reformulation of the machinery of government by creating a ministry of justice. The Lord Chancellor will be giving more details of that in another place.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o18"><a name="70329-0004.htm_para7"><a name="07032955000187">As I said, we are refocusing the Home Office, not for the first time in its history, towards the realities of today&#146;s world and the priorities of today&#146;s people. I commend those changes to the House.</p>

 Let me start by thanking you, Mr. Speaker, for granting this urgent question. It should not have been necessary. The breaking up of one of the great Departments of State, with massive implications for crime, immigration, justice and terrorism, should have been brought before the House for proper debate, not disgracefully smuggled out in a written statement on the last Thursday before the Easter recess.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o19"><a name="70329-0004.htm_para8"><a name="07032955000189">Let me turn to the substance of the Government&#146;s plan. On counter-terrorism&#151;the thing on which the Home Secretary majored&#151;some of the measures with respect to co-ordinating anti-terrorism are sensible and overdue. However, he has failed to secure a new Cabinet post for national security and will not be given control of the overall secret intelligence budget. Therefore, he will not be able to drive the counter-terrorism effort every hour of the day in the way that it clearly needs a Cabinet Minister to do.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o20"><a name="70329-0004.htm_para9"><a name="07032955000190">As for the split of the Home Office, the logic presumably is that the job is too difficult for this Home Secretary to do. It has been well run in the past by Home Secretaries of all parties when it was much bigger and faced equally sizeable responsibilities. Indeed, it still had responsibility for licensing, gambling, broadcasting, fire, civil defence, human rights, equal opportunities and charities. Breaking it up will solve none of the Home Office&#146;s problems; it may well just create a whole new raft of problems.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o21"><a name="70329-0004.htm_para10"><a name="07032955000191">After all, the Home Secretary got his job as a direct result of the scandal of foreign prisoners being released on to our streets because of poor communication between the prisons department and the immigration department. How will that poor communication be improved by splitting the prisons and immigration departments into separate Departments of State?</p>

Now he proposes to distract the senior staff of the Home Office by a massive reorganisation. Where are the resources going to come from to carry that out? Out of the frozen Home Office budget, at the expense of criminal justice, policing and immigration control? How much will it cost and where will it come from?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o27"><a name="70329-0004.htm_para16"><a name="07032955000198">Further examples are the formation of the Department of National Heritage in 1992 and, in 1995, the merging of the Departments of Employment and Education to become the Department for Education and Skills.

On the one hand he speaks of a great office of state abandoning its responsibilities; on the other, he refers to all the responsibilities that have been abandoned over the years precisely to enable the Home Office to refocus on today&#146;s challenges: constitutional affairs, the fire service, royal matters, rape, faith and cohesion, communities, and the voluntary and charitable sector&#151;and that is only since 2001. There were many before that. Indeed, originally there were only two Departments apart from the Exchequer, those responsible for foreign affairs and for home affairs. While I stand in admiration of Conservatives who wish to retain the status quo however the world has changed, it is not very useful to refuse to change one&#146;s opinions and institutions even though the world has changed.</p>

This is of course a matter of judgment, but there was another great non sequitur in the right hon. Gentleman&#146;s contribution. He cited foreign-national prisoners as an example of the way in which co-ordination is improved by matters being dealt with by the same Department. It was, in fact, a classic example of why that does not, of itself, ensure co-ordination.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o31"><a name="70329-0004.htm_para20"><a name="07032955000202">The one thing that does ensure good co-ordination is the National Criminal Justice Board, which runs like a weld under elements of the present Home Office and elements of the present Department for Constitutional Affairs. It will remain. It is chaired jointly by the Lord Chancellor and myself, and that will continue. It involves the police, the judges, the agencies and the probation and other services, as well as Ministers. That will continue as well. The co-ordinating elements are there. Of course it is a matter of judgment, but it is not self-evident that being in the same department helps or ensures co ordination.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o32"><a name="70329-0004.htm_para21"><a name="07032955000203">Will the ministry of justice always remain the responsibility of the House of Lords? I do not think so. During the transitional period up to 8 May, and perhaps for some time beyond it, my noble Friend the Lord Chancellor, who presides over the Department of Constitutional Affairs, will be the best repository and the best person to develop the ministry.

Finally, does he accept that the coherence and co-ordination of the criminal justice system that is so important to its success will be damaged seriously by these proposals?</p>

Gentleman has spent a lot of time decrying those who apparently chase headlines, and spent the rest of his time chasing the headlines, making the headlines or basing his story on the headlines. The Prime Minister will still oversee the strategic national security elements. He will chair the new integrated committee. The Cabinet Office will service that committee. He will still have a national security adviser. It will not be the Home Secretary who chairs that.</p>

 We know that we will still have all the problems there, but we are not confident from what the Home Secretary has said that we will have the proper solutions. Does not he remember how, on one busy afternoon, the Prime Minister created the Department for Constitutional Affairs on the back of an envelope and sought to get rid of the Lord Chancellor? He then found that what he was proposing was entirely unworkable and unrealistic. What confidence can we now have that the new ministry of justice, created without proper consultation with Parliament, is going to be up to the job?

 On the process point, I have already explained the matter. In fact, at the risk of boring the hon.

Of course with any of these things there are judgments to be made. Of course there is controversy, but the idea that, by preserving the present structure, we have some benign recipe for perfect co-ordination and operations within the Home Office does not strike me as self-evidently true on the basis of history. It may have been true, but as I have said, each of the units of the Home Office already has a plan for reform. I have introduced three of them, and several were introduced by my predecessor. They are being worked through, including the National Offender Management System. All those elements will continue. This reconfiguration is not a substitute for improving the quality of each of the constituent elements. It will not involve the expense that the Liberal Democrat spokesman, the hon. Member for Sheffield, Hallam (Mr. Clegg), expects. It will be accomplished within the existing budgets of the Home Office and the DCA. The change will not require the expenditure of time, energy or resources that is anticipated. If hon.

 Splitting the Home Office may make sense, but as a former police Minister I am worried about the message to the police of some of the detail in my right hon. Friend's reply today. Will not the changes appear to downgrade the Government's successful focus on cutting crime and disorder and antisocial behaviour, on police community support work and on crime reduction partnerships? Having a department of homeland security may make sense, but it appears to downgrade the emphasis on local policing. Can he reassure us on that?</p>

 On the first point, let me offer a correction: it will not be a Department for homeland security. That, by definition, would fragment our counter-terrorist and security effort because of the misapprehension that we can neatly segregate the current threat into foreign affairs, defence affairs and domestic affairs. One of the reasons why we need not only a longer term strategic response but a better integrated one is that the threat is now seamless. It is a seamless threat that runs through foreign and defence affairs and affairs at home. That is another reason why the Opposition&#146;s recommendation does nothing to address the current threat.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o46"><a name="70329-0005.htm_para5"><a name="07032955000232">I can give an assurance that neighbourhood policing&#151;the British style of policing, which has been rolled out through the country&#151;will not only remain in the Home Office but will be a very high priority, as will antisocial behaviour. While some elements of legislation&#151;such as police and criminal evidence legislation&#151;will remain with the Home Office, other elements, such as criminal justice Bills, will pass to the ministry for justice.

to my right hon. Friend that the effectiveness of the machinery of Government depends on whether it works? It has been found in the past&#151;for example, when the Conservative Government took broadcasting away from the Home Office&#151;that the machinery of Government must work.

 I agree 100 per cent. One of the reasons why I have come to the conclusion that I have reached is that it seems to me that although we can improve the constituent elements of work within the Home Office, because of the magnitude of the challenge of three or four elements, the work on them cannot be carried out properly unless we concentrate and refocus on them and shift the other elements to a different dimension or Department. This change is being made because of practical reasons to do with responding to the current challenges of mass immigration, international crime and counter-terrorism, as well as to the policing and antisocial behaviour problems that we have. I say that with sincerity as both the current Secretary of State at the Home Office and in the past as Secretary of State for almost everything else.</p>

My question is simple: can we have the figures here and now?</p>

 I have already made absolutely plain that the costs will be borne from inside the budget, alongside other ongoing efficiency savings. The cost will be small. There is no need to build new buildings, and no need for a massive reallocation, for a massive restructuring of departmental organisations, or for consultancy fees. This is a merger of an existing, coherent unit&#151;NOMS and the criminal justice section&#151;with the Department for Constitutional Affairs, so the costs are in no way prohibitive and will be met inside our budgets as a normal, routine managerial expense.</p>

 I am not going to respond here to the question of the detailed travel arrangements of this hypothetical passenger, but I will look into this issue and write to the hon. Gentleman. He will know that this week, the Minister for Immigration, Citizenship and Nationality, my hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Hodge Hill (Mr. Byrne), proposed yet another step change in our immigration and enforcement policy. Through exporting our borders, by the end of next year the people of more than100 countries will require visas to come here; and through the introduction of biometrics, fingerprint and identity management will enable us to track people in and out of the country. I ask Opposition Members to reconsider their opposition to identity management. Without it, we will never be able to counter fraud and terrorism or to track immigration. The hon.

justice system? It is important that a statement be made to the House about this matter&#151;especially as the Select Committee is looking at the Attorney-General&#146;s role&#151;and that a Minister from that department also be on the Front Bench. Could we please have an urgent debate on this issue?</p>

<p><a name="st_o164"><a name="07032955000255"><a name="70329-0005.htm_spnew29"><a name="07032955001007"><b>John Reid:</b>
 The short answer to my right hon. Friend&#146;s question is that there is no significant change to the Attorney-General&#146;s role that I am aware of. The trilateral arrangements will still pertain, and the Attorney-General will certainly still be on the National Criminal Justice Board, on which we all sit in an attempt to co-ordinate matters across the criminal justice system. So I think that there is no significant change.</p>

 What the hon. Gentleman does not seem to realise is that a massive efficiency, improvement and reform plan is under way in almost every area. For instance, a staff reduction of 1,600 in NOMS alone is envisaged over the coming period, so compared with the reductions, improvements and efficiency measures taking place, the cost of this change is, as I said, very small. There will be no cuts, but a reallocation and a refocus toward immigration, international crime and international terrorism. The British people&#146;s three priorities, according to every single opinion poll of the last three years, are fair and effective control of immigration, countering crime and countering terrorism. These are responses not only to changes in the world, but to what people in our communities want us to focus on.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman is talking about leaks and reports. The<i>  Financial Times </i>reported it 10 weeks ago; it was a misreport and misrepresentation. The <i> Evening Standard </i>reported that one of my Cabinet colleagues was opposed to this; it was not true. There have been constant leaks, as happens in government; that does not mean that we are doing these things. This issue has been discussed for a considerable time across government, and the civil servants and officials working on it have done so with huge discretion and integrity. It is in some ways amazing that the accurate details did not come out until two or three hours ago, when the written ministerial statement was issued; other details have been placed in the Library of the House. I think that the hon. Gentleman will find that all the reports of the past 10 weeks have not been at all authoritative; indeed, for the most part, they have been misleading and wrong.</p>

In addition, the rural development fund, which would otherwise have been used for flood alleviation schemes, is no longer at the level that it would have been without the fines. Secondly, as the Government are so keen to look into restructuring Departments and to consider the level of ministerial responsibility, will he please ensure that the Minister with responsibility for farms is a House of Commons man or woman, and is inthis House to answer questions and receive correspondence?

 I think that what my right hon. Friend said is accurate, and I echo what he said, because virtually nobody is waiting more than six months. The number is down by 284,000 since 1997, and is now relatively small. Of course, that is still too many people who are waiting, but the hon. Gentleman needs to make up his mind about whether he supports the extra money that we have put into the health service&#151;it alone has made the improvements possible&#151;or whether he opposes that spending, as he did at the last election, and the one before that.</p>

The questions, which I tabled on 26 February, relate to an apparent breach of planning law by the Minister for Housing and Planning.

Three weeks after answers were due, I have yet to receive an answer or even a holding reply from the Department. Will you confirm, Mr. Deputy Speaker, that that is in breach&#151;I tried to identify whether it was&#151;of Standing Order No. 22, and as you are the protector of our interests as Back Benchers, will you advise me how I can resolve the matter in the interests of my constituents?</p>

 Before the House of Commons adjourns for the Easter recess, I want to raise a matter relating to the manner in which we conduct our proceedings, particularly the manner in which legislation is now being progressed through both Houses of Parliament. On 15 March, I tabled a written parliamentary question to the Prime Minister asking him, in the light of an earlier comment that he had made, if he would place on record the <i> Hansard</i> reference to the occasion on which a very full debate took place on the Equality Act (Sexual Orientation) Regulations 2007. That written question should have been answered today. The Table Office&#151;and I have no quarrel with the Clerks whatsoever, far from it&#151;rejected the question, on the grounds that the Prime Minister, in his answer at Prime Minister&#146;s Question Time to my hon. Friend the Member for Stone (Mr. Cash), had not actually referred to a parliamentary debate. The Prime Minister in fact said:</p>


<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070329/debtext/70329-0008.htm"/>

We debate issues in the Chamber, and I do not think that it is satisfactory for the Prime Minister or, indeed, any other Minister to tell the House that we have had a full debate &#147;in public&#148;&#151;what does that mean, is it the public bar of The Bull and Bush?&#151;rather than on the Floor of the House, which is where debates relating to contentious issues upon which there are strongly, deeply and honourably held opinions on both sides should be held.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o92"><a name="70329-0008.htm_para1"><a name="07032955000363">Looking at what actually happened, we can see how fully the matter was debated. Sexual orientation was not debated at all during the passage of the Equality Act 2006 through the House of Commons. It was not debated in Committee or on Report or on Third Reading in the Commons, because it was only introduced as the subject of an amendment in Committee in the House of Lords. That introduction caused what my hon. Friend the Member for Epping Forest (Mrs. Laing) referred to later on the record as &#147;anomalies&#148;. I think that we can fairly say that the regulations are pretty anomalous. As the implications of the regulations became clear, public concern was widely expressed. To that extent, the Prime Minister was right&#151;there was a public debate outside the House&#151;but still there was no opportunity for a full debate in the House of Commons.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o93"><a name="70329-0008.htm_para2"><a name="07032955000364">Those highly contentious draft regulations were laid on 13 March. My understanding&#151;and I stand to be corrected, as it is possible that the Committee was appointed late at night on 13 March&#151;is that members of the Committee designated to consider those regulations were not appointed, or at least informed, until 14 March. The regulations were heard by a Delegated Legislation Committee very early in the morning on Thursday15 March. From the time the regulations were laid, notwithstanding their highly contentious content, until their consideration and determination in full, insofar as debate is concerned, by the House, there was a period of  <br>

two and a half days. There was no time for consideration by Committee members and there was no time for any further representations to be made. In Committee on15 March, 17 appointed Committee members were present. In addition&#151;and this is exceptional, as hon. Members will know, for a Statutory Instrument Committee&#151;24 non-Committee members who were, none the less, hon. Members, were present. A dilatory motion was moved, which the Chairman, quite properly, rejected. Once points of order had been raised&#151;and there were a number of them&#151;one Back Bencher had time to comment on those highly contentious regulations. Fourteen hon. Members sought to intervene: my hon. Friends the Members for Enfield, Southgate (Mr. Burrowes), for Wellingborough (Mr. Bone), for Stone (Mr. Cash), for Gainsborough (Mr. Leigh), and for North Essex (Mr. Jenkin); my right hon. Friend the Member for Wokingham (Mr. Redwood); and my hon. Friends the Members for Aldershot (Mr. Howarth), for Monmouth (David T.C. Davies), for Croydon, Central (Mr. Pelling), for South-West Bedfordshire (Andrew Selous), for Christchurch (Mr. Chope), for Buckingham (John Bercow), for Daventry (Mr. Boswell), and for New Forest, West (Mr. Swayne).

That is slightly disingenuous. The fact of the matter is that no offer was made, but of course, it is open to the Opposition to make a request.

 I begin by welcoming the hon. Member for Sherwood (Paddy Tipping) to his new position. It is a pleasure to see him on the Front Bench. He occupied the position once before and returns to the Front Bench, I understand, as an unpaid post, so presumably this is one area where we will see good value for money. I congratulate the hon. Gentleman. When he previously held the post, and when he summed up these debates, he always did so with courtesy and respect for the House and for Members. I am delighted to see him back in the Government. I want to use today to raise several issues which directly affect my constituency. I raised some of these matters in the Christmas Adjournment debate, and I want to consider how they have moved on.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o113"><a name="70329-0008.htm_para22"><a name="07032955000383">I want to touch on a real crisis for the countryside. Hon. Members who represent agricultural constituencies feel incredibly worried about the position of dairy farmers. Approximately 10 years ago, a dairy farmer would get 26p a litre for their milk. Today, the figure is 18p a litre. It has been estimated that on average dairy farmers today are losing in the region of 4p a litre, and they cannot go on losing money on their main product without going bust.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o114"><a name="70329-0008.htm_para23"><a name="07032955000384">The Government must take a serious look at the matter. This morning, the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Committee issued a devastating report on the Rural Payments Agency. I remember earlier warnings from the Select Committee that the RPA was in serious danger&#151;I think that the Deputy Leader of the House was a member of the Committee at that time&#151;and I also remember Lord Bach saying that the Committee was wrong and that it had misunderstood the whole position. Who was wrong and who was right?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o115"><a name="70329-0008.htm_para24"><a name="07032955000385">The devastation caused to the farming industry has been fundamental, and the Government&#146;s reputation has been seriously damaged. It is no good saying that the Secretary of State has apologised, because the situation is continuing. On 2 March, the RPA extended its final deadline for the return of the hill farm allowance forms, because it discovered that applicants had not received the explanatory booklet and declaration letter. The RPA is now re-mailing a number of upland farmers. That might explain why, according to the RPA, there was a failure by applicants to submit their declarations. It is difficult to submit a declaration if one has not been sent it in the first instance. There needs to be a radical look at how the RPA works, and perhaps that will now happen.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o116"><a name="70329-0008.htm_para25"><a name="07032955000386">Without the farmers of this country, there would be no countryside. As the Deputy Leader of the House knows, my constituency is very attractive, and 20 million people a year visit the Peak District national park. The visitors come to see the natural beauty of my constituency, but if the land is not farmed, it will not hold its beauty.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o117"><a name="70329-0008.htm_para26"><a name="07032955000387">The Minister for Local Environment, Marine and Animal Welfare has said this about the RPA:</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o118"><a name="70329-0008.htm_para27"><a name="07032955000388">Following that comment by the junior Minister, I received a letter from a farmer, which stated:</p>
<a name="70329-0008.htm_brev12"><a name="07032955000787"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Most of us see our job to be producing crops and livestock. This is what provides our income. Anything that takes us away from that work tends to be seen as waste of time. In recent years we have been straight jacketed with paperwork from people sitting in front of computers who to justify their existence have to think up new schemes and forms to complete. It is not the fear of reprisals that stops the ordinary farmer from contacting you. Most will have asked question, &#145;Will it do me any good?&#146; Experience says no. To provide you with evidence each of us has to search through our mountains of paper. And we just don&#146;t have the time&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o119"><a name="70329-0008.htm_para28"><a name="07032955000389">I hope that the Government will take on board the proper concerns of the dairy industry, and of the agricultural industry, in our country.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o120"><a name="70329-0008.htm_para29"><a name="07032955000390">The next issue that I want to discuss is the resurfacing of the A50. The A50 is a new road that has been built through part of my constituency, and it has become known as the Doveridge bypass. Traffic volumes have grown dramatically on the bypass. Indeed, it is a mistake to call that part of the A50 the Doveridge bypass, because following work in the Stoke area on the A500, it has become the M1-M6 link road. The Government published a 10-year plan&#151;I think that we are now at the stage of five-year plans&#151;and the then Secretary of State for Transport, who is now Secretary of State for Trade and Industry, wrote to reassure me that the 10-year plan included resurfacing some of the concrete roads in our country. He said that the A50 was in that particular scheme and that it would be done. Surprise, surprise, the 10-year plan never reached expectations, and I have been told that that road will not be resurfaced in the immediate future.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o121"><a name="70329-0008.htm_para30"><a name="07032955000391">I have tabled written parliamentary questions to the Secretary of State for Transport, and I have written to the Highways Agency. Just the other day, I received a letter from the Highways Agency that contained some very disturbing news:</p>
<a name="70329-0008.htm_brev13"><a name="07032955000788"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;As you know the current policy with regard to funding all works on the motorway and trunk road network is entirely dependent on safety and maintenance needs. Concrete roads are designed to have a life of approximately 40 years, but the condition of all roads are regularly assessed for safety and maintenance. Therefore under current procedures it is unlikely that the A50 will need resurfacing for some time.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o122"><a name="70329-0008.htm_para31"><a name="07032955000392">The goes against the assurance that I was given by the then Secretary of State for Transport.</p>

When the bypass was built, people were pleased, but they did not expect one problem to be replaced by another, namely consistent noise in the daytime caused by the concrete road.</p>

constituency. In 2004, I was told that work would start to lay a low-noise surface on the A303 to relieve noise in Wincanton and the villages along the road, such as Holton, Maperton, Compton Pauncefoot and South Cadbury. That has not happened, and there has been no indication from the Highways Agency when it will be done.</p>

 Assurances were given in the past. Particularly in the summer months, the noise from those roads means that people cannot go out in their gardens or enjoy the countryside in which they have purchased houses.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o124"><a name="70329-0009.htm_para0"><a name="07032955000398">I first raised the issue of quarrying in the Peak district some 10 years ago, when I was very concerned about Longstone Edge and Backdale quarry. After10 years, a public inquiry has just taken place. I do not expect the Deputy Leader of the House to comment on that public inquiry. I once asked the Library for a briefing on the subject, and it sent back a note stating that it is &#147;a rather complicated matter&#148;&#151;one can ask the Library for a brief on nuclear weapons or treaties, but if one asks for a brief on Backdale quarry, it states that it is &#147;a rather complicated matter&#148;. That is an underestimation, and I will not go into all the issues around the quarry application, but I will say that the issue has been ongoing for more than 10 years.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o125"><a name="70329-0009.htm_para1"><a name="07032955000399">I hope that when the planning inspector reports, whatever he says, the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, to whom I have written about this, will call in and investigate the whole process. The amount of money that it has cost the Peak park planning board and the quarry operators in legal fees, and the amount of officers&#146; time that has been spent, must be incalculable, and it has not been the most effective way of dealing with the matter.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o126"><a name="70329-0009.htm_para2"><a name="07032955000400">If the planning inspector&#146;s decision goes the right way, I should like to think that that might be the end of the line, but I fear that we are still going to have to spend a lot of time on this application, which has been incredibly controversial. After all, we are talking about a national park that is visited each year by millions of people who come to see it and enjoy the activities there. I am joined in that view by the former deputy leader of the Labour party, Lord Hattersley, who lives fairly near to the site.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o127"><a name="70329-0009.htm_para3"><a name="07032955000401">Another issue that is causing a great deal of anxiety to my constituents is the proposed closure of Stoney Middleton school. We now have a new process for school closures whereby they ultimately go to a school adjudicator. It used to be possible for us, as Members of Parliament, to make representations directly to the Secretary of State before a school was closed, but no longer. Stoney Middleton is a fairly small village but it is on a very busy road on which schoolchildren will have to travel if the school closes. That alone should be a reason to think again. In its motion, the county council considered proposals to &#147;discontinue&#148; the school. I suppose that that is a new kind of language and that it really means &#147;close&#148;. Closing the school would take the heart out of the village. I hope that whenever the school adjudicator comes to a final decision, he or she will say that the county council&#146;s case has not been made. The school is providing an excellent educational service for its pupils, and it should be allowed to continue to do so.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o128"><a name="70329-0009.htm_para4"><a name="07032955000402">When I spoke in the Christmas Adjournment debate, I said that I feared that Darley maternity unit would be proposed for closure by the local trust. I am afraid that those fears have come to fruition, so today I shall turn most of my attention to Darley. It is a small unit run by midwives with a wealth of experience. Indeed, my wife was given first-class service when she was there, almost 17 years ago, on the occasion of the birth of our second child, Clare. Having provided that service for people in the north Derbyshire area for a very long time, it is now threatened with closure. That is completely unacceptable.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o129"><a name="70329-0009.htm_para5"><a name="07032955000403">The way in which the trust has gone about this, in not being open and honest about the figures, is nothing less than an absolute disgrace. In its consultation document, it says:</p>
<a name="70329-0009.htm_brev0"><a name="07032955000789"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;The community maternity service review has shown the unit would need substantial extra investment to meet the required standard of clinical practice and bring it up to safe staffing levels. This extra equates to more than &#163;300,000 a year.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o130"><a name="70329-0009.htm_para6"><a name="07032955000404">When I met officials from the trust, together with the hon. Member for Chesterfield (Paul Holmes), I challenged them on that figure. To say that their response was dismal would be kind. To say that they could not justify it in any way, shape or form would be to underestimate their inability to reply. It was a disgraceful episode. In the 20 years that I have been in the House of Commons, I have never had a meeting with officials that I would class as being so bad. I am still unable to get from them a proper figure for their costs as regards the unit, because every time they are asked a question they come up with a different figure. At the meeting, they started by saying that the unit needed an extra two nurses. I said, &#147;Two nurses don&#146;t cost &#163;150,000 each, so what is the rest of the money for?&#148; After a slight pause, they said that it needed an extra five nurses. That is typical of how it went on&#151;it was unbelievable. If trusts are going to make such proposals, they must be told that they need to be honest and open with the people they are dealing with. </p>

<p><a name="stpa_o131"><a name="70329-0009.htm_para7"><a name="07032955000405">I have had many representations from my constituents about the wonderful service that the unit provides. Mrs. Smith from Wirksworth says:</p>

I felt totally disempowered I was stitched afterwards by a junior doctor who did not even introduce himself. I had to wait on a trolley for an hour after the birth, unable to move or control my bladder because of my epidural. An auxiliary mopped up my urine without speaking to me. It was like Victorian times. The next day, I was transferred to Darley. I received empathy, support, and debriefing, explaining why my delivery had been so difficult. When I became pregnant again, I booked in to Darley. I can not fault the care I received during labour. I felt supported throughout. Unfortunately, in the final stages, the baby was stuck and I was transferred to Chesterfield in an ambulance. However, the midwife from Darley came with me, held my hand, reassured me. I still felt in control, because I was part of the decision to transfer me. I can never thank the midwives at Darley enough&#151;they saved my sanity. Surely this unit should be a flag ship.&#148;</p>

De Montfort university. At an earlier stage, when the trust first came out with its consultation document, he explained that the trust questionnaires broke all the rules that he set down for his students on preparing such documents, because asking such closed questions produces biased results. He said of the questionnaire in the back of the document that is being circulated by the trust:</p>
<a name="70329-0009.htm_brev2"><a name="07032955000791"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;The only way for people who do not agree with the perspective presented in the report to express their views is to ignore or delete the closed questions and write answers in one of the boxes&#151;but people tend not to do that, they tend to get irritated and discard the questionnaire. This, of course, would further bias the responses received.&#148;</p>

I very much hope, even at this late stage, that we get a change of heart from the trust and that the Department of Health investigates the way in which the whole exercise has been gone about.</p>

It does not look that way, even if we want to take the Prime Minister at his word. I find that difficult to do when I consider what is happening to the Darley maternity unit. I hope that the Deputy Leader of the House can respond to that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o136"><a name="70329-0009.htm_para12"><a name="07032955000410">Given that the Deputy Leader of the House attended a meeting with me a few weeks ago at Ripley, where we met David Coleman, the chief constable of Derbyshire police, I want to consider police funding and the new formula that the Government have introduced. I am not asking for extra money but for the formula to be distributed in the way in which the Government originally intended. The hon. Gentleman, along with me and other east midlands Members, heard a first-class, impressive presentation. Thankfully, we got rid of the disastrous plan to merge all the police forces in the east midlands, but the presentation described the way in which the forces work together effectively on serious and organised crime. We were taken through the financing and I do not want that element of the police&#146;s work throughout the east midlands to be put in danger. I know that the Deputy Leader of the House does not want that and I hope that he can examine that matter, too.</p>

I am glad that he did not raise them all; otherwise the whole Adjournment debate would have concentrated on West Derbyshire. However, I hope that he is successful in his campaign to keep his local maternity unit open. I ask him to take the Prime Minister at his word, because I have the same problems in my constituency. There has been massive investment, but those who deliver on the front line need to be careful about the way in which they use public money and they need to be accountable.

I have watched him in the past 15 years or so take up issues of concern to his constituency, and one of the iconic television pictures of the 1992 elections was of my hon. Friend dancing&#151;it looked like banghra dancing&#151;at his count on gaining the previously Conservative seat. I do not say that he has been dancing ever since, but I am sure that he did a little jig on his reappointment this week. I wish him well in his role as Deputy Leader of the House.</p>

He is a widower with three children. Like more than 50,000 British citizens, he went on the pilgrimage to Saudia Arabia to perform his Hajj in December last year. He was on a coach with his wife, Zenab Ali, on the Madinah-Makkah highway near Dubaiyah when it overturned. It hit a central reservation and Mrs. Ali died at the scene of the crash.

18 hours before the crash. He had been swerving the coach when he was driving Mr. Gorji and his wife, and the coach passengers urged him to stop. They offered him refreshments and asked him to rest because they feared that, if he continued on the journey, the coach would crash. That is exactly what happened.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o143"><a name="70329-0009.htm_para19"><a name="07032955000418">The crash highlights the problem that many British Muslims, some of whom live in my constituency, suffer when they go on the Hajj to Saudi Arabia. The Leader of the House set up the Hajj Committee when he was Foreign Secretary and my noble Friend Lord Patel of Blackburn chairs it. It does a great job, but it cannot control the activities of the Saudi Arabian Government. So far, we have been unable to bring to the Saudi Arabian Government&#146;s attention with sufficient force an understanding of the problem that continues to occur with those who drive my constituents and those of other hon. Members in Saudi Arabia. The Hajj has to be performed there because the holy places are there.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o144"><a name="70329-0009.htm_para20"><a name="07032955000419">Rafiq Gorji eloquently made the point to me and the Saudi Arabian authorities that the people who are employed by Saudi Arabia to drive the coaches do not necessarily come from that country.

He promised to raise this matter with the Foreign Secretary, who would presumably raise it with her Minister of State, who would then raise it with the Saudi Arabians. It is only a matter of a police report, after all. We did the Saudi Arabian Government a great favour recently when we stopped the investigation by the Serious Fraud Office on the ground that it was not in the public interest.

I intervened on him to refer to the resurfacing of the A303, which is a serious issue in my constituency because of the effect of that road on the environment of many villages and on the people who live there. He also mentioned quarrying, and I represent the biggest quarrying area in the country&#151;the east Mendips. I wondered whether he would refer to our concerns about the aggregates levy, and the use of funds raised by it. The levy was set up to alleviate the disbenefits of the quarrying industry, but those funds will now apparently be distributed across the country to areas that do not suffer from such disbenefits, which is entirely contrary to the original intention of the levy.</p>

I invite the Minister responsible to put on her wellies and stand in a field in Isle Brewers, Kingsbury Episcopi, Leigh-on-Mendip or Rudge, among the cows, and then say that Somerset is not a rural county. Because of our settlement pattern, however, with lots of small villages only about two or three miles apart, and without big empty spaces, we are not deemed to be a rural county. I reassure the House, however, that we are very much a rural county, and that agriculture, particularly dairy farming, is still very important to both the environment in which we live and the enterprises that underpin our way of life. Although agriculture employs far fewer people than it used to do, nevertheless, as we saw during the foot and mouth restrictions, it is fundamental to a lot of downstream industry.</p>

dairy industry is still in desperate trouble, as the right hon. Member for West Derbyshire said. Farmers are still only getting about 18p a litre for milk, and that farm-gate price does not allow for any sort of profitability&#151;quite the reverse. It means that farmers are making a loss on the raw material that they produce. If primary producers are making a loss, that is not sustainable. Dairy farmers are going out of business every week because they conclude, rightly, that there is little point in continuing a business that is very hard work&#151;when they can otherwise realise their often substantial capital assets&#151;if they are making a loss.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o170"><a name="70329-0010.htm_para16"><a name="07032955000448">Effectively, there is a classic oligopoly on the buying side: the big supermarkets take 50 per cent. of the liquid milk in the country, apply a limit to the amount that they are prepared to pay, maintain high profitability in the supermarket through the retail price of milk, but do not pass that on to the primary producers, who are in a much weaker bargaining position. I hate to be apocalyptic, but until we address that, it will be hard for dairy farming in this country to have a future. We are exporting the industry abroad. Once dairy farms are lost, they will not be reconstituted.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o171"><a name="70329-0010.htm_para17"><a name="07032955000449">That does not just mean the loss of liquid milk production, but of all the higher-value dairy products. I am proud that my constituency makes some of the finest cheese in the world&#151;I do not dispute that other good cheeses are made around the country, but that is a fact. Why would this country want to run down one of our most effective, efficient and best industries and export it abroad? That, however, is happening.</p>

 I agree with the hon. Gentleman&#146;s comments. To carry on with the coincidences relating to his and my constituency, the king of cheeses, Stilton, is made in Hartington in my constituency. Farmers are disturbed that while they are getting 18p a litre for milk, it is being retailed at 52p. Where is that difference going?</p>

 The right hon. Gentleman is absolutely right. I will not get into a quarrel with him on the relative merits of Stilton and Cheddar&#151;they are both very good, and we can enjoy them. As he says, it is not the primary producers who are making the profit.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o172"><a name="70329-0010.htm_para18"><a name="07032955000452">Even the supermarkets have not thought the situation through. I have never been convinced that consumers buy milk on the basis of price when confronted with a supermarket shelf of milk. They buy a volume of milk and they pay the price. Therefore, if supermarkets must maintain their current profit level&#151;we all know the great profits that they are capable of making&#151;it would be sustainable for them to do so by increasing the retail price of milk. There are some small signs that that is beginning to happen, at least from the assurances given by supermarkets. However, we have had those assurances before, and they have not been sustained. I am afraid to say that I do not believe that that will be achieved by voluntary arrangement. At the end of the day, there will have to be Government intervention in what is effectively a false market in milk. That is why everyone is waiting with bated breath for the outcome of the Competition Commission report, although I am not entirely optimistic about that. We saw what it did last time  <br>

when, as the Monopolies and Mergers Commission, it examined vertical integration in milk in the context of Milk Marque. We saw then what it said aboutthe relationship between the producer and the supermarkets. If we ask the wrong questions, we get the wrong answers. The fact that it is saying that it does not have evidence of a distorted market when the distorted market is there for anyone to see in the price of milk, does not fill me with confidence.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o173"><a name="70329-0010.htm_para19"><a name="07032955000453">Nevertheless, we will have to go beyond a voluntary code of conduct into something that is on a firmer basis if we are ever to see the rescue of the dairy industry. Some people would be happy for the dairy industry to contract and, in their eyes, be made more efficient by the 1,000-header herds owned by an agricultural conglomerate, but the traditional dairy farm run by a family is the building block of British agriculture. It is what is best for this country in terms of both produce and our environment. I want it to be maintained.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o174"><a name="70329-0010.htm_para20"><a name="07032955000455">The second issue in farming is the ongoing problem with Mycobacterium bovis&#151;tuberculosis&#151;in cattle. The Government are ducking the problem. They have consulted, and the consultation has finished, but they are still not prepared to come to a decision. I know it is a difficult decision to make. It will be very unpopular&#151;almost any decision that they are going to take will be unpopular. However, we cannot have a continuing growth of the spread of TB among the bovine and badger populations. The welfare of cattle is important; the welfare of badgers and other wild species that carry the bacterium is important. We need swift decisions on what is to be done. How do we attack the reservoir of infection effectively? We must also deal with the corollary issue&#151;the profitability of farms. It is devastating when a herd tests positive for TB. It is even more devastating if the recompense&#151;the table valuations&#151;does not recognise the actual value of the stock that is culled. That needs addressing.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o175"><a name="70329-0010.htm_para21"><a name="07032955000456">There are also opportunities in agriculture. Climate change should provide a massive opportunity for diversification into new crops and new ways of doing business, yet I do not see any joined-up thinking between those who are involved with agriculture, with the environment and with trade and industry, in particular those who have the energy brief. I see no evidence that they understand how those are linked and how we can open up new opportunities for agriculture.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman is right. That happens. Farmhouses&#151;detached substantial buildings in the countryside with nice views&#151;are sold off as houses without land. There is an increase in horsey-culture. There is nothing wrong with horses, but the more prime agricultural land that is sold as pony paddock, the less there is available for farming. It worries me that if agribusiness takes over all the land, it will be run entirely on a balance sheet rather than with any consideration for the land and the communities on that land.

In addition, we have duplication of inspection. There is the view that the man from the Ministry is always around the corner, trying to find fault with what the farmer is trying to do. It is a one-way street: the farmer makes one mistake and he loses out; the Department can make any number of mistakes and they are rectified in the next month. We need ways to allow organisations to share information so that we do not have duplication. We need more straightforward implementation of regulation and far less paperwork.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o178"><a name="70329-0010.htm_para24"><a name="07032955000461">Regulation is important. We know that from the experiences of the epidemics of bovine spongiform encephalopathy and foot and mouth. However, it must be done in a way that is constructive and supportive of the industry. It should not be put in place in ways that appear to make things difficult.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o179"><a name="70329-0010.htm_para25"><a name="07032955000462">We need clear labelling. It is one of the long-standing problems in this country that people cannot identify good British food produced by good British producers from the labels, which are often grossly deceptive in terms of foodstuffs that are produced abroad, repackaged in this country and sold as British produce. That cannot be right.</p>

To meet its budgetary requirements, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs has cut back massively in the veterinary science organisations for which it is responsible, which could have a disastrous effect. However, my last point is about the Rural Payments Agency. We cannot ignore what the Select Committee on Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said today about the RPA.

<p><a name="stpa_o184"><a name="70329-0010.htm_para30"><a name="07032955000467">The RPA has been a disaster for the Government, but even more of a disaster for those working in agriculture who have found themselves in extraordinary difficulty because of the failure to deliver what is rightfully theirs in terms of payments over such long periods.

That does not happen. It is left to individual Members to secure Adjournment debates. I have initiated two such debates on the dairy industry in recent years, but debates are not held in Government time, although the issue affects huge swathes of our country and our countryside and, without such debates, goes unremarked.</p>

increasing pressure from numerous directions, not least as a result of the council tax. But today I shall focus on what is becoming another real financial burden, which we have borne for a long time but for which there seems to be no relief. I refer to the charges imposed by South West Water.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o190"><a name="70329-0011.htm_para1"><a name="07032955000474">The peninsula of the south-west features a third of the nation&#146;s beaches that have had to be cleaned and brought up to standard. Those of us who live in the south-west fully understand the requirement to do something about the old Victorian sewerage system, because the way in which sewage was being discharged into the sea was clearly a serious health hazard. A great deal of money has been invested in raising the standard of those discharges to an acceptable level, at a cost to those of us in the south-west who pay water charges, particularly those on lower incomes or in retirement.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o191"><a name="70329-0011.htm_para2"><a name="07032955000475">In the coming financial year, water charges will rise by 12.5 per cent. for those with meters and by 16 per cent. for the rest of the population. That is a massive hike. I know from my postbag and from discussions with those who seek to represent water charge payers how disappointed people are that neither the regulator nor those officially appointed to speak for the water charge payer have been able to use their influence to ensure that the prices are brought under control. As we know, many people on low incomes qualify for tapered council tax relief. I feel we must now consider a similar arrangement for water charges, because I cannot see the present position improving.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o192"><a name="70329-0011.htm_para3"><a name="07032955000476">On 21 March I met the new chief executive of South West Water to discuss the issue with him. Sympathetic as he was, it was clear to me that there was little he could do about it, for two reasons. First, South West Water faces the &#147;clean sweep&#148; programme. Ours is a tourist area, and we want clean beaches. We want to be able to say to the holidaymaker &#147;Come and bathe in the water&#151;it is all very clean&#148;. Many people come to the south-west to surf. It must be said, however, that although it is not my pensioner constituents who are out on their surf boards on Saturdays&#151;not too many of them, anyway&#151;it is they who are paying for the surfing.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o193"><a name="70329-0011.htm_para4"><a name="07032955000477">Secondly, the chief executive told me that South West Water faces a five-year programme to refurbish a third of the drinking water mains. Just as one programme starts to tail off and we think there might be a bit of relief in the future, another comes along. The reason for this particular clean-up is a mystery to me. When I go into supermarkets I see people loading bottled water into their trolleys. They stagger under the weight: they can hardly carry the load. We seem to have become a nation that drinks only bottled water, although we have invested enormous amounts in improving the quality and safety of the drinking water that comes out of the tap. For some extraordinary reason people feel that they must buy bottled water, yet regulation upon regulation comes down from on high requiring South West Water to spend more and more on cleaning up the drinking water mains.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o194"><a name="70329-0011.htm_para5"><a name="07032955000478">There is a serious point that I want the Deputy Leader of the House to convey to his colleagues. Most of the regulations dealing with the costs applying to South West Water originate from Europe. I should like the Deputy Leader of the House to do two things. First, I should like him to ask whether we really need  <br>

higher and higher quality. There needs to be a standard&#151;we should all feel relatively certain that drinking water is safe and clean&#151;but how far does it have to go? Why, when standards are higher than they have ever been, must we face a five-year programme?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o195"><a name="70329-0011.htm_para6"><a name="07032955000479">I understand that the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs has launched a consultation process. The privatised water companies are having to consider taking on financial responsibility for all the unadopted sewers in the country, of which we have a great many in the west country. Who will pay for that? It looks like even more expenditure for the water rate payer in the south-west, and when that is added to the other costs that I have identified, it becomes unbearable and unacceptable.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o196"><a name="70329-0011.htm_para7"><a name="07032955000480">We have engaged in many cross-party debates about the issue, and there is complete consensus among the parties in the south-west about the unfair burden that is being imposed on water rate payers. We have also had many debates in the Chamber. Now is the time for the Government to do something. I believe that without Government intervention of some kind and some mitigation of the problem, at least for those on lower incomes, there will be a huge impact not only on people&#146;s quality of life but on their incomes.</p>

things with big holes in them; nothing produced in this country, I can assure the hon. Gentleman. Bottled water is another of those continental habits that we have adopted, when we could simply turn on the tap to get a glass of safe, high-quality water for which we have paid an enormous amount.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o198"><a name="70329-0011.htm_para9"><a name="07032955000488">On that very subject, I come to the issue of how small businesses pay their water rates. The chairman of Tiverton chamber of commerce Mr. David Westwood wrote to me to say:</p>
<a name="70329-0011.htm_brev0"><a name="07032955000489"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Our own offices in Tiverton share our office building with other businesses. The Ground Floor and the first floor are paying in excess of &#163;3,000 a year in water rates. It is more extraordinary that the ground floor has no inlet or outlet water supply. The previous tenants...may also have paid unnecessary rates.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o199"><a name="70329-0011.htm_para10"><a name="07032955000490">I had not realised, but it transpires that business rates are assessed based on the old rateable value, whether or not there is a water supply. Of course there will be a communal washroom that is shared with other businesses, so at some point there is a mains inlet and a shared waste disposal system. But that has no relevance to the amount of rates that different businesses in the same building might pay, purely because there are differentials in their traditional rateable values.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o200"><a name="70329-0011.htm_para11"><a name="07032955000491">This is grossly unfair. Nobody minds paying for the service; if those mainly small businesses share the services that the water company provides, nobody is suggesting that they do not pay. However, this is a licence to print money on the part of the water company. The chamber of commerce has taken the matter up. Water companies have confirmed that the Government have allowed all water companies to continue raising charges based on rateable increases. So every year when the rates go up, businesses pay more and more for their water, irrespective of the number of people in the office; it may be a sole occupancy or they may be only a couple of people. However, they will pay an increasing charge for a restricted service.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o201"><a name="70329-0011.htm_para12"><a name="07032955000492">In the example given to me, a bill charging &#163;549.91 was calculated by multiplying the rateable value by &#163;99.12 for water and &#163;223.58 for sewerage despite the fact that in the office concerned there is no water or sewerage service. I know that the Minister will write to his ministerial colleagues about my concern about the domestic ratepayers. Will he also pick up on this matter? Small businesses are under pressure.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o202"><a name="70329-0011.htm_para13"><a name="07032955000493">The Budget&#146;s changes in the burden on small businesses as a result of the rise in the small companies&#146; rate from 20 per cent. to 22 per cent. will mean that the Treasury brings in &#163;820 million of additional revenue. If the Chancellor is looking for a way to bring some relief to those small businesses that are paying excessive amounts for water services because of the formula, that would be a good place to start.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o203"><a name="70329-0011.htm_para14"><a name="07032955000494">I come now to another small business case, in which I will refer to a constituent as Mr. E. The case could go into the legal domain; in fact, that is now being seriously considered. I do not want in any way to prejudice a case that may at some point be considered in a court. The case concerns the way in which HMRC has interpreted the Taxation of Chargeable GainsAct 1992. Mr. E and his wife ran a shop in the high street of one of my market towns for many years as a family business. They lived above the shop in a flat. On his retirement three years ago, he disposed of the shop  <br>

and the flat at the same time. His accountant prepared the final accounts for the Revenue, and they were agreed and paid.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o204"><a name="70329-0011.htm_para15"><a name="07032955000495">Two years later, the Revenue revisited those accounts and decided to challenge the apportionment of capital gains tax that Mr. E had paid and that the Revenue had agreed on the disposal. The reason was that although the flat was his prime home, and had been for 20 years, because he had disposed of the shop and the flat at the same time on retirement, the Revenue regarded that as a single asset. In looking at it as such, the Revenue argued that although he was of course able to offset the CGT liability on the flat&#151;none of us has CGT liability on our prime residence&#151;the taper relief that would have applied to the disposal of the business premises was affected. Therefore, the higher rate of CGT was applied to the business disposal, rather than the tapered relief that had previously been calculated. Without wanting to disclose too much about my constituent's personal details, the differential was in excess of &#163;30,000 liability.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o205"><a name="70329-0011.htm_para16"><a name="07032955000496">I have had correspondence with my constituent, his accountant and Treasury Ministers on the matter. I am astonished that the Revenue should be interpreting the Taxation of Chargeable Gains Act in that way. It is quite clear that, for all other purposes of taxation, when a person lives above a shop in that way, the two items&#151;the flat and the shop&#151;are treated separately for taxation. They are separate assets for council tax and business rates purposes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o206"><a name="70329-0011.htm_para17"><a name="07032955000497">The question has been put to me: was that what Parliament intended at the time? I have done research into the case and I am absolutely sure that it was not what Parliament intended at the time.</p>

</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o208"><a name="70329-0011.htm_para19"><a name="07032955000499">That is pretty clear. It is a domestic flat with its own entrance and a garden at the back. She goes on:</p>

</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o210"><a name="70329-0011.htm_para21"><a name="07032955000501">Mr. Deputy Speaker, if you owned a shop but had a domestic dwelling somewhere else, or if you let out the flat over the shop as a business proposition, the measure would not apply. As we all understand, different tax rules would then apply.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o211"><a name="70329-0011.htm_para22"><a name="07032955000502">We are getting very close to this being a test case. I and small business organisations will be assisting my constituent to pursue the matter as far as he needs to pursue it to get the right result. There are big implications throughout the country for every shopkeeper who lives above the shop and has an anticipation of what the tax liability may be.</p>

Members&#151;we are, after all, the legislators&#151;look at the detail of the case, as I did, I am sure that they will agree that that is not what Parliament intended when that legislation came on to the statute book.

Member on26 March. I note that we are now into double figures with parliamentarians who had their birthday on Monday. In addition, when I entered the House, my Christian name, David, was unusual, but now it seems, certainly in the Conservative party, that it is a requirement if one is to be successful.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o216"><a name="70329-0011.htm_para27"><a name="07032955000508">Is it really six years since the Deputy Leader of the House occupied that position? As he can see, I am still here. His predecessor, the hon. Member for Edinburgh, South (Nigel Griffiths), did a splendid job. The whole House respects and understands his decision to resign from the Government, but, like my hon. Friend the Member for Tiverton and Honiton (Angela Browning) and my right hon. Friend the Member for West Derbyshire (Mr. McLoughlin), we all welcome back the hon. Member for Sherwood (Paddy Tipping). When we were a little more pressed than we appear to be this afternoon to cover all the subjects, he diligently used to write to us to give us some real responses to the issues that we raised. May I gently say to him, and through him to his officials, that they need not faint at the number of issues that I intend to raise today. I will raise them quickly and perhaps in due course he could write to me about them.</p>

Last night, there was an historic dinner and the Palace of Westminster Lions club was formed. It is the first parliamentary Lions club to be formed in the northern hemisphere. We have 22 members so far, and Mr. Speaker will be given an illuminated address. I hope that other colleagues will join, and we intend to have a charity event.</p>

Every Wednesday, the Prime Minister has to give sympathy to the relatives of loved ones.

The last thing anyone in our country wants is to be involved in a war with Iran, but we are in a terrible situation. I say gently that the British Government&#146;s policy of appeasement has got us into a bit of a mess; sadly, the Government&#146;s current opinion of the President of Iran is not the same as it was a few years ago. It is a disgrace that the POMI&#151;the People&#146;s Mujaheddin Organisation of Iran&#151;is still a proscribed organisation, despite what has been decided in Europe. I hope that the Deputy Leader of the House reflects on that matter and responds on it.</p>

 Does my hon.

I remember being present in the House when Conservative Chancellors, perhaps thinking that they were being rather clever, produced Budget flourishes. When the current Chancellor came out with the big wheeze at the end of his speech that 2p would be knocked off income tax&#151;despite always saying, &#147;We would never bribe the electorate with tax cuts&#148;&#151;I was not looking at Members of my party, but at the Labour Benches. Labour Members were cock-a-hoop; they were thrilled to bits and were waving their Order Papers. They had probably been a little nervous because the opinion polls had not been good, but yesterday&#146;s opinion polls appear to offer encouragement to the Government&#146;s supporters. However, the Chancellor&#151;who is soon to be Prime Minister&#151;will regret that Budget. I shall be the first to say that, just as the current Prime Minister&#146;s nemesis has been the war with Iraq, this Budget will be the downfall of the next Prime Minister.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o221"><a name="70329-0012.htm_para0"><a name="07032955000517">I want to raise the issue of east coast fishermen&#151;the Deputy Leader of the House has some expertise in this area&#151;which my hon. Friend the Member for Castle Point (Bob Spink) will also doubtless hope to catch your eye in order to discuss, Madam Deputy Speaker. I attended a meeting on Monday with the Minister for Local Environment, Marine and Animal Welfare, and as ever he was very courteous. He was asked a number of tough questions about what the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs is doing to rectify the situation and to save the UK&#146;s inshore fleet from ruin. Having reflected on that meeting, I am not sure that we were satisfied by the answers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o222"><a name="70329-0012.htm_para1"><a name="07032955000518">The southern North sea inshore fishermen&#146;s association and the Kent and Essex sea fisheries committee are battling against ill-thought out regulations produced, in the name of conservation, by DEFRA and the European Fisheries Council that have brought the UK inshore fishing industry to near collapse. This year, the EFC introduced by-catch limits of 25 per cent. on skates and rays. That quota is far too restrictive on individual catches and means that small-scale fishermen such as those in Leigh-on-Sea are legally allowed to land only a couple of those fish per day, which is hardly enough to make a living. The Minister put a different spin on matters, but I believe that there was no consultation whatever on the regulations. Many fishermen continued to fish illegally for six weeks, without even realising that they were doing so.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o223"><a name="70329-0012.htm_para2"><a name="07032955000519">I welcome the recent DEFRA initiative whereby we exchange some of the British quota of North sea nephrops for German North sea sole, but what a crazy way to do business&#151;swapping to try to deal with what turned out to be a crisis! It was also brought to my attention that it is not just the imposition of quotas per se&#151;for example, 14 different species of skates and rays are classified as one group, ignoring the fact that each species is more abundant in some areas than in others&#151;that is threatening our inshore fleet. Current fishing regulations treat radically different fishing techniques in the same way, which is very unfair. For example, long-lining is subject to the same regulations as beam-trawling. I ask the Deputy Leader of the House to have a word with his colleagues and I urge the Government to press the EFC for a quota management review as soon as possible. I apologise to my hon. Friend the Member for Castle Point if I have completely ruined his speech. This latest saga is yet another example of how important it is that the UK be properly represented at meetings. It is an absolute disgrace that these quotas were ever agreed to in the first place.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o224"><a name="70329-0012.htm_para3"><a name="07032955000520">I want to take this opportunity to congratulate Southend United community and educational trust. Last year, I congratulated Southend United on their imminent promotion to the championship, and this year is the 15th anniversary of their magnificent community programme. They have organised after-schools coaching, holiday soccer weeks and recreational activities for senior citizens, and received all manner of awards, locally, regionally and nationally. I thought this a good opportunity to praise a football team. The team have actively engaged in the debate on obesity, encouraging children to take part in increased levels of physical activity. They specialise in girls-only  <br>

coaching&#151;that will doubtless meet with the favour of my hon. Friend the Member for Tiverton and Honiton (Angela Browning)&#151;and they have organised body care and healthy living programmes that give children a better understanding of how to keep their bodies healthy. They have also introduced programmes such as &#147;getting on with the blues&#148;&#151;actually, that is not a bad slogan for my party&#151;and they target antisocial behaviour and support activities that assist local charities and voluntary groups. So Southend United are doing a splendid job, and I am quietly confident that we will retain our place in the championship.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o225"><a name="70329-0012.htm_para4"><a name="07032955000521">I do not remember, Madam Deputy Speaker, whether you were in the Chair during the Christmas Adjournment debate, but I mentioned that the centenarians in Southend had set a world record. I am delighted to tell the House that this week that was formally recognised by &#147;Guinness World Records&#148; and I received a certificate on behalf of the centenarians. They participated in the largest ever gathering of centenarians. The previous record was 21 and we have now pushed that up to 23. The way that things are going in Southend, I am confident that we will be able to beat that record later this year. People are living much longer. In 1850, for example, people lived to 40 on average, but now it is no longer surprising to knock on a door&#151;as we will all be doing in the local elections&#151;and have it answered by a person of 90, 95 or even 100 years.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o226"><a name="70329-0012.htm_para5"><a name="07032955000522">We should have more investment in several areas to ensure that the sight, hearing, mobility and general health of elderly people is maintained. That is why I am delighted that my party is leading the way in the national debate on the quality of life. If the Government accepted that agenda, it would reduce the demand on care services. For instance, age-related macular degeneration is the most common cause of blindness and visual impairment in the UK. However, early diagnosis and prompt treatment can prevent the rapid loss of vision.</p>

Despite the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence approving anti-tumour necrosis factor-alpha therapy for rheumatoid arthritis in 2002, many primary care trusts refuse to fund its use adequately or they put a cap on the numbers of patients that can be treated. I hope that the Deputy Leader of the House will pass that message on to the Health Secretary.</p>

There is a high proportion of elderly people in our coastal resorts; I have already mentioned the number of centenarians  <br>

living in Leigh. I hope that the Government will adopt a national approach to promote and support seaside tourism. Like many other hon. Members, I supported the national tourism week at the beginning of March and I was pleased to learn that the photograph that we submitted from Leigh-on-Sea was in pride of place at the exhibition in Regent&#146;s street. Tourism brings in &#163;85 billion to the UK, so it would be in all our interests to adopt a national coastal tourism strategy, similar to that in Wales.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o229"><a name="70329-0012.htm_para8"><a name="07032955000525">I recently visited Princes Avenue school and was greeted by the excellent head teacher, Mrs. Sandy Fletcher, who sadly retires today, and her deputy, Miss Judy Kaufman. They drew my attention to a survey of 5,863 people, which found that 38 per cent. of parents had taken their children on holiday in term time. All hon. Members realise that that happens because families can save &#163;500 on the cost of holidays, but it disrupts schooling. More and more people are doing it, and the Government recognise that. The Association of British Travel Agents comes out with a lot of codswallop about responding to market forces, but I would like to see a little responsibility being exercised. The National Association of Schoolmasters Union of Women Teachers blames parents. I am not brave enough to blame parents, but there must be a way round this&#151;I will not call it a third way&#151;and I hope that we can find a solution.</p>

Despite having no knowledge of how to make a film, a team of 11 young people decided to raise awareness of the dangers of substance abuse after learning about the subject. They raised &#163;800 to make the film by themselves. It has been shown on national television and used by Essex police. Is not that a good reason to celebrate the excellent work of our young people?</p>

We do not have enough buses in Southend, particularly for our elderly people. Why not? It is because 20,000 people were left off the national census in Southend, and so we have no funding for 20,000 people. I hope that a bus company that does not need a subsidy will come forward to provide extra services and that some generous individual or company might come forward with some money to subsidise those services.</p>

I spoke on Third Reading of the Protection of BadgersAct 1992, which made badgers a protected species. I regret none of that but, 20 years on, I must confess that I had no idea of the impact of that legislation. To move badgers humanely from gardens is an issue. They are into the foundations, garages are collapsing and people cannot go into their back gardens&#151;and I am not exaggerating.

 It is always a pleasure to follow my hon. Friend the Member for Southend, West (Mr. Amess), who raised some important points. I believe that my constituency has the largest urban badger population in the country. I am delighted that some of them are going on holiday to Leigh-on-Sea, and I wish them well. I have about seven badgers and their young in my garden. I enjoy that; I feed them and watch them, and people come to my house to see them. They are beautiful, wonderful animals, but we must make sure that humans have rights, too. We must get the balance right. It is in the badgers&#146; best interests that we move them as quickly as possible when there is a conflict in an urban environment, as there often is in my constituency. There are plenty of places to which we could move the badgers where they would be much better off. That would be better than allowing that conflict to get out of hand; I assure hon.

The Health and Safety Executive highlighted the project&#146;s potential lack of safety and Calor&#146;s application was rejected. Calor has appealed, so the matter is before Ministers. I have raised the issue in the House on several occasions, and I have obtained an undertaking from Ministers that a public inquiry will be held.

<p><a name="stpa_o238"><a name="70329-0012.htm_para17"><a name="07032955000535">As I say, it was a very professional referendum, with sealed containers. People could vote, in private, however they wanted&#151;either for against. The turnout was 68 per cent. of the total voting population of Canvey Island. That is much more than twice the amount who would vote in any local government election, which shows that the issue has gripped people. The result was even more remarkable: of those who voted, 99.6 per cent. voted against the LNG plant. Two of the people who voted for it filled in their referendum forms with me. They were operators at the plant, and they apologised to me for how they were casting their private vote. Of course, they had no need to tell me how they voted. The result certainly cannot be challenged; it has great credibility, and it cannot be ignored.</p>

I have absolute confidence in his judgment and his great courtesy in dealing with good, local people, who will represent themselves, while the big business will, of course, employ expensive barristers and professionals to represent it.

The hon. Member for Cleethorpes (Shona McIsaac), who is present on the Labour Benches, has one in her constituency, too. In the USA, such sites have a 6-mile residential homes exclusion area around them if they involve LNG. They provide that exclusion area for good reason. The incidents in Port Hudson and Cleveland, Ohio, show just what can happen when an uncontrolled vapour cloud detonation takes place. That is a risk with which Canvey and Castle Point people would have to live, and there is no six-mile limit, as is mandatory in the United States&#151;not even a one-mile safety zone&#151;for Canvey people.

The Health and Safety Executive and the fire service have confirmed that there is no way of controlling such a spill. Indeed, I am having another meeting next Monday morning with the local fire service. At atmospheric pressure, LNG would vaporise and form a massive, growing cloud that would float and blow around in the wind, combining with air to form an unstable and highly combustible mixture. On ignition, it would explode and flash into a high-temperature fire that would destroy everything in its path. Ignition could take place simply if a car passed through the area or if someone flicked a light switch within it. The direction of such a cloud would be indeterminate beforehand, and the effects on homes and schools would be indiscriminate. Unlike at Buncefield, where  <br>

the emergency services could use foam to control and contain the fire because it was fuel oil-based, not LNG-based, there is no effective firefighting strategy for an LNG incident. It would be a question of watching and following the fire, and clearing up the carnage afterwards.</p>

This is not just a Canvey Island problem&#151;it is a south Essex issue. There are many other causes for objection. The terrorist threat is significant, although I will not go into it too deeply. The main threat, however, is from an accident. Flixborough and Buncefield were thought to be totally safe the night before they went up. We know what happened there.

The inspector therefore has no formal standards against which to measure the application that he is considering. I urge the inspector, therefore, to disallow the appeal on that point alone. However, there are many other reasons to reject it, including the dire implications of flood risk for the site, and the difficulty of building the massive tanks on stilts. My hon. Friend the Member for Southend, West smiles, but that is a requirement for new build on Canvey Island, which is in the flood plain and, in some places, is 6 or 8 ft below sea level.</p>

Just for the record, the plant would confer very little local benefit on my constituents&#151;not that that is a big issue, because there is a national need. However, there are many other effective sites for the importation of LNG that do not give rise to conflicts with other interests and that are not sited close to homes and, in particular, schools. Let there be no mistake: the application is not about national need but about corporate profits. There is nothing wrong with that, but I told Calor and Centrica at the outset that if there was a safety issue&#151;if safety was compromised in their application&#151;I would fight them tooth and nail. Safety is compromised, so I will fight them with every ounce of effort to stop that ill-conceived project.</p>

guaranteed without the risk of an incident&#151;it cannot be made fail-safe or totally safe. The Environment Agency has also confirmed that there are serious flooding risks on the site, which is another reason to reject it. There is no separation of homes and schools from the plant; there is no COMAH safe siting policy against which the inspector can measure the application and make a judgment; and there are more appropriate sites to meet the national need and the national interest. The inspector will consider all those matters very carefully. I say, with due respect to the inspector&#146;s independence in making the decision, that I hope that the proposal is rejected.</p>

Parts of the island, such as the Calor site, lie below sea level protected by sea walls, sea gates and, in some areas, simple earth banks.

The Thames barrier was closed, pushing water back up the Thames towards Canvey Island, but Canvey&#146;s defences were not activated. The result was predictable&#151;Canvey suffered flooding and damage yet again. The <i> Echo </i>report stated:</p>

In the Christmas Adjournment debate, I argued that in many fields, such as hepatitis C and coronary heart disease, the NHS should make sensible preventive investments. If it were to do so, the pay-off would be enormous in terms not only of improved health and quality of life, but of cash returns for the Treasury. The Chancellor, who prides himself on prudence, should not miss such an obvious mechanism to maximise the output from the extra &#163;8 billion that he plans to put into the NHS in 2007-08, which I welcome and on which I sincerely congratulate him. However, what matters to patients&#151;our constituents&#151;is output, not input.

The Berlin declaration&#151;a Trojan horse for the EU constitution&#151;has provoked widespread criticism, including from my hon. Friend the Member for Peterborough (Mr. Jackson), who is sitting next to me. One reason for that criticism is the unilateral procedure used by the German Chancellor. The declaration was discussed in secret with EU member states. The Czech Republic envoy explained that the consultation consisted only of a single bilateral phone conversation with the German authorities, followed up with an e-mail giving the declaration&#146;s very scant content. Neither national Parliaments nor the European Parliament had sight of the wording.</p>

The contributions were sparkling, informative, heartfelt and moving, especially those of the hon. Members for Hackney, North and Stoke Newington (Ms Abbott) and for Brent, South (Ms Butler).

Suffice it to say, however, that Peterborough has one of the newest prisons in the country. The former Home Secretary once famously said that if no other prison were built in England, one would be built in Peterborough. It is a state-of-the-art prison, and its director general, Mike Conway, is doing an excellent job. It is a prison for male and female prisoners, with 840 beds on the same site. One might not think that it was doing such a good job, however. As a result of the Home Office&#146;s mismanagement of the methodology and of the data management system at the prison, it is unable to tell us how well the prison is doing because the computer system cannot cope with having a male prison and a female prison on the same site. The system therefore defaults the performance indicators to place Peterborough prison almost at the bottom of the 130-odd prisons in England and Wales.

That view approaches a cultural disdain for the idea that we, as a civilised society, should send people to prison. I could not disagree with that view more strongly. Prisons are not necessarily bad. The entrenched consensus in the Home Office, and no doubt in its successor bodies, is wrong. Prisons can be made to work. I commend to the House the book, &#147;A Land Fit for Criminals&#148;, published last year, and written by David Fraser, who draws particular attention to what he calls the criminal justice elite.</p>

Prisoners have been kept in police cells&#151;Operation Safeguard only concluded at the end of December&#151;and prison numbers reached 79,627 by Christmas. I welcome the Government&#146;s decision to build two more prisons&#151;one in the Woolwich area near Belmarsh prison, and the other on Merseyside&#151;and to bring on-stream a further 8,000 prison places over the next five years.

within the context of a short-sighted decision by the Treasury to cut or at least freeze real terms funding for the Home Office over the next few years, which I regret. </p>

<p><a name="stpa_o284"><a name="70329-0013.htm_para31"><a name="07032955000584">The criminal justice proposals, as articulated by the Prime Minister, are a swansong crime review. As my right hon. Friend the Member for Haltemprice and Howden (David Davis) has astutely put it, they are an admission of failure. He says:</p>
<a name="70329-0013.htm_brev7"><a name="07032955000809"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;In any event, even the sensible proposals in this document are fatally undermined by the Government&#146;s failure to provide the necessary prison places to make them work. In fact, this document barely mentions the crisis in our prisons.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o285"><a name="70329-0013.htm_para32"><a name="07032955000585">My hon. Friend the Member for Shipley comprehensively demolished the myths surrounding prison, crime reduction and recidivism. The most potent of those myths is that we &#147;lock too many people up&#148;, and that compared with other European countries too many people are in prison and we should focus on non-custodial sentences, which are better. I completely disagree with that because it is not good enough simply to look at prison numbers; we must also look at those compared with the rate of crime committed. That measurement, rather than just the prison population, compared with the level of recorded crime shows that the proportion of the number of people we put in prison is almost the lowest in the western world. The rate in the United States is high, at 166 prisoners per 1,000 crimes. We incarcerate just 13 prisoners per 1,000 crimes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o286"><a name="70329-0013.htm_para33"><a name="07032955000586">The other myth is that prison does not work in terms of recidivism rates. That is true: 75 per cent. of tagged young offenders are reconvicted within 12 months and a study in 2003 showed that 61 per cent. of prisoners jailed in 2001 had reoffended within a year of release. Surely, though, we should be looking at the likelihood of being incarcerated as a key determinant of whether someone commits a crime. Evidence in the United States shows a causal link between the fact that it has the highest per capita number of prisoners but the lowest crime rate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o287"><a name="70329-0013.htm_para34"><a name="07032955000587">A comparative study of crime rates between 1981 and 1996 by Professor David Farrington of Cambridge university demonstrated that as the risk of being imprisoned increased, crime fell. That was in the United States, but during the same period in England and Wales the crime rate increased as the likelihood of being incarcerated reduced. We currently have the highest rate of crime in burglary, assault, robbery, motor vehicle theft and rape than in the United States. Its rate is only higher in murder.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o288"><a name="70329-0013.htm_para35"><a name="07032955000588">It is a matter of public record that my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Folkestone and Hythe (Mr. Howard) reduced crime in the period after 1995 by taking a tough line and challenging the liberal orthodoxy then prevalent in the Home Office. I have to say that that reduction continued until 2003, and rose thereafter.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o289"><a name="70329-0013.htm_para36"><a name="07032955000589">There is empirical evidence that if we put more police on the beat&#151;if we recruit and train more police and put them on to the operational front line&#151;we will also reduce crime. The number of police officers per capita in the United States, which is tracked by the FBI and reported annually, increased by 60,000 officers, or roughly 14 per cent., in the 1990s. Between 1991 and 2001, that accounted for a 10 to 20 per cent. decline in overall crime in that period.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o290"><a name="70329-0014.htm_para0"><a name="07032955000590">We all have local anecdotes on the effectiveness of policing. I visited the headquarters of the northern division of the Cambridgeshire constabulary a number of months ago and met Chief Superintendent Paul Phillipson at Thorpe Wood in Peterborough. He showed me mugshots of the 22 most prolific and persistent offenders in the city, and estimated that crime would be reduced by perhaps as much as 50 per cent. if they could be permanently excluded from the community. We need to think hard about that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o291"><a name="70329-0014.htm_para1"><a name="07032955000591">Overall statistical evidence from the United States shows a disincentive to commit crime if the likelihood of going to prison increases. There is surely a strong economic argument for more prison places. In 2004, the cost of keeping the average prisoner on the prison estate was &#163;27,320 per year. Today it costs us &#163;2.7 billion to maintain 139 prisons, but crime costs us &#163;60,000 million&#151;&#163;60 billion. That constitutes the entire school budget and two thirds of what we will spend on the national health service in 2008. We could spend just &#163;7 billion on doubling the number of prison places to 160,000&#151;which, incidentally, would amount to only 0.4 per cent. of the adult population. Surely such an opportunity cost is worthy of proper examination. Even by fiscal Conservatives such as me, prison can be seen as a bargain.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o292"><a name="70329-0014.htm_para2"><a name="07032955000592">And, of course, there are the human tragedies. We routinely ignore the many thousand parole board failures that lead to such tragedies, the terrible murder of the City banker John Monckton being the most obvious and infamous example. As any good economist will confirm, unless objectionable behaviour carries a demonstrable cost, that behaviour will not be altered, and will prevail.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o293"><a name="70329-0014.htm_para3"><a name="07032955000593">It cannot simply be said that prison does not work. It can be made to work. According to the Home Office report &#147;Re-offending of adults: results from the 2003 cohort&#148;, published in November 2006, the recidivism rate among those who had served at least four years in prison was 35 per cent., compared to 70 per cent. among those who were jailed for up to 12 months. We need to move from deterrence and incapacitation to rehabilitation. It is perfectly possible to believe in two complementary concepts: the concept that prison works, and the concept of necessary rehabilitation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o294"><a name="70329-0014.htm_para4"><a name="07032955000594">I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Shipley that it is offensive to my constituents and his that 1,500 prisoners have access to Sky television&#151;although I understand that the Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department, the hon. Member for Bradford, South (Mr. Sutcliffe) disagrees with that. It causes them anger and annoyance. That, however, does not mean that we should not focus on rehabilitation. It is not necessarily a question of being liberal, lily-livered and non-judgmental.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o295"><a name="70329-0014.htm_para5"><a name="07032955000595">I stand four-square behind my party&#146;s manifesto commitments of 2005&#151;scrapping the early-release scheme, mandatory minimum sentences and more prison places&#151;but we need to focus on drugs, on rehabilitation, and especially on education. Some facts are inescapable: for instance, 70 per cent. of female prisoners suffer from two or more mental disorders while 44 per cent. of male sentenced prisoners suffer from three or more, and the numbers are much higher  <br>

<p><a name="stpa_o296"><a name="70329-0014.htm_para6"><a name="07032955000596">We all know of the endemic effects of alcohol and narcotics abuse across the prison estate, as well as the unacceptable levels of bullying. Two thirds of prisoners are affected by those issues. As a civilised society and for the sake of our own financial well-being, we have a right and a duty to tackle them and to rehabilitate the individuals whom we choose to incarcerate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o297"><a name="70329-0014.htm_para7"><a name="07032955000597">Although rehabilitation is vital to reforming criminals and reducing the risk of offending, we must make a decision about spending. We must consider the opportunity cost. There have been some successful schemes in the United States, including the Key-Crest 12-month drug programme in Delaware. After three years, only 31 per cent. of those on the programme had reoffended, compared to 61 per cent. in a control group. In the United Kingdom, there are just 4,700 drug treatment programmes across the whole estate. Prison-based vocational training and employment is important, too. A study in the United States found that prisoners who had been on that programme had a35 per cent. less chance of re-offending than those who had not.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o298"><a name="70329-0014.htm_para8"><a name="07032955000598">A particularly innovative scheme is in Florida where prisoners are taught basic skills and manufacture goods such as optical instruments and car registration plates. They are paid a decent wage and given self-respect and hope for the future. Some of the money that comes from selling those goods is put back into the prison estate and to victim support schemes so that prisoners understand the consequences of their actions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o299"><a name="70329-0014.htm_para9"><a name="07032955000599">It is our duty and responsibility as parliamentarians to look at giving prisoners hope for the future when they have finished their sentences. It is perfectly possible to believe that we need to jail people longer to prevent crime and that people can be reformed and rehabilitated. I thank hon. Members for listening and I wish all Members, Officers of the House and members of staff a restful and productive Easter break. With that, I look forward to the next recess Adjournment debate.</p>

 I am delighted to be able to take part in the debate and to address this packed House of Commons. First, I congratulate my hon.

I have always found him to be helpful to Back Benchers and I am sure that he will take up all the issues that have been raised today with the appropriate Ministers.</p>

Cleethorpes conjures up the image of a wonderful British seaside resort, which it is, but, geographically, it is a very large constituency. On the Humber bank we have one of the highest concentrations of COMAH&#151;control of major accident hazards&#151;sites in the UK. Several years ago, there was an explosion at one of the oil refineries in the constituency, which impacted on neighbouring villages and towns. I was in my office in  <br>

<notus-date day="29" month="3" year="2007" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><b>29 Mar 2007 : Column 1705</b><br>
Immingham, about two to three miles from the refinery. When the explosion happened, the shock wave bent the glass in the window. I can appreciate the concerns of the constituents of the hon. Gentleman, who also mentioned Flixborough, which is near Scunthorpe. I believe that we have two full-time fire stations because of the number of COMAH sites&#151;refineries, power stations, inorganic chemical works and so on. I understand that given its size Immingham would not even warrant one part-time fire engine if it were not for the COMAH sites within the area. That always has to be looked at in relation to those hazardous developments.</p>

 The hon. Lady is starting her speech in an excellent fashion and I congratulate her. The problem for me is that the COMAH site on Canvey Island will be a liquefied natural gas site, not a petrochemical site. With LNG, it is much more difficult to fight the fire. In fact, it is impossible, because it vaporises and floats as a cloud in the air until it meets an ignition source. We cannot use foam, as we can on a petrochemical fire, as happened at Buncefield, for example. Essex firefighters went in and fought that fire and many of those firefighters were trained to protect my constituency.</p>

 I take the hon. Gentleman's point. There are many different types of COMAH sites around the country. On the Humber bank, many of the factories have in-house fire crews with specialist equipment. Given the number of COMAH sites within my constituency, I understand the great concern that his constituents have.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o301"><a name="70329-0014.htm_para11"><a name="07032955000604">The hon. Member for Southend, West (Mr. Amess) is perhaps an hon. Friend in relation to the subject that I am going to mention next, which is seaside towns. He mentioned the report that had been published. I wished to mention it, too. It details the poverty that can exist in seaside towns and the problems with infrastructure due to their remoteness. Those are serious issues to which the Government need to pay more attention. Those issues were covered by the hon. Gentleman, so I hope that my hon. Friend the Minister will address those points in his closing remarks.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o302"><a name="70329-0014.htm_para12"><a name="07032955000605">Like the hon. Member for Southend, West and others, in previous Adjournment debates in the House, I have raised many issues. I recall standing here mentioning the subject of East Ravendale school in the Lincolnshire wolds in the constituency, and the fact that it still had outside toilets and other problems. I spoke in the House about getting funding to build a new school. I am happy to report that the new school building is under way. The children are in their temporary classrooms and are looking forward to going into their new school as soon as possible.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o304"><a name="70329-0014.htm_para14"><a name="07032955000607">I have mentioned the resurfacing of the A180, one of the noisiest roads in Britain. I know that other Members here would probably claim that their roads are noisier. In our trunk road network, we have an awful lot of noisy concrete-surface roads, which are causing disturbance and annoyance. Some of the A180 was resurfaced, but the programme has stalled, so many of my constituents are still disturbed by the level of noise from the road.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o305"><a name="70329-0014.htm_para15"><a name="07032955000608">I urge my hon. Friend the Deputy Leader of the House to put pressure on the appropriate Ministers to complete the resurfacing work. It is ludicrous that, in travelling to Grimsby and Cleethorpes, one is literally rattling around on that concrete-surface road. One can almost feel one&#146;s bones juddering and the car falling apart. The noise is dreadful. The newly surfaced bit is only a short section. The quietness is astonishing. It was only when it was resurfaced that residents and I realised how extreme the problem was. After the short section, we go on to the old surface again. The port of Immingham is growing. Year on year, there is more HGV traffic coming off the container ships. We need to be able to do something as regards those roads. It is not fair that residents continue to be disturbed by vehicles on that road as the traffic on it increases and the port grows.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o306"><a name="70329-0014.htm_para16"><a name="07032955000609">That leads me on to another urgent local issue to do with Immingham, which is both a town and a port. Although Immingham has the A180 and two very good roads that lead from the east and west dock gates to the main dual carriageway, far too many heavy goods vehicles go through the centre of the town. I have written to local firms saying, &#147;Please can you make sure that your drivers do not go through the centre of town,&#148; and they have assured me that their drivers do not do so, but we have monitored the traffic and we have seen them going through the town. That happens week on week, month on month. It is not only the traffic coming out of the port that is increasing; the traffic going through the middle of what is a residential town is also increasing. That is unacceptable. The local authority is consulting on having a bypass so that the majority of HGVs no longer disturb Immingham&#146;s residents. However, as we all know in respect of all such major road projects, that will not happen in the short term. Any solution will be put in place only in the long term. Therefore, there must be some short-term solutions to the problem. I shall continue to press for a weight restriction on the main residential road through Immingham.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o307"><a name="70329-0014.htm_para17"><a name="07032955000610">Other Members might have come across similar problems in their constituencies to do with my next subject; if so, I would be interested to know of them. I have found that there is a great problem to do with satellite navigation in HGVs. It does not matter whether we put up weight restriction signs at the beginning of certain streets, because if their satellite navigation system tells them to go down such a street, they will go down it. I do not know whether much can be done about that. I fear that it will increasingly become a problem throughout the country, unless satellite navigation can be programmed to inform of weight restrictions on specific roads and to say that no vehicle over a certain weight should travel down them.</p>

 I thank the hon. Gentleman for that information. I think that that Adjournment debate was held this week. <i> [Interruption.] </i>Apparently, it was an earlier debate. I shall certainly take a look at it, and if there is more that I can do on this issue, I will certainly do it. I will join other Members who are campaigning to stop the &#147;sat nav&#148; invasion of our residential streets. I do not suppose that I shall get any free satellite navigation systems in the post after having said that&#151;besides, I much prefer using a traditional map. The hon.

I noticed that under the Budget there will be increased landfill taxes. That worries me because, sadly, my area is still not recycling as much as it should be. Given that the increase has been announced, I hope that the local council takes on board more initiatives. I have many ideas for initiatives to reduce the amount of waste that our area generates and the amount of it that goes into landfill, thereby reducing some of the blot on the landscape that the residents of Immingham have to live with.</p>

Because of the way in which health services in my part of the country have been reorganised, thousands more people who live in the towns and villages on the south bank of the River Humber have to travel north to the hospitals in Hull for essential treatment, particularly cancer sufferers. It is a very long journey, which is always problematic for those travelling for chemotherapy or radiotherapy. On top of that, there is this added charge. Because of the way that the benefit system works, although those in a certain income group can get recompense, those just above that threshold&#151;that includes a lot of pensioners&#151;cannot get any assistance. As those who have to travel for such treatment or to visit someone in hospital regularly know, it costs a lot of money to cross the Humber bridge.</p>

Fridays to debate it. I was lucky in the draw, so I took up the measures in that Bill, but yet again we crashed into the parliamentary barriers and ran out of time. The Government have a role to play. I hope that, by bringing together all the parties concerned, we can examine the serious issue of the increasing cost of accessing essential life-saving health care.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o312"><a name="70329-0014.htm_para22"><a name="07032955000617">I turn to antisocial behaviour and police community support officers. One of my local newspapers, the <i> Grimsby Telegraph</i>, recently ran a strong campaign on the respect agenda and tackling various antisocial behaviour issues in our towns. Sadly, north-east Lincolnshire did not become a respect action zone, which was a great disappointment to people in our area. However, on analysis, it was clear that many things on antisocial behaviour were not being done as well as they could be. I hope that, by taking on board some of the suggestions that were made, we can move forward and become a respect action zone in the next round. I will certainly support that move, and I hope to come up with some suggestions for the council&#151;based on what colleagues in the House have told me is happening in their areas&#151;that might speed up our application to become a respect action zone.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o313"><a name="70329-0014.htm_para23"><a name="07032955000618">There is one small difficulty relating to police community support officers. I am not going to get into a debate today about numbers. However, our problem in Grimsby and Cleethorpes concerns recruitment: not enough people are coming forward to fill the places available. In the wider area, yes, we can get people to apply, but in the towns, where we want PCSOs to patrol, people are not coming forward. I hope that the Home Office&#151;or whichever bit of the divided Home Office will be responsible&#151;can consider providing extra assistance if an area is struggling to recruit people. Our problems may be because we were late in recruiting PCSOs. We are perhaps four years behind other parts of the country, because the previous chief constable did not want PCSOs. That time lag has created many difficulties. I have raised the issue with Ministers before, but we are trying to recruit at the moment. That serious issue must be addressed so that people can obtain some sort of relief from the hellish antisocial behaviour that can occur.</p>

It is the only venue of any particular size in the resort. Planning permission has been granted to demolish the winter gardens and build flats on the site. Yes, of course we need accommodation, but it must be affordable. High-rise executive flats on the sea front are not the type of home sought by most people in Cleethorpes. Some of the prices that I have seen are akin to London prices, but the average house price in Cleethorpes is well below them. I am not sure who would buy those properties.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o316"><a name="70329-0014.htm_para26"><a name="07032955000621">Now that the sale has fallen through, perhaps the Department for Culture, Media and Sport can advise on what we can do next. We have tried to get the building listed, which might have helped, but apparently it had been altered a little too much to get a listing. However, there must be some way in which we can save the only real venue of any size in which entertainment can be put on in our seaside resort. The hon. Member for Southend, West (Mr. Amess) mentioned the report about the problems in seaside resorts, but we have just lost our only major venue and that will have a severe impact on the economy of the area and tourism in the resort. I hope that the matter can be taken up with the Department for Culture, Media and Sport.</p>

I am getting some quizzical looks from hon. Members, but I am not talking about the smokable type of grass. I mean the salt marsh growing on the beach. The Humber estuary has shallow areas and salt marsh has grown, causing concern in the tourist industry in the area that it will eat up the whole beach and kill off tourism in Cleethorpes as we know it. If one considers the detailed botany, biology and ecosystems involved, that is not likely to happen, but we are having some battles with various Government agencies as to how to resolve the problem.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o318"><a name="70329-0014.htm_para28"><a name="07032955000623">The Humber estuary is a site of special scientific interest. Further south, the salt marsh areas are excellent for visiting birds. Donna Nook is one of the biggest seal colonies on the east coast of Britain. The area is certainly attractive, yet we must get the balance between that more natural part and the more traditional beach with its donkey rides and seaside. We need Ministers to broker some understanding between the two sides to see whether we can contain the growth of the salt marsh and maintain the nice sandy area of the resort that people love.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o319"><a name="70329-0014.htm_para29"><a name="07032955000624">The final issue of concern to my residents is time dependent and concerns the Humberston fitties. Ironically the name &#147;fitties&#148; comes from a Lincolnshire word for salt marsh. The Fitties lie behind the sand dunes and are a most wonderful chalet village. The chalets are painted white and the village is the jewel in the crown of the Lincolnshire coast. It is a conservation area. The hon. Member for Tiverton and Honiton extolled the virtues of Devon, but I will extol the virtues of Lincolnshire. The scent of wild roses by the sand dunes on east-coast Britain is a delight in the summer months and certainly worth a visit.</p>

The chalets are classified as holiday homes and there are serious problems with the leases. They all vary and have different conditions. We have had fights about ground rents. The residents are paying ground rent, 90 per cent. of council tax and a service charge, so they are paying more in local charges than many local residents, yet according to their leases they may sleep there overnight  <br>

for only 10 months a year. These are people&#146;s main homes, yet for two months there is a closed period. They may spend time in their home, for which they pay a mortgage, but may not sleep there overnight.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o321"><a name="70329-0015.htm_para1"><a name="07032955000626">This year people have been peeping through windows to see whether residents are breaking the terms of their lease and, heaven forbid, sleeping in their own beds at night. Various residents will, unfortunately, be taken to court by the local authority. I feel that that reaction is too extreme. One resident who is being taken to court for having the temerity to stay overnight is terminally ill. The court case was due to be heard a few weeks ago, but has been adjourned until mid-April. I hope that something can be done to prevent the case from going ahead. Another person who stayed in their property during the so-called closed period passed away, so the council did not issue them with a summons. Another person has documentary proof that they were not anywhere near their chalet, but as a sensible resident they had lights on timer switches to make it look as though someone was in the chalet to deter burglars, so the council has issued a summons to take them to court. The summons is ludicrous. It was issued a couple of days before the new season started at the beginning of March and it is to evict the residents for the remainder of the closed period, which finished at the end of February.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o322"><a name="70329-0015.htm_para2"><a name="07032955000627">It is ludicrous to call people to court in mid-April to evict them from their properties until the end of February. That is a complete waste of time, and it is an extreme reaction. I hope that the local authority will see sense and will stop taking terminally ill people, and people who were not in their home, to court. I hope that the authority will work with the residents of the Humberston fitties to sort out the terms and conditions of the leases and get them up to date. It could consider a shorter closed season. Nobody who lives in the fitties wants a 52-week-a-year residency, but if we could reduce the closed season to, say, two or three weeks a year, people could go away on holiday for those weeks. It is hard finding somewhere for two months. If we did that, we could avoid the silly situation that we seem to end up with every single year.</p>

I know the area well; in fact, last year I popped down to Tiverton on my way to seeing my mother, who lives in another part of Devon. I hope that the hon.

for money, as the Deputy Leader of the House will not get an additional sum of money. The alternative view was summarised by the Leader of the House earlier today in business questions; he said that it was all being done for the pleasure of working for the Office of the Leader of the House of Commons.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o324"><a name="70329-0015.htm_para4"><a name="07032955000630">It is a great pleasure to respond to the debate on behalf of the Opposition. There have been many excellent speeches, which have covered a broad range of subjects, both domestic and international. The Deputy Leader of the House will be aware that there remains considerable concern about the absence of proper answers to written and oral questions, and given that Members have given up a lot of time to be in the Chamber today, I hope that if there are specific issues that he is unable to deal with today, he will pass them on to the relevant Ministers so that proper answers can be obtained. By all accounts, and given all the praise that I have heard today, I can be confident that that will indeed happen.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o325"><a name="70329-0015.htm_para5"><a name="07032955000631">We started off with a contribution from my hon. Friend the Member for North Thanet (Mr. Gale), who rightly raised the absence of proper debate on the important issue of sexual orientation. The subject was recently dealt with in the House by means of a statutory instrument, rather than through primary legislation. As he rightly said, the issue was highly contentious, and there was enormous debate outside the House, but very little in it. I hope that the Deputy Leader of the House will take those strongly expressed views on board.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o326"><a name="70329-0015.htm_para6"><a name="07032955000632">My right hon. Friend the Member for West Derbyshire covered a number of local points. He started off by discussing dairy farmers and the fact that they receive 18p per litre, which means that most of them are losing some 4p per litre. It is hardly surprising, given that those are the sorts of figures involved, that last year some 350 dairy farmers stopped operating, and that the trend is continuing. He rightly raised the issue of single farm payments, which has caused great anguish to farmers. The situation has not been helped by the fact that Ministers have made two contradictory statements. First, it was said that there were fewer than 200 farmers who had not received either their full payment, or the balance of the payment due. However, in a statement in February, the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs admitted that some 13,000 farmers were still awaiting payment. While an apology has been offered to the 200 farmers, it would go a long way if it were extended to the full 13,000 who are still suffering. It is ironic that the Minister responsible was promoted to the Foreign Office.</p>

Friend the Member for West Derbyshire said that farmers were the custodians of the countryside, which is a valid point that the farming community would like to be addressed more than is currently the case in the House. My right hon. Friend rightly said that farmers have been crippled by paperwork. It is a fair point that farmers are in the business of looking after their farms, rather than sitting behind desks filling in endless papers. He referred, too, to the peak district national park planning inquiry. I agree that when the issue is resolved a review should be carried out to assess whether or not the 10 years of legal fees and officers&#146; time was  <br>

He said that the local school was the heart of the village, and I very much hope that his efforts to keep that school and, indeed, his efforts to keep the Darley Dale maternity unit continue. He is quite right that it is all very well to receive the Prime Minister&#146;s assurances when the reality is somewhat different.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o328"><a name="70329-0015.htm_para8"><a name="07032955000634">My right hon. Friend&#146;s speech was followed by a contribution from the right hon. Member for Leicester, East (Keith Vaz). In his typically ingenious way, he managed to bring in and promote Bhangra dancing, which will please his Sikh community. He raised, too, the tragic case of Rafiq Gorji and the death of his wife, Mrs. Ali. I am sure that Members present will share his concern at the lack of response from the Saudi authorities about obtaining the police report so that matters can progress. I noticed that the Leader of the House went to sit next to the right hon. Gentleman and I very much hope that as a former Foreign Secretary he can exert pressure to try to resolve the issue. In my own constituency, I am dealing with the case of Craig Alden, who is still trying to secure justice in Brazil. My efforts at dealing with the Foreign Office have not been particularly fruitful, so if there are any lessons that the right hon. Gentleman can give me, I would be happy to accept them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o329"><a name="70329-0015.htm_para9"><a name="07032955000635">The right hon. Gentleman complimented the Prime Minister on the Northern Ireland settlement, and I think it would be fair if the House acknowledged, too, the contribution by a previous Prime Minister, Sir John Major, in arriving at that settlement. That needs to be put on the record. The right hon. Gentleman rightly expressed concern about the Tamils in Sri Lanka, and the whole House will agree that it is right that we should try to engage in dialogue, and that can only happen if there is a ceasefire. He spoke about Britain taking a leading role, and while I agree, I am mindful of the comments by the Minister for Trade in the statement on Zimbabwe that it is important that Britain does not continue its colonial past. There is a balance to be struck&#151;while Britain may offer assistance to former colonies, that should be done delicately and sensitively.</p>

He, too, referred to the plight of dairy farmers, and he said that some supermarkets have tried to address the issue of their not receiving enough money. My understanding is that at least three supermarkets have raised the price of the milk that they sell, with the intention that the increase will go directly to the farmers. It is important that that voluntary arrangement is properly monitored to ensure that the price increase goes to the farmers, and not to intermediaries or to the supermarkets.</p>

I understand that for the past two years it has been increasing in many herds, and the problem certainly needs to be dealt with. The hon. Gentleman referred to the farming industry being overregulated. Most of us who have farming communities in our constituency would echo the sentiment that it is time for regulations to be reviewed, with the aim of lessening them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o333"><a name="70329-0015.htm_para13"><a name="07032955000639">I agree with the hon. Gentleman about the need for clear labelling. It is a scandal that products that are made overseas or animals that are reared overseas are brought into this country, processed, packaged and sold in British supermarkets and shops as British goods. That is largely a result of the Trade Descriptions Act 1968. It is high time that the Act was revisited, with a view to ensuring that the British public have properly labelled goods.</p>

She made a passing reference to pensioners surfing, but given the activities that pensioners engage in now, I would not be surprised if a large number of them were thinking of taking that up. </p>

She focused particularly on the massive hike in water rates in her area, which she attributed to regulations emanating from Europe. I would add that it may have something to do with the tradition of gold-plating undertaken by our civil servants. It would be interesting to know how many other European Union countries are as diligent in enforcing regulations as we are.</p>

Friend spoke of the unfairness for small businesses that are charged water rates with reference to the rateable value of properties, regardless of the number of people who may use the water in a particular business. I hope she has joy in dealing with the issue of taxation arising when the disposal of a flat and shop at the same time by one of her constituents was judged by the Revenue to be the disposal of one asset, rather than two, particularly when for all other matters&#151;council tax and so on&#151;they are treated as two assets. The Chancellor of the Exchequer recently took on board my party&#146;s suggestion for a reduction in corporation tax, so I am hopeful that he will look favourably on the suggestion offered by my hon.

He also lamented the fact that there are a lot more Davids in the House than when he entered Parliament. By way of consolation, he should take comfort in the uniqueness of his contribution to this House.</p>

for Cleethorpes talked about recycling. I feel that I have been recycled into this job; after six years, perhaps I am a bit rusty.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o353"><a name="70329-0016.htm_para1"><a name="07032955000662">We heard 10 speakers cover a wide range of subjects, including international issues such as Iraq, Iran, Saudi Arabia, Sri Lanka and Europe. We also heard about the smaller but important question of the quality of local cheeses. I am not going to get into that, nor will I get drawn into a discussion about whether one should have jugs of water or bottled water at a restaurant. With regard to the comments of the hon. Member for Tiverton and Honiton (Angela Browning), I am interested in what happens to all the plastic water bottles. One of the big issues in recycling is how we can make better use of those bottles. That is being considered by the Government agency, WRAP&#151;the Waste and Resources Action Programme. The message must be that we should drink from the jug rather than buy the bottle.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o354"><a name="70329-0016.htm_para2"><a name="07032955000663">I listened with interest to the hon. Member for Tiverton and Honiton extolling the virtues of Devon. I know its countryside, and for a moment I wanted to walk out of the Chamber to see the banks of primroses.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o355"><a name="70329-0016.htm_para3"><a name="07032955000664">I also know Donna Nook. For Members who have not been there, it is worth taking visitors in the early part of the year, when it is cold and ferocious, to see the newborn seals. The right hon. Member for West Derbyshire (Mr. McLoughlin) reminded us that he has a daughter, who is now an adolescent. Adolescent girls can be difficult but my adolescent girls enjoyed their trip to Donna Nook, which I highly recommend. I commend the British tourist industry and, like other hon. Members, I took part in last week&#146;s event. Tourism is important to new investment and new jobs, especially in rural areas.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o356"><a name="70329-0016.htm_para4"><a name="07032955000665">Rural communities were a strong theme throughout the debate. Hon. Members referred to agriculture, the environment&#151;including the marine environment&#151;and climate change. Noise pollution was also mentioned. I believe that that will become increasingly important, especially on concrete roads. That affects local residents and I believe that the local environment will increase in political significance in future.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o357"><a name="70329-0016.htm_para5"><a name="07032955000666">The landfill tax was also mentioned. I am delighted that the Budget increased the landfill tax by &#163;8 a tonne. It is important to divert waste from landfill and move towards recycling.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o358"><a name="70329-0016.htm_para6"><a name="07032955000667">Let me deal with the specific comments that hon. Members made. I shall start with the right hon. Member for West Derbyshire, first, because of his significance in the Conservative party&#151;he is one of the most powerful men in the Chamber&#151;but secondly, because I know his constituency well and visit it often. I often use the A50 to get there. He is right to remind us of the position of dairy farmers, which the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome (Mr. Heath) also mentioned. There is no doubt that dairy farmers face an extremely difficult position and that something needs to be done.</p>

Gentleman was slightly dismissive of the call for evidence from farmers and producers. It is vital that people rise to the challenge and give genuine evidence to the Commission of abuse that takes place.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o360"><a name="70329-0016.htm_para8"><a name="07032955000669">There should be more honesty and transparency in the supply chain in the milk industry. There is hostility between the producers, the processors and the retailers. Although I examined the matter in some depth at one time, I never really sorted out the cash flows and where the profit came in. There is a supply chain working party and we need to try to get some answers to people. </p>

<p><a name="stpa_o361"><a name="70329-0016.htm_para9"><a name="07032955000670">I am pleased that the report of the Select Committee on Environment, Food and Rural Affairs on the Rural Payments Agency has been mentioned. I have read it&#151;it is belligerent in tone and shows the difficulties of trying to make management changes while not being clear about policy. The report uses strong words. The new Secretary of State has been diligent in coming to the Chamber, apologising and ensuring that the House is kept up to date with developments. My noble Friend Lord Rooker holds regular surgeries&#151;I have used them&#151;which colleagues can attend to seek advice on individual cases. That is important because the payments for 2005 are not yet resolved. We are in the middle of the payment window for 2006, and 2007 is not far away. We must resolve the outstanding issues before we get into the third payment window. We need to do a great deal and there is a lot to learn from the report.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o362"><a name="70329-0016.htm_para10"><a name="07032955000671">I know Longstone Edge, which the right hon. Member for West Derbyshire mentioned, the scar on the ridge and the history, which I shall not recount. However, I believe that it would be excellent if we could make arrangements with aggregates extractors not to work in national parks. I do not think that we shall achieve that, but I look forward to the result of the planning inquiry. I noticed that the right hon. Gentleman was present at the public inquiry, looking extremely smart in his country clothes. My noble Friend Lord Hattersley appeared in casual wear, and I know who had the most effect.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o363"><a name="70329-0016.htm_para11"><a name="07032955000672">Stoney Middleton school is important. The rate of small village school closures has declined dramatically over recent years. Consultation exercises need to take into account the social value of educational establishments, and such considerations should also apply in the campaign for the Darley Dale maternity unit. A consultation is taking place on that at the moment. There is a debate about choice in the health service, and the Government need to be clear that if we offer choice, there will, almost by definition, be increased costs. One of the issues relating to the Darley Dale maternity unit involves costs, but there are also clinical issues involved. The unit is highly regarded, but it is also relatively small, and that needs to be taken into account in the consultation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o364"><a name="70329-0016.htm_para12"><a name="07032955000673">I liked the point that the right hon. Gentleman made about the management of primary care trusts and, indeed, of the NHS. I sometimes feel that the non-executive board members of some of those organisations tend to be out of touch with local people. I suspect that that issue will be raised again in the House, and it is one that we should examine.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o365"><a name="70329-0016.htm_para13"><a name="07032955000674">I would like a debate on agriculture, as the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome suggested. It would give us the chance to talk about common agricultural policy reform, in which a lot has been achieved, but more needs to be done. It would also give us an opportunity to celebrate the fact that, today, at last, the English rural development programme has been announced, and that &#163;3.9 billion has been allocated for the period from 2007 to 2013, which is double the amount for the last payment period.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o366"><a name="70329-0016.htm_para14"><a name="07032955000675">We need to make decisions about the contentious issue of bovine tuberculosis, but that is not easy. In the long term, we all aspire to a solution involving vaccination, but for as long as I have been in the House, vaccination has always been 10 years away and it never seems to get any closer. One of the puzzling things is that the incidence of TB has declined, but now appears to be rising again slightly. We need to look closely at the science. There is a case for culling, but there is also an argument that culling migrates the problem. This is not an easy issue, but the hon. Gentleman is telling us to make our minds up, and he makes a strong point, of which the Secretary of State is well aware.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o367"><a name="70329-0016.htm_para15"><a name="07032955000676">Biofuels offer opportunities in the countryside, and the hon. Gentleman made a case for joined-up thinking between all the Departments involved, including the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, the Department for Transport and the Treasury. I am conscious that we have not always done that as satisfactorily as we might have done.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o368"><a name="70329-0016.htm_para16"><a name="07032955000677">The hon. Member for Tiverton and Honiton spoke, as all MPs from the south-west do, about water and sewerage charges. I was with representatives of South West Water earlier this week, and I know that the charges are a hot issue in the south-west. Having such a long coastline means that it is not easy to clean up areas of sewage pollution. There are also real issues of affordability in the south-west, where water bills are relatively high compared with those in other parts of the country. As the hon. Lady knows, South West Water has a trust fund for cases where there are difficulties, and it is also involved in an affordability project. We need to come forward with some proposals on that fairly quickly.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o369"><a name="70329-0016.htm_para17"><a name="07032955000678">It is important to listen to consumers&#146; voices on water charges, and that is happening increasingly often. One of the questions that I have heard involves marginal increases in water quality: is it worth paying for that little bit extra? There is a real debate to be had in the water industry on that issue. There is also a debate to be had and completed on unadopted sewers. I have argued for many years for the adoption of unadopted sewers. The Government have finally announced that they will do it, but there will be a further period of consultation in which the issue of increased cost, which the hon. Lady rightly raises, will be discussed yet again.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o370"><a name="70329-0016.htm_para18"><a name="07032955000679">I was also interested in the hon. Lady&#146;s important point in relation to water costs and business premises, and I shall draw the attention of my hon. Friend the Minister for Climate Change and the Environment to that. The case of Mr. E also deserves attention. I do not want to say too much about it because, as she rightly said, it might become a test case, and might come before the courts. If I can help in any way, however, I would be delighted to try to do so.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o371"><a name="70329-0016.htm_para19"><a name="07032955000680">The hon. Member for Castle Point (Bob Spink) rehearsed the arguments that he was going to make at the public inquiry, which, I thought, were compelling. He knew what he wanted to tell the inspector. Clearly, local people also knew what they were going to tell the inspector. I am delighted that, as he puts it, they will fight tooth and nail at the public inquiry.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o372"><a name="70329-0016.htm_para20"><a name="07032955000681">The hon. Gentleman also raised the issue of what planning guidelines will be taken into account by the public inquiry, and I am delighted that my Friend the Minister for Housing and Planning is in the Chamber to hear that point. As the hon. Gentleman rightly said, planning guidance will change in future to allow quicker processing of big infrastructure projects. He and his constituents need to know, when they go to the public inquiry, on what set of rules they are fighting. I will make sure that he receives a reply on that. He also referred to the recent inappropriate use of flood barriers. He deserves a proper reply, and I will make sure that he receives one.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o373"><a name="70329-0016.htm_para21"><a name="07032955000682">The hon. Gentleman made an important point about the NHS, and I am pleased that he recognised the extra &#163;8 billion going into the NHS next year. He is right that we must move away from investment in acute services towards investment in preventive services. To try to achieve that, a big change programme, and an education programme, need to take place in the NHS.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o374"><a name="70329-0016.htm_para22"><a name="07032955000683">It is a long time since I have replied to the hon. Member for Southend, West (Mr. Amess) in one of these debates. I was sorry that he did not mention the Palace theatre in Southend, which has been a running issue for many years. I hope that that matter is now resolved.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o375"><a name="70329-0016.htm_para23"><a name="07032955000684">I also hope that progress can be made on the issue of east coast fishing. Looking to the future, how we control, conserve and pursue economic activities in the marine environment will become increasingly important. The House will debate the marine environment on the Thursday after it returns from recess, and a White Paper on the marine environment is out. The Government have a manifesto commitment to bring forward proposals to manage better the marine environment. Therefore the hon. Gentleman is on a winning wicket. I shall make sure that he gets an appropriate reply to the points that he raised.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o376"><a name="70329-0016.htm_para24"><a name="07032955000685">I was also pleased that the hon. Gentleman mentioned buses. The Department for Transport is consulting on how local authorities can work more closely with bus companies on a more strategic overview of routes. At present, basically, bus routes are planned through market forces, which does not make sense for local consumers, especially vulnerable elderly people. I am pleased that the Department for Transport is consulting on the matter, and it has been indicated that there will be legislation when&#151;as they say&#151;parliamentary time allows.</p>

Member for North Thanet (Mr. Gale) did the House a great service by raising the issue of the sexual orientation regulations. As he put it, there are strong, deeply and honourably held opinions on the matter. He will know, as he has been in the House for many years, that there are different views on different sides of the argument. As the hon. Gentleman said, it has proved difficult to reconcile those views. However, I accept his point that outside the House there was a feeling that we did not deal with the process, which he  <br>

described properly and in some detail, as well as we might have. In the Government&#146;s defence, I have to say that there were discussions between the usual channels, but I accept that many hon. Members, myself included, have strong views on the subject and missed the opportunity to vote on it because the vote was early. We did ourselves a disservice by not handling the matter better.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o378"><a name="70329-0016.htm_para26"><a name="07032955000687">I think that I am the only hon. Member in the Chamber who has been involved in the actual adoption process. Adoption is vital. It is important that we remember the law&#151;that the needs of the child are paramount. We lost sight of that in the discussion, although I know that my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister is determined to ensure that faith-based adoption agencies survive into the future. It will not be easy, but I know the valuable work that they do and the difference that they have made to many children&#146;s lives. It would be criminal to see them go out of business.</p>

He has been pursuing that vigorously and I have heard him raise it on several occasions in the Chamber. I assure him that he will get maximum help from the British embassy in Saudi Arabia. There is already a recognition from the Saudi Government that there need to be new and better regulations on drivers. My hon.

As what he said concerned the east midlands and affects my constituents and me, I will pursue it vigorously. He was right to point out that the five police authorities in the east midlands are not receiving their quota under the present formula. He and I, and others, have already pursued that vigorously with the Minister for Policing, Security and Community Safety, my hon. Friend the Member for Harrow, East (Mr. McNulty). My hon. Friend has agreed to visit the east midlands special operations unit, where we have both been fairly recently. That will provide an ideal opportunity not only to press for funds for the unit&#151;&#163;8 million of Home Office grant may well disappear next year&#151;but to press the wider issue of fairness of funding that the right hon.

The Government have an excellent record for large-scale regeneration projects. All over the United Kingdom, cranes can be observed and the work can be seen taking place. Where we have not been so successful, and need to be more sophisticated, is in areas with relatively small pockets of deprivation. The Select Committee has produced a report, and the Government will respond in due course&#151;I hope favourably, because seaside towns need an adequate infrastructure.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o387"><a name="70329-0016.htm_para35"><a name="07032955000698">My hon. Friend also talked about fireworks legislation. We have made progress, but the matter must be kept under review, and I am keen to do that.</p>

 I am pleased to have this Adjournment debate and while I am conscious that I could go on for an hour and a quarter, that might not encourage you to call me again, Mr. Deputy Speaker. I will make sure that my remarks are to the point.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o395"><a name="70329-0017.htm_para3"><a name="07032955000714">Most people in Northampton, as in other parts of the country, own their own home and have done very well, in no small part owing to low mortgage rates resulting from the Government&#146;s economic stewardship. Northampton is a growing town, so we have a lot of new housing, some of it to very high standards because of the development of new design standards. For those people, housing is not a problem but an economic asset.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o396"><a name="70329-0017.htm_para4"><a name="07032955000715">However, there is also a group in my constituency for whom things have got quite considerably worse; the people who are dependent on social housing, particularly in certain parts of the constituency where the housing is deteriorating and there is pressure on that housing. We tend to see a widening gap between people doing quite well and those for whom things are very difficult. It gives me real concern that for some, during my time as an MP, things have not improved and different pressures have arisen. I want some assurances as to how things might progress for them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o397"><a name="70329-0017.htm_para5"><a name="07032955000716">I know that my hon. Friend the Minister will say that most of these matters are down to the local authority, and I would agree, but she and the Department know that there are particular difficulties in Northampton in terms of the borough council. It is hard to stand by and watch my constituents being left in a worse position because they have a bad council.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o398"><a name="70329-0017.htm_para6"><a name="07032955000717">I want to focus on some particular housing problems, such as the actual number of people who are homeless. We often think of homeless people as rough sleepers, but there are a lot of hidden homeless who are doubling up in the houses of parents, aunts and uncles or friends. Some are sleeping on sofas or in crowded conditions and some are moving from place to place. Those pressures still exist in my constituency.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o399"><a name="70329-0017.htm_para7"><a name="07032955000718">In addition, instead of being helped into council housing or other social housing, those people are being pushed into private sector rented accommodation. This has produced some real difficulties, with people finding it impossible to get back on to the housing ladder.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o400"><a name="70329-0017.htm_para8"><a name="07032955000719">The best way to illustrate the point is with a story about a teenage couple with a charming little girl; I will not mention their names. The mother was vulnerable for a number of reasons&#151;it is not appropriate to go into those here&#151;and they needed extra support. They were living with his parents. His mother was being very supportive and helpful to them. It was she who brought them to me to see whether we could sort something out for their accommodation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o401"><a name="70329-0017.htm_para9"><a name="07032955000720">I have no doubt that, in previous times, that couple would have been put into council accommodation. They may have spent some time in temporary accommodation, but they certainly would have been  <br>

<notus-date day="29" month="3" year="2007" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><b>29 Mar 2007 : Column 1724</b><br>
straight into the council system given their circumstances: she had been involved in the care system; they were teenagers; they had a young child; they were very committed to looking after the child; and determined to make a go of things in quite difficult circumstances. They were, however, directed into private sector rented housing and refused access to council accommodation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o402"><a name="70329-0017.htm_para10"><a name="07032955000721">The next time we heard from the family, they had to move because they had only a six-month tenancy. Therefore, they were forced to move. The mother was expecting another baby. They managed to do the next move but then things got very difficult. As often happens, because rents are high, they got into arrears. Then real disaster struck. With all the rushing around that he was having to do, the boy lost his job. He had been working to support the family. They had been doing a really good job of holding things together and then he lost his job.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o403"><a name="70329-0017.htm_para11"><a name="07032955000722">It seems that, because of their record of rent arrears, it is unlikely that the couple would be accepted for council housing. In any ordinary circumstances, they should have been supported by the council and put into social housing. With just a little support, and because they were so committed and they had the support of his parents, they would have probably established and maintained a successful family unit and would have looked forward to a good-quality, happy life. Instead, they are faced with a series of extra problems to cope with, when they already face challenges.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o404"><a name="70329-0017.htm_para12"><a name="07032955000723">We have been through the subject before, but the couple were directed down the road of private sector housing before a full assessment was done, or else the assessment must have missed a few points. To me, that seems to be wrong. For a number of people, private sector rented accommodation is not a good idea because they cannot afford the rent, or they cannot afford the top-ups of the rent if the landlord is charging above what is covered by housing benefit. For a lot of people, the insecurity of six-month tenancies, with the reality, not just the prospect, of moves each six months, is inappropriate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o405"><a name="70329-0017.htm_para13"><a name="07032955000724">Another issue is about the use of bed and breakfast. I know that the number of families with children in bed and breakfast has gone down since the Government said that it should be used for six weeks only and then only in case of emergency. However, it still seems from the cases that I see in my advice surgeries that the prospect of being put into bed and breakfast effectively acts as a deterrent for people who would otherwise properly claim support with housing and then be placed into council housing. I would like my hon. Friend the Minister to say whether it is right that, once someone has given a notice to quit, which then gives28 days for the assessment to be done, that should be regarded as an emergency. It seems to me that, if someone has given a notice to quit and they know that there will be 28 days for the assessment, that should not be regarded as an emergency.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o406"><a name="70329-0017.htm_para14"><a name="07032955000725">Housing repairs is a real problem in my constituency. That is something else that I am concerned about in terms of certain areas in my constituency. As always, nice private housing goes up and people move into that as they can. Because there is a buoyant economy, people have jobs and can by and large move, but there is a residue of deteriorating public sector housing that  <br>

continues to decline in quality. I am concerned that, if nothing is done to deal with some substantial problems of disrepair, a few years down the line, the gap will have widened between people who have very nice private sector housing and people who are stuck in housing that is going down in value.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o407"><a name="70329-0017.htm_para15"><a name="07032955000726">When the original stock survey for Northampton was done, it was said that the council could achieve the decent homes standard for all housing within existing resources, and therefore it did not go for stock transfer or the other options. However, it was also recognised&#151;finally&#151;that the housing on the east side of town, or in the eastern district as it is called and which is in my constituency, was deteriorating. The standard of housing there was declining as other housing was improving, and it was acknowledged that the two paths would soon cross and that there would be a problem.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o408"><a name="70329-0017.htm_para16"><a name="07032955000727">That deterioration has continued apace, and I have to deal with some serious problems to do with disrepair, in particular damp. That is often attributed to condensation, although some of it does not look like condensation to me. Condensation is normally accompanied by certain types of mould growth and certain quantities of water, and some of what I see appears to be worse than that, although I am not an expert. A young woman explained to me that she was told that her ground-floor flat had condensation and that she should leave her windows open, and she said that she wondered who in their right mind would leave the windows open of a ground-floor flat on an estate such as hers, which has a high crime level, so all the contents of the flat could rapidly disappear as a result of burglaries.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o409"><a name="70329-0017.htm_para17"><a name="07032955000728">Some properties do not have central heating. In some instances, that is simply unacceptable. A man who lives in a disability bungalow came to me. He had a couple of storage heaters and he had been given a couple of electric heaters. Not only are they expensive to keep running, but in such domestic circumstances people with a disability, who need a constant and reasonable level of heat, cannot use parts of their home at certain times because they are not warm enough. Does the decent homes standard include the requirement to have central heating? What type of heating are people supposed to have? Also, what will happen in respect of the decent homes standard in future&#151;I ask that especially in the context of the deteriorating housing that I have mentioned?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o410"><a name="70329-0017.htm_para18"><a name="07032955000729">Adaptations for disabilities is an issue. There is a general problem to do with the disabled facilities grant and the amount of money in it. I am concerned as a number of my constituents who are disabled&#151;or, more importantly and more frequently, who have children who are disabled&#151;have real difficulties in using their accommodation. I was called to see a family with a boy who was almost trapped on the ground floor in his wheelchair because they could not have a stairlift and he had become too big to carry up the stairs, and also the design of the property was quite awkward. He had not had a bath for quite some time, because they had no way of getting him up the stairs. What is regarded as being acceptable in terms of disabled children and their accommodation?</p>
<br>

<p><a name="stpa_o411"><a name="70329-0017.htm_para19"><a name="07032955000730">Let me give another example. A woman lives with her partner and two children. One of them is a boy aged 4 who is thought to have attention deficit hyperactivity disorder&#151;he is being assessed. There is also a little girl of one and a half years of age who cannot walk and faces major surgery to her legs and feet. During the time of the recovery, she will need major splints&#151;a frame around her legs&#151;to help with the treatment. They are living in a second-floor flat with no lift. The family find it hard now to get her up two flights of stairs, but that will become very difficult after she has had her surgery and she is in her recovery time. The children&#146;s bedroom has a very old gas heater, and because of the boy&#146;s behavioural difficulties, the parents feel that it is not safe for him to use; I am not surprised at that. They put the wardrobe in front of it so that he cannot get at it, but of course, that means that the room has no heating at all. There is also a hole in the outer wall, which they asked to be filled in.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o412"><a name="70329-0017.htm_para20"><a name="07032955000731">On considering the information in the application, the medical panel assessed that</p>
<a name="70329-0017.htm_brev5"><a name="07032955000810"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;the current accommodation is reasonable on medical grounds&#148;,</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o413"><a name="70329-0017.htm_para21"><a name="07032955000732">so no award of medical points was made. I find that very surprising. What is the guidance on providing accommodation for families with children with disabilities? Getting such children up and down stairs is hard enough, but it is even harder when equipment also needs be carried up and down. The type of accommodation provided for children with behavioural difficulties is also a real issue. If a child is fidgety and fiddling because of ADHD, should they be placed somewhere where there is a gas heater, particularly the older type, which as we know presents problems?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o414"><a name="70329-0017.htm_para22"><a name="07032955000733">In addition to the disrepair of such properties, there is the wider issue of estate management. If a housing estate is not generally managed well, it becomes a haven for antisocial behaviour. That can, and has, made life very difficult for some of my constituents. The safer community teams have played a really important role, providing a fresh impetus for some of these difficult estates. However, it is quite wrong, as has sometimes happened, to expect the police to deal with problems that housing management should resolve. It is a waste of the police&#146;s function to do work that should be done by housing management. I shall bring one such case to my hon. Friend&#146;s attention a little later.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o415"><a name="70329-0017.htm_para23"><a name="07032955000734">A fourth issue is overcrowding. I pay tribute to the way in which my hon. Friend has dealt with this issue on the Government&#146;s behalf&#151;I know that standards on overcrowding are due to be published shortly&#151;but I should point out that it is a very real problem not just in the big cities, but in middle England constituencies such as mine. Let me give an example from my constituency. A man, his wife and five children are living in a single bedsit in a hostel that is supposed to be for homeless single people. He was a homeless single person when he came to this country as a refugee, but now that his wife and children are also here, they really need something a bit bigger.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o416"><a name="70329-0017.htm_para24"><a name="07032955000735">Let me read a letter that I received today&#151;I promise that it is not a plant&#151;that is perhaps a much better example of the typical cases of overcrowding that I hear about. I shall take out some of the detail, so that hopefully, the woman in question cannot be identified:</p>
<a name="70329-0017.htm_brev6"><a name="07032955000811"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;My partner and I have four children and I am pregnant with my fifth and we live in a small two-bedroom house and it is very  <br>

stressful because we don&#146;t have a lot of room. The three older children sleep on just a mattress on the floor in what people would call a box room. They can&#146;t even have wardrobes or toys because there is no room.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o417"><a name="70329-0017.htm_para25"><a name="07032955000736">What she wants is a bigger property</p>
<a name="70329-0017.htm_brev7"><a name="07032955000812"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;where we can live as a family which will be good because me and my kids have been through enough due to the violent and aggressive relationship that we suffered with the older children&#146;s dad. My kids mean a lot to me and it means a lot to me that they are happy.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o418"><a name="70329-0017.htm_para26"><a name="07032955000737">That is the general sentiment of most of my constituents and it is not an unreasonable aspiration. It is important that women who suffer domestic violence can move on and try to establish a stable family unit, in my constituent&#146;s case with a partner who is playing a positive role in her life and the lives of her children. They need a decent start in life.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o419"><a name="70329-0017.htm_para27"><a name="07032955000738">Another example also concerns the problems related to disability. A woman was living with her husband and their five children, three of whom have special needs, including physical disabilities, in a three-bedroom house. That is a reasonable size, but given the children&#146;s difficulties it was hard. On top of that they were being bullied by other children on the estate. Because of the children&#146;s disabilities, they were targeted and harassed. That raises two issues, one about the standard of accommodation and another about how to manage harassment and bullying when it comes to housing provision. I hope that my hon. Friend can say something about when the standards for overcrowding will come out. What cognisance will be given to children with special needs and disabilities?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o420"><a name="70329-0017.htm_para28"><a name="07032955000739">As Northampton grows, the existing properties need to be improved along with the new build, because it will not help community cohesion if some people move into nice new properties while others see their personal circumstances, living standards and neighbourhoods deteriorate. If a town is to grow and be successful, everybody needs to share in the good fortune of its growth and development.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o421"><a name="70329-0017.htm_para29"><a name="07032955000740">In all the discussion about &#147;Every Child Matters&#148;, attention was paid to many issues, but there was no focus on housing, which has always been a slight problem. Unless the problems that I have identified are resolved, we will not be able to deal with some of the issues of vulnerability and social exclusion. Those under particular housing pressure are disabled people, young parents, single parents, victims of domestic violence and children, especially disabled children. For the most part, those are the very people whom social housing was designed to support. I expect that my hon. Friend the Minister will say that it is the local authority&#146;s responsibility, and I accept that, but it is important that pressure is put on the local authority and steps are taken to ensure that my constituents get better housing services. They need to see the prospect of improvements in their lives and a constructive future for their families.</p>

experiences of families in her constituency and she is right that poor housing, in different forms, can have a devastating impact on family life and on people&#146;s chances in life. I wish to try to address some of the points that my hon. Friend has made and to refer to some of the national issues, as well as the local issues that she raised.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o422"><a name="70329-0017.htm_para30"><a name="07032955000742">We are clear that we face housing pressures across the country as a result of not having built&#151;over a 30-year period&#151;enough homes to meet rising demand, with the growing number of single households and people living longer. We are clear, too, that if we are to address the pressures of affordability for the next generation, we need to ensure that we build more market housing, shared ownership housing and social housing. That means that we need to address pressures around social housing in my hon. Friend&#146;s constituency and across the region. When there is demand for social housing, it is even more important that the social housing in place is well and sensitively managed, including issues of allocation and quality. For those reasons, the cases that my hon. Friend raised are of concern.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o423"><a name="70329-0017.htm_para31"><a name="07032955000743">My hon. Friend will be aware that we have set standards for decent homes. There was a shocking &#163;19 billion backlog of repairs and maintenance in 1997. Every council and social housing tenant has a right to live in a decent home. We have given local authorities an additional 30 per cent. in real terms funding per home compared with 1997 to invest in improvements and refurbishment to council housing. We urge them to ensure that it is well used to improve housing standards. Some local authorities need additional resources, given the backlog of repairs that they face. That is why we have made available additional resources through arm&#146;s length management organisations and stock transfers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o424"><a name="70329-0017.htm_para32"><a name="07032955000744">My hon. Friend and I have met people from her local council at her instigation to urge them to look at the deteriorating stock that she identified and what more needed to be done to meet the decent homes target. It is important that councils take account of areas where the age of homes means that they may be able to anticipate the need for further work over the next few years and ensure that that is properly taken account of as part of the decent homes programme.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o425"><a name="70329-0017.htm_para33"><a name="07032955000745">Given my hon. Friend&#146;s concerns about the continuing deterioration of the stock in a particular area of her constituency, I will ask the Government Office to review the position for her area against the decent homes programme and to look into heating issues. It is certainly part of the decent homes standard that they should be heated to a proper modern standard. Local authorities need to make sure that they have appropriate heating systems in place.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o426"><a name="70329-0018.htm_para0"><a name="07032955000746">My hon. Friend spoke about overcrowding. She has campaigned on this issue over many years and has been responsible for raising it up the political agenda and ensuring that it is addressed. The standards have not changed for 70 years and they need to be updated. We have consulted on a new approach but, as she will be aware, it is not enough simply to change the standards; we need a programme to address overcrowding. That is why we are looking not simply at standards, but at how to combine that with the appropriate work to prevent overcrowding through building larger family homes  <br>

and better management of our stock to ensure that we can better address the needs of large families.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o427"><a name="70329-0018.htm_para1"><a name="07032955000747">My hon. Friend asked about homelessness. It is important that housing authorities have a sensitive approach to the particular needs of families who are becoming homeless. It may be that all kinds of measures can be taken to prevent them from becoming homeless in the first place and to support them. Councils should take into account the vulnerability of different families and their particular needs. They should carry out proper assessments to ensure that people get the right kind of support.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o428"><a name="70329-0018.htm_para2"><a name="07032955000748">My hon. Friend raised issues concerning families with disabilities and children with behavioural difficulties. There is a wider issue here around children in poor housing that we need to look at further, particularly around children with disabilities and the links between housing and child poverty. It is interesting that the Fabian Society&#146;s recent report on life chances, which looked into the issue of life chances and child poverty, did not consider housing very much. There is a tendency for people to think about child poverty simply in terms of the income that a family receives, but the quality of the housing that people live in, and that children grow up in, can be critical to their future.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o429"><a name="70329-0018.htm_para3"><a name="07032955000749">The decent homes programme has already lifted 1.4 million children out of bad housing since 1997. We have made substantial progress in improving the quality of housing for many children across the country, but there are issues, particularly to do with overcrowding, that my hon. Friend is right to highlight, and we need to do more on some families&#146; special needs. She raised a series of other questions, too. She  <br>

pointed to the fact that many of the issues are matters for the local council. We need to do more in a series of areas at national level if we are to continue the progress that we have made, both through the decent homes programme, and through the recent increases in the amount of social housing built. However, there are clearly responsibilities at local level, too.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o430"><a name="70329-0018.htm_para4"><a name="07032955000750">We recognise that Northampton borough council&#146;s housing service has considerable room for improvement, and the Audit Commission&#146;s progress report, published earlier this year, indicated that its housing service was poor. Programmes of work are under way to try to improve the service in different areas, but we want those improvements to be sustained. There is considerably more work to do in a series of areas, and Northampton borough council needs to do more to improve its housing services in the interests of local tenants and local people across the board. We have asked officials at the Government office for the east midlands to work closely with Northampton borough council to improve its housing services before the next Audit Commission inspection, which is planned for this autumn. I will raise the concerns that my hon. Friend has mentioned this afternoon with officials, so that they are included in that improvement process. May I again thank my hon. Friend for raising such important issues, and wish her and the House a happy Easter?</p>
