Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport
(Mr. David Lammy):</b> My right hon. Friend the Secretary of
State and I are aware of the many cultural attractions that grace the
Wakefield area, and I was delighted to be in the area recently
celebrating the plans for the new Hepworth gallery that is being built
there. I know that the Secretary of State will also be visiting the
region with the Olympic roadshow in
July.</p><p><a name="0606054000038"><b><a name="0606054000449">Mary
Creagh:</b> I thank my hon. Friend for his reply, and for his
visit to Wakefield to launch the Hepworth trust. Will he join me in
congratulating the Yorkshire sculpture park on its recent new
commission of James Turell&#146;s fantastic Skyspace deer shelter in
the park? It is the first major commission by the national art
collection since Rodin&#146;s Burghers of Calais, which stands
outside this place. Will my hon. Friend pencil into his forward diary
the opening of the new Hepworth gallery in Wakefield city centre in
2008? It will regenerate a swath of our historic waterfront and attract
visitors from all over the world to our proud
city.</p><p><a name="0606054000039"><b><a name="0606054000450">Mr.
Lammy:</b> I know that my hon. Friend is doing a huge amount
to promote culture and the arts in her region, and we are very grateful
to her for that. When I was up in Wakefield, everyone was talking about
the sculpture park and the Skyscape, and particularly about the way in
which the three elements&#151;the landscape, the architecture and the
sculpture&#151;combine to make the park really wonderful. I look
forward to visiting it soon, and we have of course pencilled into the
diary the coming to fruition of the Hepworth later on.</p><h3 align="center"><a name="0606054000021">Olympic

Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport (Tessa
Jowell):</b> The candidature file set out the key costs of
staging the games. Since then, it has become clear that, in certain
areas such as security, there are cost pressures. We are seeking to
mitigate those pressures wherever we can, by cost reductions and by
maximising the value of the Olympic site itself. That work is
continuing.</p><p><a name="0606054000042"><b><a name="0606054000453">Mr.
Dunne:</b> Given last month&#146;s confusion over the London
Organising Committee for the Olympic Games&#151;LOCOG&#151;budget,
will the Secretary of State provide the House with an accurate estimate
of the Government&#146;s contribution to infrastructure 
<br><notus-date day="5" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>5 Jun 2006 : Column 3</b><br>improvements in the east end? How much of that is specific to the
Olympics, and how much would have been done anyway? Will the Secretary
of State consider moving more of the events to places outside
London&#151;where facilities either already exist or could be
provided more cheaply&#151;such as Much Wenlock in my constituency,
which is the home of the modern Olympiad, as she
knows?</p><p><a name="0606054000043"><b><a name="0606054000454">Tessa
Jowell:</b> I know that the hon. Gentleman has been a champion
of bringing Olympic benefits to his constituency. I shall be taking
part shortly, along with colleagues on both sides of the House, in the
Olympic roadshow, which will be travelling around the country between 6
and 27 July. I am quite sure that Much Wenlock is on our itinerary, as
it should be. The hon. Gentleman is right to say that the benefits of
the Olympic games&#151;which will be considerable in economic
terms&#151;should be felt around the country, and that is the
overriding purpose of the Olympic tour.
</p><p><a name="0606054000044">In relation to the
hon. Gentleman&#146;s first question, I am sure that he will
understand that the answer will depend on the conclusion of discussions
and negotiations about the balance between the publicly funded parts of
the Olympic park and those that might be funded by the private sector.
It will be easier to give him an accurate answer when the Olympic
Delivery Authority publishes its corporate plan in the
autumn.</p><p><a name="0606054000045"><b><a name="0606054000455">Mr.
Kevan Jones (North Durham) (Lab):</b> Does my right hon.
Friend agree that an important part of the Olympics involves ensuring
that funding is directed to the next generation of sports stars? Will
she therefore look into the reasons why <i> The Northern Echo</i>
newspaper in the north-east, which wants to raise funds for youngsters
as part of its Olympic Dream campaign, has been blocked by the 2012
Olympic organising committee from using the word
&#147;Olympic&#148; in the campaign? This public-spirited campaign
has a lot of support in the north-east, but it is being blocked by
bureaucratic nonsense.</p><p><a name="0606054000046"><b><a name="0606054000456">Tessa
Jowell:</b> I thank my hon. Friend for his question, and I
suspect that similar questions will come up quite often between now and
the opening of the games. There are two elements of which he needs to
be aware. The first is that the legislation precludes any kind of
commercial association with the Olympics unless it is borne out by
financial sponsorship. That protection has been established by the
International Olympic Committee to address some of the issues that my
hon. Friend raised in his first question.</p><p><a name="0606054000047">That said, however, I am
absolutely determined, as is my right hon. Friend the Minister for
Sport, to ensure that young people from right around the country
benefit from this unique opportunity to take part in sport, glorified
by the Olympics. The UK school games has already been established, and
we will work with colleagues on both sides of the House to ensure that
the legislation required by the IOC is interpreted properly and
proportionately and does not put off young people or key local sponsors
from taking part in the Olympics.</p><br><notus-date day="5" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>5 Jun 2006 : Column 4</b><br><p><a name="0606054000048"><b><a name="0606054000457">Richard
Ottaway (Croydon, South) (Con):</b> I wish the Secretary of
State well in her efforts to mitigate any costs overrun, but can she
give some clarity as to who will pay for any overrun? I represent a
London seat, and my constituents already face a substantial bill over a
long period. Can she assure me that the costs overrun will be borne
nationally, not just by the people of
London?</p><p><a name="0606054000049"><b><a name="0606054000458">Tessa
Jowell:</b> No, I cannot give the hon. Gentleman that
assurance. He knows that the agreement that was signed, which is part
of the candidate file, made it absolutely clear that there was a budget
that would fund the infrastructure for the Olympic games and that any
costs beyond that would be met on the basis of a shared agreement, as
at that time unspecified, between the lottery, the council tax payer
and, ultimately, the Exchequer. It is worth reminding him that the
costs of the Olympic games, again as a requirement of the IOC, are
ultimately underwritten by the
Exchequer.</p><p><a name="0606054000050">The hon.
Gentleman and his Front-Bench colleagues will know that the overriding
consideration is to keep the cost of the Olympic games down, to
maximise the benefit of the legacy and to maximise the benefit to young
people in communities in every constituency in the
country.</p><p><a name="0606054000051"><b><a name="0606054000459">Jim
Sheridan (Paisley and Renfrewshire, North) (Lab):</b> My right
hon. Friend is aware that the rest of the UK will benefit from the 2012
London Olympics, but can she advise the House, given that other cities
will benefit, whether other, devolved bodies will be expected to make
any financial contribution towards the London
Olympics?</p><p><a name="0606054000052"><b><a name="0606054000460">Tessa
Jowell:</b> There is no assumption that any direct funding
will come from any of the devolved authorities. Obviously, the lottery
will be a major contributor to the costs of the Olympics, and funding
the Olympics means that there will be some diversion from other good
causes, so indirectly there will be a consequence for the devolved
Administrations. The funding formula for the Olympics has been clearly
set out and the Olympic lottery is doing very well&#151;better than
we expected&#151;but, no, there is no intention that, other than
through the lottery, there should be a direct impact on any of the
devolved
Administrations.</p><p><a name="0606054000053"><b><a name="0606054000461">Susan
Kramer (Richmond Park) (LD):</b> The Secretary of State will
be well aware that the &#163;625 million already agreed as London
taxpayers&#146; burden for the Olympics includes &#163;50 million
for cost overruns such as she has described as possibly occurring. Will
she then at least agree to cap London&#146;s burden at that
&#163;625 million, given that an overrun is already included in that
figure?</p><p><a name="0606054000054"><b><a name="0606054000462">Tessa
Jowell:</b> As well as being Secretary of State, I am Member
of Parliament for a London constituency. My constituents are as
concerned as those of the hon. Lady about the impact on the council
tax. It is our responsibility to ensure that the council tax burden is
minimised. We have had here and in another place many debates on
whether the ultimate amount should be capped, and the reasons as to why
not have been clearly set out.</p><br><notus-date day="5" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>5 Jun 2006 : Column 5</b><br><p><a name="0606054000055"><b><a name="0606054000463">Mr.
John Randall (Uxbridge) (Con):</b> The Secretary of State has
said that her constituents, like mine in Uxbridge, are concerned about
the cost and the legacy of the Olympics. Is she aware that in the
London borough of Hillingdon we have plans for a 25 m pool ready to go
ahead, but we are just waiting for a little more investment from either
Sport England or the Government to make it a 50 m pool, which would be
a superb legacy for the swimmers of west London? A 50 m pool is
desperately needed in west London, so can she give us a little hope
that her Department will look into this matter a little more
seriously?</p><p><a name="0606054000056"><b><a name="0606054000464">Tessa
Jowell:</b> I am delighted that a new pool is planned for the
young people of Hillingdon. The decision on whether it will be a 25 m
or a 50 m pool should be made by Sport England, and should be made in
the context of proper distribution of 50 m pools&#151;which, as the
hon. Gentleman knows, are the standard facility required for
competitions.</p><p><a name="0606054000057">I cannot
tell the hon. Gentleman conclusively atthis stage whether
Hillingdon is the prime location for a 50 m pool, but I am sure that
the pool will be a much-used facility if it measures 25 m. I suggest,
however, that on behalf of his constituents the hon. Gentleman should
arrange to meet representatives of Sport England, and representatives
of UK Sport if necessary, to discuss the distribution of pools and
whether Hillingdon is the right place for
one.</p><p><a name="0606054000058"><b><a name="0606054000465">Mr.
Lindsay Hoyle (Chorley) (Lab):</b> Obviously my right hon.
Friend will be considering funding issues, but does she recognise that
Lancashire can play a role in the Olympics too? I am thinking
particularly of Chorley, which hosted the mountain biking and road
cycling events in the Commonwealth games. Could my right hon. Friend
find funds to support a sporting village in the Chorley
constituency?</p><p><a name="0606054000059"><b><a name="0606054000466">Tessa
Jowell:</b> I am sure that my hon. Friend will raise that with
me on many occasions between now and 2012.</p><p><a name="0606054000060">Our intention and hope is that a
combination of increased Government investment in sporting facilities
and the activities of local clubs, local authorities and the private
sector will produce a substantial rise in the number of facilities not
just in my hon. Friend&#146;s constituency, but throughout the
country. I look forward to having many more discussions with my hon.
Friend, and support his advocacy of a sporting village in his home
town.</p><p><a name="0606054000061"><b><a name="0606054000467">Hugh
Robertson (Faversham and Mid-Kent) (Con):</b> The question of
how we empower young people through sport remains the one wholly
uncosted element of the entire Olympic equation. Given that the amount
of lottery funding for sport has fallen from &#163;390 million in
1998 to &#163;264 million last year, and given that the proposed big
lottery fund has only &#163;19 million earmarked for it, how will the
Government finance the key Singapore commitment to empowering young
people through sport?</p><p><a name="0606054000062"><b><a name="0606054000468">Tessa
Jowell:</b> I would not rely only on lottery money, which, as
the hon. Gentleman knows, is spent principally on facilities. Some
2,000 new facilities have 
<br><notus-date day="5" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>5 Jun 2006 : Column 6</b><br>been or are being developed on the strength of lottery funds. The
programme is not yet complete; it will be complete next
year.</p><p><a name="0606054000063">The hon.
Gentleman should incorporate in his sums the money that is being
invested in school sport&#151;some &#163;500 million a
year&#151;the money being invested in coaches, the money being
invested in the talented athlete scholarship scheme and, of course, the
money being invested by the Chancellor in the development of elite
sport, as announced in the Budget. It will help participation to
ensure&#151;and this will be done by 2010&#151;that every child
engages in at least two hours of sport each week in curriculum time and
has the opportunity to take part in sporting activity outside school,
and that there is competition in schools for young people.</p><p><a name="0606054000064">The hon. Gentleman must accept
that the money that has been invested over the past three years is now
producing results. It is producing results for one specific reason:
this Government are wholeheartedly committed to sport being part of
every child&#146;s life, and we have provided the means for that to
happen.</p><h3 align="center"><a name="0606054000022">Licensing

months, and it is still too soon to draw any conclusions about their
success. What does seem clear is that there has been no discernible
increase in alcohol-related crime, and there have been many reports of
better working relationships between the police, local authorities and
other relevant local partners. Monitoring and evaluation, particularly
through the work of the scrutiny councils, will give us a clearer
picture of the impact in the longer term, and will guide us in respect
of any changes that may be
necessary.</p><p><a name="0606054000068"><b><a name="0606054000471">Mr.
Bailey:</b> I thank my right hon. Friend for her reply. I
share her view that giving local communities more control over
licensing has been an important step forward. However, coming up is the
combination of light nights and World cup fever, which could be the
supreme test of the new licensing laws. What special measures are being
taken to improve coordination between the industry, police and local
authorities to ensure that everyone has an enjoyable World
cup?</p><p><a name="0606054000069"><b><a name="0606054000472">Tessa
Jowell:</b> I thank my hon. Friend for his question and pay
tribute to his local authority for its implementation of the Licensing
Act 2003. There will be a nationwide programme of policing and
enforcement during the World cup, but it is important to note and to
take some reassurance from the fact that most World cup matches will be
played during the daytime or the early evening. It is not as if the
World cup is being played on the other side of the world, which would
mean that people were up long after what has become the more normal
closing time. However, the police will operate under gold command,

are carrying out risk assessments. Licence conditions such as not
taking glasses out of the pub are being employed and CCTV is being
used. I am encouraged not only by the focus of the police and the
seriousness with which they are taking the matter, but by the new
spirit of collaboration with local
authorities.</p><p><a name="0606054000070"><b><a name="0606054000473">Mr.
John Whittingdale (Maldon and East Chelmsford) (Con):</b> Is
the Secretary of State aware of the latest research by the Central
Council of Physical Recreation, which shows that, contrary to the claim
by the Minister for Sport, over 75 per cent. of amateur sports clubs
fall outside band A and therefore face significant extra bills as a
result of the Act? Is she aware that many village halls, including that
in Maldon in my constituency, used up their entire entitlement to
temporary event notices by the end of January? Will she ask Sir Les
Elton&#146;s committee to address those problems as a matter of
urgency and act on its recommendations?</p><p><a name="0606054000071"><b><a name="0606054000474">Tessa

independent panel sitting under Sir Les Elton is examining fee levels
and their impact. He will report later this year.</p><p><a name="0606054000072">On the hon. Gentleman's second
point, which was about temporary event notices, we have just concluded
a consultation on whether there should be any change, but he should
remember the importance of getting a proper balance between the
interests of local residents, who have greater powers of redress under
the Licensing Act, and the wish of village halls and other
organisations to be able to put on events with the minimum of
bureaucracy. We will address those issues and publish the conclusions

Eric Illsley (Barnsley, Central) (Lab):</b> As my right hon.
Friend knows, there is a section within the Licensing Act that states
that every sale of alcohol has to be under the supervision of the
licence holder. In south Yorkshire, the police have taken that to mean
that the licence holder cannot be absent from the premises even for one
day and, despite the advice from the Crown Prosecution Service, they
have pursued a prosecution of a licence holder who took a few days
holiday. In a letter to me that arrived this morning, South Yorkshire
police are standing by that interpretation of the legislation and are
looking to bring the matter before the courts to try to clarify
whether, under the law, which I think is section 19, every sale of
alcohol has to be supervised. Will she look at that matter with some
urgency because, with the law as it stands, South Yorkshire police will
not allow licence holders to take any form of
holiday?</p><p><a name="0606054000074"><b><a name="0606054000476">Tessa

terms of the objectives set out within it: does it reduce
alcohol-related crime and disorder; and does it protect the vulnerable

traditional, indigenous, working-class folk dance and song. As English
pride reaches a climax with the World cup approaching, does he agree
that Arts Council England should invest more in English folk dance and
song, and not invest in contemporary Latin American art, as in foisting
a &#163;5.5 million art gallery on Colchester, which people there do
not
want?</p><p><a name="0606054000087"><b><a name="0606054000486">Mr.

new visual arts centre that is coming to Colchester, of which the Latin
American arts component, which is the university of Essex&#146;s
contribution to the art gallery, is but a small part. The visual arts
can bring regenerative effects, and we all hope to see them in
Colchester, as we have seen them in Salford, Newcastle and Gateshead.
Yes, he is right: of course the Arts Council should invest in all art
forms. That is why it has quadrupled the amount of money that it has
given to folk dance, of which he is such a fan; but money has also gone
to Colchester&#146;s museum service, which has increased, and to the
Mercury theatre in Colchester and to the Colchester arts centre. Across
the board, the arts have experienced a funding increase in
Colchester&#151;something that he should be pleased about and proud
of.</p><p><a name="0606054000088"><b><a name="0606054000487">Mrs.

get it right. At this stage, of course, what we have conducted are
pilot schemes and trials. In 2008, we begin in the Border region. There

for the future is one of the biggest investment programmes in sports
facilities. The investment via local authorities is over and above that
from Sport England. Our investment in schools and the school sport

and I hope that, over the next few months and years, we will build an
infrastructure for volunteering that will be second to none. I
acknowledge what my hon. Friend is saying, but the investment in

Second Church Estates Commissioner (Sir Stuart Bell):</b>
There are no European Union funds principally for the restoration of
historic churches and cathedrals. The best thing that the European
Union can do for us is to reduce VAT on church repairs. The church
heritage forum is developing close partnerships with funding and
fundraising bodies and disseminating information to church and
cathedral authorities to assist in the upkeep of historic churches and
cathedrals by way of a stitch in
time.</p><p><a name="0606054000136"><b><a name="0606054000531">Michael
Fabricant (Lichfield) (Con):</b> As the hon. Gentleman said
that there are no funds available, I am inclined to ask, why not?
Churches in the United Kingdom provide heritage that is of great
European importance. Will the commissioners go to the other Commission
and say that money is required, not only for great cathedrals such as
Lichfield but for churches all over the country, as that heritage makes
Europe so very different?</p><p><a name="0606054000137"><b><a name="0606054000532">Sir
Stuart Bell:</b> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman.
<i> [</i><i> Interruption.</i><i> ]</i> The House is in an hilarious mood.
Compared with other parts of Europe, United Kingdom churches and places
of worship are poorly funded. We recommend that some public funding
should be available in recognition of both the contribution that they
make to the community and of the cost of their
upkeep.</p><p><a name="0606054000138"><b><a name="0606054000533">Keith

The Electoral Commission should consider issuing clear guidelines on
how far voters are expected to walk to a polling station. In the last
local election in my constituency, the London borough of Barnet placed
one polling station in a marginal ward about 40 minutes&#146; walk
away from a less well-off area and right in the middle of a more

recommended a change in the last date for registration, so that it is
closer to the date of an election, and it has also recommended clearer
powers for returning officers and registration officers to encourage
participation at a local level, which relates to the hon.

and other dedicated health care professionals look after patients,
improve health and well-being and save thousands of peoples&#146;
lives, and we all owe them an enormous debt of gratitude. But sometimes
something goes wrong. The Bill deals with the minority of cases in
which patients are harmed by their NHS care. All of us know about such
cases from our own constituencies. What I find, and I am sure that
other hon. Members find, is that people want to know why the treatment
went wrong, they want an apology from the hospital or doctor concerned,
and they want to be reassured that lessons have been learned so that
others will not suffer like them in future. Sometimes, but by no means
all of the time, they would like some
compensation.</p><p><a name="0606054000176"><b><a name="0606054000567">John
Bercow (Buckingham) (Con):</b> The Secretaryof State
will be aware, I am sure, that clauses 1, 5 and 14 all provide for
order-making powers. They deal with the power to establish a redress
scheme, the duty to consider its application, and the question of
complaints. Why, under clause 16, are those order-making powers subject
to the negative procedure of the House, rather than to its affirmative
counterpart?</p><p><a name="0606054000177"><b><a name="0606054000568">Ms
Hewitt:</b> If the hon. Gentleman wishes to pursue the matter,
we can consider it further, but it is perfectly reasonable for the
negative procedure to be used for a Bill in which the principles are
clearly set out and the detail will be established by order in
secondary legislation. I shall say a little more about the structure of
the Bill and some changes that we wish to make to it in
Committee.</p><p><a name="0606054000178"><b><a name="0606054000569">Keith
Vaz (Leicester, East) (Lab):</b> I welcome the Bill and my
right hon. Friend&#146;s commitment to improving the system. Does she
agree that one way in which we can deal with such matters quicker is
that once a constituent makes a complaint to the health authority, it
should give that person as much information as possible? There should
be as much information and detail as possible to enable people to
decide how they wish to proceed. In far too many cases, even in the
authority that we both share, the information is not detailed.
Consequently, people feel that they must seek legal
advice.</p><p><a name="0606054000179"><b><a name="0606054000570">Ms
Hewitt:</b> My hon. Friend is right. Trying to get a much
faster and more open response to complaints and things that have gone
wrong is precisely what the Bill 
<br><notus-date day="5" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>5 Jun 2006 : Column 25</b><br>tackles. As he suggests, all too often, patients and their families feel
that the harm that the original incident did is compounded by delays in
investigating the complaint and especially by the legal system that
deals with clinical negligence cases. Too often, it is perceived as
complicated, slow, unfair and costly in time as well as legal fees.
Patients and their families often do not get either the explanation or
the apology that they want.</p><p><a name="0606054000180">It is also fair to say that the
system is equally unsatisfactory from the point of view of NHS staff
because clinicians can end up spending far too much time on legal
processes which they could be using to care for other patients. Staff
morale can be damaged, and because the current arrangements encourage a
culture of defensiveness, the NHS loses the opportunity to use the
experience and information that patients provide to improve care and
clinical practice for the future.</p><p><a name="0606054000181">Growing dissatisfaction with all
those problems led the chief medical officer for England, Sir Liam
Donaldson, to produce his report, &#147;Making Amends&#148; in
2003, which set out a series of recommendations for reforming the way
in which the NHS responds to clinical negligence. I am sure that hon.
Members of all parties will want to join me in paying tribute to Sir
Liam, who is an outstanding champion of patient
safety.</p><p><a name="0606054000182">The Bill
effects Sir Liam&#146;s recommendation to introduce a much simpler
and faster NHS redress scheme. It also responds to the recommendations
of the health service ombudsman, Ann Abraham, in her report on the NHS
complaints procedure, which was published earlier this
year.</p><p><a name="0606054000183"><b><a name="0606054000571">Mr.
David Kidney (Stafford) (Lab):</b> Does the Bill provide for a
hospital complaints system? If I read clause 1 (5), (6) and (7)
correctly, primary care is excluded and it would take further primary
legislation to set up a similar scheme for primary care, where
approximately 90 per cent. of health care takes place. That does not
make
sense.</p><p><a name="0606054000184"><b><a name="0606054000572">Ms
Hewitt:</b> My hon. Friend&#146;s first point is
correct&#151;the scheme was designed to deal with clinical negligence
in hospitals. However, as a result of discussions in another place, we
have extended it to relate to hospital services that are provided
outside the hospital building. The Bill does not&#151;and is not
intended to&#151; cover GPs who provide primary care, for the simple
reason that most GPs are independent contractors to the NHS. They have
their own arrangements through private indemnity insurance for dealing
with cases of clinical negligence that arise. That is why the Bill will
not cover primary care services under the general medical services
contract.</p><p><a name="0606054000185"><b><a name="0606054000573">John
Bercow:</b> The Secretary of State has already been generous
in giving way. For the avoidance of doubt, I stress that the principle
that underlies the Bill is sound and reasonable. The right hon. Lady
gave me the facial impression that she thought my point was narrow,
anorakish or even&#151;perish the thought&#151;tendentious. Let me
simply say that it was not. The Leader of the House, who is present,
will understand the genesis of the question, because I appeared before 
<br><notus-date day="5" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>5 Jun 2006 : Column 26</b><br>the Modernisation Committee last week and made a similar point. May I
ask the Secretary of State to accept that, often, what is well
intentioned goes wrong through poor secondary legislation and that it
might help the House if we could have a draft of the order-making
powers before the Bill&#146;s final stages, not to undermine but to
improve
it?</p><p><a name="0606054000186"><b><a name="0606054000574">Ms
Hewitt:</b> I entirely accept the hon. Gentleman&#146;s good
faith and his support for at least the principle of the Bill. It will
not be possible to publish draft orders before the completion of its
passage, for the simple reason that there needs to be an extended
period of formal and informal consultation with patients and other
stakeholders about the detail of the redress scheme. The hon. Gentleman
may well say that that reinforces the case for the affirmative action
procedure to be used, and that is a matter to which I am certainly
prepared to give further consideration, although I think that the point
that he makes will be best met by the thorough process of consultation
on the detail of the orders before we bring them back to the House. We
will certainly publish them in draft before we bring them to the House
under, as we propose at present, the negative order-making
procedure.</p><p><a name="0606054000187">The Bill
was introduced in the other place and comes to us in an amended form. I
will return to that point in a moment, because the significant
amendment was the introduction of clause 12, with which we are not
happy. I should like first to say a little more about the kind of case
that will be covered by the new redress scheme and how the scheme will
work.</p><p><a name="0606054000188">The Bill sets out
the framework that will enable us to establish an NHS redress scheme to
deal with clinical negligence claims arising out of NHS hospital
treatment, brought by patients, their dependents or, in the worst
cases, their estates. It is intended to cover cases where compensation
awarded by a court would be no more than &#163;20,000. We have
selected that figure because in the majority of such cases the legal
costs of bringing the action are wholly disproportionate to the
compensation awarded. The new scheme will not extend patients&#146;
rights to compensation&#151;it will not create new rights&#151;but
by creating a simpler, faster route to redress, it will significantly
improve access to justice for those with rights that already exist
under current
law.</p><p><a name="0606054000189"><b><a name="0606054000575">Mr.
Nick Hurd (Ruislip-Northwood) (Con):</b> I understand the
point that the Secretary of State makes about the upper limit, but can
she tell us what proportion of cases fall within the &#163;20,000
limit?</p><p><a name="0606054000190"><b><a name="0606054000576">Ms
Hewitt:</b> As I said a moment ago, the majority of clinical
negligence cases that are settled involve compensation of less of
&#163;20,000. In the past couple of years, in slightly more than half
of the cases settled for between &#163;10,000 and &#163;20,000, the
legal costs exceeded the damages. For cases settled below
&#163;10,000, legal costs exceed compensation in some 90 per cent. of
cases. That is not a satisfactory situation.</p><p><a name="0606054000191">I shall give an example of a
case that was dealt with by the health service ombudsman, because it
had not been properly dealt with by the hospital concerned. A woman,
Mrs. X, injured her foot in a fall. She went to 
<br><notus-date day="5" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>5 Jun 2006 : Column 27</b><br>accident and emergency, where X-rays were taken, and she was told that
she had sprained her ankle and did not need any treatment. A few weeks
later, when she was still in pain, she saw a consultant orthopaedic
surgeon who confirmed that the X-ray showed no fracture. The ankle was
put in plaster and Mrs. X later had physiotherapy. Still in pain, she
went back to the consultant in October 1998 and he arranged an
exploratory operation, which took place in February 1999. In July 1999,
on reviewing the original X-rays, the consultant surgeon realised that
Mrs. X had, in fact, sustained a fracture of the heel bone. She was
only told about that in September 1999&#151;18 months after she first
attended accident and
emergency.</p><p><a name="0606054000192">The issue
should have been dealt with by the hospital trust involved, but as it
was not, the ombudsman&#146;s clinical assessor identified a very
obvious extensive fracture of the heel bone that had unfortunately been
missed by both the consultant radiologist and consultant surgeon. If
the diagnosis had been right at the outset, Mrs. X would have had the
right treatment, instead of being subjected to what proved to be an
unnecessary and painful operation. Once the ombudsman had intervened in
the case, the trust apologised to Mrs. X and paid her damages of about
&#163;12,000. Of course, that should have happened on the initiative
of the trust, without the need for the ombudsman&#146;s
intervention.</p><p><a name="0606054000193">The new
redress scheme that the Bill will establish will encourage all the
hospitals that it covers&#151;NHS trusts, foundation hospitals and
independent providers&#151;to take action themselves on cases like
that of Mrs. X, to seek them out even if a complaint is not made, to
investigate the facts and, where clinical negligence is established, to
apologise, to learn the lessons and, where appropriate, to offer
compensation.

Shailesh Vara (North-West Cambridgeshire) (Con):</b> Hospitals
and other medical institutions will be encouraged to be proactive in
this respect, but will there be quotas or targets for those
institutions that could count against them if more actions resulted in
payments being made? If that is to be the case, hospitals&#146; chief
executives might not encourage their staff to be proactive in offering
such payments.</p><p><a name="0606054000195"><b><a name="0606054000578">Ms
Hewitt:</b> The hon. Gentleman makes an extremely important
point. However, our intention is precisely the opposite. It is to
encourage a much more open culture in which doctors and other
clinicians feel that they can own up to and learn from their
mistakes&#151;as is already best practice&#151;rather than finding
themselves in an adversarial situation in which they might deny that
anything had gone wrong, possibly at the behest of their lawyers or
their insurance company. I shall deal in a moment with the role of the
Healthcare Commission, which will have the important responsibility of
ensuring that each hospital trust&#151;each scheme member&#151;is
applying and operating the scheme in the way that is
intended.</p><p><a name="0606054000196"><b><a name="0606054000579">Steve

independence in the process?

independent scrutiny and a genuinely independent assessment of their
compensation.</p><p><a name="0606054000197"><b><a name="0606054000580">Ms

another place. There will be important independent elements in the
scheme, however, including the right to free independent legal advice
before any settlement is accepted.</p><p><a name="0606054000198">The new scheme will not simply
change the way in which complaints like those of Mrs. X are dealt with.
Even more importantly, it will also require hospitals to identify all
cases of possible negligence, whether or not there has been a complaint
from the patient concerned. When a trust considers that a case could
fall within the scheme, it will obtain the patient&#146;s permission
to refer the case to the scheme authority. The scheme authority, which
we intend to be the NHS Litigation Authority, will assess liability and
the appropriate level of damages. Where liability exists, the trust
will offer an explanation and an apology. Where appropriate, an offer
of financial compensation will be made, broadly equivalent to the level
of compensation that could be awarded in a successful claim before a
court.</p><p><a name="0606054000199"><b><a name="0606054000581">Hywel
Williams (Caernarfon) (PC):</b> As the Secretary of State
knows, a large number of people from Wales are treated in England. Will
she explain to the House how cases involving such people will be
handled, given that the Welsh Assembly may or may not decide to set up
a similar system in
Wales?</p><p><a name="0606054000200"><b><a name="0606054000582">Ms

hospital, that hospital would, as a scheme member, be covered by the
new redress scheme. If any of the hon. Gentleman&#146;s constituents
were in the unhappy position of having such a problem, they should be
covered by the new scheme. As he says, it is up to the Welsh Assembly
to decide whether it wishes to use the framework provided in the Bill
to apply the scheme to NHS hospitals in
Wales.</p><p><a name="0606054000201"><b><a name="0606054000583">Mr.

many of my constituents are treated in Scottish hospitals&#151;either
Borders general or one of the Edinburgh hospitals&#151;but under the

them?</p><p><a name="0606054000202"><b><a name="0606054000584">Ms

Gentleman was making. My answer is that the Bill does not apply to
hospitals in Scotland. It will be for the Scottish Parliament to decide
whether it wishes to introduce an equivalent scheme. The NHS in
Scotland is a devolved responsibility; I believe that to be the case.
If I am wrong, I will no doubt shortly be corrected. It follows from
the logic of the scheme that it applies to the hospital organisations
that are members of it&#151;in other words, NHS trusts, foundation
trusts and independent providers to the NHS in
England.</p><p><a name="0606054000205"><b><a name="0606054000587">Mr.
Beith:</b> If treatment in a Scottish hospital is commissioned
by an English health authority, which in most examples would expect
either to be paying the Scottish authority or at least to have some
reciprocal arrangement for cases that cross the border, surely the
provisions referring to treatment outside the hospital, or indeed
outside England, will
apply?</p><p><a name="0606054000206"><b><a name="0606054000588">Ms

that he is talking about treatment commissioned by the English
NHS&#151;in other words, a primary care trust in England is
responsible for the treatment, even though it is being given in a
Scottish hospital.</p><p><a name="0606054000207">If
criminal negligence is involved, and the patient therefore has a claim
that could arise under English law, the scheme will apply. I hope that
that is clear. If not, this is a matter that the Minister of State, my
hon. Friend the Member for Leigh (Andy Burnham), can return to later in
the debate. If necessary, I shall write to the right hon. Gentleman to
go through the detail of the application of the scheme where devolved
boundaries are
crossed.</p><p><a name="0606054000208">The new
redress scheme will offer patients a simpler and faster alternative to
a court case, but it will not&#151;this is an important
point&#151;remove a patient&#146;s right to bring legal
proceedings. If the patient decides to reject an offer under the
scheme, or if no offer of compensation is made, the patient will still
be able to pursue the matter through the courts, or, if the patient
wishes, to go direct to the courts and not use the redress scheme.
However, where the redress scheme is used and where an offer of
compensation is made, legal advice will be provided to the patient free
of charge in relation to the offer and any settlement under the
scheme.</p><p><a name="0606054000209"><b><a name="0606054000589">Mr.
Philip Hollobone (Kettering) (Con):</b> In making proposals
for the redress scheme, what comparisons did the Secretary of State
make with other international schemes, and where does she see this
scheme in the new international league table? Could we do rather better
than she is
suggesting?</p><p><a name="0606054000210"><b><a name="0606054000590">Ms
Hewitt:</b> When the chief medical officer undertook his
review for the report to which I referred earlier, he looked at a
number of other countries and the variety of schemes&#151;often
called, sometimes wrongly, no-fault compensation schemes&#151;that
exist, for instance, in Scandinavia, New Zealand and so on; but for a
variety of reasons, which he spelled out in that report, he felt, and
the Government concur, that it would not be suitable to try to
introduce a so-called no-fault compensation scheme, not least because 
<br><notus-date day="5" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>5 Jun 2006 : Column 30</b><br>people would end up arguing about what caused the damage, even if they
were not arguing about where the fault lay. That is why he recommended
a scheme along the lines of that provided for in the Bill. We have
accepted that
recommendation.</p><p><a name="0606054000211">My hon.
Friend the Member for Stafford (Mr. Kidney) raised the question whether
the scheme is confined to hospital services. Originally, that was our
intention, but we listened carefully to the debate in another place and
the Bill, as presented in this House, will enable the scheme to be
extended through secondary legislation to services over and above
hospital services. For instance, services that fall into the grey area
between primary and secondary care can be brought within the scope of
the scheme. That is particularly important as changing medical practice
and technology allow more of what we think of as hospital care to be
delivered in the
community.</p><p><a name="0606054000212">I
referred to discussions in another place. One significant change was
made there that we cannot endorse. We intend to try to delete clause 12
in Committee. The Bill as originally published provided for a coherent
redress scheme focusing on the speedy resolution of cases after full
investigation by scheme members at local level, giving full redress to
patients through a single-stage scheme, and encouraging and
facilitating local learning in hospitals from mistakes that had
occurred.</p><p><a name="0606054000213">What I do
not like about the amendments made in the other place is their creation
of a two-stage scheme involving two administrative bodies, which we
believe will prove too costly and bureaucratic. It allows investigators
to act independently of a hospital, which will work against the aim of
encouraging local learning and a more open culture. The Healthcare
Commission will be charged with supervising the work of the
investigators. The commission believes that that would be inappropriate
and would not sit well with its current expertise and
role.</p><p><a name="0606054000214"><b><a name="0606054000591">Mr.
Andrew Lansley (South Cambridgeshire) (Con):</b> The Secretary
of State seems to have skipped the point of principle involved in the
amendments and concentrated on detail. The point of principle is that
patients who make a complaint or, indeed, a claim against an NHS trust
expect and need an independent investigation. Is the Secretary of State
saying that the amendments are wrong because investigations should not
be independent? It seems to us an essential point of principle that
they should be.</p><p><a name="0606054000215"><b><a name="0606054000592">Ms
Hewitt:</b> That is precisely where we differ. In the original
Bill we provided for a single scheme allowing a hospital trust to
identify untoward incidents that might well involve clinical
negligence, as well as dealing with complaints made to it directly by
patients or their families. The trust would investigate and ascertain
the facts and, with the patient&#146;s consent, would refer the case
to the scheme authority, the NHS Litigation Authority, to establish
liability and an appropriate level of compensation. The patient would,
however, have access to independent legal advice and, in some cases, to
independent medical advice as well, because independent medical advice
might well be needed to establish the full facts.</p><br><notus-date day="5" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>5 Jun 2006 : Column 31</b><br><p><a name="0606054000216">Because the scheme originally
proposed does not replace or deny a patient&#146;s right to go to
court, we believe that it is proper and sensible to stick to it. We
think that there should be an integrated investigation system and a
single authority, the NHS Litigation Authority, overseeing the scheme,
rather than the two-part process established in the other
place.</p><p><a name="0606054000217"><b><a name="0606054000593">Mr.
Lansley:</b> Does the Secretary of State realise that a
patient to whom injury may have been done will expect not just an
independent investigation, but an investigation that is not conducted
in circumstances involving a clear conflict of interest between
establishing the facts and the degree of liability andthe
amount of compensation to be paid? The Government&#146;s scheme
allows such a conflict, which will drive patients to the point of
pursuing claims through litigation rather than using the fact-finding
mechanism introduced by their lordships to seek redress from
trusts.</p><p><a name="0606054000218"><b><a name="0606054000594">Ms
Hewitt:</b> Our scheme is entirely designed to respond to what
patients tell us they need: much faster investigation of complaints,
much faster establishment of what went wrong, and real learning of
lessons. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman has heard from his
constituents something that I hear regularly: &#147;What I want is
for lessons to be learned from what happened to me, so that someone in
the same position does not suffer in the same way.&#148;</p><p><a name="0606054000219">Those people want compensation
to be paid, where appropriate. By having a single scheme under the
aegis of the NHS Litigation Authority, we believe that we can most
effectively respond to the wishes of patients and&#151;this is part
of what patients rightly want&#151;ensure that there is an open
culture and a culture of learning in NHS and other
hospitals.</p><p><a name="0606054000220"><b><a name="0606054000595">Sandra
Gidley (Romsey) (LD):</b> I think that we would all agree with
those aims, but the Secretary of State has not explained what the
problem is with the scrutiny being independent, so that it has greater
authority in the eyes of the patient. As has been explained, we should
be focusing on the
patient.</p><p><a name="0606054000221"><b><a name="0606054000596">Ms
Hewitt:</b> The problem&#151;I was just starting to make the
point&#151;is that the scheme would be more complex and more
cumbersome if we had completely independent investigators and we had
two separate organisations, with the Healthcare Commission overseeing
the work of the investigators and maintaining the register of
independent investigators. We were told in another place that those
supporting the amendments had in mind the coroners model. For anyone
who has dealt with constituents who have been through a difficult
inquest, that is not a particularly happy model. We would have the NHS
Litigation Authority looking at liability and the appropriate level of
damages, and no single body would be responsible for oversight of the
operation of the redress scheme as a whole. As I said a moment ago, the
Healthcare Commission&#151;we consulted about that possible new
role&#151;is very clear that neither the validation and accreditation
of staff nor the oversight of local 
<br><notus-date day="5" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>5 Jun 2006 : Column 32</b><br>investigators would fit sensibly with its current remit. Nor does it
believe that it would have the expertise to undertake those
roles.</p><p><a name="0606054000222">A further and
not negligible point is that the potential cost of establishing a
completely separate set of independent investigators could amount,
depending on how many complaints were brought, to
another&#163;40 million or so a year. I do not believe that
the benefits that have been claimed for the independent investigators
would be realised. They would not justify those additional
costs.</p><p><a name="0606054000223"><b><a name="0606054000597">Mr.
Vara:</b> This is an issue of credibility. I do not agree with
all the arguments that the Secretary of State has advanced but, even if
they were to be the case, is she suggesting that there should be a
system that is not credible, as opposed to having an independent system
that is credible? She seems to be veering towards a not credible
situation.</p><p><a name="0606054000224"><b><a name="0606054000598">Ms
Hewitt:</b> I do not accept the Opposition&#146;s charge
that the scheme that we proposed would not be credible. Indeed, the
principle of the Bill, the way in which we intend to proceed and the
recommendations of the chief medical officer have been welcomed by a
number of patients organisations and others involved in these matters.
We have, of course, put in place additional safeguards to ensure that
the scheme works in the way in which we intend and believe that it
will. We want the Healthcare Commission to have a specific role
providing training to the hospital trusts and the scheme members on the
way in which the redress scheme will operate. We will ensure that the
Healthcare Commission&#146;s annual review of the provision of health
care by NHS bodies will consider how effectively each of those hospital
trusts is operating the redress scheme. In other words, there will be a
new standard relating to redress and the Healthcare Commission will
review the operation of the scheme against the new
criteria.</p><p><a name="0606054000225"><b><a name="0606054000599">Rob
Marris (Wolverhampton, South-West) (Lab):</b> I think that a
simple scheme is a good idea, particularly when there is still access
to the courts, but clause 8(3) refers, in shorthand, to a list of legal
people who could provide advice upon an offer. That list is to be
prepared by &#147;a specified person&#148;. Can my right hon.
Friend assure me that that specified person will be totally independent
of the Department of Health? For example, it may be the Law Society of
England and Wales, of which I am a member and which has a panel of
clinical negligence experts.</p><p><a name="0606054000226"><b><a name="0606054000600">Ms
Hewitt:</b> I can certainly give my hon. Friend that
assurance. In fact, we envisage that the Legal Services Commission,
which holds its own list of appropriate clinical negligence lawyers for
legal aid purposes, will fulfil that
function.</p><p><a name="0606054000227">In addition
to the role of the Healthcare Commission, clause 15 enables the
independent health service ombudsman to investigate complaints about
any maladministration of the redress scheme. Ann Abraham, the
ombudsman, has welcomed the fact that the scheme&#146;s operation
will fall clearly within her jurisdiction. She believes that the fact
that an independent review of complaints about the scheme 
<br><notus-date day="5" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>5 Jun 2006 : Column 33</b><br>will be available will give reassurance to those using the scheme, to
complainants and to the NHS bodies
involved.</p><p><a name="0606054000228">May I revert
to a point made earlier by the hon. Member for Buckingham (John
Bercow), who has since left the Chamber? I should like to correct an
answer that I gave about the negative procedure. The first regulation
establishing the scheme under the Bill will, in fact, be subject to the
affirmative procedure. I hope that that will reassure the hon.
Gentleman, and I shall make a point of drawing it to his
attention.</p>

<p><a name="0606054000229">There were
disagreements on clause 12 in the other place. Clearly, they will
follow us into Committee as well as into this debate. Despite those
disagreements, I believe that the Bill has been improved by more than
10 hours of discussion in another place. Following those debates, we
have already made other amendments to the Bill as originally
published.</p><p><a name="0606054000230">In clause
3, we put the offer of an apology into the Bill and we prevent caps on
individual heads of damage&#151;for instance, loss of earnings. That
makes it much clearer that payments received under the redress scheme
will be in line with those made through the
courts.</p><p><a name="0606054000231">We have
strengthened clause 8 to provide that legal advice must be available on
the offer of redress and a settlement
agreement.</p><p><a name="0606054000232"><b><a name="0606054000601">Steve
Webb:</b> The Secretary of State has twice referred to some
free legal advice being available. Will she confirm that it is
extremely limited in scope? It comes at the end of the procedure, not
at the start when it would be most useful. There will not be enough
time for a lawyer to go through the whole detail of the case and
appraise the adequacy of an assessment. The lawyer will come in at the
end, have a glance and have little time to do much more. Would not
legal advice of the sort the Secretary of State talks about be more
useful to people throughout the process rather than only at the
end?</p><p><a name="0606054000233"><b><a name="0606054000602">Ms
Hewitt:</b> It lies absolutely at the heart of the redress
scheme that we will be able to give quicker responses and better
compensation to patients, rather than paying greater fees to lawyers. I
am quite certain that lawyers will argue, as some outside the House
have already, that much more legal advice should be made available all
the way through the process. If we do that, however, we might as well
stick with the existing situation in which people seek legal advice and
go to court. Given that the redress scheme does not rule out the
possibility of court action but will in many cases, I hope, replace it,
it is right that the independent legal advice should come at the end of
the process and that, in return for a fixed fee, an independent,
properly qualified lawyer will be able to look at what happened, the
medical evidence and what is proposed by way of compensation and
apology. No doubt, though, that is a point to which we shall return
later in this debate and in
Committee.</p><p><a name="0606054000234">Clause 8
also allows for a jointly instructed medical expert to be engaged at
any point throughout the redress scheme, where both the patient and the
trust feel that that would be helpful.</p><br><notus-date day="5" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>5 Jun 2006 : Column 34</b><br><p><a name="0606054000235"><b><a name="0606054000603">Rob
Marris:</b> May I caution my right hon. Friend? As one who did
personal injury cases for many years before entering this
place&#151;indeed, I think that I am still on the Law
Society&#146;s personal injury panel&#151;I know that in many
circumstances it is very difficult for a lawyer to give advice on the
adequacy of an offer of quantum unless that lawyer knows how strong the
case is on liability. If an offer was made at, say, half of what full
liability would command, but the liability case for the individual
would be weak were the matter to go to court, the lawyer might advise
someone to accept a half offer. When the Secretary of State considers
the scheme and the regulations, I would caution her that the lawyer
will need to be able to look to some extent at liability before he or
she can advise adequately on quantum, unless the lawyer wants to get
sued.</p><p><a name="0606054000236"><b><a name="0606054000604">Ms
Hewitt:</b> My hon. Friend has a great deal of valuable
experience in this matter, but his point seems to reinforce the case
for independent legal advice to be available at the end of the process,
where, of course, the lawyer can look not only at the details of what
happened and any independent medical assessment that has been made, but
at the assessment by the NHS Litigation Authority about liability, as
well as the level of
damages.</p><p><a name="0606054000237"><b><a name="0606054000605">Mr.
Si&#244;n Simon (Birmingham, Erdington) (Lab):</b> Is there
not some confusion? The Secretary of State is explaining why, in her
view, the advice can only come at the end, while admitting that the
Government amendments in the Lords to clauses 6 and 8 appear to suggest
that there is scope for giving advice throughout the process and for
using jointly instructed experts. The right hon. Member for Liverpool,
Wavertree (Jane Kennedy) certainly gave the impression in her letter to
the Constitutional Affairs Committee that the Government would look
sympathetically on that kind of reading of those amendments in the
secondary legislation. I am a bit confused about what message the
Secretary of State is trying to give to
us.</p><p><a name="0606054000238"><b><a name="0606054000606">Ms
Hewitt:</b> The Bill, as originally published, established
quite clearly that legal advice could be available. We have
strengthened that to ensure that legal advice must be available on the
offer of redress and the settlement agreement. So that will come at the
end of the process and enable the patient to make an informed judgment
about whether to accept the offer or to reject it and pursue a court
case instead. However, as a result of debate in another place, clause 8
will allow the patient and the trust together to instruct an
independent medical expert, during the investigation of the incident or
the complaint, to ensure that there is a full and agreed diagnosis of
what has gone wrong.</p><p><a name="0606054000239">We have also introduced an
amendment to clause 10 to enable the scheme to require the hospitals
and trusts that are members of the scheme to prepare and publish an
annual report about the cases that they have dealt with under the
redress scheme and the lessons learned from them. Clause 14 will
provide the power to ensure that wrongly directed complaints under the
scheme are redirected to the appropriate
body.</p><p><a name="0606054000240"><b><a name="0606054000607">Ms

at the moment is that they simply do not respond in what seems to be a
reasonable
time.</p><p><a name="0606054000241"><b><a name="0606054000608">Ms
Hewitt:</b> My hon. Friend makes a very important point. Like
her, I have dealt with constituents who have been intensely frustrated
by the length of time taken to get the facts acknowledged and a proper
apology offered. I am rather sympathetic to the point that she makes,
although we have not yet considered the possibility of trying to impose
time limits at different stages of complaints. Of course, such time
limits would depend somewhat on the complexity of the matter that was
being investigated, but I am sympathetic to the principle, and that is
a point to which we should return not only in Committee, but
particularly when we consult on the detailed orders that will establish
the scheme.</p><p><a name="0606054000242">Clearly,
there will be lively debates, not only this afternoon but in Committee,
about some aspects of the redress scheme&#151;in particular, the
nature of the investigation that should take place&#151;but I believe
that, overall, not only in the House but across the country, there is
broad support for the principles behind the Bill, and I commend it to
the
House.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="0606054000439">4.18

Andrew Lansley (South Cambridgeshire) (Con):</b> On behalf of
the Conservative party, I welcome the Bill, particularly in the form in
which it has come to us from another place. The Secretary of State is
quite right to say that, every day, tens of thousands of patients are
treated in our hospitals. They are grateful to NHS staff for the care
and attention that they give, and successful treatment is provided to
the highest standards in the overwhelming majority of cases.</p><p><a name="0606054000244">The Secretary of State will also
be aware that, as in other health care systems across the world, a
small fraction of treatments give rise to adverse events, and a tiny
fraction of those adverse events give rise to injury. We need to pay
very careful attention to those cases&#151;not least, as she says, to
learn the lessons and constantly to improve the quality of care. I am
sure that she and the Minister of State, Department of Health, the hon.
Member for Leigh (Andy Burnham), who has taken up ministerial
responsibility for patient safety and quality, will pay very close
attention to the progress of the National Patient Safety
Agency&#146;s reporting scheme, which, like so many other schemes, is
running late. I am sure that it will speed up under the
Minister&#146;s
whip.</p><p><a name="0606054000245">We cannot
underestimate the importance of these matters, because for patients who
are affected and for those who suffer injury, such events can be very
serious indeed. All of us as MPs will have had such cases in our
constituencies; I have certainly had a number. Indeed, the Minister of
State, Department of Health, the hon. Member for Doncaster, Central (Ms
Winterton) will recall our debates on the Human Tissue Bill, and the
fact that that legislation itself gave rise to quite a number of
cases&#151;certainly in my constituency&#151;of 
<br><notus-date day="5" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>5 Jun 2006 : Column 36</b><br>constituents feeling very strongly that the way in which the NHS dealt
with them portrayed precisely some of the unfortunate issues with which
we are now trying to get to grips. The truth of what had happened was
not acknowledged and the facts were not made available&#151;in some
cases for many years. Even when the facts were transparent, for reasons
of not admitting liability, they did not give rise to an apology or a
decent explanation, or any intention to provide substantial redress. As
it happened, my constituents were not seeking financial compensation;
they were driven to the courts by the failure of the NHS to accept
liability and responsibility, and to provide proper explanations and an
apology. That is principally what they were looking for.</p><p><a name="0606054000246">We should start by recognising
the fact that strictly speaking, this legislation is not required for
the NHS to provide the facts, an explanation or an apology. All those
things can happen now, and should happen now. They should not happen
only as a result of this Bill. This legislation is not an alternative
to litigation; it should provide a basis in difficult cases, where the
facts are not easily found and where fault is not easily established,
for a much more patient-friendly way to
proceed.</p><p><a name="0606054000247"><b><a name="0606054000610">Michael
Fabricant (Lichfield) (Con):</b> My hon. Friend talked about
examples that he has encountered in his constituency as a Member of
Parliament. Does he agree that sometimes the saddest cases are those of
a husband or wife complaining to him about the death of a spouse in
hospital? Even if the hospital is not at fault, would not an
independent inquiry conducted into the hospital have more resonance
with the complainant than the hospital saying, &#147;It is not we who
are to blame&#148;?</p><p><a name="0606054000248"><b><a name="0606054000611">Mr.
Lansley:</b> My hon. Friend is quite right. I am sure
that he, like me, has had constituents coming to him to talk about a
relative&#151;a husband or wife perhaps&#151;who had died in
hospital, and about the fact that they knew that things had gone wrong.
Such events may or may not give rise to a claim for clinical
negligence. We are of course dealing in the Bill with something that
concerns an issue in tort&#151;an injury resulting from that, which
can be claimed for through a court. Such people have often said to
me&#151;and, I am sure, to my hon. Friend&#151;that they are
looking for a recognition of the truth of what happened and a
reassurance that it will not happen again.</p><p><a name="0606054000249">People would often take
tremendous comfort from knowing that an event would not happen
again&#151;but I am afraid that people are not confident about that.
I know from personal experience that the patient advice and liaison
services in the hospitals in my constituency&#151;I have two large
hospitals there&#151;go to enormous lengths to try to establish the
facts of what happened. I have been very impressed on many occasions by
the detail that the service has gone into. However, that does not mean
that my constituents are satisfied about the independence and veracity
of what is said. A degree of independence is
required.</p><p><a name="0606054000250">The Secretary
of State talked about independent medical experts, but patients are
looking for an investigation into a matter that is serious and has
resulted in their injury, and about which they might 
<br><notus-date day="5" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>5 Jun 2006 : Column 37</b><br>otherwise go to court. They want that independence of investigation,
because it gives them the confidence to be able to reach a settlement
or to accept an explanation, an apology and some redress from the NHS,
without feeling that they have to have their day in
court.</p><p><a name="0606054000251">We are not
trying to establish an alternative courts procedure through the system,
but if it is independent, members of the public may certainly be able
to treat the process as if it were their day in court. They will have
the facts examined, they will know what happened and they can insist on
the lessons being learned. That point comes home.</p><p><a name="0606054000252">To an extent, we have been
talking about complaints in general. The Bill is about a distinct
subset of complaints that give rise to this kind of claim. However,
across the complaints procedure we can see how often members of the
public and patients want an independent investigation. That has
happened in so far as they have been given the opportunity to go to the
Healthcare Commission. Previously, people had community health
councils, which often supported complainants. The Government took that
away from them. <i> [</i><i> Interruption.</i><i> ]</i> There is an
independent complaints service. Many members of the public go to the
Healthcare Commission, not least because they want the independence of
the commission&#146;s
investigation.</p><p><a name="0606054000253">The hon.
Member for Birmingham, Edgbaston (Ms Stuart) just asked about time
limits. She is right. There is sometimes a case for considering how
long it is taking to examine complaints. I applaud much of the
Healthcare Commission&#146;s work, but it has had to set limits on
the time that it will take to examine complaints. I am a bit
disappointed because in letters I have had from the Healthcare
Commission, it is perfectly clear that those time limits do not apply
to the existing backlog of cases. There will be some cases that are
taking a long time and there will be no certainty about how long it
will take to resolve them. That gives an indication of the volume of
activity that we are dealing with and how important it is to members of
the public that cases do not go on for months. Sometimes it takes more
than a year to resolve a case.</p><p><a name="0606054000254"><b><a name="0606054000612">Rob

the Bill 
<br><notus-date day="5" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>5 Jun 2006 : Column 38</b><br>as it stands&#151;it seems to me that if there is an independent
process, at least there is a reasonable chance of there not being a
delay occasioned by the interests of the trust itself. At least if
there is some delay, it will be as a consequence of the volume and
complexity of the cases being dealt with. I hope that the independence
of the system and the ability to appoint independent redress
investigators will give greater flexibility, rather than having things
determined simply by the resources of the NHS Litigation Authority, as
the Government propose.</p><p><a name="0606054000258"><b><a name="0606054000616">Mr.
Brian Jenkins (Tamworth) (Lab):</b> The one thing that strikes
me as a common chord is that I do not believe that there is any
financial difference between an independent and an in-house
investigation, in so far as there is an opportunity cost in taking
surgeons and doctors away from their duties. My main concern is that if
independent people are brought in, they will not know the operating
methods in the hospital, so it will take them longer to get to the
nitty-gritty of the affairs, to get to the people that they need to
reach, and to get the information. I am talking about that time delay.
Those people might not come up with the same degree of accuracy when
they carry out the investigation. That is my difficulty with the
independent aspects.</p><p><a name="0606054000259"><b><a name="0606054000617">Mr.
Lansley:</b> I do not agree with that. Let us face it, under
the system that the Government propose, even though it is not
independent, there must be a fact-finding process before moving on to a
fault-finding process. The Government themselves propose that there
should be independent medical experts, who, by their nature, will
presumably not be employed by the trust in question, so there will be a
degree of independent scrutiny. Frankly, that must be essential because
in the absence of independent scrutiny, I am sure that patients would
not regard the outcome of an investigation&#151;whether in the form
that the Government propose or that which we propose&#151;as having
the necessary validity for them to accept any kind of redress. There
must be a degree of
independence.</p><p><a name="0606054000260"><b><a name="0606054000618">Ms

Lansley:</b> I am sure that that would, in part, depend on the
nature of the facts that needed to be established. We are talking about
a fact-finding investigation following an assertion of clinical
negligence, so it would be likely that those people would be medically
trained and, of course, independent of the trust in question. I am sure
that Ministers would expect there to be a degree of independent medical
investigation, as would be the case under their proposal that
independent medical experts be available.</p><br><notus-date day="5" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>5 Jun 2006 : Column 39</b><br><p><a name="0606054000264">I thank their lordships for their
amendments to the Bill. They have given us a Bill that would enable us
to set up a scheme that would be coherent and with chances of success
that did not exist previously. I especially pay tribute to the work of
my noble Friend Earl Howe, on behalf of my party, and that of Baroness
Neuberger and Baroness Barker, who speak for the Liberal Democrats.
They created a consensus in another place on amending the Bill in such
a substantial way.</p><p><a name="0606054000265">As
has been illustrated by the nature of our discussions so far today, the
debate is not party political, but one of policy and practice. The
arguments clearly point towards the merit of the Bill as it stands, so
the Government would do well to accept the Lords amendments, rather
than trying to reverse them. I was thus sorry to hear the Secretary of
State say that the Government wish to change the Bill. Government
Members will support the Bill&#146;s Second Reading and endorse its
principles, but clearly there is a major principle at the heart of the
Bill that the Government do not endorse, which, I fear, shows once
again that they, and the Department of Health in particular, do not
have the sureness of touch that is needed to deliver better policy. In
this case, they would do well to show a degree of humility and accept
that there is conceivably a better policy than that which they
originally put
forward.</p><p><a name="0606054000266">Our policy on
clinical negligence is simple. Any patient who is injured by negligent
treatment should be entitled to compensation. There must be affordable
access to justice, and such justice must not lead to excessive
compensation or cost, because as we know, every penny lost in
litigation is a penny less available to provide patient care. We must
thus find a system that is fair, not prone to abuse or excess, not too
bureaucratic, and not exposed to speculative
claims.</p><p><a name="0606054000267">We welcome the
principles and intentions that underlie the Bill. We are pleased that
the Government recognise that clinical negligence litigation is in
serious need of reform. There is widespread concern that the
compensation system is complex, unfair, slow, costly and wasteful. The
process can be stressful for the parties involved&#151;both patients
and health care professionals. The Bill thus represents a limited step
towards addressing the
problems.</p><p><a name="0606054000268">The cost of
clinical negligence litigation to the health service in 2004-05 was
&#163;502 million. The contingent liability is estimated at several
billion pounds. Indeed&#151;the Secretary of State did not mention
this&#151;because of the changes in the relevant discount rate, the
contingent liability increased by &#163;635 million in the 2005-06
accounts alone.</p><p><a name="0606054000269">Of
course, legal aid provides the oxygen for medical litigation, because
most cases are publicly funded. Last year, 6,217 legally aided clinical
negligence cases were concluded. Of those, 2,574 went beyond the
investigation stage, and there was a substantive benefit to the
claimant in 56 per cent. of cases. Happily, I do not have to do the
arithmetic in my head, but the overall success rate for legally aided
clinical negligence cases was 23 per cent. That figure, which
represents about 1,400 cases, must be contrasted with the hundreds of
thousands of adverse clinical events that 
<br><notus-date day="5" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>5 Jun 2006 : Column 40</b><br>occur. Even if only a tiny proportion of those adverse events gives rise
to injury, it will be apparent to the House that there is still a huge
disparity between the number of possible negligence claims and the
number of cases that go on to litigation. Indeed, it is curious that a
high proportion&#151;perhaps three quarters&#151;of those that are
litigated prove not to have substance, while large numbers of potential
clinical negligence claims are not even
pursued.</p><p><a name="0606054000270"><b><a name="0606054000622">Steve
Webb:</b> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for giving way,
and for his comments about my noble Friends in another place; as he
says, we have worked closely
together.</p><p><a name="0606054000271">May I ask
about legal aid, which he just mentioned? The Secretary of State
effectively said, &#147;Well, people can go to court anyway,&#148;
but is it the hon. Gentleman&#146;s judgment that people who apply
for legal aid opt for negligence? Once NHS redress is up and running,
the legal aid people will say, &#147;Well, there is a redress scheme
and we aren&#146;t going to spend taxpayers&#146; money on legal
aid,&#148; so people on low incomes will not have the option of going
to
court.</p><p><a name="0606054000272"><b><a name="0606054000623">Mr.
Lansley:</b> That may be true, and I accept the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s point. I find it astonishing that the Secretary of
State did not talk about legal aid, because the problems of legal aid
go to the heart of the difficulties that we are experiencing with the
clinical negligence system. The Government&#146;s apparent desire to
avoid that fact is evidence that they have not thought through the
policy implications of dealing with the legal aid problems.</p><p><a name="0606054000273">Let us run through some of those
problems. Legal aid does not ensure access to justice for deserving
cases, as most people are not eligible. Instead, it provides access to
lawyers for an eligible minority. Legal aid lacks independence. Funding
is granted on the advice of the applicant&#146;s lawyer, so there is
a clear conflict of interest that may encourage over-optimistic advice,
to put it kindly, or speculative litigation, putting it less kindly.
Legal aid lacks fairness. Successful defendants cannot recover legal
costs. Legal aid puts the claimant in a no-lose position and the health
service defendant in a no-win position. It may be cheaper to settle a
claim regardless of merit, to avoid irrecoverable legal costs&#151;a
practice known as legal aid blackmail.</p><p><a name="0606054000274">The Secretary of State referred
to the legal costs that the NHS has incurred, and of course the
structure of legal aid is one of the reasons why the legal costs that
the NHS has had to meet have been so great. Legal aid lacks
accountability. Funding decisions involving public money are privileged
and confidential, and are not subject to public scrutiny. As a Member
of Parliament, I have sought to question some of the decisions made by
the Legal Services Commission about the people to whom they grant legal
aid. Frankly, that is an impenetrable question. The fact that it has
met and made a decision is regarded by the LSC as justification
enough.</p><p><a name="0606054000275">Most clinical
negligence cases are legally aided, but the great majority of
households do not qualify for legal aid. Is it the case that clinical
negligence harms only people eligible for legal aid? Of course not. It
is not a matter of cases not being brought because they 
<br><notus-date day="5" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>5 Jun 2006 : Column 41</b><br>lack merit; they are not brought because there is no legal aid
available. The record of legally aided claims involving health care is
dismal, as I said. In some instances, that has promoted unsubstantiated
health claims and scares based on junk science, threatening the health
of the nation&#146;s children. Too often, lawyers are the only
beneficiaries of publicly funded legal action. Scarce resources are
diverted from patient care to lawyers&#146; fees, all in the name of
justice and all paid for by the taxpayer.</p><p><a name="0606054000276">The solution to the problem of
clinical negligence litigation lies in the realm of funding. Legal aid
has brought relief to many people, but it is a popular misconception to
equate legal aid with access to justice. Access to justice is not best
delivered by the legal aid system. There is a better way to do that;
before the election, we said that we needed wider proposals to reform
clinical negligence&#151;I am sure we will return to that. The
reforms in the Bill are consistent with a wider reform, but no one
should believe that they are sufficient in themselves. However, it is
best to confine ourselves to the scope of the Bill, rather than try to
debate the wider question of the way in which legal aid can be
reformed.</p><p><a name="0606054000277">As the
Secretary of State mentioned, the origins of the Bill lie in the chief
medical officer&#146;s report, &#147;Making Amends&#148;, which
considered the problems highlighted by &#147;Options for
Change&#148;. The underlying policy of &#147;Making Amends&#148;
was to move away from a tort-based culture. It stated
that:</p><a name="0606054000426"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;tort sits so
uncomfortably in an NHS with an ethos of
equity&#148;.</p></ul><p><a name="0606054000278">Its
recommendations</p><a name="0606054000427"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;move the
role of tort from its current central position to the outer perimeter
of the NHS.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="0606054000279">However, the
report paid scant regard to the problems of legal aid. The Bill
recognises and exposes the failure of &#147;Making Amends&#148;. It
is not based on &#147;Making Amends&#148;. Instead of moving away
from tort, the Bill makes tort its centrepiece, in clear contradiction
of &#147;Making
Amends&#148;.</p><p><a name="0606054000280">That
report by Liam Donaldson contained 19 recommendations, of which 18 are
not addressed by the Bill. Indeed, the well-intentioned but
ill-considered recommendation No. 2, proposing a no-fault compensation
scheme for brain-damaged babies, was dropped last summer. The Bill
gives effect only to recommendation No. 1, not in the way that
&#147;Making Amends&#148; proposed, but at least by introducing an
NHS redress scheme to provide investigation when things go wrong,
remedial treatment, rehabilitation and care where needed, explanations
and apologies, and financial compensation in certain circumstances. It
applies where there is a qualifying liability in tort&#151;that is, a
breach of duty causing injury. This is the condition precedent to
qualify for the scheme. It is much narrower in scope than a complaint,
which may or may not involve
negligence.</p><p><a name="0606054000281">The Bill is
ambitious in its scope. It proposes a package of remedies&#151;a
one-stop shop providing different remedies. It represents enabling
legislation. The detail will be set out in secondary legislation. It
provides a skeleton framework of duties and powers to give effect to
the underlying policies, and it is the Government&#146;s underlying
policy that gives rise to our concerns.</p><br><notus-date day="5" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>5 Jun 2006 : Column 42</b><br><p><a name="0606054000282">The
Government&#146;s proposal seems to be mainly concerned with
compensation, as it can apply only where there is a qualifying
liability in tort. It appears to be conceived as an in-house
settlement-making process, rather than as an independent judicial
investigative process. Liability is to be assessed by the National
Health Service Litigation Authority, rather than determined by any
independent tribunal. Compensation is to be offered by the NHSLA,
rather than awarded by any independent person. We should remember that
the NHSLA is the body that carries the liability on behalf of scheme
members, so it has a vested interest in the matter.</p><p><a name="0606054000283">Any offers arising from the
process are to be made on a &#147;without prejudice&#148; basis.
Although facts or some degree of fault may be disclosed, if the
claimant&#151;the patient&#151;does not take up an offer and reach
a settlement, that disclosure cannot be used as the basis for a claim,
and no admission of liability can be derived from it. Offers are to be
accepted or rejected on a &#147;take it or leave it&#148;
basis.</p><p><a name="0606054000284">The situation in
clinical negligence is bad enough, but the Bill as originally drafted
would have made matters worse. The response of claimants to such a
process may well be to treat it as partial, and as no more than a
preliminary stage to legal action. Far from being an alternative to
litigation, it would, by virtue of its invitation to claim, have
generated more litigation, not less.</p><p><a name="0606054000285">The concept of a one-stop shop
is superficially attractive, but on closer inspection the Bill was
found to be fraught with problems. It sought to combine conflicting
functions and it confused fact finding with fault finding, an
inquisitorial process with an adversarial process, and open proceedings
with &#147;without prejudice&#148;
proceedings.</p><p><a name="0606054000286">We have
consulted widely in formulating our alternative approach, which is now
reflected in the Bill. The Government&#146;s willingness to tackle
the problems of clinical negligence was broadly welcomed. However,
there was a general recognition that the original Bill was
fundamentally flawed, and represented a wasted opportunity. In summary,
there was a single constant theme: the need for open, independent,
fact-finding investigation. The Bill as amended in their
lordships&#146; House reflects that simple point. The amendments have
given the Bill functional coherence, and place the interests and
priorities of patients at its core.</p><p><a name="0606054000287">Our first key concern has been
the need for independent investigation. Independence is a basic
principle of natural justice, enshrined in the rule against
bias&#151;that no man may be a judge in his own cause. The
investigation should not be concerned with issues of legal liability.
We should separate fact finding from fault finding. There is ample
judicial authority for that dichotomy. The Secretary of State spoke
about two separate processes, and logically they are two processes.
Fact finding and fault finding will be distinct aspects of any
investigation. We want the fact finding to be conducted by NHS redress
investigators as an inquisitorial process. The investigation may
provide the basis for an explanation, apology, lessons to be learned
and, where appropriate, an assessment of civil liability and an offer
to be made.</p>

<p><a name="0606054000288">The
Government&#146;s proposals would have had the NHS investigating
itself as judge and jury. The Constitutional Affairs Committee report
stated:</p><br><notus-date day="5" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>5 Jun 2006 : Column 43</b><br><a name="0606054000428"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;We are concerned that if
the organisation which is responsible for defending trusts and
hospitals is also charged with running the scheme, there may be a
perception (whatever the reality) of a conflict of
interest.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="0606054000289">We need the
reality and the perception to be understood. Justice must not only be
done but must be seen to be
done.</p><p><a name="0606054000290">Secondly, we need
an open procedure. Findings of fact should be robust and capable of use
apart from the redress scheme, which means that the proceedings leading
up to the offer should be either without prejudice or privileged. An
investigative process can hardly be described as transparent if its
findings are not open, which is a consequence of the
Government&#146;s proposal to mix up fact finding with fault finding.
The Government are treating facts disclosed during an investigation as
if those facts were part of a fault-finding process, in which case
their disclosure would be an admission of liability, whereas disclosing
the facts is an essential part of the process of winning the
patient&#146;s confidence in the redress scheme. If an offer is
rejected, the findings of the investigation cannot be used for any
compensation claim outside the redress scheme under the
Government&#146;s proposals. Our proposal would change that state of
affairs, and rightly so. I will not detain the House by explaining our
proposal in detail, but it follows the precedent set out in the
Inquiries Act
2005.</p><p><a name="0606054000291">Thirdly, we want
the scheme to reflect patients&#146; priorities. When something goes
wrong, patients want an explanation and an assurance that lessons have
been learned, and an open and independent fact-finding investigation
reflects that priority. Compensation does not necessarily rank highly
in patients&#146; expectation of the role of a redress scheme, but
the Government scheme is geared to compensation and does not allow for
the possibility that establishing facts and learning lessons is
sufficient in itself.</p><p><a name="0606054000292">When compensation is required,
we want it to be fair. Our proposal provides a range of options:
patients can accept an offer; they can negotiate or mediate a
settlement; they can enter a Resolve-style scheme; and, as must always
be the case, the courts are available as a last resort. Different cases
may require different procedures, and choice and flexibility should be
available for patients. The fact-finding investigation that we propose
would provide patients with an understanding of the basis of any claim,
and a Mackenzie friend would be available to provide support and
guidance.</p><p><a name="0606054000293">As I have
said, the health service has always had the power to settle claims
without resort to litigation, and it has done so on innumerable
occasions in the past. Early settlement by defendants in suitable cases
represents good practice and reduces costs&#151;it is what the health
service should be doing anyway. To characterise the Government&#146;s
proposed redress scheme as providing an &#147;alternative to
litigation&#148; is misleading and something of a gimmick. The same
is true of the offer of treatment by the NHS as a consequence of the
redress scheme. Remedial treatment which is clinically necessary is an
entitlement of patients, and it should not depend on the outcome of any
redress scheme.</p><br><notus-date day="5" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>5 Jun 2006 : Column 44</b><br><p><a name="0606054000294">The Secretary of State has said
that the introduction of an independent fact-finding scheme would cost
up to &#163;41 million. Frankly, we cannot see how the Government
have arrived at that figure. The investigation of cases represents a
fixed cost, whether it is conducted under the system currently in the
Bill or under the Government&#146;s original proposal. We do not
envisage a separate bureaucracy undertaking the investigations, which
should be overseen, directed and conducted by an independent person
under the auspices of the Healthcare Commission.</p><p><a name="0606054000295">On 28 March 2006, the former
Minister of State sought to explain how the figure of &#163;41
million was derived. She said that &#163;41 million was the upper
cost estimate and that the lower limit is &#163;14.5 million. She
also said that the funds would be for investigating clinical
negligence, but that is wrong, because our proposals cover an
investigation of the facts, not fault. The cost is not additional, but
it is an inevitable cost, because there has to be an investigation
whetherby the NHS Litigation Authority or by independent
investigators.</p><p><a name="0606054000296">The
Government&#146;s estimate of the number of cases involved is between
2,200 and 19,000&#151;a tenfold range. Again, the Government&#146;s
number crunching is
fanciful.</p><p><a name="0606054000297"><b><a name="0606054000624">Mr.
Graham Stuart (Beverley and Holderness) (Con):</b> Does my
hon. Friend agree that if independence is instilled in the fact-finding
part of this process, people will be less likely to seek financial
compensation when what they most seek is an apology and a proper
finding of the facts, and that that will save the NHS money, as well as
giving confidence to patients who have been wronged by the
system?</p><p><a name="0606054000298"><b><a name="0606054000625">Mr.
Lansley:</b> Yes, that is right. I think that we will find, in
many cases, that a more open scheme which is perceived to be
independent will forestall litigation to a greater extent than it gives
rise to it. The Government anticipate that there will be an increase in
the number of claims. Quite a number of claims may well go through the
NHS redress scheme, but we should not treat that as a fault in the
scheme. We want to ensure that people who currently may not have access
to compensation for clinical negligence should, in some cases, have
such access, but we do not want large numbers of people to pursue
litigation. My hon. Friend is right to say that the lack of
independence in the Government&#146;s proposals will cause many
people to feel that they want their day in court. The only way that
they will get the independent scrutiny and judgment for which they are
looking will be to go to court. I am sure that we want to avoid that
happening.</p><p><a name="0606054000299">I am afraid
that the Government&#146;s figures have been wrong before. The
Constitutional Affairs Committee was pretty sceptical about the
Government in its report, which says in paragraph
94:</p><a name="0606054000429"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;It is
surprising that the Department of Health has brought forward an
ambitious Redress Scheme, without setting out in detail how it will be
run...We were informed that contact had not been made, either with
lawyers or medical experts, about whether they would work for fixed
fees and to the timetables envisaged. These lapses appear to threaten
the viability and effectiveness of the
scheme.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="0606054000300">It is curious
that the Government appeared to be completely unaware of, or were
speculating about, the 
<br><notus-date day="5" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>5 Jun 2006 : Column 45</b><br>cost of their own scheme, yet absolutely precise, to the nearest
&#163;1 million, about the cost of an alternative. As the Committee
made clear, there is little reason to accept the economic forecasts of
the Department of Health, which has just been plucking figures out of
the air.</p><p><a name="0606054000301">Our proposals
would put patients, not the health service, at the centre of the
redress process. By confining the investigation of a case to fact
finding by an independent process, and separating fault finding, we
largely avoid the problems of the Government&#146;s proposals.
Patients&#146; interests are safeguarded by that
independence.</p><p><a name="0606054000302">We do
not pretend that the redress scheme provides an alternative to
litigation, as defendants ought to settle cases without resorting to
litigation anyway, where possible. We should not underestimate their
wish to do that. I well remember constituents who wanted the truth and
an apology, but got neither and so went to court. Their cases needed
independent investigation. Our proposals reflect such patient
expectations and priorities, comply with the principles of natural
justice, and are economically prudent and fair in application. They
would widen access to justice; they do not rely simply on the legal aid
process to ensure access to justice. They would simplify an
overcomplicated and confused Government approach. In short, we believe
that our proposals would allow patients to have access to a potentially
fairer and better
result.</p><p><a name="0606054000303">No scheme will
be perfect when dealing with such a complex subject, but we believe
that our proposals&#151;by which I mean the proposals supported by
all Opposition Members&#151;are a substantial improvement on the
original Bill as presented in another place last October. I therefore
commend the Bill to the
House.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="0606054000440">4.53
pm</h5><p><a name="0606054000304"><b><a name="0606054000626">Mr.
Si&#244;n Simon (Birmingham, Erdington) (Lab):</b> I start
by welcoming my hon. Friend the Member for Leigh (Andy Burnham) to his
relatively new position in the Department of Health. As I was coming
here, it occurred to me that when he became the Minister with
responsibility for identity cards, ID cards were the screaming
adolescent of British politics. A relatively short time later, he
leaves them sleeping gently like a baby, if not ticking like a time
bomb. We can only hope that he works the same magic on the
NHS.</p><p><a name="0606054000305">I declare an
interest as a trustee of the patients&#146;, charity Action against
Medical Accidents, which is generally known as AvMA. For more than 20
years, it has held the mantle for patient safety and justice for people
who have been affected by medical accidents in this country. It is fair
to say that, without AvMA&#146;s influence, patient safety would not
be as high on the agenda as it is today. We might well not be holding
the debate or have such a Bill without it. I hope that Ministers agree
that AvMA has a constructive, well informed and coherent input into
policy and that there is much to be learned from the patient&#146;s
perspective. I know that other hon. Members will have found the AvMA
briefing on the Bill as valuable as I have.</p><p><a name="0606054000306">AvMa and other patient groups
have long argued that there should be a speedier, less stressful way of
providing redress in the widest sense for people who have been caused
avoidable harm. Legal action remains 
<br><notus-date day="5" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>5 Jun 2006 : Column 46</b><br>a vital safety net and will still be necessary in more complex and
serious cases, but it is not popular with injured patients and should
be a last resort. AvMa has campaigned for years for dovetailing the
complaints procedure with a process of awarding compensation, together
with full explanations, apologies and assurances that patient safety
lessons will be implemented to make things safer for others. The Bill
intends to deliver most of that. The measure is broadly good and hon.
Members of all parties want to support it and help the Government make
it work. So far, so
good.</p><p><a name="0606054000307">We have
consensus, but there is an opportunity for the Bill to be a universally
good news measure. We must ask ourselves why, when there is such
consensus on the Bill&#146;s stated aims, we do not have the positive
response for which we might have hoped. Why do not AvMA and a broad
coalition of patient groups welcome the Bill with unreserved
jubilation? Although the aims are widely welcome, there is widespread
concern about its implications as
drafted.</p><p><a name="0606054000308">The joint
statement that many hon. Members will have seen is from groups
including the Patients Association, <i> Which?</i>, the National
Consumer Council, Help the Aged and Mind. Their core points are: there
should be an independent means of deciding on merits; advice and
assistance should be provided during the scheme; and medical and legal
expertise should be available during the process, not simply at the
end. There also need to be more robust measures in place to learn
lessons and take action to improve patient safety. Those requests do
not seem unreasonable given how coherently they sit with the
Bill&#146;s stated aims and the Government&#146;s intentions, which
no one doubts are sincere.</p><p><a name="0606054000309">Many of us would like the
reforms to go further, as the hon. Member for South Cambridgeshire (Mr.
Lansley) said, in line with the chief medical officer&#146;s
recommendations in &#147;Making Amends&#148;, in which he called
for a fairer test for eligibility than the Bolam test. That test, with
tort at its centre, is not the best on which to base the Bill from our
current position. An avoidability test, which would widen the
definition of liability, similar to what has been done in, for example,
Denmark, is more in tune with a culture that is less focused on
apportioning individual blame and more about identifying the root
causes of errors, which are usually systemic. That test might have
provided us not only with the answer to whether redress should be
provided but what risk management measures should be put in
place&#151;all through one investigation. That can be done.</p><p><a name="0606054000310">Perhaps the time is not yet
right for such a radical reform, notwithstanding its merits and
compatibility with what the Government say that they are trying to do,
but perhaps we could revert to it once the initial scheme has bedded
down a little. We are told that we will need new legislation for
primary care anyway and we are repeatedly told to look forward to
endless streams of secondary legislation. I would welcome the
Minister&#146;s comments on whether some sort of avoidability test
could be the subject of future legislation.</p><p><a name="0606054000311">The issue of independence in
determining eligibility for redress has been a recurrent theme in our
debate today and in all the previous debates on the Bill in the 
<br><notus-date day="5" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>5 Jun 2006 : Column 47</b><br>other place and elsewhere. Many stakeholders would have preferred the
merits of negligence cases to be investigated by a completely
independent organisation. The Government have explained that the
intention is to change the culture of the NHS, so that it learns to
recognise its errors, investigate them fully and make fair offers of
redress, without the need for the rigour of an independent process.
That is a laudable aim, but the way to change the culture is to change
the rules. Realistically, one cannot expect the culture to change and
the rules to follow. It has to be the other way
around.</p><p><a name="0606054000312">There are real
difficulties with how long change would take and how practical it would
be. The problem is that at present we are stuck with the Bolam test,
which is designed for the tort approach and assumes specialist legal
representation for the claimant and the case being examined with the
full rigour and independence of the courts. It would also be used in a
scheme in which the NHS, the would-be defendant, sat in judgment on
itself, and no specialist legal representation would be available to
empower the patient to make their case effectively on what is a very
technical legal test.</p><p><a name="0606054000313">As Ministers have said, the Bill
does provide for some legal advice and
some</p><a name="0606054000430"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;assistance for
individuals seeking redress under the scheme&#148;.</p></ul><p><a name="0606054000314">That advice, however, is available only at
the end of the process and would not enable claimants to influence the
outcome of the decision on the offer of redress. That is a fundamental
point.</p><p><a name="0606054000315">The assistance
to those seeking redress is described in the guidance as</p><a name="0606054000431"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;PALS or ICAS type
arrangements&#148;.</p></ul><p><a name="0606054000316">We all
have tremendous respect for the people doing worthwhile work in both
those services, but neither is appropriate for empowering a patient to
influence the outcome of an investigation based on the highly
technical, legalistic and tort-based Bolam test. Patient advisory
liaison services are not independent, but part of the customer care
arrangements in NHS trusts. The Independent Complaints Advocacy Service
is designed to help patients navigate the NHS complaints procedure.
Neither has the legal and medical expertise available to empower
patients to influence such a legalistic test, nor would it be
appropriate for them to do so without radically changing the purpose
for which they are
designed.</p><p><a name="0606054000317">This is not a
bad Bill. It is definitely moving in the right direction. It is at
least possible that the scheme could be run so that it would go a long
way to address the main concerns that have been articulated by
interested groups such as AvMA. The Government amendments in the Lords
allow for the possibility of legal advice being available during,
rather than just at the end of, the process. As I said in an
intervention,the previous Minister said in her letter to the
Constitutional Affairs Committee that stakeholders will be consulted,
during consideration of the secondary legislation, about the
circumstances in which legal advice could be provided at earlier stages
of the scheme. The question is whether such fundamental provisions,
which could radically alter the nature of the 
<br><notus-date day="5" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>5 Jun 2006 : Column 48</b><br>redress scheme&#151;especially the way in which it is perceived by
stakeholders and its capacity to enjoy public confidence&#151;should
be left to the vagaries of future consultation on secondary
legislation. I suggest not. We are always being told that our requests
will be met by the regulations, but Ministers have already conceded
that the Bill should contain such powers. I therefore strongly urge
Ministers to consider strengthening the provisions in Committee to make
more legal representation available during the process.</p><p><a name="0606054000318">It seems to me, and to AvMA,
that the most practical way forward would be to draw on the experience
of the resolve pilot in England, which has been favourably evaluated,
and the speedy resolution pilot in Wales. In those pilots, cases in
which liability had not already been admitted and an offer of
settlement made&#151;disputed cases, in other words&#151;had their
merits determined on the basis of independent medical experts&#146;
reports. The experts had been commissioned jointly by the NHS and a
specialist solicitor acting for the patient. There is already evidence
that that approach works, and it is much cheaper than litigation. The
solicitors are paid a relatively modest success fee only if the case
receives a positive report on eligibility from independent experts, and
the mechanism would be needed only if the NHS had not already
recognised its own negligence and sought to settle the case.</p><p><a name="0606054000319">The more successful we become in
changing the culture of the NHS and improving its capacity to
investigate itself, the less we will need such a safety net. Will the
Minister at least confirm that such an approach is consistent with what
he has in mind? It is hard to see how justice will be done in the
majority of cases, in the short term at least, without such a safety
net. It is a fundamental fact that the vast majority of clinical
negligence cases that are settled in favour of the claimant have
already been investigated and stubbornly defended by the NHS. It is as
simple as that. Almost all of them have been resolutely, and wrongly,
defended by an NHS that was not equipped to investigate
itself.</p><p><a name="0606054000320">That culture
needs to change, but I say that we should change the rules and let the
culture follow. It will take years and a considerable amount of
investment to turn the culture around, and to go ahead with an NHS
redress scheme that does not provide for an independent means of
determining eligibility in contested cases would mean that many
deserving cases would not get the redress that they deserve and that
the Government and all of us want. It will also lead to a lack of
confidence. It is notable that the Government said of the Legal
Services Bill, which is before the House at the moment, that the office
for legal complaints</p><a name="0606054000432"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;will not delegate the handling of
consumer complaints to Approved Regulators as set out in the White
Paper. There must be no appearance of professionals judging their
own&#148;.</p></ul><p><a name="0606054000321">That is right; it is
obvious that they should not handle those complaints. Even if they were
extremely successful at it&#151;and there is clear evidence that they
are not&#151;the appearance would be bound to alienate the vast
majority of lay people, who would simply not believe that they were
getting justice.</p><p><a name="0606054000322"><b><a name="0606054000627">Rob

stopped practising as a lawyer&#151;I made hundreds, if not
thousands, of negligence claims against the NHS. All too often, the
problem was that the solicitors from outside the health service who
were engaged on contracts by the NHS were absolute rubbish. They did
not know what they were doing, they were far too slow, they incurred
far too many costs on behalf of the NHS, and the cases often folded at

that the Government are serious about doing this. I equally firmly
believe that, although the direction of travel is right, we must ensure
that this long-awaited initiative enjoys more widespread confidence
than it will achieve as drafted. It would be a terrible shame if this
opportunity were wasted. We might simply need to be clearer in the Bill
about the nature of the provisions that the Government already intend
to put in place through secondary legislation. At least some clearer
assurances about what is intended would go some way to address the

a genuinely historic milestone of a Bill in terms of changing how
ordinary people experience their interface with the huge, great,

hospitals.</p><p><a name="0606054000330"><b><a name="0606054000631">Sandra
Gidley:</b> I thank my right hon. Friend for pointing that
out. I had not noticed it, and I hope that the Minister can help us in
his winding-up
speech.</p><p><a name="0606054000331">I had a quick
look at the Bill to see whether I might have to declare an interest, as
I am on the practising register of the Royal Pharmaceutical Society.
That does not seem to be the case, but it is worth pointing out at this
stage that when I worked in the health service the culture was
important. That was alluded to by the hon. Member for Birmingham,
Erdington (Mr. Simon). I shall refer to an example of how it can
operate.</p><p><a name="0606054000332">I worked for a
company that decided to have an open, no-blame culture, and there was
great encouragement that any error, however small, should be recorded.
Those errors were shared throughout the group. As a result, it was
common to see one or two errors that were not necessarily life
threatening, but which could be prevented. Steps were taken throughout
the company to ensure that they did not happen again. Exactly the same
thing could happen in the NHS as a result of more information
sharing.</p><p><a name="0606054000333">The National
Patient Safety Agency is trying hard to encourage a culture of no blame
and openness, but there are fears that the legislation as drafted might
not necessarily further those interests owing to the fact that
everything is in-house. The Secretary of State argued the opposite, but
it remains to be seen how the system works in practice.</p><p><a name="0606054000334">Despite talk of a litigation
culture, evidence shows that the number of claims is falling slightly.
In 2004-05 there were 5,609, while in 2003-04 there were 6,251.
However, it is dangerous to take a year out of context. The figures for
those two years are widely cited, but the background reveals a steady
increase in the number of claims up to that point.</p><p><a name="0606054000335">It should be borne in mind that
we live in a society in which there is sometimes a failure to accept
human error. Medicine is a complex subject, staff are only human, and
mistakes sadly happen. A friend of mine trained as a doctor. On the
first day, the trainees were sat down and told that at some stage
during their medical careers they would kill someone. If they could not
cope with that thought, they should leave there and then. It was not
suggested that they would kill anyone intentionally&#151;the Shipmans
of this world are, thankfully, rare&#151;but mistakes happen for a
number of reasons, such as tiredness, pressure, attempts to deal with
enough patients to meet the latest Government target, and even
ill-thought-through protocols. Often mistakes are due to a combination
of unfortunate events: an error can be compounded by other
happenings.</p><p><a name="0606054000336">It is
important for us to be able to identify what is going wrong. The
figures are stark. In 2005, the National Audit Office reported 974,000
incidents and 
<br><notus-date day="5" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>5 Jun 2006 : Column 51</b><br>near-misses, which did not include hospital-acquired infections. Only a
proportion of those cases were due to negligence, and we could argue
all day about what the proportion was, but some would say that it could
be as high as 25 per cent. The number of claims that have been made
suggests that that is the tip of the iceberg.</p><p><a name="0606054000337">It is good that patients will
have an automatic right to come forward, but the $64,000 question is
whether the number will be greater than predicted, and how that would
affect the pot of money available. As has been said today, an
unwillingness to own up early and instigate remedial action promptly is
often a cause of prolonged correspondence with Members of Parliament,
patients and hospital authorities. A change in the culture would save
much time and
effort.</p><p><a name="0606054000338">Many Members
have identified a major problem with the original Bill: the fact that
the NHS Litigation Authority, which is not regarded as independent,
will oversee the process. As has been pointed out, that must be done by
an independent body if justice is to be not just done but seen to be
done. That is the crux of the argument.</p><p><a name="0606054000339">The actual procedure, as
outlined by the Government, is fair enough. It is important to
determine the facts behind a claim, to decide whether an error was
indeed made, and to assess the seriousness of such an error. Above all,
it is important for the patient, or the patient&#146;s relatives, to
be given an explanation as soon as possible, because any delay gives
the impression of a cover-up. Finally, it must be established whether
the error constitutes a qualifying liability, and a value must be put
on any resulting compensation. The problem is that if the NHS is
involved at every stage, it will become judge and jury dealing with its
own
case.</p><p><a name="0606054000340"><b><a name="0606054000632">Mr.
John Gummer (Suffolk, Coastal) (Con):</b> Does the hon. Lady
agree that the real issue is perception? If people perceive that the
system is too much in the hands of those whom they see as judge and
jury, although we and the Minister may know that they are entirely
independent, that will defeat the whole object. We must ensure that,
objectively, people perceive the system to be
independent.</p><p><a name="0606054000341"><b><a name="0606054000633">Sandra
Gidley:</b> There are those who say that perception is the
only true reality, but I do not think that this is the place for that
discussion today. To develop the right hon. Gentleman&#146;s point,
one of the results of the in-depth investigation following the Shipman
saga is that all the professional bodies now have to have a huge lay
component. The logic is that it cannot be right that a profession is
seen to oversee itself all the time. Balance must be provided by
outsiders who can give another perspective. That argument is related to
what is going on here. If there is a mistake and a cover-up, will we be
saying further down the track that we must have more independent
scrutiny? Clearly, we cannot have a single lay person investigating the
health service&#151;that point was made earlier&#151;because they
would have to come to terms 
<br><notus-date day="5" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>5 Jun 2006 : Column 52</b><br>with and try to understand all the procedures, but perhaps there is an
argument for considering a mixture of both in any investigative panel
that is set up.</p><p><a name="0606054000342">Clearly, the fact finding should
be independent. Staff and patients need to be sure how the problem
arose and what will change as a result of the lessons learned. Again,
the point has been well made that that does not need legislation; it
should be happening already. The sadness is that, although in many
trusts it is happening, in some trusts&#151;I see it because I deal
with a number of different hospital trusts&#151;it is much more
difficult to get that openness and that willingness to admit that there
has been a mistake.</p><p><a name="0606054000343">As
my right hon. Friend the Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed (Mr. Beith) has
pointed out, legal advice will not be available until quite late in the
procedure. Is there not a possibility that a patient will be offered a
certain amount of compensation, decide that that is not enough, try to
obtain legal advice, but because there is an award, find that the
difference is deemed not to be worth funding? Therefore the patient
will be stuck between a rock and a hard place. They may have been one
of the fortunate few who could access legal services, but their claim
will not succeed because of the offer on the table. That needs to be
looked at.</p>

<p><a name="0606054000344">I would be
grateful if the Minister when he sums up clarified the issue around the
capping of the amount. I believe that the Secretary of State said
earlier that an attempt would be made to ensure that any awards were in
line with those in the civil courts. That may be the aim now, but if
there are future financial pressures can we be reassured that that aim
will remain? Will that be enshrined in legislation? We would seek to
avoid a situation where patients think, &#147;I am not sure I can get
much compensation. There seems to be a history of people thinking they
could get more if they went through the civil courts, so should I go to
the ambulance-chaser type of solicitor on a no win, no fee basis and
risk that?&#148; That is something that the Bill is trying to avoid.
We should ensure when we draft legislation that we avoid that
eventuality.</p><p><a name="0606054000345">I want to
turn to the secondary care aspect. Again, there have been some changes
to the Bill in the other place, but there is a move to deliver more
care outside hospital and it makes no sense to have an NHS Bill that
does not deal with all aspects of the NHS. The Secretary of State said
that GPs were not included because they are independent, but they are
not the only deliverers of primary care. Not to recognise that fact
ignores the many nurses, pharmacists, therapists and others who work in
the primary care sector who may not be covered in the way that she
described. It would be helpful, then, if the Minister elaborated on the
point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Northavon (Steve Webb)
about the review of primary
care.</p><p><a name="0606054000346"><b><a name="0606054000634">Steve
Webb:</b> Is not there an inconsistency between the Secretary
of State saying that GPs, because they are independent contractors,
will not be included, while independent sector treatment centres will
fall within the scope of the scheme? If they are independent
contractors to the NHS, what is the difference between them and GPs as
independent contractors?</p><br><notus-date day="5" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>5 Jun 2006 : Column 53</b><br><p><a name="0606054000347"><b><a name="0606054000635">Sandra
Gidley:</b> My hon. Friend makes a very good point, which I
hope the Minister will clarify. The Bill is clearly well meaning, and
we will take pleasure in supporting it in its proper form. I can assure
the Secretary of State, however, that we shall work hard on keeping
that
provision.</p><p><a name="0606054000348">How
will the scheme be scrutinised? We have had reassurances that the
ombudsman will be arbiter, and that all will therefore be well.
Unfortunately, this House has seen rather too many examples in recent
months of cases in which the Government have frankly ignored the advice
of various ombudsmen. That is not reassuring, and it would be useful to
know how the scheme will be assessed and what notice will be taken of
any future recommendation by the
ombudsman.</p><p><a name="0606054000349">It is a
shame that the Bill does not go much further. It is, unfortunately, a
rather half-hearted attempt to do something well meant and in the right
direction. We very much hope to improve it in
Committee.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="0606054000442">5.37
pm</h5><p><a name="0606054000350"><b><a name="0606054000636">Julie
Morgan (Cardiff, North) (Lab):</b> I am glad that the
Government are introducing an important Bill that I strongly support,
particularly as regards the implications for
Wales.</p><p><a name="0606054000351">Many of us have
dealt with patients, or relatives of patients, whose treatment under
the national health service has gone wrong. Those are probably among
our saddest cases, and some have gone on for many years. It has been
difficult for patients and relatives to be able to move on and to close
off on that part of their lives.</p><p><a name="0606054000352">The way the system works at the
moment militates against openness in the NHS, and the process is very
protracted. That means that relatives cannot move on. It is also
draining for NHS resources and staff, emotionally speaking. The costs
of bringing cases are often disproportionate to the compensation
granted. Reform was part of Labour&#146;s manifesto, and I am pleased
that it is happening.</p><p><a name="0606054000353">I
shall speak specifically about the Bill&#146;s effect on Wales. It
applies to England only, except for clause 17, which contains a
framework power for the Welsh Assembly. The clause has attracted quite
a bit of debate, mainly about constitutional issues. It is one of the
first examples of the enabling powers given to the Assembly to enable
the Assembly to determine its own policy. It is in line with proposals
in the White Paper &#147;Better Governance for Wales&#148; and with
the general progress of devolution, and I strongly welcome
it.</p><p><a name="0606054000354">The power conferred
by clause 17 on the Welsh Assembly does not contain the limitations
found in relation to England. It is not limited to hospital services
only, although the Secretary of State has expanded on that point today;
nor is it limited only to health professionals or specified bodies. The
proposals that the Welsh Assembly comes up with will need to fit into
the structure and general direction of the NHS in Wales, which has been
going in a slightly different direction from that in England. For
example, Wales does not have primary care trusts. Local health
boards 
<br><notus-date day="5" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>5 Jun 2006 : Column 54</b><br>perform the functions of PCTs. There are no foundation hospitals in
Wales. There are differences in commissioning arrangements.
Specialist servicesare commissioned by Health Commission
Wales. Community health councils have been retained and strengthened
and have a duty to provide advocacy services for local people who want
to make complaints about the NHS. The system for handling clinical
negligence claims in Wales is fundamentally different from that in
England. The NHS Litigation Authority is an England-only special health
authority. So the whole scene is very different in Wales, and it is
important that the proposals that come from Wales fit the particular
circumstances of
Wales.</p><p><a name="0606054000355">My
hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Erdington (Mr. Simon) referred
to the pilot scheme that has taken place in Wales. The Assembly
launched a new pilot scheme in February 2005 to deal with clinical
negligence claims against NHS trusts in Wales. That scheme covers
figures between &#163;5,000 and &#163;15,000 and is called the
speedy resolution scheme, which is very different from the traditional
litigation process. Its aim is to be consensual, using a single joint
expert, to which my hon. Friend has already referred. It uses a fixed
timetable and has fixed fees for all legal and medical professionals.
There is no court involvement, and there are certain specific
conditions for joining the
scheme.</p><p><a name="0606054000356">We heard some
discussion earlier of the length of time that such cases take; the
speedy resolution scheme has a fixed timetable of 61 weeks from the
date of acceptance to the outcome in the most complex cases, and it
anticipated that the majority of cases will be completed much more
quickly than that. The scheme also aims to provide an explanation to
patients. There will be an independent evaluation of the scheme. The
reason why the framework powers in the Bill are so wide is to take
account of the current different health arrangements in Wales and the
outcome of the pilot scheme. It is important that the Welsh Assembly
come up with no proposal until that scheme has been evaluated and that
we can propose a solution in Wales that best fits the Welsh situation.
Of course, any scheme that is proposed will operate alongside the
current complaints arrangements in Wales.</p><p><a name="0606054000357">Clause 17 will allow the
Assembly to introduce wider arrangements. The primary care
sector&#151;GPs and other primary care practitioners&#151;could be
included in the scope of the scheme. The Assembly wants the power to do
that laid down now, so that it need not return to Parliament at a later
stage, when it has decided on the way it wishes to proceed. Obviously,
any proposal to bring primary as well as secondary care into the scheme
will involve a lot of consultation, but at least the Assembly could do
that.</p><p><a name="0606054000358">I wanted to raise
the importance of clause 17 for Wales. It will allow the Welsh Assembly
to find Welsh solutions to Welsh issues. No decision has yet been made
in Wales about how the redress scheme will operate, but I understand
that the Assembly wants new legislative powers, rather than just
plugging the existing gaps in the process. The scope of clause 17 is
wide enough to include primary as well as secondary care and to extend
the arrangements beyond what the Assembly does at the
moment.</p><br><notus-date day="5" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>5 Jun 2006 : Column 55</b><br><p><a name="0606054000359">I very much welcome the Bill.

Wales.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="0606054000443">5.34
pm</h5><p><a name="0606054000360"><b><a name="0606054000637">Mr.
Alan Beith (Berwick-upon-Tweed) (LD):</b> I am glad to follow
the hon. Member for Cardiff, North (Julie Morgan), who is a member of
the Constitutional Affairs Committee, although not when it produced its
first report on this subject.</p><a name="0606054000421"><p>Before I come to the
Committee&#146;s report, I want to refer to the point about
cross-border problems that emerged during the Secretary of
State&#146;s speech. I recognise that it is a difficult and
complicated matter. I want to be quite clear what the situation is in
respect of my constituents who obtain treatment in hospitals in
Scotland&#151;the same thing would apply on the English side of the
Welsh border&#151;which are usually the nearest hospitals for those
living in the Berwick area, whether they use the Borders general
hospital or the two or three major hospitals in Edinburgh. Usually the
treatment arises because people choose to go to that particular
hospital, but with the support of the health authority on the English
side of the border. In some cases, the health authority may actively
encourage people to make that choice.</p><p><a name="0606054000361">I can see that the situation is
complicated because the hospital is in Scotland. An issue that would be
tort in England would arise under Scots law in Scotland. The
circumstances would be different. Am I right in supposing that whether
the scheme applies will depend on whether the health authority on the
English side can be thought to be responsible in some way for the
unsatisfactory outcome? That situation would be rather limiting and a
constituent would probably be much better placed taking legal action in
Scotland without the benefit of the scheme. The Minister may well reply
that the scheme is simply an addition to the legal rights that people
have on each side of the border. However, I would not want to create a
perverse incentive whereby patients were discouraged from going to an
appropriate hospital because of the existence of different schemes on
either side of the border.</p><p><a name="0606054000362">I am anxious, first, to clarify
the situation, and secondly, to ensure that, in particular, the health
authority on the English side will not say, &#147;We had better not
let patients go to Scottish hospitals because we might be pursued over
our aspect of the responsibility under the NHS redress scheme and we
might avoid that if the whole thing was dealt with on the English
side.&#148; I hope that, in his response, the Minister can give me
some initial guidance on that and that, if necessary, the matter will
be followed up fairly quickly&#151;before the Bill gets much
further&#151;by correspondence clarifying the situation. The slight
perversity of the situation is that patients on the Scottish side of
the border who come to Berwick for hospital treatment&#151;often
because they go to a general practitioner in Berwick anyway&#151;will
definitely benefit from the scheme, as I understand it. There is no
harm in that, but it indicates the paradoxes and complexities that will
arise.</p><br><notus-date day="5" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>5 Jun 2006 : Column 56</b><br><p><a name="0606054000363">I want to deal now with the
reports of the Constitutional Affairs Committee&#151;the third report
of 2005-06 on compensation culture, in which there is a substantial
section about the Bill, and the fifth report on the Bill itself, which
is, in effect, a report of the response from the right hon. Member for
Liverpool, Wavertree (Jane Kennedy), who was then Minister of State
with responsibility for quality and patient safety in the Department of
Health. She used her response to clarify a number of issues and we
commented briefly on those in the fifth report.</p><p><a name="0606054000364">Many of the issues in the third
report will come up again on Thursday when we debate the Compensation
Bill and I hope to refer to those matters then. The report addresses
issues relating to the so-called compensation culture, which is
sometimes adduced in respect of the Bill and the NHS generally. It
wasmy Committee&#146;s conclusion that there is not a
compensation culture that is driven by an increase in personal injury
claims. The evidence does not point to that. There are many problems in
relation to excess risk aversion in many parts of the public sector and
elsewhere, but they may be driven by a whole lot of other factors,
rather than by an actual increase in personal injury litigation. There
is considerable confusion in the media on that point.</p><p><a name="0606054000365">In looking at the NHS Redress
Bill, we raised a number of issues and I want to touch on some of them.
We referred particularly to the total lack of detail in the Bill and
its heavy dependence on secondary legislation and on non-statutory
schemes to fill out that secondary legislation. That is a far from
satisfactory way of legislating. It leaves the House making quite major
decisions without knowing how they will work in practice and, in this
case, without seeing even the draft secondary legislation that would be
involved. It is quite a dangerous trend in Government to create
framework legislation&#151;we have seen it in many other areas
too&#151;that leaves the House making decisions of vague general
principal and being able to deal with quite important aspects of the
legislation only by way of orders. As hon. Members must be aware, even
the affirmative procedure is profoundly unsatisfactory if a specific
defect is found, but Members do not want to vote out the order
completely because they do not want to prevent a scheme or a piece of
legislation from coming into operation. The negative procedure is
wholly inadequate in many such instances because hon. Members are
unable even to cast a vote on measures, let alone secure the amendment
of something that they consider to be fundamentally unsatisfactory. The
Committee was thus critical of such a lack of
detail.</p><p><a name="0606054000366">The Committee
was presented with no compelling evidence that doctors and lawyers will
be prepared to work for fixed fees and was not told what those fixed
fees might be. The Government&#146;s response made reference to fixed
fees payable by the Legal Services Commission, but those fees are
likely to be lower than those payable for private work. It is not
apparent whether the Department expects lawyers to work for fixed fees
at LSC rates, or whether participants will be able to go only to the
LSC to pursue their grievance. Reference was made earlier in the debate
to the problem that will arise if the LSC effectively acts as a
gatekeeper to the scheme for anyone who would be eligible for legal
aid.</p><br><notus-date day="5" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>5 Jun 2006 : Column 57</b><br><p><a name="0606054000367">The fact that medical experts can
be instructed jointly does not mean that they will be clearly
independent. If the NHS Litigation Authority was able to identify the
doctors that it wanted and also paid the bill, it would not lead to a
perception of independence. In the world of personal injury litigation,
there is often talk of claimant and defendant doctors being two rather
different groups of people. Indeed, the same is true of claimant and
defendant lawyers. We heard an interesting example from the hon. Member
for Wolverhampton, South-West (Rob Marris), who is a former personal
injury lawyer. He referred to all the lawyers engaged on the
Department&#146;s side as &#147;rubbish&#148;, which, on
reflection, he might consider was a rather extreme view. However, that
underlines the fact that there is a tendency for some lawyers and
doctors who are called on to give evidence to be thought of as
generally of use to claimants, while others are thought to be generally
of use to defendant authorities. If the NHS Litigation Authority uses
doctors who are thought to come into its category, it will further
reduce the possibility of the proceedings being regarded as
independent.</p><p><a name="0606054000368">The
Department acknowledges that it expects the number of claims to rise
and has cited the number of additional claims a year as between 2,200
and 19,500. That suggests that the estimates are very vague, which
makes the prospective cost of the scheme difficult to judge. The former
Minister, the right hon. Member for Liverpool, Wavertree, made the
intriguing comment that the Government could not make any predictions
because that involved modelling human behaviour. However, all
Government policy, including most economic policy, is based on
modelling human behaviour, and fairly reliable estimates of what people
might do under schemes and policies that are proposed have to be made
on the basis of
experience.</p><p><a name="0606054000369">Given the
difficulties that are facing the NHS, the Committee thought it rather
odd that the Department was pretty relaxed about the possible cost of
the scheme and that it could engage in such an exercise, despite the
wide disparities in the cost estimates. As the hon. Member for South
Cambridgeshire (Mr. Lansley) pointed out, such costs obviously
represent money that is diverted from patient care, so the Department
must have an understanding of the impact of its scheme on patient care
costs.</p><p><a name="0606054000370">It is for such
reasons that the Committee recommended piloting the scheme, but we did
not find the Department&#146;s response to that idea at all
compelling. The Department produced various arguments against the idea,
one of which has significant relevance to another point that has come
up in the debate. As I said earlier, one of the Government&#146;s
arguments against piloting was that the scheme will be evaluated after
three years&#146; operation. However, according to their published
response to our Committee&#146;s report, one of the consequences of
that evaluation might be that the Government will consider extending
the scheme beyond hospital care, although that contradicts directly
what the Secretary of State said in her speech. I can well understand
why the Government might want to take the process forward in two stages
and examine the experience of the hospital sector before even
considering extending the scheme to primary care, but there is no doubt
that the clear 
<br><notus-date day="5" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>5 Jun 2006 : Column 58</b><br>implication of their original response to the Committee was that the
first three years of the scheme would be an evaluation period, after
which it might be extended into the primary care sector. The Government
gave that three-year evaluation as a reason not to undertake any formal
piloting of the scheme. The Committee remained unconvinced about that
and still thought that piloting would make sense in an area where there
could be substantial cost implications.</p><p><a name="0606054000371">I have referred already to the
possible gatekeeper role of the Legal Services Commission. The chief
medical officer, in making amends, recommended that the LSC should be
able to take into account whether someone had used the NHS redress
scheme when making a decision on application for legal aid. The LSC
would come in at a later stage because if use had not been made of the
scheme, that might be reason for refusing legal aid. If the LSC is to
come in at an earlier stage&#151;in effect, it is the body that is
choosing the lawyers and determining the fees&#151;that slightly
casts doubt on whether it can properly use a refusal to use the scheme
as the basis for not granting legal aid, if somebody is not satisfied
and wants to go to court. There is some concern that the LSC, as a
result of what the Government are now recommending, will be involved at
two separate stages of the scheme.</p><p><a name="0606054000372">The difficulties to which I have
referred could be ironed out in various ways. They are not insuperable
obstacles. I recognise the potential value to those among our
constituents who have experienced the problems that the provisions in
the Bill seek to address, with a scheme that could be easier to work
through than a legal scheme, and one that could also satisfy their
demands for clear answers, which for some constituents are more
important than getting compensation.</p><p><a name="0606054000373">The Committee felt that the
&#163;20,000 limit might unduly restrict the scheme. There might well
be cases where someone is prepared to accept the limitations of the
scheme and prepared also to accept that a case potentially justifying a
larger sum could be treated under the scheme. I recognise that what the
Government have produced is potentially of value. I hope that they will
address some of the difficulties to which the Committee has referred
and realise that in their initial responses they have either not fully

Moffatt (Crawley) (Lab):</b> It is obvious that we all make
mistakes in our working lives and at home. Admitting that fact is
incredibly important for us. As for the NHS, it is not surprising that
with more than &#163;70 billion of taxpayers&#146; money being
spent on that organisation, mistakes happen and people are even
negligent and cause harm to others. That is why I am a firm supporter
of the redress scheme&#151;not in its present form, but in its
simplified form that went to the House of Lords before amendments were
made to the Bill.</p><p><a name="0606054000375">I am

negligence to what I believe to be a minimum. However, if there are
accidents and negligence, it is right that there is proper redress. I
believe that the scheme will lead to ensuring that there is fairness
and consistency in decision making. It is most important that there is
faster decision making.</p><p><a name="0606054000376">The scheme will encourage a
willingness for members of staff to speak out when they believe that
something has gone wrong.</p><p><a name="0606054000377"><b><a name="0606054000639">Mr.

Moffatt:</b> My hon. Friend is entirely right. That was the
message, sadly, that was given to us all. For some clinicians, that
continues to be the message in terms of any legal action that might be
forthcoming. That is why I believe that the scheme will be helpful in
trying to get rid of the culture that has been spoken about in the
Chamber.</p><p><a name="0606054000379"><b><a name="0606054000641">Mr.

Moffatt:</b> It is important to provide a fast, fair scheme
that is quick to offer an apology and an explanation. If the original
event is not dealt with quickly or properly, the aggrieved patient or
family member is often more unhappy about the poor process than the
event itself. It is therefore right to start to set things in motion
and ensure that the system is fair to all. As much as I love
solicitors, it is not a marvellous idea for the NHS to spend a great
deal of hard-earned taxpayers&#146; money on them. The public are
aware that accidents happen, so if someone requires a reasonable amount
of compensation&#151;and not a huge sum&#151;it is far better that
that money goes straight to them without the NHS spending very much on
solicitors. That is another reason why the public generally consent to
what the Bill hopes to achieve.</p><p><a name="0606054000381"><b><a name="0606054000643">David
Taylor (North-West Leicestershire) (Lab/Co-op):</b> Is my hon.
Friend aware that Action against Medical Accidents has argued that
specialist help is needed because, under the existing arrangements, the
vast bulk of cases that result in compensation are vigorously and
stubbornly resisted until the last minute, when an overwhelming case
has been built up, often using the advice and professionalism of
dedicated lawyers?</p><p><a name="0606054000382"><b><a name="0606054000644">Laura
Moffatt:</b> I am grateful to my hon. Friend for his
intervention. No one is running away with the idea that a culture of
defending a case to the death or the last minute is a suitable way for
the NHS to do business. I sincerely hope that we can create a different
culture, because delay and prevarication in cases in 
<br><notus-date day="5" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>5 Jun 2006 : Column 60</b><br>which a mistake has been made or in which negligence is apparent are not
good for people working in the NHS or for the public.</p><p><a name="0606054000383">As I have said, it
is extremely sad, but mistakes are made. Anyone who has been a member
of an NHS team dealing with a mistake will know that it is extremely
distressing for the doctor responsible. When I was working in Crawley
hospital, a gentleman in one of the units was sadly given a massive
overdose of the chemotherapy treatment that he was receiving for a
serious blood disorder. There was a systemic problem, as the way in
which the drug was drawn up and delivered had led to the mistake.
Everyone in theteam was desperately upset and the team
leader,Dr. Nandi&#151;she is an oncologist who treats
people with blood disorders&#151;worked throughout the night, having
worked all day at the hospital. She brought her young children to sleep
on the ward because she had to stay at the hospital to deal with the
emergency. She conducted an exchange transfusion for the gentleman
throughout the night. The whole team was present, including the doctor
who had made the mistake and who was utterly mortified. I am glad to
report that they managed to save that man&#146;s life, which was a
spectacular success considering how poorly he was and how awful the
event.</p><p><a name="0606054000384">It took months
for that gentleman to secure redress for a genuine mistake. He did not
want to denude the NHS of huge amounts of money. He wanted to make sure
that the pharmacy department worked more closely with doctors on the
way in which drugs were delivered, and he wanted someone to say sorry.
In that case, no one was backward in coming forward. If a different
system had been in place and if we had been in a position to set up an
investigation that was quick to achieve a conclusion and offer an
apology, he would have received his just desserts much sooner. I will
always remember him as somebody who would benefit from the
Bill.</p><p><a name="0606054000385">I
have seen the situation from both sides and I believe that the Bill
will deliver confidence in the NHS. As I have said, people are not
convinced that battalions of lawyers must be involved. They want an
apology; they want somebody to accept that a mistake has been made.
They want the NHS to recognise that sometimes people do not do the job
that they should do. I have no doubt that most of the cases taken under
the Bill will be genuine mistakes and things that have gone wrong, but
there are, of course, times when people are negligent in their work and
need to be admonished. However, we should be glad that such cases are
relatively rare. I am sure that a system such as the one under
discussion will expose things still further&#151;we must have the
ability to ensure that we have a clear pathway for amending mistakes
and making apologies.</p><p><a name="0606054000386">Let me repeat&#151;delay is
not good for the teams of staff under investigation, any more than it
is for the people having to wait for their apology. Confidence will be
returned to the NHS as a result of the Bill, which will create a
culture of change. I have listened carefully to our debate. The
contributions have been excellent and there is a willingness in the
House to settle the matter and to put a scheme in place. However, the
best people to tell us whether the scheme is of value are 
<br><notus-date day="5" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>5 Jun 2006 : Column 61</b><br>those who use it, so we should evaluate and review the scheme, without
jumping in and assuming that we need to add in all sorts of
independents, before we go on to make any changes. I urge the Minister
to come back to the House and tell Members how people feel about the
scheme and how effective it is for them. I believe that people will be
happy to support a system that is simple and that creates confidence in
the NHS, and I am certainly happy to do
so.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="0606054000445">5.57

Charles Walker (Broxbourne) (Con):</b> It is a great pleasure
to follow the hon. Member for Crawley (Laura Moffatt), who was very
clinical in her analysis of the problems facing the
NHS.</p><p><a name="0606054000388">It is impossible
to set a price on loss. Losing a mother or father, or&#151;God
forbid&#151;a son or a daughter, is an absolute tragedy. In most
cases, those losses are unavoidable, but very occasionally a mistake is
made by clinicians and responsibility needs to be taken. If a person
has just lost someone they loved very dearly, they are in a hugely
complex emotional state. If, on top of that, they have to take on the
NHS, they are David challenging Goliath. For most people, that is
daunting. After all, where do they start? Most people have never
embarked on legal action in their life, so what is the beginning point
for them?</p><p><a name="0606054000389">One problem,
which has been clearly identified in the debate, stems from the fact
that we live in a litigation culture, which has developed over the past
20 years and which means that no one&#151;but no one&#151;says
sorry. Even if an individual&#146;s urge and driving force is to
apologise for the mistake that they made, they are taken aside by a
lawyer or senior manager and told, &#147;Whatever you do, do not
apologise to this family.&#148; Often, such an apology at a very
early stage would mean so much, and put an end to a great deal of
suffering. It would halt much of the needless litigation in the NHS.
Hospitals are frightened to admit any form of liability, lest they face
a very expensive legal claim.</p><p><a name="0606054000390">I broadly welcome the Bill. It
is not as good as it could be, but it goes a long way towards
addressing some of the concerns that I shall raise. Three years ago, a
constituent lost her mother, who had heart disease and lung cancer. She
was dying, but she was not meant to die on the day that she did die;
she was meant to go into hospital for routine checks and be sent home.
A litany of mistakes were made in the treatment of that elderly lady,
perhaps the two most serious of which were the fact that bedsides were
not put up on her bed, so she rolled out and fractured her hip, and in
response to that she was pumped full of fluids, which was the mistake
that led to her unfortunate
death.</p><p><a name="0606054000391">My constituent
bravely and nobly took her complaint to the health service ombudsman. I
have a 34-page report, which is devastating in its content. One of the
saddest parts is in the last paragraph, in which the senior
investigating officer, Sarah Gallagher,
writes:</p><a name="0606054000433"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;The
Trust has asked me to convey&#151;as I do through my

report. That was welcomed by my constituent, but what she really wanted
was an apology from the 
<br><notus-date day="5" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>5 Jun 2006 : Column 62</b><br>chief executive or the chairman of the trust. She did not want an
apology via a third party. She wanted an apology from the people who
run that organisation, who are responsible for its day-to-day
management. It was only after my intervention that she got an
apology.</p><p><a name="0606054000394">I bear no
grudge against the chief executive and chairman of that trust. They
were operating within the parameters that the NHS had set them. But I
do bear a grudge against a system which for two and a half years made
them feel that they could not issue an apology to my constituent.
Echoing some of the comments made by hon. Members on both sides of the
Chamber this afternoon, I question some of the legal advice that the
NHS receives from its lawyers, which seems pretty
poor.</p><p><a name="0606054000395">My
constituent&#146;s lawyers are in negotiation withthe NHS
for a cash settlement. It is not a huge settlement&#151;well below
the &#163;20,000 being discussed today. She wants &#163;10,000; the
NHS is offering &#163;5,000. This has gone back and forth between
solicitors for a year and a half, with the NHS quibbling over
&#163;5,000 after a devastating ombudsman&#146;s report. If the
Bill addresses such inequities, it is a step in the right
direction.</p><p><a name="0606054000396">When I
raised the matter with the then Minister,the right hon.
Member for Liverpool, Wavertree(Jane Kennedy), I received a
wonderful compassionate response from her. At the bottom of her letter
there was a handwritten note passing on her condolences and apologies
to my constituent, which was gratefully received. I am sure the
Minister of State, the hon. Member for Leigh (Andy Burnham) will do as
good a job as his predecessor. In this case she was outstanding, and a
credit to her profession as a
politician.</p><p><a name="0606054000397">My one
concern about the Bill is that my constituent&#146;s faith in the NHS
is shot to pieces. She does not believe that she has been treated
fairly. If it was suggested to her that a new system was in place to
ensure that she received fair recompense and that there would be an
investigation by the NHS to make sure that the mistakes were not
repeated, she would not attach much credit to those promises. She
believes that the NHS is ultimately self-serving&#151;I am sure that
it is not&#151;that it will seek to protect itself, and that the Bill
probably would not go far enough to change
that.</p><p><a name="0606054000398">I hope the
Minister will give serious thought to ensuring that the process for
helping patients and those who have lost loved ones who bring a claim
against the NHS is transparent and, most importantly, impartial. The
redress scheme must be the patients&#146; champion and the champion
of the bereaved, not just another arm of the NHS which is perceived,
perhaps wrongly, as existing to protect the status
quo.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="0606054000446">6.4

Bill, which aims to ensure that patients and their families can obtain
redress by way of an investigation, apology or compensation when
something has gone wrong with NHS treatment or care. I particularly
welcome the broadening of the 
<br><notus-date day="5" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>5 Jun 2006 : Column 63</b><br>scope of redress specified in clause 3 to provide for explanations and
apologies. It is extremely important for a patient or a
patient&#146;s family to be offered an explanation and an apology
when things have gone
wrong.</p><p><a name="0606054000401">Like other hon.
Members, in the 13 months since I was elected I have dealt with a
number of cases in which the provisions of the Bill would make a
considerable difference for constituents. One case stands out for me as
a perfect illustration of a situation in which a patient&#146;s
family desperately need explanations and apologies. Many hon. Members
are familiar with such situations among their constituents. In that
case, there was inadequate and delayed diagnosis of a condition that
was terminal, leaving the family feeling that the patient&#146;s life
ended prematurely and with little time for the patient or his family to
prepare for his death. The family feel that the treatment and care that
the patient received as a hospital in-patient were &#147;totally
disgraceful&#148;.</p><p><a name="0606054000402">I
shall describe the case in a little more detail, as it shows the extent
of systemic failure and why my constituent, Mrs. Dawn Smallman, feels
that she desperately needs an answer and an explanation for what
happened. Most importantly, the hospital in question needs to admit its
errors and take measuresto ensure that what happened to the
patient,Mrs. Smallman&#146;s father, does not happen to
anyone else. Regrettably, the hospital seems unable to do
that.</p><p><a name="0606054000403">The case is that
of Mr. Stanley Collins, who died on 30 August 2005, three days after
being discharged from the Royal Bolton hospital. Specific areas of
complaint were raised by Mr. Collins&#146; daughter. Mr. Collins had
a stomach cancer which proved terminal. It was finally diagnosed only a
week before his death. He had, however, been attending the hospital as
both an in-patient and an out-patient since October 2004 and had
undergone colonoscopies, endoscopies, biopsies, scans and X-rays. There
seemed to the family to be signs of a serious illness. Mr. Collins was
in great pain, he was very ill for the last few months and he was
anaemic, but hospital staff insisted, almost to the last, that his
condition was neither serious nor
terminal.</p><p><a name="0606054000404">Mr. Collins
felt that his condition was not taken seriously. When he was taken in
great pain to the accident and emergency unit, the triage nurse merely
referred him to the unit&#146;s on-call GP. The GP called for some
tests to be done by the family GP to identify the causes of pain, but
the request for tests was lost in the hospital&#146;s administrative
system. That was just a month before Mr. Collins
died.</p><p><a name="0606054000405">A few times
during the last two months of his life, Mr. Collins was admitted to the
Royal Bolton hospital as an in-patient. During these stays, the family
felt that he was treated very badly. They felt that he was neglected
and left to suffer great pain and a lack of dignity. Many aspects of
this inadequate patient care involve basic standards of care and
professional practice. First, throughout the last weeks of his life,
Mr. Collins suffered great pain, yet medical staff dealing with him did
not respond with adequate pain control. His family tell me that they
repeatedly asked for pain relief, yet observed that he was often kept
waiting hours to be given that.</p><br><notus-date day="5" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>5 Jun 2006 : Column 64</b><br><p><a name="0606054000406">Secondly, in Mr. Collins&#146;
condition, he needed help at times&#151;for example, to use a
commode&#151;yet even that help was not available when he needed it,
although it is a basic aspect of care for the seriously or terminally
ill. Thirdly, a ward where Mr. Collins stayed during the last few weeks
of his life was described by his family as filthy, with dead insects
and even toenail clippings not being cleaned away. Next, basic needs
such as the provision of clean drinking water and a clean glass were
not provided by the staff on the ward.</p><p><a name="0606054000407">Perhaps most serious of all was
the way in which hospital staff dealt with Mr. Collins in the last week
of his life. In this respect, lessons must be learned. A week before he
died, Mr. Collins&#146; family attended a meeting at which the
consultant was to give the diagnosis and prognosis for him. The news
that Mr. Collins had a cancer that was now terminal, with no real
treatment options, was delivered to him and his family on an open ward
in the hearing of other patients and visitors. Indeed, Mr.
Collins&#146; daughter found that the news of her father&#146;s
condition was overheard by a relative of a work colleague of hers. Mr.
Collins had to ask how long he had to live in the hearing of other
patients, and he was told that he had a very short
time.</p><p><a name="0606054000408">Perhaps
unsurprisingly, given that low standard of professional practice,
hospital staff also failed to deliver the palliative and nursing care
that might have made Mr. Collins&#146;s last seven days of life more
tolerable. With very little time to live, he wanted to be at home with
his family, but even that was not handled well. First, it took from
Tuesday to Saturday to get a hospital bed at home for Mr. Collins and
for the palliative care consultant to arrange his medication.</p><p><a name="0606054000409">Secondly, hospital discharge was
arranged on Saturday 27 August by emergency ambulance, but the
ambulance never came. Eventually, Mr. Collins&#146;s family came into
hospital and found him left in a chair with no help with toileting, no
pain control&#151;his drip had fallen out and had leaked all over the
floor&#151;and no opportunity to summon help, because the emergency
button was out of reach. Disgusted by that treatment, Mrs. Smallman and
her mother, who is disabled, signed a form to discharge Mr. Collins
themselves by car.Mrs. Smallman said that trying to bundle
her father into the car was the worst thing that she has had to do in
her life.</p><p><a name="0606054000410">Finally,
hospital staff discharged Mr. Collins with oral medication rather than
the intravenous medication that he needed. On a bank holiday weekend,
the district nurses told Mrs. Smallman that it would be practically
impossible to get the drugs that Mr. Collins needed for pain
relief&#151;it is, of course, particularly difficult to get oral
morphine post-Shipman. Mrs. Smallman andher sister spent the
bank holiday weekend, which comprised the last few days of their
father&#146;s life, driving around on-call doctors and dentists in
Bolton trying to get prescription forms signed and to obtain the
necessary permissions for the district nurses to administer the
medication that their father
needed.</p><p><a name="0606054000411">The district
nurses who were trying to helpMr. Collins contacted the C4
ward of the Royal Bolton hospital, which told them that Mr. Collins was
&#147;no longer their responsibility&#148;. Mrs. Smallman has
said:</p><a name="0606054000435"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;You
cannot imagine the burden placed on us to get this medication in order
to relieve his pain. There were times when he was in agony. You cannot
imagine what it was like racing back to 
<br><notus-date day="5" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>5 Jun 2006 : Column 65</b><br>him with his medication, never knowing if you would be back in time or
if he would die while you were
out.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="0606054000412">On the day that Mr.
Collins died, his GP visited him. Astonishingly, the hospital had sent
no information on Mr. Collins&#146;s diagnosis to his GP.</p><p><a name="0606054000413">On her father&#146;s death,
Mrs. Smallman has
said:</p><a name="0606054000436"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;I wish I
could say that his death was peaceful, but it was not&#151;he died in
pain with absolutely no dignity
whatsoever&#148;&#151;</p></ul><p><a name="0606054000414">thanks,
she feels, to the Royal Bolton hospital. Lack of information from the
hospital even made it difficult for Mr. Collins&#146;s GP to certify
Mr. Collins&#146;s death, as he had been sent no information about
the diagnosis.</p><p><a name="0606054000415">Much of
the evidence that I have recounted clearly indicates poor standards of
nursing and medical care, bungled administration and very poor
communication. However, the situation has been made worse over
subsequent months by the inadequate response by the Royal Bolton
hospital to complaints from Mrs. Smallman. Since raising her complaint
with the hospital on 3 October, Mrs. Smallman has found that responses
from the hospital have not been sent to agreed time scales and have
often been three to four weeks late, that copies of responses have not
been sent to me&#151;I have had to chase every single response from
the hospital&#151;and that the responses have been inadequate, which
is the worst thing for the family. The delayed answers and
prevarication by those investigating the bereaved family&#146;s
complaints have left the family feeling more angry and upset. The
family&#146;s feelings of anger were originally due to what it
regarded as undue delay in diagnosing Mr. Collins&#146;s terminal
condition and the poor standard of treatment and care that he received
both in hospital and on his discharge home to die.</p><p><a name="0606054000416">In making her original
complaint, Mrs. Smallman knew that nothing could bring back her father
or change how he was treated. She raised the complaint to obtain
explanations and an apology and to help prevent any other patient or
family from suffering in the same way. It is clear to me and my
constituent that the current system for redress is inadequate, and I
welcome the change introduced by the Bill. Standards of professional
practice were patently not met inthat case.</p><p><a name="0606054000417">The Government cannot manage the
practice of every NHS consultant, but we need to bring about a change
of culture to allow acknowledgement when a whole system of treatment
and care fails a patient and his family, which seems to have happened
in this case. When standards of both professional practice and
communication fail, we need a system of redress in the NHS which
acknowledges and investigates such failures, explains what has happened
and apologises to those affected.</p><p><a name="0606054000418">We know that cancer care is
improving, but we also know that it is still patchy. It is more than
three years since the Commission for Health Improvement report
&#147;NHS cancer care in England and Wales&#148; highlighted the
fact that some consultants have poor communication skills in giving bad
news. What happened to my constituent&#146;s father, Mr. Collins, and
his family should be seen as an unacceptable standard in communicating
such bad news. Indeed, good communication is a key part of the cancer
plan. Cancer patients and their families increasingly want help to 
<br><notus-date day="5" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>5 Jun 2006 : Column 66</b><br>enable patients to die at home without pain and with some dignity, which
did not happen for Mr. Collins, who died in pain and with no dignity.
He did not receive the palliative care which he should have received
and which many other patients now receive.</p><p><a name="0606054000419">The Healthcare Commission has
reprimanded some NHS hospitals for failing to pay sufficient attention
to complaints, and the number of complaints that went to independent
review doubled in 2005. The commission felt that too many trusts were
failing to respond promptly and effectively to complaints. That has
unfortunately been the case for my constituent,Mrs. Smallman,
in her complaint against the Royal Bolton hospital. There is still time
for the hospital trust to change the situation and handle the complaint
more effectively, and I hope that it will.</p><p><a name="0606054000420">I welcome the Bill and the new
scope for redress, which will offer the explanation and apology that my
constituent and her family need, and benefit other patients and their
families.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="06060513000144">6.16

the hon. Member for Crawley (Laura Moffatt), I do not have personal
experience of working in the NHS, but, like most hon. Members, I keep
in close contact with my local hospitals. Last year, I had the
opportunity to work&#151;I use the word loosely&#151;the night
shift at Hillingdon hospital in the accident and emergency department
on a Friday night. I said that I was there to &#147;work&#148;, but
I shadowed the senior nurse through the course of that evening, which
covered a period of peak demand for the department. When I left the
next morning, I was astonished and impressed by the capacity of staff
to cope with the pressure and the flow of decisions&#151;hundreds of
decisions were taken that night, and a huge number of decisions are
taken throughout the system every day. In his report, &#147;Making
amends,&#148; Sir Liam Donaldson, the chief medical officer, states
that 50 medical decisions are taken every year on behalf of each person
in this country. Given the increased complexity and pressure of the
environment in which NHS staff work, it is not surprising, as the hon.
Member for Crawley said, that mistakes are made.</p><p><a name="06060513000004">I have been surprised by the
scale of the problem. The trend in the debate has been to downplay the
issue, but I hope that we have not given out the signal that we are
complacent. Sir Liam Donaldson&#146;s report informs us that the
level of adverse effects during in-patient episodes in the UK runs at
about 10 per cent., of which about 50 per cent. are preventable. On my
maths, there are more than 400,000 preventable adverse effects a year,
which, again using the figures in the report, cost about &#163;1
billion a year in additional bed delays&#151;those are big numbers.
The report also points out that the health care sector has been
historically tolerant of 
<br><notus-date day="5" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>5 Jun 2006 : Column 67</b><br>error, certainly compared with other industries that have had to be a
great deal more robust on accountability for health and safety. I hope
that we are not in danger of being complacent in the face of the
challenge of driving down the scale of the
problem.</p><p><a name="06060513000005">The stress
caused on both sides of the decisions that I have discussed is not in
doubt. Anyone who read the report and the account of the mother whose
child died as a result of a GP&#146;s failure to diagnose meningitis
could not fail to be moved by the thought of how much pain that
incident caused on both sides.</p><p><a name="06060513000006">I recently met my constituent,
Jean McFarlane, a cancer patient who is in remission. She was seriously
injured by an overdose of radiation, which left her semi-paralysed and
in chronic pain for life. Such was her determination that that should
not happen to anyone else, that she joined forces with other women who
were injured at the same hospital to form a group called
RAGE&#151;Radiation Action Group Exposure. She said, &#147;Sadly,
we are now the forgotten hundreds, who get no help from anybody to
maintain daily lives. Our injuries are unrecognised, or pushed under
the carpet.&#148; Her driving motivation is that what happened to her
should not happen to anyone
else.</p><p><a name="06060513000007">Given the scale
of the problem and the consequences for those who are unfortunate
enough to suffer from it, we need to be sure that we have a complaints
system that is seen to be effective and a system of redress that is
seen to be fair. Those are surely hugely important pillars on which to
build public confidence in the NHS. I suspect that they are underrated
and underestimated within the system; the evidence certainly suggests
that they are not as strong as we would wish.</p><p><a name="06060513000008">The case for reform of the
redress system is not seriously disputed. Although it is clear that
progress has been made as a result of Lord Woolf&#146;s
recommendations and the actions of the NHS Litigation Authority since
1995, three trends are of particular concern, the first of which is the
rising number of clinical negligence claims and the associated costs.
The number of claims has risen from 392 in 1996-97 to more than 5,000
in 2004-05, and the associated costs have risen from &#163;235
million in 1996-97 to more than &#163;500 million in 2004-05. I am
sure that no one in the House wants to go down the route of the USA,
which spends a staggering 0.2 per cent. of its gross domestic product
on medical litigation costs. That is a future that we must
reject&#151;not least because, as my hon. Friend the Member for South
Cambridgeshire (Mr. Lansley) said, every pound wasted in this area is a
pound that could be redirected to front-line
care.</p><p><a name="06060513000009">The second trend
that concerns me, and other hon. Members, is the length of time that it
takes for claims to be settled. According to the NHS Litigation
Authority, the average is 1.4 years, but the National Audit Office has
suggested an average of five years for 2004-05. That is too long, as
other hon. Members eloquently stated. During that time, there is a
great degree of suffering on both sides involved in decisions.
</p><p><a name="06060513000010">The third trend that
concerns me is the waste of time and money wrapped up in the following
statistics:38 per cent. of cases are abandoned, 43 per cent.
are 
<br><notus-date day="5" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>5 Jun 2006 : Column 68</b><br>settled out of court, and 75 per cent. of claims under &#163;25,000
cost more to settle than the amount that is claimed in
compensation.</p><p><a name="06060513000011">All
those factors conspire to create the wrong culture: defensive,
obstinate, and confrontational. It becomes a game in which the patient
holds few cards&#151;truly a situation of David against Goliath, as
my hon. Friend the Member for Broxbourne put it.I add my
voice to the consensus that something needs to be done to speed up the
process of claims andto generate a culture that is more
conducive to transparency, co-operation and improvement.</p><p><a name="06060513000012">We do not hear enough about the
need to reduce the size of the Bill. Some &#163;500 million of
taxpayers&#146; money has been redirected. Primum non nocere,
&#147;First, dono harm&#148;&#151;I hesitate to
introduce Latin into the Chamber&#151;was the motto of Florence
Nightingale. I am afraid that we have not heard enough about that this
afternoon. For example, how successful has the National Patient Safety
Agency been since it was set up in 2001 in helping to reduce the size
of the problem,in learning lessons and in identifying risks
and mechanisms to track progress with
solutions?</p><p><a name="06060513000013">I
understand that reducing costs is not the main driver of the Bill. Its
aim is to provide a simpler means of obtaining compensation in lower
value cases. Costs might rise depending on the various assumptions that
might be made about future claims. I am happy to applaud that
objective, but the test of any new legislation is to ask what it will
add to what is already there. What gives us reason to think that it
will succeed in its objectives, particularly when one of those
objectives is to change the culture? We know how hard that is. How can
we be confident about it, particularly given that there is currently
nothing to stop the NHS from offering compensation, remedial care, an
explanation or apology? That is within its power today. How can we be
sure that the Bill will be a turning point in changing that culture so
that those options are used more? The frank answer is that it is hard
to say because, as the right hon. Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed (Mr.
Beith) said, there is so little detail. That point is also made by the
Law Society, the British Medical Association and the Constitutional
Affairs Committee. </p><p><a name="06060513000014">We
are told that the NHS Litigation Authority will manage the scheme, so
why is it not named in the Bill? The bottom line is that it will still
need to be established regardless of whether injuries have been caused
by negligence, but what criteria will be used? Who will decide or
advise on which cases are eligible? How will proceedings start? Will
they be independent of the complaints process? Why was the
&#163;20,000 limit chosen? What does it include? Does it include only
legal costs or does it include remedial costs? Exactly what type of
independent advice will patients and families be entitled
to?</p><p><a name="06060513000015">Even in the vacuum
of detail in which we are asked to debate this afternoon, one real
concern stands out: the need for independence and for the process to be
seen to be genuinely independent, in terms of judgments being made and
of the access that patients will have to independent opinion, not just
at the end of the process. The Government are, in effect, bringing
everything in-house into the hands of an agency the main purpose of
which is to defend the NHS. The model is fatally flawed, because it
will remove trust and 
<br><notus-date day="5" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>5 Jun 2006 : Column 69</b><br>confidence in that process. If I were a patient who had gone through
some of the experiences that hon. Members have described, and I was
told that that the NHS was to be the judge and jury in my case, I would
not enter that process with confidence or trust.</p><p><a name="06060513000016">How will the new system change
the culture? Currently, the clearest way of changing culture and
raising accountability is to throw a harsh spotlight on matters from
outside to break down the culture of stubborn defensiveness that seems
to pervade the NHS, as comes through in the evidence from Action
against Medical Accidents. Underlying this is a general feeling that
the Government know best and that people should take what they are
given. That is why I supported our amendment, which seemed to be a
victory for common sense. We should separate the redress process into
two parts: find the facts and find the fault. An independent redress
system that is overseen by the Healthcare Commission is essential for
building confidence. The hon. Member for Crawley mentioned the
importance of defining the status, training and legal skills of
independent investigators.</p><p><a name="06060513000017">It is rich for the Government
to complain about cost. The figure bandied around for the cost of this
scheme is about &#163;14.5 million at the bottom end of the range. It
is ironic that today, in Committee Room 15, the Public Accounts
Committee is investigating the shambles that is the Paddington health
campus project, which the Department of Health failed to supervise over
five years, with a cost to the taxpayer of &#163;14.5 million and an
opportunity cost that runs into hundreds of millions of pounds. Given
that kind of cavalier attitude to taxpayers&#146; money, it is
ridiculous say that the price of a genuinely independent system that
will generate confidence is too high at &#163;14.5 million. Only by
building a system and a model that can inspire confidence in the
independence of decision making can the Government truly say that this
Bill is for and about
patients.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="06060513000145">6.28
pm</h5><p><a name="06060513000018"><b><a name="06060513000149">Mr.
John Baron (Billericay) (Con):</b> This has been an
interesting and wide-ranging debate in which there have been many
thoughtful contributions from both sides of the House.</p><p><a name="06060513000019">The hon. Member for Birmingham,
Erdington(Mr. Simon) talked about the importance of
independence within the scheme. That is terribly important, as the
scheme must be seen to have credibility with regard to NHS patients. He
also reminded us that &#147;Making Amends&#148; wanted to move away
from the tort-based culture, yet the Government&#146;s original Bill
had tort as its centrepiece. I remind him of a quote in that report. It
stated:</p><a name="06060513000138"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Tort
sits so uncomfortably in an NHS with an ethos of equity...Even a
reformed tort system is
unfair&#148;.</p></ul><p><a name="06060513000020">Despite that,
tort is at the centre of the Bill. That is why we proposed amendments
in another place and, thankfully, won the day. Our proposals would
separate fact finding from fault finding. That is an
essentialfirst step.</p><p><a name="06060513000021">The hon. Member for Romsey
(Sandra Gidley) acknowledged the importance of independence and made
the valid point that perception is vital. The Bill and the scheme must
be seen to be credible. It is no 
<br><notus-date day="5" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>5 Jun 2006 : Column 70</b><br>good simply doing right and claiming that the scheme is
independent&#151;it must also be seen to be independent by NHS
patients who use it. The hon. Lady made several telling points,
including emphasising that the redress scheme must be patient centred
and tackle patients&#146; needs. Sometimes in our discussions we have
spoken a little too much about the needs of the NHS, which are not
necessarily always those of the
patient.</p><p><a name="06060513000022">The hon.
Member for Cardiff, North (Julie Morgan), who is not in her place,
reminded us that the scheme does not apply to Wales and wisely
suggested that perhaps the Welsh Assembly should wait to see how the
scheme beds down here before taking it on. Clause 17 rightly stresses
that Welsh solutions are needed for Welsh issues and reminds the
Assembly that it has the power to effect that.</p><p><a name="06060513000023">The right hon. Member for
Berwick-upon-Tweed (Mr. Beith) wanted clarification about whether
patients who cross the border into Scotland would have access to the
redress scheme. My understanding&#151;for what it is worth&#151;is
that they would not. Doubtless the Minister will clarify that at least
in Committee, but hopefully in his winding-up speech.</p><p><a name="06060513000024">The hon. Member for Crawley
(Laura Moffatt) wrongly suggested that the original Bill was somehow
simpler than our proposals. She forgets that we propose to simplify the
scheme by limiting it to a role of fact finding. That is much simpler
than trying to determine liability as well. Our scheme is therefore
simpler. I shall revert to that point when I consider the
Government&#146;s suggestion that our proposals mean increased
costs.</p><p><a name="06060513000025">My hon. Friend
the Member for Broxbourne(Mr. Walker) reminded us of how
patients must feel in taking on the NHS. He rightly said that the
conflict is perceived as one of David and Goliath&#151;an apt
description. He also reminded us of what patient priorities often are.
Patients want an apology and an explanation, and they want to know what
went wrong. Hon. Members of all parties made that
point.</p><p><a name="06060513000026"><b><a name="06060513000150">Mr.
Walker:</b> Does my hon. Friend agree that the lack of that
apology forces many people into taking legal action to get financial
recompense because that is the only way in which they feel that their
voice is being
heard?</p><p><a name="06060513000027"><b><a name="06060513000151">Mr.
Baron:</b> Yes, I agree. In too many cases, thelack
of an explanation&#151;and an apology, when appropriate&#151;forces
patients to seek alternative redress and prolongs the length of the
process, at great cost to the NHS. That money could be better spent on
patient care.</p><p><a name="06060513000028">The
hon. Member for Worsley (Barbara Keeley) mentioned a sorry constituency
case. I am sure that the House extends its concern and sympathy to the
Collins family. The case reminded us that reform is desperately
needed&#151;we all agree with that. The issue is how best to ensure
that the redress scheme is effective and has patients&#146;
confidence.</p><p><a name="06060513000029">My hon.
Friend the Member for Ruislip-Northwood (Mr. Hurd) reminded us that, in
addition to an explanation and an apology when appropriate, NHS
patients also want to ensure that lessons are learned for the benefit
of others. That is important. He mentioned the need for transparency
and the cost of the current 
<br><notus-date day="5" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>5 Jun 2006 : Column 71</b><br>system to the NHS&#151;more than &#163;500 million. He was right to
argue for the need for independence.</p><p><a name="06060513000030">The Government know that
Conservative Members support their attempts to deal with the problem of
clinical negligence litigation. As we have heard, the current process
is complex, costly and too lengthy. Most clinical negligence cases are
legal aid funded and most fail, at great expense to the NHS, the
taxpayer and, ultimately, the patient. However, most people do not
qualify for legal aid. They therefore seek a credible and independent
alternative to going to court. The NHS redress scheme could offer such
an alternative.</p><p><a name="06060513000031">However, the fundamental
dividing line between us and the Government is that, whereas the
Secretary of State today envisaged a scheme that would make the NHS
effectively judge and jury in its own case, we firmly believe that
investigating the facts of what went wrong should be separated from the
process of the NHS assessing its liability and making an offer.
Moreover, that investigative process must be independent, like the
coroner&#146;s court and what happens under the provisions of the
Inquiries Act 2005.</p>

<p><a name="06060513000032">The Government have pledged to
reverse our key amendments, which were won in another place by a
cross-party coalition and with the help of the Liberal Democrats. It
falls to the Minister to explain exactly why he will ask 300 or so of
his colleagues to troop through the Lobby to remove an essential
feature of independence from the new scheme, which has the support of
the Law Society and Action against Medical
Accidents.</p><p><a name="06060513000033"><b><a name="06060513000152">Mr.
Graham Stuart:</b> Does my hon. Friend agree that the
Government have diagnosed the problem correctly, put enormous effort
into tackling it and yet, by failing to put independence at the heart
of the new system, could pluck defeat from the jaws of victory? The
Minister may not concede the point in his winding-up speech but I hope
that the Government will do soin Committee and join Labour
Members, includingthe hon. Member for Birmingham,
Erdington(Mr. Simon), and Conservative Members who spoke
strongly in favour of the need for independence. We could have true
independence and the Bill could be a genuine legacy of the Government
if only they agreed to the
proposal.</p><p><a name="06060513000034"><b><a name="06060513000153">Mr.
Baron:</b> My hon. Friend makes a valuable point, which
several hon. Members have raised. If we do not put independence at the
core of the Bill, no matter how strongly the Government may argue that
it is effective and fair, many NHS patients will not perceive it as
such. If it does not have the confidence of NHS patients, we are
engaged in an uphill struggle to try to ensure that patients receive
the redress that they are due and that they are happy with the process.
Otherwise, it will solve no problems.</p><p><a name="06060513000035"><b><a name="06060513000154">Mr.
Simon:</b> It is important to make it clear that, although
everything hon. Members said about perception is true, that is only
half the point. The scheme needs to be independent for reasons of
efficacy as well as perception. It should be independent because 
<br><notus-date day="5" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>5 Jun 2006 : Column 72</b><br>only independence will produce the right outcomes and do the job
properly. It needs not only to be seen to be independent but to be
independent.</p><p><a name="06060513000036"><b><a name="06060513000155">Mr.
Baron:</b> I agree. Independence should be atthe
Bill&#146;s core. We attempted to do that with the amendments that
were carried in another place. We shall now thrash out the arguments in
Committee about how best to ensure that independence remains a feature
of the Bill.</p><p><a name="06060513000037">The
bottom line is that we agree with the Bill&#146;s overall objectives,
which are to create a scheme for efficient and speedy redress for NHS
patients who have suffered harm through negligence while receiving
treatment. We all agree that reform is desperately needed. A typical
claim can take several years. The process is too long and costly and
largely fuelled by legal aid. In short, it is a mess and does not
reflect patient priorities. As we have heard from hon. Members of all
parties, the aggrieved patient often wants an explanation, an apology
when due, and the reassurance that those who committed the clinical
error acknowledge their wrong and that lessons are learned for the
benefit of other patients. However, that does not often
happen.</p><p><a name="06060513000038">The system is
widely viewed as unfair. Most clinical negligence cases are funded by
legal aid, yet most people are not eligible for legal aid. Many of the
vast majority of those who cannot access legal aid are put off from
pursuing a negligence claim because of the cost and complexity
involved, regardless of whether the grievance is legitimate.</p><p><a name="06060513000039">In its original form, the Bill
was fundamentally flawed as it did not provide what is needed&#151;an
open, independent fact-finding investigation that reflects the
interests and priorities of patients. That is why we combined forces
with the Liberal Democrats and Cross Benchers in the other place to
force amendments onthe Government that ensure the
independence of investigations. Otherwise, the Government&#146;s
proposals would have had the NHS investigating itself as judge and jury
in its own cause&#151;a modern form of Star Chamber&#151;which
would represent a clear conflict of interest, with the NHS Litigation
Authority being asked to take responsibility for running the entire
scheme, from hearing the facts to determining liability and awarding
compensation.</p><p><a name="06060513000040">Paying
a fixed fee for a lawyer to adjudicate at the end of the process would
not guarantee that the process was independent. We do not know what the
fixed fee would be or what sort of in-depth analysis would be
conducted. The lawyer may be asked to adjudicate on facts that, for
whatever reason, had not been fairly construed.</p><p><a name="06060513000041">The Bill, as amended, now
provides for a robust, independent investigation, limited to fact
finding. We must remember that investigating the facts must logically
precede any consideration of fault. We suggest that the investigation
should be conducted by independent NHS redress investigators as an
inquisitorial process. The coroner&#146;s inquest provides a model.
The investigation we envisage would also comply with the spirit of the
Inquiries Act 2005, which provides that inquiries may be wide ranging
but limited to fact finding, and not consider legal liability. 
<br><notus-date day="5" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>5 Jun 2006 : Column 73</b><br>However, that should not prevent fault from being inferred from the
determination of fact. In other words, what we are suggesting is
already in practice every day. The investigation process we envisage
may provide the basis of the explanation, any apology, recommendations
and assessment of civil
liability.</p><p><a name="06060513000042">Under our
proposals, the investigation of the facts would be open and with
prejudice. That means that the findings of fact would be robust and
could have evidential value outside the redress scheme. By separating
fact finding from fault finding, the findings of fact by independent
investigators would be open. Thereafter, patients would have available
to them a range of options for settling disputes. In addition, the NHS
Litigation Authority could offer compensation on the basis of its
privileged assessment of its
liability.</p><p><a name="06060513000043">Compensation
under the amended redress scheme would be as in the original Bill.
However, our proposal provides patients with a range of options at the
end of the fact-finding stage should they wish to seek compensation.
They may accept an offer under the proposed redress scheme, they may
seek to negotiate a settlement or they may wish to enter into a
resolve-type scheme. The courts would be available as a last resort.
Different cases may require different approaches and procedures. Choice
and flexibility should be available. The fact-finding investigation we
propose may also provide the basis of an assessment of liability for
any proposed claim. We propose that a Mackenzie-type friend should be
available to provide support and guidance for
claimants.</p><p><a name="06060513000044">The
original Bill did not reflect patient priorities. Research has shown
that when something goes wrong, patients often want an explanation and
an apology, and an assurance that lessons have been learned.
Compensation does not necessarily rank high on their list. The open,
independent, fact-finding investigation that we propose reflects those
priorities. Patient safety is promoted by ensuring that lessons learned
are not lost. The Government&#146;s focus on compensation does not
reflect patient priorities and may subvert the purpose of the
investigation. It means also that the importance of the explanation and
any lessons risk being
relegated.</p><p><a name="06060513000045">The
original Bill would have provided a demand-led, open-ended, cost-free
and risk-free scheme for claiming compensation. That would have proved
unnecessarily costly and wasteful of resources better directed to
patient care. In addition, the regulatory impact assessment
states:</p><a name="06060513000139"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;The
vast majority of opportunistic claims will be easily
rejected&#148;.</p></ul><p><a name="06060513000046">However, the
Government will struggle to provide evidence for that. We know that the
Government are concerned about that, as evidenced by their talk last
year of introducing conditional fee arrangements as a way of ensuring
that only claims with merit proceed. That idea was
shelved.</p><p><a name="06060513000047">The claim
that our scheme would increase costs to &#163;41 million is spurious.
The Government do not recognise that the infrastructure has to be in
place anyway, and we are attempting to simplify the scheme by
restricting it to a fact-finding, independent investigation.</p><br><notus-date day="5" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>5 Jun 2006 : Column 74</b><br><p><a name="06060513000048">Our proposals
put patients, not the health service, at the centre of the redress
scheme. By confining the investigation of a case to fact finding by an
independent process, and separating fault finding, we would largely
avoid the problems of the original Bill. Patients&#146; interests
would be safeguarded by independence, so they would be more likely to
have confidence in the system. Our proposals would allow patients
access to a fairer and perhaps better result. No scheme would be
perfect, but our amendments to the Bill are a substantial improvement.
Our proposals would be more likely to lead to a fair outcome, weed out
spurious claims and meet patients&#146; expectations. My final plea
to the Government is: please leave the Bill
alone.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="06060513000146">6.46
pm</h5><p><a name="06060513000049"><b><a name="06060513000156">The
Minister of State, Department of Health (Andy Burnham):</b> We
have had a good debate this afternoon, which has been something of a
parliamentary rarity in that we all know something of what we are
talking about. That is&#151;dare I say it?&#151;not always the
case. All hon. Members, especially those who have contributed to the
debate, will have had firsthand experience of the NHS complaints system
and of helping constituents to obtain redress from it. As a result,
hon. Members talk with knowledge and authority on the issue.</p><p><a name="06060513000050">I acknowledge that the process
can be unsatisfactory and frustrating, often deeply so, for individuals
and their families. The hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood (Mr. Hurd)
cited the statistic that since 1995 38 per cent. of cases have been
abandoned before reaching a conclusion and 43 per cent. have been
settled out of court. Those figures show that the current system does
not deliver much satisfaction to NHS patients and their
families.</p><p><a name="06060513000051">The vast
majority of patients and families are not motivated by a desire to hurt
the NHS or to take it to the cleaners, as my hon. Friend the Member for
Crawley (Laura Moffatt) said. They simply want the system to take
proper notice of what has happened, to apologise and to show that steps
are being taken to ensure that other patients do not suffer in the same
way. Members on both sides of the House have made that point about the
motivation of the vast majority of those who come through the doors of
our constituency surgeries with complaints about the NHS. We are united
on that.</p><p><a name="06060513000052">It is because
the system often does not respond in the right way that people feel
that they have no alternative but to use the legal route&#151;it is
the only way to get those responsible to sit up and take notice. That
said, the hon. Member for Broxbourne (Mr. Walker)&#151;for whom I
have great respect&#151;said that the system never says sorry. That
is not entirely true. There have been many examples of good practice in
the NHS and we increasingly see a spirit of openness and a willingness
to accept criticism and address problems head on. However, I am sure
that the NHS could improve inthat
regard.</p><p><a name="06060513000053"><b><a name="06060513000157">Mr.
Walker:</b> I stand corrected. I should perhaps have said that
in many cases the NHS is reluctant to
apologise.</p><br><notus-date day="5" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>5 Jun 2006 : Column 75</b><br><p><a name="06060513000054"><b><a name="06060513000158">Andy
Burnham:</b> I agree with the hon. Gentleman that the culture
has perhaps not encouraged the issuing of apologies; he was right to
draw attention to that point. The point was also made very forcefully
by my hon. Friends the Members for Crawley and for Livingston (Mr.
Devine) that the culture has not been there to encourage those working
at every level in the system to accept responsibility.</p><p><a name="06060513000055">There has been broad consensus
in the House today that we could do better, and the Bill seeks to
engender a culture change, a spirit of openness and a willingness to
find resolution. This is an important reform that is in tune and
consistent with other reforms that the Government are making to ensure
that the patient is truly at the heart of the NHS and that the NHS
responds first and foremost to the interests of the patient. So we have
a good measure of agreement.</p><p><a name="06060513000056">Many points of detail have been
raised in the debate today, and I shall seek to address them in order.
However, I shall leave until last the major point of substance about
which there has been disagreement across the House&#151;the issue of
independence. The hon. Member for South Cambridgeshire (Mr. Lansley)
said that this was not a party-political debate, and he was absolutely
right. As a new boy to this job, I was pleased and surprised to hear
him outline his policy on clinical negligence. That was the first
Conservative policy that I have come across in that area. So there is
one up on the board, and we look forward to a few more appearing in the
not-too-distant future.</p><p><a name="06060513000057">The hon. Gentleman also said
that the scheme proposed in the Bill is what the NHS should be doing
anyway. That is partly true, but I hope that he will accept that one of
the problems with the present system is the confusion that often
results because the system is unsure whether a patient is also bringing
legal action. This can result in a kind of stand-off, and in
uncertainty as to the status of the complaint. The Bill will bring
absolute clarity to the situation and create a space in which
complaints can be clearly
addressed.</p><p><a name="06060513000058">The hon.
Gentleman also mentioned disclosure, saying that the provisions would
not leave the patient any better off, because nothing would be
disclosed. That is not the case. Under the scheme, relevant material
will be disclosed to the patient. We are also considering whether an
investigation report should be issued to the patient at the end of the
process, and we will consider that matter further in consultation with
stakeholders. The scheme will not leave the patient no better informed.
Indeed, the whole point of the Bill is that patients will be able to
find out what has happened and see the information relating to their
case. So I am happy to put the hon. Gentleman right on that
point.</p><p><a name="06060513000059"><b><a name="06060513000159">Mr.
Graham Stuart:</b> Can the Minister give us any clue as to the
time frame within which patients making a complaint might expect to
receive the document to which he has
referred?</p><p><a name="06060513000060"><b><a name="06060513000160">Andy
Burnham:</b> That is an important point, and it was also
raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Edgbaston (Ms
Stuart)&#151;</p><p><a name="06060513000061"><b><a name="06060513000161">Mr.
Simon:</b> And Erdington.</p><br><notus-date day="5" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>5 Jun 2006 : Column 76</b><br><p><a name="06060513000062"><b><a name="06060513000162">Andy
Burnham:</b> Erdington and Edgbaston. There is a confusing
number of Birmingham constituencies beginning with &#147;E&#148;.
Both my hon. Friends raised that point. It is intended that each stage
of the scheme will be governed by time limits to ensure consistency and
appropriate speed in the handling of cases. The hon. Member for
Beverley and Holderness (Mr. Stuart) has asked a fair question, and I
can tell him that the time limits will be set out in secondary
legislation after full consultation with stakeholders. We want to
ensure that the limits are practical and effective, and that they do
their job without placing on the service undue burdens to provide
information. We accept the principle that there should be time limits,
because we want the system to deliver the speediest possible redress
while ensuring that a full inquiry takes place. My hon. Friends the
Members for Birmingham, Edgbaston and for Birmingham, Erdington (Mr.
Simon) both drew our attention to that issue.</p><p><a name="06060513000063">The hon. Member for South
Cambridgeshire also questioned us on the issue of tort, and asked why
we had moved away from the recommendations in the &#147;Making
Amends&#148; report. When developing the redress policy, officials
had a series of meetings with stakeholders to discuss the practicality
and desirability of an alternative to the existing legal test of
liability. Among the alternative tests examined was one based more on
determining whether harm caused to a patient could or should have been
avoided, rather than on making reference to an act or omission of an
individual clinician. However, it became clear that changing the whole
basis of clinical negligence law was likely tobe extremely
difficult and time consuming. The Department reached the conclusion
that, given that many of the problems in the present system relate to
its adversarial nature, to the time that it takes and to the high
administrative and legal costs involved, reform of the test itself was
neither desirable nor necessary. So we have concentrated on delivering
what we believe will be a better system to provide better redress for
the cases that meet the existing legal test for
liability.</p><p><a name="06060513000064"><b><a name="06060513000163">Mr.
Simon:</b> I wonder whether the Minister can see the logic in
my suggestion. If the Government insist that tort should remain at the
heart of the Bill, and if the test is to be a purely legal one, the
Bill must surely include the provision of legal advice to the claimant
throughout the process if it is to make any sense. If the people who
are trying to get justice are to be genuinely empowered, they will need
to be given legal advice.</p><p><a name="06060513000065"><b><a name="06060513000164">Andy
Burnham:</b> I will answer my hon. Friend directly. There is a
danger there of replicating the present system. The new scheme will do
things differently and better for the individual patient. However, he
makes a fair point. I draw his attention to clause 8 of the Bill, which
provides the flexibility for legal advice to be made available, not
only at the end of the process but throughout it. It could, for
example, be made available when a joint medical expert is appointed. It
will be possible for advice to be provided; there is flexibility in the
Bill in that regard. Perhaps we will return to this issue in Committee,
but in the majority of cases, the advice will be needed at the point at
which an offer is made, when the process has reached its resolution,
and our proposals for the development of the scheme reflect
that.</p><br><notus-date day="5" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>5 Jun 2006 : Column 77</b><br><p><a name="06060513000066"><b><a name="06060513000165">Mr.
Hurd:</b> If an offer is rejected, will the patient have the
right of appeal, or will his or her only destination at that point be
the
courts?</p><p><a name="06060513000067"><b><a name="06060513000166">Andy
Burnham:</b> It is not our intention to allow an appeal. We
want the scheme to work properly to provide speedy redress to the
patient. The patient will not lose their right to take the matter
further, however. The right to refer the matter to the health service
ombudsman is enshrined in the Bill, and people will obviously retain
their legal right to take further action. In our view, it would be too
bureaucratic to keep reviewing and appealing the decisions, and that is
not the intention behind the scheme.</p><p><a name="06060513000068"><b><a name="06060513000167">Mr.
Baron:</b> Will the Minister give
way?</p><p><a name="06060513000069"><b><a name="06060513000168">Andy
Burnham:</b> I want to make a little more progress. I will
give way to the hon. Gentleman in due course, if that is
okay.</p><p><a name="06060513000070">My hon. Friend
the Member for Birmingham, Erdington spoke well, and I appreciate the
work that he does in his role as patron of AvMA&#151;Action against
Medical Accidents. I appreciate the work of that organisation, and his
welcome for the Bill. He made the interesting point that the vast
majority of cases had already been rigorously investigated by the NHS
before going on to be unsuccessfully defended. That underlines the
point that we need a different way of doing things, and that the system
needs to be able to react differently to the handling of complaints. So
my hon. Friend made an important point, but the conclusion that I draw
from it is different from his.</p><p><a name="06060513000071">The hon. Member for Romsey
(Sandra Gidley) placed particular emphasis on the lack of provision for
primary care in the Bill. However, as the Secretary of State explained
earlier, primary care is governed by an entirely different set of
arrangements. The NHS Litigation Authority does not have responsibility
for the provision of primary care. It is possible that people might in
future seek to extend the ambit of the Bill, but that is not on the
agenda at the moment. It is important that we put in place a scheme
that works for hospital care&#151;secondary care. The arrangements
that already cover patients and provide protection to them in the
primary care setting&#151;the professional indemnity that primary
care practitioners have&#151;will continue to be the way that their
claims can be met. Of course, at that level, claims tend to be smaller
than those in the secondary
setting.</p><p><a name="06060513000072"><b><a name="06060513000169">Mr.
Beith:</b> If that is so, why does paragraph 92 of the
Government response to the Constitutional Affairs Committee report say
of the
scheme:</p><a name="06060513000140"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;If it
is successful in delivering a better response for patients...the
Department will want those benefits to be available for all NHS
patients and will consider extending the
scheme.&#148;?</p></ul><p><a name="06060513000073">Was that not
meant to imply that the scheme might eventually cover primary
care?</p><p><a name="06060513000074"><b><a name="06060513000170">Andy
Burnham:</b> The right hon. Gentleman is correct in saying
that there is not a closed mind here, but we shall review the position
in due course. The important thing is to get a scheme that works for
hospital care and then to see whether the will or consensus is there in

<br><notus-date day="5" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>5 Jun 2006 : Column 78</b><br>the future. Such an extension would significantly widen the ambit of the
scheme and significantly increase its cost. At this stage, it would not
be right to go in that direction, but as I have said, that is not to
say that the position is
closed.</p><p><a name="06060513000075">The hon.
Member for Romsey made some important points. She said that there is an
unwillingness to own up early in the NHS and that we need a change in
culture, which would save so much time and effort. On hearing that, I
thought that she was about to support what we are doing, because those
things need to be internal to the NHS, not externally imposed. The only
way to get internal culture change&#151;she rightly drew attention to
this&#151;is to encourage the NHS from within to adopt a different
culture.</p><p><a name="06060513000076">There are
issues of independence, which I shall come to, but I want to stress to
the hon. Lady that most trusts have a lay non-executive on the board
who is specifically charged with dealing with matters relating to
complaints. That is true of my local trust. There is already
independence within the arrangements, and it is important not to ignore
that fact.</p><p><a name="06060513000077">The hon.
Lady also mentioned the value of compensation and people not being
short-changed, but there could be no incentive under this scheme to
short-change people or to give them a value less than they would get in
the courts, because that would simply encourage taking a claim further
to the legal level, duplication of effort and further cost to the
system. I do not believe that it is in the interests of the NHS
knowingly to offer less than would be obtained in a legal setting. I
hope she is reassured on that
point.</p><p><a name="06060513000078">My hon. Friend
the Member for Cardiff, North (Julie Morgan), who has apologised for
being unable to be present, made an extremely important point. She
welcomed clause 17, particularly its permissive and deliberately broad
powers to enable our colleagues in the Welsh Assembly to develop their
own redress scheme that meets the needs of the Welsh health service.
She rightly drew attention to the speedy resolution scheme and the
various aspects of it, which we can learn from. We will seek to draw
from them as we take our proposals
forward.</p><p><a name="06060513000079">The right
hon. Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed (Mr. Beith) raised the West Lothian,
or the Borders, question. It is obviously a fair question, but it is
often one that vexes legislation of this kind. The statement of policy
on NHS redress
states:</p><a name="06060513000141"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Where
hospital services are commissioned as part of the NHS in England from a
healthcare provider outside of England and Wales, the commissioning
body&#148;&#151;</p></ul><p><a name="06060513000080">the PCT, in
the normal run of
events&#151;</p><a name="06060513000142"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;will run
the scheme and coordinate the investigation, and where appropriate make
the offer of
redress.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06060513000081">The liability
as I understand it, not being a lawyer, is of a different kind, but I
believe that there is protection for the right hon. Gentleman&#146;s
constituents should they choose to be treated in Scottish hospitals.
That is something that we would want to encourage, rather than take
away.</p><p><a name="06060513000082">The right hon.
Gentleman drew attention to the costs of the scheme, but as the hon.
Member for Romsey said from the Liberal Democrat Front Bench, the costs
can vary from year to year, so it is difficult to give any precise
costs for the scheme. Cases can vary 
<br><notus-date day="5" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>5 Jun 2006 : Column 79</b><br>and it is important that we all accept that. We cannot plan with
absolute certainty on those
matters.</p><p><a name="06060513000083">My hon.
Friend the Member for Crawley spoke passionately and authoritatively,
as befits someone of her standing in the NHS. She was right to talk of
the effect on staff of the pressure that such complaints can bring.
That aspect was missing from our debate until she rightly introduced
it. I am sure that those complaints place huge distress on the members
of a clinical team who have been involved in an incident where
something has gone wrong. She drew attention to one herself.</p><p><a name="06060513000084">Things are obviously extremely
difficult for people in such circumstances, which, again, makes the
point for the Bill, in that those people should be supported. People
will make mistakes, so we must consider how the system supports someone
through that process and encourages them to be able to make redress
through their employer or organisation. We must produce a more
satisfactory result than a finger-pointing culture and neither the
patient nor the staff feeling
satisfied.</p><p><a name="06060513000085">My hon.
Friend was right to draw attention to that issue, and she also said
that we need a simple scheme that creates confidence in the NHS that it
will work. Again, she was right to make that point. The hon. Member for
Broxbourne made a similar point, drawing attention to a particularly
distressing constituency case. He spoke well, and also spoke kindly of
my predecessor, who would thank him for that. We offer our sympathies
to the individual involved in that case and would want to learn from
it.</p><p><a name="06060513000086">My hon. Friend the
Member for Worsley (Barbara Keeley) raised the case of Mr. Stanley
Collins, who sadly died at Bolton hospital, and the difficulties
encountered by his daughter, Mrs. Dawn Smallman, in getting the system
to face up to the clear inadequacies in his care. My hon. Friend
described them in a measured and compassionate way. She was right to
say that such injury can be compounded by the process of trying to get
redress through the system. I am sure that her comments will have been
heard by others outside the House today in relation to whether we can,
at this stage, get the hospital to take those issues
up.</p><p><a name="06060513000087">My hon. Friend
also raised an important issue of communication by clinical staff with
patients at a distressing time. It is my experience of patients who
come to my constituency surgery that they recall every single word of
what was said to them, as well as the manner in which those words were
imparted. They are seared on people&#146;s minds for the rest of
their lives.</p><p><a name="06060513000088">Receiving
such news can be the single most important event in people&#146;s
lives. There is great professionalism in the service, but people would
always do well to remember the point that the way in which people hear
difficult news can be extremely important. My hon. Friend made a
significant point in drawing our attention to
that.</p><p><a name="06060513000089">Before I close,
I want to deal with the main point of substance between us&#151;that
is, the measure of independence in our proposals. Our remarks have
drawn out the fundamental differences between how we and Conservative
Members in particular see the scheme.</p><br><notus-date day="5" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>5 Jun 2006 : Column 80</b><br><p><a name="06060513000090">Let me say quite clearly that
this is the NHS Redress Bill. The Bill relates to the NHS itself; the
NHS has ownership of it. It is about getting the NHS to face up to
mistakes when things go wrong, take ownership of them and make proper
redress to people who are on the receiving end of inadequacies in care.
There is a crucial difference, in that this is an internal system that
the NHS will feel it owns and has control
of.</p><p><a name="06060513000091">As I understand
the proposals tabled by the Opposition in relation to clause 12, the
same process would effectively be created twice, but there would be a
more adversarial system&#151;a finger-pointing culture&#151;
whereby people would feel under pressure, which is not the purpose of
the Bill we are introducing. That takes us back to my comments to my
hon. Friend the Member for
Crawley.</p><p><a name="06060513000092"><b><a name="06060513000171">Mr.
Baron:</b> The Minister makes the point that we are
considering the question of ownership by the NHS, but I put it to him
that the central issue is whether patients will be fairly treated and
whether they will have a system that best meets their priorities. We
suggest that the best way to achieve that is to have a system that is
truly independent.</p><p><a name="06060513000093">Our
proposal is not more adversarial, because we suggest splitting fact
finding from fault finding. Bringing in the fault finding creates the
adversarial aspect, so we suggest that the redress scheme simply
restrict itself to fact finding. That should not be adversarial in
itself.</p><p><a name="06060513000094"><b><a name="06060513000172">Andy
Burnham:</b> I want to explore that with the hon. Gentleman in
Committee, but if we want a change of culture in the NHS and if we
really want it to respond differently when confronted with a poor
patient experience, it must be right that the NHS can make its own
response to take ownership of the situation. It must be right for the
NHS to understand what is going on. The service is perfectly capable of
establishing and presenting the facts. That is what it does already,
but we can ensure that does it even
better.</p><p><a name="06060513000095">Patients will
retain the ability to take their claims to the courts through an
independent legal process. That has not been signed away by the scheme.
The hon. Gentleman, and others who have used the phrase, are wrong to
say that the NHS is judge and jury. That is patently not the
case.</p><p><a name="06060513000096"><b><a name="06060513000173">Mr.

signing their rights away in pursuing cases under the Bill. It simply
gives some breathing space&#151;some time&#151;in which the NHS can
examine what has happened, engage positively with the family involved
and establish whether a better way can be found of giving them what
they want: an apology, an explanation and, crucially, an assurance that
the same thing will not happen to someone else. My argument, which I
shall develop with the hon. Gentleman in Committee, is that our
proposals will deliver that result better than a replication of an
adversarial, finger-pointing, accusatory system. The hon. Gentleman is
advancing a fundamentally different proposal, with which we do not
agree.</p><br><notus-date day="5" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>5 Jun 2006 : Column 81</b><br><p><a name="06060513000099">Let me refer the hon. Gentleman

Peter Bone (Wellingborough) (Con):</b> I thankMr.
Speaker for giving me the opportunity to discuss an issue that is
becoming increasingly significant inmy constituency. I also
thank the Minister for his attendance and look forward to his response.
I welcome my hon. Friend the Member for Kettering (Mr. Hollobone) to
the debate&#151;we share the same basic police area, and I know of
his concern about
crime.</p><p><a name="06060514000026">When I applied
for the debate, the title that I proposed was &#147;Vandalism,
Graffiti, Arson, Muggings and Yob Culture in Wellingborough&#148;.
That was changed on the Order Paper to &#147;Tackling antisocial
behaviour in Wellingborough&#148;. I want to make it clear from the
start why I do not believe that &#147;antisocial behaviour&#148; is
an adequate description of the problem in my
constituency.</p><p><a name="06060514000027">In
certain parts of Wellingborough, yob culture is rife. It is that yob
culture&#151;what is described as &#147;low-level
crime&#148;&#151;that is having such a devastating effect on many
law-abiding citizens in my constituency. Yob culture, vandalism,
thuggery, muggings, arson, drug-dealing and generally threatening
behaviour may not command the same seriousness in the eyes of the law
as high-level crimes, but they blight the lives of many, many innocent
people. Those people feel that the law is letting them down&#151;that
the law is on the side of the criminal, not the victim. They feel
helpless. I am here today to stand up for those people in my
constituency.</p><p><a name="06060514000028">&#147;Antisocial
behaviour&#148; is not a strong enough phrase to describe the despair
that families in my constituency are experiencing at the hands of
mindless criminals who make it their mission to disrupt the everyday
lives of innocent people. These yobs are criminals, and they must be
caught and tried as
such.</p><p><a name="06060514000029">One of my
constituents had huge concerns about law and order in the other major
town in my constituency, Rushden. Councillor David Childs was both a
district and a town councillor, and he was very concerned about the
level of crime and violence in the town, especially on Friday and
Saturday nights. He had suffered unprovoked attacks on two separate
occasions. David was not a professional politician; he was an ordinary,
decent person who wanted to serve the community in which he lived. He
was a local plumber and a family man. Although he held Conservative
views, his interest was in helping the local community, regardless of
party politics. He played an active role in promoting social life in
Rushden through his many interests, including &#147;Party in the
Park&#148;.</p><p><a name="06060514000030">Like
many local councillors, David wanted to see a greater police presence
in the town. I have mentioned him first because it was he who first
alerted me to the problems of yob culture in Rushden. On 4 May this
year, David was made mayor of Rushden. Unfortunately, a week ago today
he died of asbestos-related cancer. I shall attend his funeral
tomorrow. David will be sorely missed by his family, friends and
colleagues, and by the people of Rushden.</p><br><notus-date day="5" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>5 Jun 2006 : Column 85</b><br><a name="06060514000067"><p>Yob culture is growing in
Wellingborough. For some families, the situation has become so
unbearable that they feel that the only option is to take the law into
their own hands. They are fed up with being victims of the mindless
youths who terrorise their lives. I run the Listening to Wellingborough
and Rushden campaign. We regularly survey local people because I feel
it is important to listen to the views of people whom one represents
and then campaign for change on their behalf. The campaign was formed
because only by listening to people makes is possible fully to
appreciate their problems and concerns.</p><p><a name="06060514000031">The listening campaign seeks
the views of local people through surveys, public meetings and
doortodoor canvassing, as well as by e-mail and telephone. We regularly
send out surveys to residents asking what local and national issues are
of most concern to them. Time after time, the number one issue of
concern for the people of Wellingborough is crime. In fact, the gap
between crime and the second biggest concern for my constituents is
increasing with every survey.</p><p><a name="06060514000032">Just last week, I had a meeting
with worried residents in the Croyland ward of Wellingborough. They
contacted me because they were fed up with a couple of problem families
in the area who were making the lives of everyone else a misery.
Several people who live in the Abbey road and Priory road area of
Croyland told me how they were subjected to a constant spate of
vandalism, graffiti, theft, abuse and even arson. Only a few residents
felt that they were able to come forward to let me know of their
suffering. Many of the other families, especially the elderly, who have
been affected by this explosion of yob culture in the area were too
scared to come forward; they were afraid of the repercussions that it
would cause. One name did get into the local media and that person's
garden was set on fire. How many more cases are there that we do not
know about? These are innocent victims who are too scared to say
anything in fear of being a target of revenge by mindless
criminals.</p><p><a name="06060514000033">The
meeting I had last week was also attendedby the police, the
antisocial behaviour officer for Wellingborough council and local
councillors Paul Ainge and Lesley Callnon. The residents of Abbey road
told us how they were consistently terrorised by the yobs. Their cars
have been vandalised so many times that someone made the point that
they no longer get the damage repaired because it will just happen
again. One person said that they were too frightened to go on holiday
because they were not sure what they would come home to.</p><p><a name="06060514000034">Many of the residents who
attended the meeting owned their houses. Some have tried to move out of
the area, but their property is unsaleable owing to the reputation of
those local yobs. Why should innocent families be forced to sell their
homes?</p><p><a name="06060514000035"><b><a name="06060514000093">David
Taylor (North-West Leicestershire) (Lab/Co-op):</b> I am sure
that the hon. Gentleman would not want to give the impression that
teenage thuggery, persistent truancy and general antisocial behaviour
are restricted to young people who happen to live in rented properties
on council or housing association estates. He is coming perilously
close to saying that. Some of the 
<br><notus-date day="5" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>5 Jun 2006 : Column 86</b><br>worst cases in north-west Leicestershire are in private estates around
the town
centre.</p><p><a name="06060514000036"><b><a name="06060514000094">Mr.
Bone:</b> I am grateful for that intervention. I tried to word
this passage of my speech particularly carefully because it would be
totally wrong and misleading to suggest that it is council tenants who
cause the problem. That is outrageous and wrong, but in this particular
case, as I shall explain, there are one or two families who are living
in council property and the question has been raised of why the council
is not doing something about it.</p><p><a name="06060514000037">The criminals whom residents
spoke of were all council tenants. The residents said, &#147;Why
should the council rent accommodation to people who are terrorising the
neighbourhood? Surely the council should have powers to evict families
who are acting in such an appalling manner.&#148; Why should they be
terrorised by those very few families, who happen to be councils
tenants?</p><p><a name="06060514000038">The system
is failing those people and the criminals know it. One of the mantras
that is being muttered around criminal circles in Wellingborough is,
&#147;You don&#146;t rob off your own. You rob off people who are
rich enough to afford insurance.&#148; When those yobs and vandals
get away with terrorising innocent people, they see no reason why their
criminal activities should not continue and grow in degree and
intensity.</p><p><a name="06060514000039">The
residents at the meeting gave the representatives of the council and
the police the names of the criminals. Both the police and the local
council were well aware of those criminals. Indeed, most of them were
repeat offenders, yet they are still living in council accommodation,
terrorising the innocent.</p><p><a name="06060514000040"><b><a name="06060514000095">Mr.
Philip Hollobone (Kettering) (Con):</b> I congratulate my hon.
Friend on securing this important debate. I know that he is a
constituency champion on these and other important local issues. He has
just made the point that the police, the council and the other agencies
know who these criminals and yobs are. Does he agree that the system is
such that the legal team at Wellingborough council, which is now a
joint team with Kettering council, finds it extremely difficult to
convince the courts that known criminals and yobs should be evicted
from their council
tenancies?</p><p><a name="06060514000041"><b><a name="06060514000096">Mr.
Bone:</b> My hon. Friend makes a powerful and true point. It
was interesting that when the residents were naming three or four
families who were causing the problems, before they finished the police
told them who the next family was. It is ridiculous&#151;the police,
the council and the victim know who is doing it, yet no action can be
taken.</p><p><a name="06060514000042">The police
sergeant at the meeting explained how the call centre worked when
people telephone the police. He stated that there is a call centre
grading system where the operator grades the seriousness of the crime,
which then receives the allocated and available resources. General
thuggery and yob crime is not high on the priority list, yet it is that
type of crime that affects so many people up and down the country. One
person summed it up at the meeting by saying that there is no point in
phoning the police if the group of 
<br><notus-date day="5" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>5 Jun 2006 : Column 87</b><br>known criminals are hanging around outside their property because they
would just get laughed at&#151;but it is that intimidation and the
lack of response which currently allows the criminals to
win.</p><p><a name="06060514000043">What we need in
Wellingborough, what we must have, is an increased police presence on
our streets. We need more police officers patrolling the beat, catching
criminals and deterring crime. The answer to the problem of yob culture
is not regional superforces, as proposed by the Government. In my
constituency, we have already lost our chief superintendent, who is now
based in Kettering. Public access to Wellingborough police station is
now part-time. Police resources have been diverted elsewhere, all to
the detriment of my
constituents.</p><p><a name="06060514000044">Under
the Government's plans for an east midlands superforce,
Northamptonshire police would mergewith Nottinghamshire,
Derbyshire, Leicestershire and
Lincolnshire.</p><p><a name="06060514000045">Our
police headquarters would be moved from Northampton to Nottingham, and
all that at a huge cost to the taxpayer. The money would be better
spent on local policing&#151;on more beat officers patrolling our
streets. It is proven that if we have a greater police presence on the
streets, the level of crime decreases.</p><p><a name="06060514000046"><b><a name="06060514000097">David
Taylor:</b> While I took issue with the hon. Gentleman the
first time I intervened, I endorse the point that he is making now. If
a force serving a population of 4.25 million has its headquarters 40 or
so miles away, it is likely to be less sensitive to local priorities on
antisocial behaviour not just in Wellingborough, but in Whitwick in
Leicestershire and Wirksworth in Derbyshire. The list could go on.
There is real concern that those priorities will be damaged as policing
resources are transferred to Nottingham and south Nottinghamshire to
tackle the evident problems there.</p><p><a name="06060514000047"><b><a name="06060514000098">Mr.
Bone:</b> Again, I am grateful for the hon. Gentleman's
intervention. I know of his concern, which he has expressed on many
occasions, about the proposal to create an east midlands regional
force, but I will come later specifically to that
point.</p><p><a name="06060514000048">Another area in
my constituency, Queensway, has experienced a lot of crime caused by
yob culture. The police recognised that that was a real problem
areaand ploughed huge police resources into the
neighbourhood. In Queensway, there was a particular problem with
burglaries. Extra police officers were drafted in to patrol the area 24
hours a day and the number of burglaries went down to zero. As soon as
that police presence was removed, the crime levels started to increase
again.</p><p><a name="06060514000049">The latest
crime figures were released last week. In north Northamptonshire, crime
figures were down in every area&#151;except Wellingborough. Crime was
up4 per cent. last year on the previous year&#146;s figure.
One in eight people in Wellingborough is a victim of crime. In
adjoining Kettering, the figure is one in 11. In the adjoining area of
east Northamptonshire, it is one 
<br><notus-date day="5" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>5 Jun 2006 : Column 88</b><br>in 16. In other words, a person is twice as likely to be a victim of
crime in Wellingborough as in an adjoining area.</p><p><a name="06060514000050">It is not just so-called
low-level crime that is on the rise. The surrounding areas of
Kettering, Corby and east Northamptonshire had a reduction in violent
crime; in Wellingborough, it increased. The other three areas also had
a decrease in criminal damage; in Wellingborough, it increased. Crime
is, unfortunately, out of control in Wellingborough, and something must
be done to protect its law-abiding citizens. It is proven that a strong
local police presence works. We need it in Wellingborough, and we need
it all the time.</p><p><a name="06060514000051">We
also need local, accountable chiefs to run our police forces. We need
sheriffs, directly elected by the people, to run our police service. If
they fail, they can be held directly accountable. At the moment, that
just does not happen. What we do not need are the Government&#146;s
superforces, which will take even more power away from our citizens,
who should have a voice in how their service is run. How can a chief of
police be accountable to the people of Wellingborough when he is based
in Nottingham? It is all well and good going back to having a sheriff
of Nottingham, but I want a sheriff of Wellingborough as
well.</p><p><a name="06060514000052">The Government
need to stop spending money on police community support officers and
start putting more money into having more real police officers. When
senior police officers are asked whether they want more PCSOs or more
real police officers, I thinkI know what the answer is. If
the people of Wellingborough are asked what they want more of, the
answer is more real police officers patrolling the streets, catching
criminals and deterring
crime.</p><p><a name="06060514000053">I wish to put a
number of suggestions to the Minister. Does he accept that top-down
policing, with national targets, has failed? How can the priorities of
Wellingborough, Nottingham, Lincoln and Market Harborough all be the
same? Does he accept that the woolly minded liberal thinking on yob
culture of the past 30 years or so has failed us? The liberal excuses
are that it is all the fault of poor education, that these young yobs
will grow out of it, and that it is always the community&#146;s fault
and never that of the individuals responsible. Is not all that absolute
rubbish? If the Minister does not accept that, will he explain why the
policies of the last decade have failed so miserably?</p><p><a name="06060514000054">On a more positive note, I
suggest that the Government take the problem seriously; that they set
up proper, long-term consultation; that they abandon their plans for
super police forces; that they look at least at the possibility of
elected sheriffs; that they look at mergers of police forces based on
operational needs, not regional boundaries; that they look at the case
for an office of homeland security; and that they consider running
pilot schemes of density policing with a zero-tolerance approach to
low-level crime. If they think that such pilots are a good idea, may I
volunteer Wellingborough as the
first?</p><p><a name="06060514000055">Would not it be
a good idea to reconsider penalties for yobs, thugs and vandals? Let us
have policing based on the needs of local people. It is not rocket
science&#151;we do not need a totally remote superforce, costing the
taxpayer millions of pounds, to solve the problem of crime. We need
more police, out on the beat. We need our chief superintendent restored
to 
<br><notus-date day="5" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>5 Jun 2006 : Column 89</b><br>Wellingborough. We need our police station open and manned full time. We
need zero tolerance of thugs, vandals and yobs. We need to be surprised
if we do not see a police officer patrolling the streets&#151;at the
moment, we are surprised if we do see
one.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="06060514000056">7.34

Deputy Speaker.</p><p><a name="06060514000060">I am
delighted to support my hon. Friend the Member for Wellingborough (Mr.
Bone) on the subject of his debate tonight. He and I share a local
paper,<i> </i>the <i> Northamptonshire Evening Telegraph</i>, and are
delighted that it is, this week and in recent weeks, featuring a series
of articles on crime and antisocial behaviour in Wellingborough,
Kettering and Corby. We have seen stories about residents in
Wellingborough and the sad circumstances of the crime and antisocial
behaviour from which they suffer. We should congratulate the paper on
its initiative. In raising the issue, it is probing the details of how
the problem can be tackled. That goes alongside another campaign that
the paper is running on the &#147;seven social sins&#148;, which
include the graffiti, vandalism and yobbery that my hon. Friend so
excellently
described.</p><p><a name="06060514000061">I have also
recently spent time with the local police force I share with my hon.
Friend. On two occasions, I have come into direct contact with crime
and antisocial behaviour in Wellingborough. On the first occasion, I
had the opportunity to telephone my hon. Friend from the Wellingborough
library, to which I had been driven, with the police scientific support
unit, to try to find fingerprint and DNA evidence of someone who had
broken in. After an extensive search, some very good footprints,
fingerprints and DNA samples were indeed found.</p><p><a name="06060514000062">The chances are that the person
who broke in, causing extensive damage to the library, is probably a
persistent and prolific offender who is very well known to the local
police. It is my view that such persistent and prolific offenders
should, when caught&#151;as they are by our local police&#151;and
when they are sentenced&#151;as they are by the courts&#151;should
serve their time in jail in full. Those persistent prolific offenders
are basically extremely bad people, most of whom are incapable of being
reformed. They commit 85 per cent. of local crime in Wellingborough,
and my point is that the police spend all their time chasing persistent
prolific offenders when they are released from jail. If they did not
have to do that, they could spend their time and resources on
introducing zero-tolerance the policies on crime and antisocial
behaviour that the people of Wellingborough
want.</p><p><a name="06060514000063">My other direct
experience of Wellingborough yobbery happened in a car park in Burton
Latimer, just over the border. I was on patrol with the local police as
part of the police parliamentary scheme when we came 
<br><notus-date day="5" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>5 Jun 2006 : Column 90</b><br>across a car at dead of night. Six Wellingborough youths were hanging
around outside it. The car was full of drug smoke&#151;it was almost
blue&#151;but no one was actually in the car. Because the six youths
involved were not in the car, there was little the local police could
do. They took names and addresses and searched the youths. They came to
the conclusion that the vehicle was a stolen one. Clearly, some kind of
crime had been committed, but the police decided that they simply could
not take action against the six youths because they were not sitting in
the car when the police
arrived.</p><p><a name="06060514000064">The point is
that the law somehow needs to be changed and the system adjusted so
that common-sense policing can take place. Despite the best efforts of
the local police in Wellingborough and Kettering, it is becoming
increasingly difficult for our local officers to present evidence to
courts that courts will accept. The burden of proof is simply, in many
cases, too great.</p><p><a name="06060514000065">In
that case, the police took names and addresses and let the youths go.
The car was taken to the Northamptonshire car pound and reported as a
stolen vehicle. I asked the officer concerned, &#147;What will happen
now that these youths have to walk back to Wellingborough?&#148; and
he said, &#147;Well, another car crime will probably be committed
tonight.&#148; That is the sad and sorry state that we have got into
in Northamptonshire.</p>

<p><a name="06060514000066">My fundamental point is that,
as my hon. Friend said, the police and the authorities know who the
yobs and the criminals are and they are doing their very best to sort
out the situation, but when those people are caught and sentenced, they
should serve their timein
full.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="06060513000147">7.40
pm</h5><p><a name="06060513000109"><b><a name="06060513000179">The
Minister for Policing, Security and Community Safety (Mr. Tony
McNulty):</b> I congratulate the hon. Member for
Wellingborough (Mr. Bone) on securing the debate and commend him on his
eloquence. These are hugely important issues. I take the point that he
made at the start: of course, these offences do not rank with the most
serious crimes&#151;murder, manslaughter and so on&#151;but the
impact on our communities is none the less quite severe, and blights
communities every
day.</p><p><a name="06060513000110">May I, through
the hon. Gentleman, pass on my commiserations to the family of
Councillor David&#151;I did not catch his second name; I do
apologise&#151;the recent mayor of Rushton? I commend his sadly now
deceased colleague for his public service and all his endeavours. I say
without fear or favour that councillors of all parties throughout the
country are doing a fine job for their communities, day in, day out,
and very often with little reward.</p><p><a name="06060513000111"><b><a name="06060513000180">David
Taylor:</b> The Minister says that councillors throughout the
country are doing just that sort of job, but does he acknowledge that
some councils appear reluctant to tackle antisocial behaviour and all
that goes with it in a systematic and adequate fashion? Does he welcome
what the Prime Minister has said today about the funding of councils
that do not get to grips with that as the three Back Benchers who are
in the Chamber are urging tonight?</p><br><notus-date day="5" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>5 Jun 2006 : Column 91</b><br><p><a name="06060513000112"><b><a name="06060513000181">Mr.
McNulty:</b> I am grateful to my hon. Friend for that
intervention, because I agree wholeheartedly with all that he says. We
must get to a stage where all the agencies involved in such matters
take them as seriously as our assorted communities in various
constituencies do, and I fully concur with him in that regard. Again,
beyond any sort of party dimension, there are councils up and down the
country that work very closely with their crime and disorder reduction
partnerships to great effect and do get it&#151;to use the modern
parlance&#151;with regard to the impact of such apparently low-level
crimes and yobbery on our communities. So I commend what my hon. Friend
has said, as well as the comments made by the hon. Members for
Wellingborough and for Kettering(Mr.
Hollobone).</p><p><a name="06060513000113">The
exasperation of many people in our communities, not least that of the
hon. Member for Wellingborough, may well lead them, at least in
passing, to think of taking the law into their own hands. I am sure
that he will join me in trying to exhort people not to do so,
regardless of their frustrations. As my hon. Friend the Member for
North-West Leicestershire (David Taylor) suggests, this is about
invoking the local machinery and stakeholders to ensure that things
improve.</p><p><a name="06060513000114">The hon.
Member for Wellingborough will know of examples of such improvements in
Wellingborough and elsewhere. None the less, as he suggests, the
starting premise is that yob culture, low-level crime, vandalism and
all that is wrapped up under the label of antisocial behaviour are
unacceptable and should not happen. That is very much on the agenda for
all of us, and the Government have tried to do any number of things in
that regard.</p><p><a name="06060513000115">Before I
go into some of the detail about Wellingborough and Northamptonshire,
and the national plans, let us take one step back. There are things
that can and should happen regarding the responsibilities of the
individual citizen and the family rather than the state, whether
locally or nationally. The hon. Gentleman will know that many of the
things that we outlined in the respect action plan relate to parenting,
education and how people should learn effectively to be good citizens,
and if not to respect, at least to tolerate one another.</p><p><a name="06060513000116">As my hon. Friend suggests, the
more people who condemn such behaviour as unacceptable and against the
grain the better. The notion of a culture that says that such behaviour
is acceptable, and just the way things are these days with young
children, is simply unacceptable, in Wellingborough and elsewhere. It
is clear in Wellingborough and elsewhere that people of all generations
and backgrounds are united in wanting antisocial behaviour to be
tackled head on, as it directly affects their quality of
life.</p><p><a name="06060513000117">The last time I
had the pleasure to share such a forum&#151;upstairs, I
believe&#151;with the hon. Gentleman and his colleague the hon.
Member for Kettering was in a debate specifically on the restructuring
of the east midlands police force. With respect, I will not go down
that route today, except to repeat that I am more than happy to meet
all the MPs from the east midlands, on a county basis or any other
basis, to speak directly to that policy, which, as I have been saying
over the past couple of days, involves important issues.</p><br><notus-date day="5" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>5 Jun 2006 : Column 92</b><br><p><a name="06060513000118">Crucial to the direction that
policing will take inthis country, with or without
super-forces, as thehon. Gentleman describes them, is the
continued implementation of what we are trying to do with forces
throughout the country in relation to neighbourhood policing. We are
trying to determine&#151;this is already well advanced in some ways
in Wellingborough&#151;how such neighbourhood policing will dovetail
with all the assorted local stakeholders, for want of a better phrase,
including the crime and disorder reduction partnership, so that those
involved can give the best of their resources to help local people. I
am know that thehon. Gentleman is aware of that, and that he
works well with Wellingborough&#146;s antisocial behaviour
co-ordinator and others in that
context.</p><p><a name="06060513000119">The truth is
that whatever the Government do in offering resources for policing and
in setting out our agenda and legislation on antisocial behaviour and
the respect action plan, we cannot impose those things on communities
to assist them. We must all work together locally and nationally across
assorted agencies to ensure that people get the protection that they
deserve.
</p><p><a name="06060513000120">Notwithstanding my
hon. Friend&#146;s comments, communities, councils, police forces and
other authorities throughout the country are increasingly taking a
stand against such behaviour. There are examples up and down the
country of the sort of tipping point that is reached when sufficient
effort and resources are put in by assorted local agencies&#151;when
we get to the stage where people say, &#147;We won&#146;t put up
with this sort of behaviour any more.&#148; At worst, the antisocial
behaviour moves elsewhere; at best, it is not displaced in that way,
because the people next door, too, make dealing with it a
priority.</p><p><a name="06060513000121">We want to
get to a stage where CDRPs, local police and local councils all work
together successfully to move towards precisely the sort of zero
tolerance that the hon. Gentleman suggests. It is almost a cultural
change, and that takes time. As my hon. Friend suggests, it has taken
time to break down some barriers between those assorted agencies, but
in the end more and more people are moving towards an acceptance that
although such crimes may be low level, they are increasingly
important.</p><p><a name="06060513000122">I do not
want to quibble with the hon. Gentleman about crime rates. The latest
information that I have for Wellingborough CDRP area and
Northamptonshire is that many of the figures that he has quoted are not
accurate about the measures taken in 2003-04 compared with 2004-05,
when burglary, theft, fraud and criminal damage all went in the right
direction&#151;down&#151;in Wellingborough and Northamptonshire.
However, I am sure that we can talk about statistics after the
debate.</p><p><a name="06060513000123">I still
accept that even if crime levels are moving in the right direction,
because of the malaise of antisocial behaviour, the perception in our
communities is that crime is being anything but reduced. I have
attended meetings similar to those that the hon. Member for
Wellingborough has organised, and I can say until I am blue in the
face, &#147;Yes, but Harrow is the safest but one borough in the
whole of London,&#148; only to be told time and again, &#147;Well,
it doesn&#146;t feel like it.&#148; So it is not just a question of
dry statistics, although I would contend 
<br><notus-date day="5" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>5 Jun 2006 : Column 93</b><br>that the statistics are going in the right direction; we must do all we
can with all the agencies concerned, to improve the
situation.</p><p><a name="06060513000124">The hon.
Member for Wellingborough referred, perhaps a tad unkindly, to the
Caspar project in Queensway. As he will know, it involved not just a
police presence but a whole series of other important elements that, in
some cases, sought to re-establish the fabric and infrastructure of the
local community. It did not, as the hon. Gentleman implied, provide
&#147;something for the kids to do&#148; in a liberal, woolly,
wishy-washy way; rather, it turned round that estate and improved the
situation. The project has not been 100 per cent. successful in
eradicating all the difficulties associated with antisocial behaviour,
but I hope that he will agree that it has improved the situation in
Queensway, and that the collective behaviour is far better than it was.
Such interventions are important. They may seem to be as low-level and
unimportant as many of the activities that we are discussing, but the
hon. Gentleman will know that they have led to significant improvements
in the community.</p><p><a name="06060513000125">Following the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s discussions with residents in Abbey road and Priory
road, the police are at least considering the use of measures such as
cameras and additional patrols. That shows that, through a partnership
in which the community and individual agencies collectively recognise
that such behaviour is no longer acceptable, the situation will
improve.</p><p><a name="06060513000126">There are
record numbers of police throughout the country, and there has been an
equivalent increase for Northamptonshire. While that should be taken as
read, it is important that local constables use the record level of
resources to the best of their ability in servicing local communities.
We are examining ways of ensuring that civilians do the jobs that
civilians should be doing, so that we can increase the number of
uniformed officers on the streets and reduce the number in police
stations. I should point out that that project has the full indulgence
and active participation of the police forces themselves, who are keen
to get officers out on the beat. I take issue, however, with the notion
that police community support officers have no real place in the
equation; they do, and they can work very well with the police. They
are not, and were never meant to be, substitute policemen, but they do
act as their eyes and ears and complement what they do in a
particularly productive way.
<i> [Interruption.]</i></p><p><a name="06060513000127">Despite
the fact that, as instructed, my phone is on &#147;Boothroyd&#148;
mode, the vibration is particularly loud and I cannot turn it down. I
apologise, Mr. Deputy Speaker.</p><p><a name="06060513000128">There are plans to introduce
more community support officers to assist the record numbers of police,
which is only right and proper. To judge by the London experience and
the way in which the Metropolitan police have configured their local
neighbourhood policing scheme, such schemes work very well. We will try
to ensure that the importance of neighbourhood policing is recognised
not only in Northamptonshire but throughout the country, regardless of
the debate on super-forces. The hon. Gentleman will know that
Wellingborough was one of the key locations in Northamptonshire where
the scheme was started. I do not have the timetable for when the rest
are to be 
<br><notus-date day="5" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>5 Jun 2006 : Column 94</b><br>introduced, but he will doubtless find out that information far more
readily than I could. Getting these people out on to the streets is
extremely
important.</p><p><a name="06060513000129">There was a
meeting at Downing street today to discuss antisocial
behaviour&#151;as the hon. Gentleman said, that was astute
timing&#151;at which, among other things, my right hon. Friend the
Secretary of State for Work and Pensions announced that we are
seriously considering the use of housing benefit sanctions for those
who rent in the social sector. However, I take the point, made by my
hon. Friend the Member for North-West Leicestershire, that antisocial
behaviour is not the preserve of those who rent in the social
sector.</p><p><a name="06060513000130"><b><a name="06060513000182">David
Taylor:</b> I am grateful to the Minister for that
reassurance. It is certainly true that powerful levers are available to
housing associations and local authorities in dealing with families
guilty of persistent antisocial behaviour. However, is there any new
thinking on the levers that might be necessary to tackle some of the
most persistent and dreadful incidents of antisocial behaviour, which
are just as likely to involve owner-occupiers? Indeed, two of the worst
cases of antisocial behaviour in my time as an MP&#151;in the
Coalville area of my constituency&#151;occurred precisely because no
such levers were available.</p><p><a name="06060513000131"><b><a name="06060513000183">Mr.
McNulty:</b> My hon. Friend makes an entirely fair point. In
dealing with such cases, the focus will have to come from a different
legislative base. As he suggests, it is through assorted social housing
powers and the dimension of housing benefit sanctions that we can fix
on those in the social sector. Thought is being given, in a general
sense, to how we might deal with those for whom such a sanction does
not exist. My own constituency experience shows that it in no way
follows that even the most persistent of offenders in an area are from
a particular social tendency; it depends entirely on the area in
question. The respect action plan provides new standards for housing
management, so that social landlords can understand what is expected of
them in dealing with misbehaving tenants. We are considering extending
that plan to the private rented sector, but that is a small, less
burgeoning sector, even in this day and age. A lot is
happening.</p><p><a name="06060513000132">I take the
hon. Gentleman&#146;s point about the impact on policing of low-level
inquiries into the &#147;fabric&#148; issues&#151;for want of a
better phrase&#151;associated with antisocial behaviour. Such
inquiries might better be undertaken by, say, environmental health
bodies, councils or others. We are trying to set up an alternative,
non-emergency number, called the 101 service. Northamptonshire is
included in the third wave of that service. We want to increase
awareness, so that people realise that if a car has been abandoned or
windows have been broken&#151;such behaviour might encourage those
who choose to hang around and make mischief&#151;they can call the
101 number.</p><p><a name="06060513000133">When the
service is up and running, it will, through the use of a filter, divert
the caller to the relevant council department, environmental health
body or agency. That will, we hope, take a significant burden away from
999 in the form of the sort of intermediate call that should go to the
police station rather than being dealt with in that way, and get some
reciprocity 
<br><notus-date day="5" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>5 Jun 2006 : Column 95</b><br>in terms of action following soon after our communities have made such
an inquiry. That will not solve all the issues, but it does assist in
that regard and addresses the important point that the hon. Member for
Wellingborough made at the start, which is that someone somewhere
should recognise that the consequences of destructive behaviour, or of
messing up a particular street scene or park, matter. They matter to
local communities, and so should matter to everybody else.</p><p><a name="06060513000134">The key to success is the
vigilance of local communities, of local councillors and MPs in
properly representing their communities, and of all community agencies,
including the crime and disorder reduction partnerships, working
together. It is also getting a model where neighbourhood policing has
far more substance than it has now&#151;and we are trying to do that.
I fully concur with the notion that the impact of such antisocial
behaviour and yobbery matters because 
<br><notus-date day="5" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>5 Jun 2006 : Column 96</b><br>it matters to our communities and to the cohesion of those communities,
and that our communities deserve a voice against it. That is what all
our legislation on antisocial behaviour has been about, and what all
the resources and investment that we have put into policing up and down
the country have been about. It is what the respect action plan is
about.</p><p><a name="06060513000135">Across the
Chamber, with the armoury of assorted ways to go forward, and with that
voice engaged, with locally elected councillors and the community
proper, we can get to the stage at which our communities can feel that
someone is listening&#151;I know that that is the
frustration&#151;that their voice matters, and that things will be
done both about the individuals concerned and the consequences of those
individuals&#146; antisocial behaviour. I again commend the hon.
Gentleman and congratulate him on raising this important debate, and on
the manner in which he has done so.</p><p><a name="06060513000136"><i> Question put and agreed
to.</i></p><p><a name="06060513000137"><i> Adjourned
