</p>


<p><a name="st_0"><a name="51103-01_spmin0"><b>The Secretary of State for Trade and Industry  (Alan   Johnson): </b> 
 My ministerial team and I have regular meetings about the security of the UK&#039;s energy supply, and particularly about the position for the forthcoming winter. We have also had discussions with a wide range of energy stakeholders. The gas market is likely to be tighter this year, compared with previous years, because of a larger than anticipated decline in North sea gas supplies. However, as Ofgem and National Grid have made clear, under normal weather conditions there are sufficient gas supplies and electricity generation to meet expected demand. Even in the severest of winters, their analysis shows that the market can maintain supplies. In all credible scenarios, energy supplies will be maintained for domestic customers.
</p>





<p><a name="st_1"><a name="51103-01_spnew0"><b> Mr. Stuart: </b> 
 We are a net importer of gas, yet we have no strategic reserve. We have liberalised gas markets, yet we have stood by while continental countries artificially protect theirs. UK businesses and consumers pay higher prices as a result. What reassurances can the Secretary of State give my constituents at Electro Furnace Products in Saltend that their jobs are safe from gas cuts and artificial price hikes?
</p>





<p><a name="st_2"><a name="51103-01_spnew1"><b> Alan Johnson: </b> 
 It is no good me giving answers if hon.   Members do not listen to them. As Ofgem and National Grid have made clear, under normal weather conditions, there are sufficient gas supplies and electricity generation to meet expected demand. Their analysis shows that, even in the severest of winters, the market will be able to maintain supplies. In relation to the hon. Gentleman&#039;s first point, we have moved from 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>3 Nov 2005 : Column 950</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>being a net exporter of gas to being a net importer. We are just in that process. As a result, the market is responding. As I said in my answer, the supply of gas from the North sea has run down more quickly than anyone expected it to. Nevertheless, that is what we have banked as our storage. Just as the Netherlands and Norway have no storage capacity because they have large gas fields, we still have significant storage there. We have a whole series of measures coming in before the winter, and another whole series next year. I would say to Conservative Members that the market really is working.
</p>

<p><a name="st_4"><a name="51103-01_spnew3"><b> Peter Luff  (Mid-Worcestershire)</b> 
 (Con): In his evidence to the Select Committee on Trade and Industry on Monday, the Minister for Energy confirmed that there would be a real risk of interruptions to supply for gas users this winter if, as the Met Office predicts, we have a colder than average winter. The Minister also said that he was prepared to consider certain exemptions, to maximise flexibility in the response to gas users, such as temporary exemptions from emissions regulations or from climate change regulations. Will the Secretary of State tell us what discussions he is having with industry and with his colleagues in the Government to bring forward those sensible proposals?
</p>





<p><a name="st_5"><a name="51103-01_spnew4"><b> Alan Johnson: </b> 
 I was aware of the hearing that took place with the Minister for Energy earlier this week. I am not accusing the hon. Gentleman of scaremongering in any way, although there are plenty of others around who are scaremongering on this issue. My hon. Friend the Minister was describing what would happen if there were a one in 50 winter. That is not being predicted by the Met Office, but we have discussed with the energy intensive users group a range of measures that might need to be put in place in such circumstances. That, however, is a long way from frightening domestic customers by saying that they are going to have their supplies cut off.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51103-01_para0">
<a name="stpa_0">On the hon. Gentleman&#039;s other point, he and his Committee have quite properly explored what would happen in an emergency, if there were a one in 50 winter, which we are not predicting at the moment. They have asked what measures would be in place to deal with such a situation. It was in that context that my hon. Friend the Minister talked about emissions, from chemical plants in particular. Such measures would need the authority of the Environment Agency, and no one would want to take such steps, even in the most extreme conditions. Nevertheless, the Government have to have contingency measures in place. The problem with talking about them is that we might give the impression that we are going to need them, but, as my answer has clearly demonstrated, and as the winter outlook report from National Grid and Ofgem shows, we do not expect to be in that situation this winter.

<p><a name="st_7"><a name="51103-01_spnew6"><b> Mr. Dennis Skinner  (Bolsover)</b> 
 (Lab): Is the Secretary of State aware that we do not need any lectures from the party that got rid of clean coal technology, shut the pits, and privatised our gas interests? What we do need is to ensure that in the forthcoming years&#151;not just this one&#151;we save what remains of the British coal industry, introduce the necessary clean coal technology, stop handing out large sums of money to UK Coal, which is using it for property development and shutting pits, and start a process such as the one at Tower colliery in Wales, where the miners themselves are able to produce the coal.
</p>





<p><a name="st_8"><a name="51103-01_spnew7"><b> Mr. Speaker: </b> 
 Order. I am also looking for brief supplementary questions.
</p>





<p><a name="st_9"><a name="51103-01_spnew8"><b> Alan Johnson: </b> 
 I agree with my hon. Friend about the record of the previous Government in respect of coal and the environmental damage left behind from the pits that they closed down. While I do not think that we will see the days of king coal again, coal is having a resurgence, and it will be a central feature of the energy review that my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister announced recently. On the final point, we are investing &#163;25 million, as we announced recently, to develop new carbon abatement technology such as carbon capture and storage, so there are some exciting developments that were not around even in 2003 when we published our energy White Paper.
</p>





<p><a name="st_10"><a name="51103-01_spnew9"><b> Mr. Tim Yeo  (South Suffolk)</b> 
 (Con): Why do the Government continue to dither over nuclear power? Is it not clear to the Secretary of State that the long-term security of our energy supplies and the achievement of our environmental commitments depends on an early decision to commission a new generation of nuclear power stations?
</p>





<p><a name="st_11"><a name="51103-01_spnew10"><b> Alan Johnson: </b> 
 Where I agree with the hon. Gentleman is on the point that a decision needs to be made soon on whether we go for new build or not. That must be seen in the context of the entire energy mix: energy renewal, security of supply and energy abatement. Those issues need to be considered together. That is why, rather than   dithering, the Prime Minister has announced a comprehensive review, the details of which will be announced soon.
</p>





<p><a name="st_12"><a name="51103-01_spnew11"><b> Mr. Anthony Wright  (Great Yarmouth)</b> 
 (Lab): Whenever there is a threat of a shortage of anything, the   price of that product invariably increases. In the unlikely event of a shortage in gas supply over the coming winter, will my right hon. Friend guarantee that we will not cease in our efforts to reduce fuel poverty? Over the past eight years, the fuel poverty strategy has taken 4 million people out of fuel poverty, and I fear that, if the price increases over the winter months because of shortage, more people will fall into it.
</p>





<p><a name="st_13"><a name="51103-01_spnew12"><b> Alan Johnson: </b> 
 My hon. Friend is right to raise the issue: we have taken 4 million people out of fuel poverty, including 1 million of the most vulnerable. Now that gas   prices have increased, because they are linked to oil prices, which have increased, we must redouble our efforts. We have recently announced a free helpline to provide people with advice on insulation and so on. We 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>3 Nov 2005 : Column 952</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>need to take other measures. The &#163;200 winter fuel allowance this year&#151;&#163;300 for the over-80s&#151;will be a welcome contribution to tackling those problems.
</p>





<p><a name="st_14"><a name="51103-01_spnew13"><b> Norman Lamb  (North Norfolk)</b> 
 (LD): The Secretary of State will be aware that National Grid estimates that large energy users would have to give up some 3.7 billion cu m of gas in the event of a repeat of the 1963 big freeze, unlikely though it might be, to keep gas flowing to the domestic sector. Is it not crazy that the Government are   now contemplating an opt-out from the emissions trading scheme? Would it not have been better to have followed the advice of the International Energy Agency and many other experts in pursuing a much more vigorous assault on energy waste?
</p>





<p><a name="st_15"><a name="51103-01_spnew14"><b> Alan Johnson: </b> 
 First, no one is predicting a 1963 winter&#151;<i>[Interruption.]</i> I repeat that nobody, in the Met Office, is predicting that. Secondly, major users, to whom we talk all the time, and who have a serious problem&#151;this is not to diminish that&#151;in the event that we have severe weather conditions, have interruptible contracts. They sign those interruptible contracts on the basis that they would get a lower price, and they could, as they recognise, through energy efficiency, sell some of their supplies back on to the market and make a profit in a tight energy situation. I therefore believe that we have the right framework in place even if we have the most extreme winter conditions.
</p>





<p><a name="st_16"><a name="51103-01_spnew15"><b> Paddy Tipping  (Sherwood)</b> 
 (Lab): Does the Secretary of State accept that there is an element of scaremongering occurring? There is no question of domestic customers being cut off this year. Things might be tight for industrial consumers, but in the longer term, will not new pipelines resolve the issue of gas supply?
</p>





<p><a name="st_17"><a name="51103-01_spnew16"><b> Alan Johnson: </b> 
 My hon. Friend is right. We have doubled the capacity of the Belgian interconnector and introduced the new liquefied natural gas facility that has opened at the Isle of Grain in the Thames estuary. Other measures are being taken this year and more will be taken next year. On the scaremongering issue, one newspaper that puts lurid headlines above journalistic accuracy said that there would be a blackout. It quoted a guy called Jonathan Smith, the media relations manager of E. ON UK. He wrote to the newspaper. It did not publish the letter, but he copied it to me. It states:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_0">&quot;Throughout my conversations with your journalists I stressed that we at E.ON UK did not believe there would be any power and gas problems this winter . . . At no point during the course of the article&quot;</p>

</p>

<p>
<a name="51103-01_para4">
<a name="stpa_4">Let me deal with the hon. Gentleman&#039;s very serious point. At present, we have the extra capacity that I just mentioned. I could also have mentioned the new gas storage facility at Humbly Grove in Hampshire. In the unlikely event of severe winter conditions, we can switch from gas and electricity generation to coal generation. We have mothballed plant that we have made ready for   use, at Didcot for coal, at Grain for oil and at Killingholme, where there is a combined cycle gas turbine. Moreover, as I said earlier, big users can reduce their energy demand and sell back to the grid. We do not expect any fuel supply problems this winter.
</p>





<p><a name="st_20"><a name="51103-01_spnew19"><b> Mr. Willetts: </b> 
 I note that the Secretary of State did not repeat the guarantee that the Leader of the House gave during Prime Minister&#039;s Question Time last week. Many energy consumers will have noticed that.

<a name="stpa_5">I am pleased that we are making some progress this morning.

What we need now is for him to publish an authoritative account of the steps that he will take if there is a threat to our energy supplies during a harsh winter, so that industry and business know where they stand. That is the least he can do.

<p><a name="st_21"><a name="51103-01_spnew20"><b> Alan Johnson: </b> 
 The National Grid published its preliminary outlook in May. It published its final outlook last month. We share the wish for a debate on the Floor of the House that has been expressed by the hon.

That is not the case, and we therefore have an obligation not to scaremonger. The hon. Gentleman has no such obligation, and nor have any of his Front-Bench colleagues, but others have.

 As the Prime Minister has announced, we will publish proposals on energy policy next year, embracing our continuing commitment to tackling climate change, preserving reliable supplies of energy and maintaining competitive markets.

<p><a name="st_25"><a name="51103-02_spnew2"><b> Mr. Borrow: </b> 
 A few weeks ago, I met civil engineers in the north-west, who recently produced an infrastructure report on the region.

 My hon. Friend is right. In line with the commitment that we gave in the 2003 White Paper, if the   result of the new review announced by the Prime Minister is that we should go down the nuclear new build route&#151;that is a very big if, because factors such as waste and cost have to be taken into account&#151;we will need to publish another White Paper and to have the widest possible consultation. A very healthy public debate is going on, but it is very different from that which took place even as recently as 2003 in terms of climate change and the need for security of supply.

 My hon. Friend is right about the size of the manufacturing sector, and about the contribution that it makes to the economy. He is also right to point to the impact made by China, India and some other countries, as they now aspire to be at the cutting edge of manufacturing rather then just to produce low-value goods. However, their development provides us with large emerging markets that we should regard as an opportunity rather than a threat. Through the manufacturing strategy, we are working with manufacturing industry to face up to those challenges.

Is the Minister aware that DTI officials confirmed to the Trade and Industry Committee the other week that the platform for mass-produced Rover cars has been shipped to China lock, stock and barrel? That is a great disappointment to my constituents, but the officials also confirmed that so far they had held no negotiations with Nanjing Automotive Corporation in respect of the company&#039;s long-standing promise that it would reinstate mass production at Longbridge.

 I am certainly not going to go into the details of what are commercial matters for the company. The Government engaged very rapidly once the impact of the Rover decisions was known and my hon. Friend the Minister for Trade remains closely in touch with the   company. We are also working carefully with the   whole supply chain. Despite the Rover issue, the automotive industry is a success story in this country. The   contribution made by automotive producers to the economy is considerable, and continues to be strong.

Higher taxes, more regulations and cosy deals with the trade unions are making this country less competitive, and driving investment away to eastern Europe and Asia. Does he recognise that the tragedy is that business is telling the Government what is wrong, and it is only the Government who do not recognise the extent of the challenges?

He has the cheek to try to give us lessons, but I have to say to him that since I came to this job I have been impressed by the way in   which manufacturing industry works with the Government, because those people know the value of the manufacturing strategy that we established in 2002 to help manufacturing industry. They know where their friends are.

What efforts is he making to ask the private sector to invest more   in   R and D so that we can have a successful manufacturing sector?

<p><a name="st_47"><a name="51103-02_spnew23"><b> Alun Michael: </b> 
 My hon. Friend is right. What is strong is the partnership with manufacturing industry involving initiatives such as the materials centre that we opened recently on the Isle of Wight, and also the fact that our manufacturing strategy is based on applying science and innovation, world-class practice, raising investment and a high level of skills. That all depends on high standards and good leadership in manufacturing industry, and leaders in that industry are acting as partners with us to tackle those issues, so our industry will be successful.

 There is a technical debate about that. Certainly, nuclear energy shares some scientific characteristics with wind and solar energy.

 It is certainly the case that the nuclear industry, like other parts of the energy industry, such as oil and gas exploration, is demographically challenged&#151;to use the terrible jargon.

I am giving some priority to the skills issue in the energy industry generally and I have discussed it already with the nuclear industry and other parts of the energy sector.

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>3 Nov 2005 : Column 961</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br></p>


<p><a name="st_62"><a name="51103-03_spmin2"><b>The Minister for Energy  (Malcolm Wicks): </b> 
 In July 2005, following a complaint by Energywatch under the Enterprise Act 2002, Ofgem conducted an investigation into the billing practices of gas and electricity suppliers. It made a number of recommendations, designed to take   effect in July 2006. There is no reason why those recommendations, or the measures taken to implement them, should materially change the number of customers using pre-payment meters. Indeed, there are 3.6 million electricity and 2.1 million gas pre-payment meter customers.
</p>





<p><a name="st_63"><a name="51103-03_spnew12"><b> Mr. Leigh: </b> 
 As the Minister has made clear, more than   5 million people pay for their gas or electricity with pre-payment meters, despite being some of the poorest people in the community. In March, the Public Accounts Committee found that on average they were paying a premium to the companies of &#163;60 a year. That is unacceptable. What actions have the Government taken since our report was published to rectify the situation and how much has the premium reduced since that time?
</p>





<p><a name="st_64"><a name="51103-03_spnew13"><b> Malcolm Wicks: </b> 
 This is a matter that concerns me but it is not an easy one. The question is whether those choices should be allowed to the customer; I think they should. There are difficulties with pre-payment meters such as the extra costs, which I acknowledge. I worry about that too, but the alternative might be more disconnections and there are many evils associated with that. The matter is difficult and we need to approach it in a balanced way.

<p><a name="st_65"><a name="51103-03_spnew14"><b> David Taylor  (North-West Leicestershire)</b> 
 (Lab/Co-op): One obvious problem with pre-payment cards, as well as disconnections which the Minister has just mentioned, is that if the card is not charged no fuel   is   supplied. A quarter or more pre-payment users self-disconnect in that way every year and a much higher proportion of them are gas users, which reflects the lower income profile of people forced into that position. Will the Minister tell us what he intends to do to tackle that problem?
</p>





<p><a name="st_66"><a name="51103-03_spnew15"><b> Malcolm Wicks: </b> 
 As I said, this is a difficult issue because if people were in different systems and there were rising numbers of disconnections, the House would properly be concerned, as some of us have been in the past. We need to enable more customers to be given the   information to make proper choices, including the choice of switching back to the type of payment methods that many of us enjoy. In that sense, the launch of the industry home heat helpline on Monday is important, as it means that a customer, or someone concerned about their welfare, can phone up for advice on those issues.

 There is some switching between suppliers for people on pre-payment meters, but I   acknowledge that that occurs at a lower rate than for other customers. Will I look at the matter again? Yes I   will, because it is a serious concern. We want people on low incomes to be able to enjoy the kind of facilities that we all enjoy. It is true that in this case the poor pay more due to the charging structure. I will look at it again.

<a name="51103-03_para0">
<a name="stpa_9">Clearly, pre-payment meters involve capital expenditure. If there was no price differential, other customers, including many low-income people and many pensioners, would have   to subsidise those on pre-payment meters. These are difficult issues. I am not relaxed about the fact that so many low-income families have different payment methods from the mainstream of society. I repeat that there is no easy solution, but I have told the hon. Member for Angus (Mr.   Weir) that I will reconsider the issue.

 (Con): Would the Minister be prepared to consider looking again at the regulation of the energy market to encourage the installation of smarter, more high-tech meters across the board? The advantage is that the consequences of consumers&#039; energy choices would be   much more visible to them. With that visibility, we could encourage and enhance energy efficiency among consumers because they would instantly see the energy consequences of the appliances that they choose to use in the home.
</p>





<p><a name="st_72"><a name="51103-03_spnew21"><b> Malcolm Wicks: </b> 
 The short answer is yes. I am very interested in the concept of smart metering, particularly if it could tell householders how much CO <sub>2</sub> their dwellings are emitting and, with micro-generation in the   dwelling, they could see the savings that they are making. I understand that there has been a roll-out of smart metering in Italy, so the European experience can be considered. We are discussing that option with Ofgem. The investment required would be expensive, but to repeat my short answer, yes, it is worth considering that option.

Proposals are in place for proper consultation on whether someone wants to work flexibly if they have a child under the age of six, a disabled child or caring responsibilities, so that the needs of both the employer and the employee can be considered properly.

 Is the Minister aware that each year Government Departments squander an absolute fortune on all sorts of politically correct equality schemes? Let me cite two random examples: the NHS is spending more than &#163;1 million a year on an equality unit, while in the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, 10 people who could be sorting out the agricultural crisis are manning a diversity unit.

 We have the message clearly that the hon.   Gentleman does not support equality. We know that in the past he has attacked the ethnic business support programme and the minority ethnic women network.

 (Lab): Contrary to the reactionary attitude of the hon. Member for Monmouth (David T.C. Davies), will my hon.

Is she encouraging fathers within her Department to take up their responsibility for caring within their own families, rather than just leaving it to their wives?
</p>





<p><a name="st_89"><a name="51103-04_spnew12"><b> Meg Munn: </b> 
 We have just been talking about the Work and Families Bill. Obviously the civil service, and the Department of Trade and Industry in particular, have an interest in ensuring that a great deal is done to support all parents, whether mothers or fathers, to take leave to look after their children. The civil service is   doing particularly well in certain respects, although we can always do better. For example, of

<p><a name="st_90"><a name="51103-04_spnew13"><b> Mark Pritchard  (The Wrekin)</b> 
 (Con): May I ask the Minister to reflect on what, unfortunately, I think were unhelpful and partisan remarks vis-&#224;-vis equality? I   think that all Members across the House believe in   equality, but many of us have concerns when the Government begin to undermine equal rights by introducing special rights. That causes division.
</p>





<p><a name="st_91"><a name="51103-04_spnew14"><b> Meg Munn: </b> 
 I have already highlighted the division that is apparent on the Conservative Benches rather than on the Government Benches&#151;27 per cent. of Labour Members are women. If action by the Conservative party came anywhere near to achieving that figure, that would be very good.

<p><a name="st_92"><a name="51103-04_spnew15"><b> Vera Baird  (Redcar)</b> 
 (Lab): Of course the purpose of monitoring is to drive change. I am concerned that public authorities are not necessarily moving very quickly. I was appalled to find that my police force in Cleveland was next to the bottom of all forces in the recruitment of women officers. If we are to deal satisfactorily with real causes of concern such as domestic violence and sexual offences, it is imperative that we have high numbers of women police officers. I   shall chase Cleveland police now, make no mistake about it. What steps will my hon. Friend take to ensure that public authorities move into a higher gear on recruiting women?
</p>





<p><a name="st_93"><a name="51103-04_spnew16"><b> Meg Munn: </b> 
 I thank my hon. and learned Friend for that question. We need to do a great deal more in the public sector. To that end, the Equality Bill will introduce a public sector duty to ensure that all public sector authorities perform equally for both genders in terms of employment and the services that they deliver.

Does she agree that it would be useful to encourage women to enter the fast-track civil service scheme? Does she share my disappointment that the percentage of women entering that scheme has dropped by 10 per cent. over the past three years? What measures will she introduce to redress that balance?
</p>





<p><a name="st_95"><a name="51103-04_spnew18"><b> Meg Munn: </b> 
 I agree with much of what the hon. Lady has said about the importance of getting women into the fast-track civil service stream. The public sector gender duty should ensure that greater efforts are made to increase their number.

 (Lab): Does my hon. Friend agree that Government Departments need to make the best use of all available talents and that the services of Government Departments will be much improved if they make use of the diversity of the population? Is my hon. Friend concerned, as I am, that the senior civil service does not represent women adequately? What steps will she take about that?
</p>





<p><a name="st_97"><a name="51103-04_spnew20"><b> Meg Munn: </b> 
 My hon. Friend makes an important point in that public services best serve the population 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>3 Nov 2005 : Column 967</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>when they reflect that population. We are continuing to set challenging targets, which we strive to meet. Our civil servants are also committed to doing that. Along with the public sector duty, those targets should help us to make better progress.

<p><a name="st_98"><a name="51103-04_spnew21"><b> Mrs. Eleanor Laing  (Epping Forest)</b> 
 (Con): May I   assure the House that the Opposition believe in equality of opportunity, even for people from Wales? Does the Minister believe everything that she said about   equality of opportunity in the public sector? Government Departments are the agent of the taxpayer, so will she go further and require companies that are awarded contracts by Departments to take equality of opportunity into consideration?
</p>





<p><a name="st_99"><a name="51103-04_spnew22"><b> Meg Munn: </b> 
 The hon. Lady raises an interesting issue. The Women and Work Commission, which is looking at the gender pay gap, has done some interesting work on procurement and will produce a report in January, which, I hope, will include recommendations to develop those proposals.

 I thank my hon. Friend for her question. As the first woman MP for Worsley she is an excellent role model for her young constituent. The Youth Parliament could certainly teach us a thing or two about the ratio of male to female Members, because it is 49:51.

<br>&nbsp;<br>of the Government&#039;s code of practice working party, which completely dished large parts of that Bill. Will he confirm whether the rumours that the whole Bill might have been ditched are true, and that the Government have realised that they do not want to open up another front in the onslaught on civil liberties that the Bill represented? If not, will we see the Bill this side of Christmas? In any case, will he at last give the House an opportunity to debate the subject of mental health, which has not once been debated in Government time since 1997?

<p><a name="st_59"><a name="51103-09_spnew9"><b> Mr. Hoon: </b> 
 As I have said to the hon. Gentleman previously, mental health is an important issue. I accept that the terrible consequences of such problems, for many more people than perhaps is understood, are not   always recognised. The Mental Health Bill is in the Government&#039;s legislative programme and will be brought forward, but as with all parts of that programme, the appropriate timing is a matter for the business managers.

 May I ask the Leader of the House for a debate on housing in south Yorkshire, in the light of a written reply from the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister to me this week showing that over the past five years, for the giant conurbations of Rotherham, Sheffield, Barnsley and Doncaster, on average just 3,189 new dwellings have been built a year for the 1.5 million people who live there? That is the lowest rate of house build in south Yorkshire since the   stone age. We have the land and the building firms, so can we have a debate to consider how planning committees can move forward and land use rules be changed? While the concrete mixers are ready for the south of England, we would like to see in the north of England a much more supply-side orientated policy from the Government to encourage new homes and new houses.
</p>





<p><a name="st_61"><a name="51103-09_spnew11"><b> Mr. Hoon: </b> 
 My right hon. Friend is absolutely right to raise that issue. My constituency is not that far away from the area that he describes and there has been a great deal of new building there, which has improved the housing stock. It is not only a question of new houses for currently homeless people; what most people want is to   be able to move out of some of the older properties into new and better quality houses. I therefore support his call to improve planning processes to allow that to happen.

 When we have the debate on returning asylum seekers, can we have a good and proper look at the use of dawn raids by the immigration service? There is almost universal revulsion and embarrassment in Scotland about the use of that practice, especially with our backdrop of a falling population. Does the Leader of the House agree that because of our different immigration requirements, and because of our clearly different political values on the matter, it is time to devolve immigration to the Scottish Parliament?

It is important, as the Government have repeatedly made clear, that we balance an appropriately sympathetic and understanding position in relation to those who are genuinely seeking asylum, as against those who are simply coming here as economic migrants.

 Last year, as a one-off, the Government pumped &#163;1 billion into local government finance because, understandably, they did not want council tax bills to go through the roof before the general election.

Will the Leader of the House undertake to provide a debate on this year&#039;s settlement in Government time before the House rises for the Christmas recess, so that we can all come and tell him that he is wrong about the council tax increases that will be necessary in the coming year because of the Government&#039;s failure to give financial support to local government?

 On a point of order, Mr. Speaker. Yesterday we witnessed a fantastic demonstration of democracy in Parliament when we were lobbied by the Trade Justice Movement in a wonderfully organised way. Sadly, however, a postcode lottery determined who was completely soaked in the rain outside, because people travelled here from different parts of the country. My constituents, who had travelled no further than 50 miles or so, spent four hours outside and were soaked to the skin. Meanwhile, Westminster Hall was nowhere near full. I   wonder whether you, Mr. Speaker, could look into   how we organise delegations to Parliament in the 21st century, so that we can treat our constituents in a much better fashion.
</p>





<p><a name="st_69"><a name="51103-10_spnew3"><b> Mr. Speaker: </b> 
 I will look into the point that the hon.   Gentleman has raised, but my understanding is that as   many members of the public were admitted to the precincts as could safely be accommodated&#151;and the organisers of the lobby were well aware in advance that they were bringing more people to Westminster than could be admitted to the building. The organisers of such lobbies have to take some responsibility for the consequences of their arrangements.

 On a point of order, Mr. Speaker. As you will know, the expenses of all Members have been published in the past few weeks, causing great excitement to all and sundry. You will also know that the costs of the office of the Leader of the Opposition, which are paid in Short money, are in the public domain. I am told by the House of Commons Library, however, that no equivalent information about the Prime Minister&#039;s office is available. I understand that questions have been tabled about the issue, but to no avail. Can you advise me, Mr.   Speaker, on how I might be able to establish the costs of the Prime Minister&#039;s private office, in an entirely proper way, so that we can compare them with our own costs and with those of the Leader of the Opposition?

 Further to the point of order raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Hemel Hempstead (Mike Penning), Mr. Speaker.

I had to attend a meeting of the Environmental Audit Committee, which, as you know, is doing fine work on climate change renewables and nuclear power. I was told that a green slip could not be taken to Portcullis House, and that I could be given one only if I was in the main building. Is not Portcullis House still part of the parliamentary estate?

 As the Minister will know, an amendment to clause 21 was tabled but not selected. It dealt with the question of what constitutes unlawful glorification, which seems to depend on what glorification turns out to mean in the rest of the Bill. We believe that there are good grounds for proscribing an organisation that glorifies terrorist acts, because that is different from criminalising such an organisation, but I should like to understand better the nature of unlawful glorification and its relation to the   meaning of glorification in clause 1. I hope that the Minister will be able to enlighten us.
</p>





<p><a name="st_79"><a name="51103-10_spmin0"><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department  (Paul Goggins): </b> 
 The hon. Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Grieve) referred to an amendment that had not been selected, but we have an opportunity to discuss the clause. I think he agrees with the Government that proscription is an important weapon in the fight against terrorism. He mentioned the word &quot;glorification&quot;: there was some discussion about that yesterday, and the Committee settled its opinion.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51103-10_para3">
<a name="stpa_45">Proscription is an important weapon in the fight against terrorism, but more would be required than for an individual member of an organisation to make glorifying statements. The organisation itself would have to be aligned with those opinions. It should also be   stressed that glorification of terrorism applies only when an audience can reasonably be expected to infer that what is being glorified is conduct that should be   emulated in existing circumstances. Glorification of terrorism in itself is not sufficient ground for proscription.
</p>





<p><a name="st_80"><a name="51103-10_spnew9"><b> Mr. William Cash  (Stone) (Con):</b> 
 When deciding whether particular organisations should be proscribed, might we not encounter a difficulty? A mosque, for instance, consists of a body of people&#151;the jurists on the one hand and the imam on the other&#151;who may say certain things. I do not pretend to know the answer to the problem, but, as I tried to explain yesterday, we could find ourselves on extremely dangerous territory because of aspects of the universalism of the religion in   question, and the interaction between religion and   politics&#151;which, in the context of the Koran, are inseparable.

<p><a name="st_81"><a name="51103-10_spnew10"><b> Paul Goggins: </b> 
 Even communities such as the Muslim community have organisations and structures, although overall the Muslim religion is not as highly structured as   some other religions. Each mosque has its own management committee; nothing is left to one individual. The clause relates to organisations, and it would be for Ministers to consider and make recommendations in respect of any specific organisation once all the evidence had been carefully considered.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51103-10_para4">
<a name="stpa_46">In conclusion, I again pray in aid Lord Carlile, who has been quoted many times during our deliberations. He made the following recommendation:

 I support very strongly what the Government are trying to do in   general through this Bill, but we are right to ask for   a certain amount of caution at various points, and this is   probably one of them. During our proceedings, the so-called Mandela test has been raised in a number of   ways. Of course, the fact is that these provisions apply not only to this country but internationally&#151;to   organisations and activities elsewhere. There is a fundamental difference between societies that have democratic, liberal political systems and those that do not, and between the appropriate political responses. We should never forget that terrorism is always an act of mass murder, but the context in which it operates is profoundly different when there are no opportunities for   normal means of political opposition. So giving some kind of credence&#151;or, indeed, support&#151;to organisations operating in such a context is clearly different from giving it to the organisations that we are primarily dealing with today.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51103-10_para6">
<a name="stpa_48">I suspect that in the past all of us have flirted with supporting organisations that would come a cropper under this Bill. Many of my generation had a picture of Che Guevara on their walls, and not many of us regarded Nelson Mandela as anything other than a great icon. That suggests that we should proceed with great care in making sure that we get this Bill right. Of course, in a sense these provisions apply to past activities, not just current ones. In Westminster Hall, there is a splendid exhibition about Guy Fawkes, and we can buy commemorative mugs showing pictures of the Guy Fawkes conspirators. In fact, I just met someone dressed as Guy Fawkes walking into Portcullis House, and I am sure that there are Guy Fawkes commemoration societies and various other such bodies.

<p>
<a name="51103-10_para7">
<a name="stpa_49">We do not want to be silly about this, but the fact is that we tend to regard things that happened a long time ago rather differently from those happening currently. However, these provisions are designed deliberately to capture past associations, too, and all that I am doing is asking the Government please to proceed with some care and caution.

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>3 Nov 2005 : Column 987</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>exactly how this provision will be applied. I agree with what has just been said, in that the wording is very broad and could cause difficulties. The Minister gave no specific examples of what he thought might be unlawful conduct leading to an organisation&#039;s being proscribed. I   shall give a more recent&#151;and still sometimes sensitive&#151;example than the perfectly reasonable ones given a moment ago.
</p>

<a name="51103-11_para0">
<a name="stpa_50">As we all know, in Ireland there are plenty of gatherings at which people will start singing republican songs that glorify very violent conduct, and I believe that there are some loyalist equivalents, as well. The situation in Ireland is very much improved, but there are still extremists there. The current end to violence, which we all hope will last, can prove somewhat fragile when tensions arise in Ulster, and I wonder whether the past glorification of terrorism as contained in the lyrics of many Irish republican songs could be regarded as unlawful conduct.

<p><a name="st_86"><a name="51103-11_spnew3"><b> Mr. Clarke: </b> 
 The Bill seems not to require that, to be caught by this provision, the person or organisation singing the republican songs must be intending to provoke further violent conduct; it is simply a question of whether it might reasonably be expected that someone will take from such songs a general encouragement to emulate such conduct in current circumstances. I can think of situations where that might be so&#151;if, for example, an event were taking place in the Province at a very sensitive time. I give this example so that the Minister can offer some insight into how such a situation might be affected by this clause.

<a name="51103-11_para2">
<a name="stpa_52">is vague and is such an innovation that it will be susceptible to very wide interpretation at various future points. I am not sure why it has been included. I am entirely content that organisations be proscribed that in other ways are plainly trying to encourage violent activities. Given yesterday&#039;s very narrow majority, may we have an assurance that the Government will consider before Report whether this vague term&#151;the &quot;glorification&quot; of such conduct, be it in the past, present or future&#151;might not more sensibly be removed from the Bill altogether?
</p>





<p><a name="st_87"><a name="51103-11_spnew4"><b> Mr. Peter Robinson: </b> 
 In attempting to intervene earlier, I wanted to make a point similar to that made by   the right hon. and learned Member for Rushcliffe (Mr. Clarke). I can foresee circumstances in which the police might have to scoop up half the population of Northern Ireland. Some, for example, glorify the 1916 rebellion, and parades are regularly held to glorify those who were arrested in the post office and later executed. A large section of the community glorifies the actions of 1912 and the defiance of the Ulster volunteers; indeed, even today there are bands named after the Ulster volunteers. All such forms of glorification would   clearly be caught by the net of this Bill. The only   criterion that the Government have offered is the   Director of Public Prosecutions&#039; sensible use of the 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>3 Nov 2005 : Column 988</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>legislation. If I may mix my fishing metaphors, the only way for such people not to be caught by this legislative net is for the DPP to let them off the hook. That is hardly satisfactory. How do the Government view those major commemorative occasions in Northern Ireland and the actions that are likely to flow from them?

<p><a name="st_88"><a name="51103-11_spnew5"><b> Mr. Cash </b> 
: I very much endorse the views expressed by   my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for   Rushcliffe (Mr. Clarke) and the hon. Member for Belfast, East (Mr. Robinson). The glorification provision, to which I have tabled a number of amendments, takes us into extremely dangerous territory. It will lead to extremely unproductive discussion and invite the problems that I mentioned earlier in an intervention on the Minister.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51103-11_para3">
<a name="stpa_53">I think that I heard the Home Secretary suggest this morning on the &quot;Today&quot; programme&#151;he will correct me if I am wrong&#151;that the glorification provision was an important but not essential part of the Bill. Given the   circumstances and the narrow majority for this provision of just one vote, to which my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Rushcliffe referred, I   hope that I can infer from the Home Secretary&#039;s comments that the Government are not going to insist on it. If it proceeds to the House of Lords, it will get into increasingly deep trouble. I sat through the whole of yesterday&#039;s debate and I cannot remember a single Member&#151;apart from Government Front Benchers&#151;saying a single word in favour of including the glorification provision in the Bill.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51103-11_para4">
<a name="stpa_54">My right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Rushcliffe was right to say that we must deal with other aspects of incitement to terrorism and the proscription of terrorist organisations. However, it is simply absurd to introduce the notion of glorification to deal with the mischief that terrorism presents.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51103-11_para5">
<a name="stpa_55">With respect to the hon. Member for Cannock Chase (Dr. Wright), I must point out that not only past associations are important in this respect. Present associations must also be taken into account. Yesterday, I spoke about the Catholic martyrs of the 16th century, to whom Catholic services still constantly refer. Beatification is still an issue, as is the fate of people such as St. Edmund Campion and others. For instance, in the persecutions of the late 16th century, 30 people who attended my old school were martyred. They were hung, drawn and quartered, and services are held at regular intervals to glorify them.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51103-11_para6">
<a name="stpa_56">Martyrdom, whether religious or political, is not confined to the past. It happens in the present, and will continue to happen in the future. People will continue to act in ways contrary to the circumstances of the present, and the law must deal with that. Inserting into the Bill a   notion of glorification, unlawful or otherwise, is extremely dangerous, as it will encourage much uncertainty and unnecessary hostility.

Another example is Italy&#039;s revolt against the Austrians. Garibaldi sought the emancipation, in one sense, of the south of Italy, and was treated as a national hero when he arrived here: all of London turned out to celebrate the courageous acts of one of the great 19th century figures.

That is because it could be reasonably expected that some people living in Ireland&#039;s 32 counties might start emulating the activities with which Michael Collins was associated in the period   between 1919 and 1921. Those activities included blowing up British forces and, on occasion and by accident, civilians.

<p><a name="st_92"><a name="51103-12_spnew0"><b> Mr. Grieve: </b> 
 I am very grateful to all those who have participated in this short debate, which has highlighted some of my anxieties about the clause. My party accepts that a problem exists in connection with organisations in this country that regularly glorify acts of terrorism currently taking place around the world, and that that problem must be addressed. As so often, however, there is a difficulty with how the clause is worded.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51103-12_para0">
<a name="stpa_64">In its present form, clause 21 is a catch-all provision. It could be used to proscribe any organisation that glorifies any past act of terrorism. When I was at university, many left-wing organisations gloried in all sorts of activities that took place in the past. An example of that might be the peasants revolt, whose acts of terrorism were especially&#151;and regrettably&#151;targeted against lawyers.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51103-12_para1">
<a name="stpa_65">If a group is founded that calls itself the John Bull society, for instance, or the Wat Tyler club, its aim might   be to promote radical political change. Such organisations might well draw inspiration from figures from the past who committed acts of violence, but the result is that they would be liable to be caught by clause 21. The Minister will no doubt fall back on the old mantra and say, &quot;It&#039;s all right, the DPP will know how to distinguish between various groups,&quot; but that will not be good enough.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51103-12_para2">
<a name="stpa_66">If the Government want to go down this road, they must produce a coherent argument that makes it clear what they are aiming at. They must narrow the definition sufficiently to allow the Committee as a whole to agree about the groups that would be caught. Otherwise, the Bill will create an absurdity, with endless challenges when attempts are made to proscribe organisations.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51103-12_para3">
<a name="stpa_67">Without that narrower definition, there will be allegations of unfairness. Other organisations will be   brought into the argument, and it will be contended that all sorts of bodies celebrate past violence. The Government should focus attention on the clause&#039;s use of the expression
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_3">&quot;whether in the past, in the future or generally&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="51103-12_para4">
<a name="stpa_68">I accept that the matter is not an easy one but, if it turns out to be impossible to produce coherent grounds for proscription, that would be a good reason for saying that we should not have the clause at all.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51103-12_para5">
<a name="stpa_69">I do not intend to force a vote at the end of this debate, as I support the Government&#039;s underlying intention with the clause. I believe that Ministers will consider the other, linked issues relating to glorification between now and next Wednesday, when the Bill returns on Report. I   hope that they will reassure the House then that there is a form of words that meets the Government&#039;s intended target. Otherwise, the Government should not be aiming at a target at all, regrettable though it might be that that would allow some organisations to glorify terrorism. I hope that the Minister will be able to provide us with some reassurance that the Government will go away and consider that.

 We have had a useful discussion, but one aspect that needs to be emphasised is an echo of yesterday&#039;s discussion on clause 1. It is the fact that it is possible for   an individual, as well as an organisation, to fall foul   of the provision merely because of a perception 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>3 Nov 2005 : Column 991</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>on   somebody else&#039;s part. We should criminalise the intent   of the individual or organisation, not the way in which somebody else might see their actions. Many organisations that try to highlight issues in connection with places such as Palestine or Kashmir will have to tread an exceptionally fine line, and it should not be the business of the House to proscribe their activities simply because somebody else may feel that they have crossed that line.
</p>





<p><a name="st_94"><a name="51103-12_spnew2"><b> Paul Goggins: </b> 
 As I predicted earlier, some of the discussion on this clause has reflected our earlier considerations in Committee. I can tell the right hon.   and learned Member for Rushcliffe (Mr. Clarke), his hon. Friends and, indeed, all hon.

 Will the right hon. and learned Gentleman give me a second, because I was about to come to the point that he raised? He asked me for specific examples, and of course, some of our discussions have related not to the specific issue that we are discussing here, which is proscription, but to the conduct of individual people. With individual people, it would be for the courts to determine whether glorification had actually taken place in a specific case. Now, however, we are discussing glorification by an organisation to an extent that requires it to be proscribed.
</p>





<p><a name="st_97"><a name="51103-12_spnew5"><b> Mr. Clarke: </b> 
 The clause extends the existing definition in the Terrorism Act 2000. My recollection is that no one in the House objected to the powers taken in 2000 to proscribe organisations promoting terrorism. However, clause 21 implies that the Government have had a difficulty&#151;that they have wanted to proscribe an organisation but because what it was doing was glorifying past terrorism, they were unable to do so. The Minister may be able to cite some particular organisation, or at lest to describe anonymously some problem that has arisen involving an organisation that ought to have been proscribed, but as its activities were based on glorification of martyrs, past causes, freedom fighters or whatever, in some other part of the world, it could not be proscribed. I am not aware of the Government having been prevented from using their powers in such circumstances. Can the Minister let us   know what provoked this measure, and why it is necessary to extend the definition? What are the organisations that now get through a loophole that will be closed by the strange introduction of the concept of &quot;glorifying&quot; as a particularly worrying action?

 I cannot give the right hon. and learned Gentleman a specific example, but I can tell him that as   we take the Bill forward, it is important that we have the necessary powers in place where it is necessary to   proscribe organisations that glorify acts of terror&#151;acts that, as my hon. Friend the Member for Wolverhampton, South-West (Rob Marris) reminded the Committee earlier, are acts of mass murder.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51103-12_para7">
<a name="stpa_71">Because of his knowledge of the previous legislation, the right hon. and learned Gentleman will know that when the Home Secretary takes the view that a particular organisation should be proscribed, he does so not on a whim, but with great care and judgment. He then has to come to both Houses of Parliament for approval under the affirmative resolution procedure. Indeed, under the existing legislation and the existing rules, we did exactly that a couple of weeks ago. Not only is care taken with the initial decision, but that decision then has to be agreed and affirmed by both Houses.

 If we were to go through the clauses in which the term &quot;glorification&quot; crops up&#151;including the definitions at the end of the Bill, the convention offences and the other stuff with which the Minister will be familiar&#151;and we stick to the wording, but exclude all the subsections and paragraphs that include a reference to &quot;glorification&quot;, we would still deal with the mischief that the Minister and the rest of the Government seek to overcome. That is a sensible proposition&#151;and we would also link the provisions to the proscribed organisations, while knocking out the increasingly threadbare argument that the notion of glorification adds anything useful to the process. In fact, that notion is dangerous and unproductive. Furthermore, some have said&#151;I do not want to make this into a certain accusation&#151;that it was the Prime Minister who used the word &quot;glorification&quot; at some stage. Some people have suggested that this is a sort of face-saving operation. However, the real question is whether we are going to deal with the mischief that glorification would include.

 The hon. Member for Orkney and Shetland (Mr. Carmichael) raises an important point. It is not an easy matter; the criticism that can be made of the approach he advocates is that if a list has to be produced of what the acts happen to be, it could become unnecessarily prescriptive. One cannot always predict the act or conduct that first highlights the intention to give effect to committing an act of terrorism.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51103-14_para6">
<a name="stpa_87">It is worth bearing in mind the possible scope of the legislation, however. In that sense, it is similar to the old treason statutes&#151;compassing and imagining the death of the king. One would not have to do very much to be liable to imprisonment for life. If someone decided that they wanted to become a terrorist and the first thing they did was to buy a new suit to wear on the day that they   blew themselves up, they would be liable, without doing anything else, to imprisonment for life, if it could be proved that the buying of the suit was linked to the intention to become a suicide bomber.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51103-14_para7">
<a name="stpa_88">That example seems rather a good one because on the face of it, such a situation would be caught by the clause. I do not know how much reassurance the Minister can provide about how the clause would work in practice. That is what we need to examine. As the Minister knows, we have not expressed opposition to the clause in theory but as so often happens the theory, the detail and the practice&#151;how the measure operates&#151;are different things.

 I am most grateful to my hon. Friend. Often confidences are imparted to one&#039;s tailor or to the person in the shop.

 The first thing one should do when considering legislation is to conclude how it may work in practice, and in practice that example would not be fanciful for the person concerned. When the Minister responds, I should be grateful if he would enlighten us about how he sees the clause operating in practice. Perhaps he could give us some examples of the categories of conduct that the Government are trying to catch. Clearly, that is important and it might provide some justification for the amendment proposed by the hon.

<p><a name="st_144"><a name="51103-14_spnew9"><b> Mr. Peter Robinson: </b> 
 I caution against the amendment. The wording of the clause is such that the   inclusion of the word &quot;relevant&quot; is not necessary. Its only purpose is as something on which to hang the subsequent amendment, which defines aspects of relevant conduct. However, that list could be so extensive that the Government could not possibly envisage what its future terms might be&#151;whether catching a bus, buying a battery or a cell phone; the list could go on for ever.

<a name="stpa_89">The fact that the provision would be implemented through secondary legislation does not satisfy me. That would mean that the Government were always chasing the terrorists.

<br>&nbsp;<br>cell. It may not be possible to know the precise atrocity that was being planned&#151;indeed, the terrorists themselves might not have made up their minds about a specific target; nevertheless, the offence requires clear evidence of intent to commit a terrorist act, which is of course a serious criminal matter, as the hon. Gentleman said.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51103-14_para12">
<a name="stpa_93">The hon. Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Grieve) rightly emphasised that the key feature of the &quot;acts preparatory&quot; offence is that it can be used when terrorists&#039; exact plans are unknown. He asks how this will work in practice. I am sure that he well understands that preparatory acts can be proven to have taken place only when the connection is made between the specific action and the terrorist act itself. Purchasing a car on its own is not an act preparatory to terrorism, but once it has been connected to the act of terror, it becomes a preparatory act. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman appreciates that.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51103-14_para13">
<a name="stpa_94">Obviously, the offence must be drawn widely to include all the possible acts that could be preparatory acts. Attempting to create and maintain a list of all those acts that could possibly be considered as being preparatory to a terrorist attack would be, frankly, impossible, as the hon. Gentleman made it plain before. If we had a list that included buying a suit, we would have a very long list indeed. Of course that would not be a practical or feasible challenge.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51103-14_para14">
<a name="stpa_95">The second and perhaps more important point is that it is likely that any list would be reactive. In other words, we would learn about preparatory acts based on the last terrorist atrocity, rather than being able to anticipate what might come in the future. It would be possible for   mischievous terrorists to work their way around that provision if we were to include it in secondary legislation, as the amendment suggests.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51103-14_para15">
<a name="stpa_96">We need an open situation where any preparatory act that can be linked to terrorism is captured by the offence. The risk of terrorists devising new methods of preparing for terrorist acts is too great to allow such an approach. We cannot give the opportunity to terrorists to evade prosecution in that way. Again, Lord Carlile has described clause 5 as
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_10">&quot;a proportional and proper response to achieve the criminalisation of the conduct described.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>

<a name="stpa_97">I conclude by once again thanking hon. Members on both sides of the Committee for their warm and general support for this new provision on preparatory acts. We hope that it will help us to bear down more successfully in future on those who would carry out acts of terror against innocent people.

 May I tell my hon. Friend the Minister that the wording of clause 5 underscores yet again the difficulties that we have as legislators have in defining terrorism? Given the way the clause is worded, as I   understand it, if I give 25p to collection for the Karen National Liberation Army in Burma, I can be sentenced to life imprisonment. As someone who wishes to fight oppression and has been political all his life, and recognising that the state of Burma is in no way democratic, that it should be resisted and that that resistance should occasionally take a quasi-military form against the military, I find that outrageous. Given the difficulty with the lack of clarity about what is terrorism, if I give 25p to the KNLA or a similar organisation, I can go to prison for life.
</p>





<p><a name="st_150"><a name="51103-15_spnew2"><b> Paul Goggins: </b> 
 In response to my hon. Friend the   Member for Wolverhampton, South-West (Rob   Marris), who wants to take us into slightly wider territory, I can only repeat that clause 5 deals with preparatory acts, that it has been warmly welcomed by both sides of the Committee and that Lord Carlile sees it as being proportionate. My hon. Friend admits in his contribution that he wants to take the debate wider than that. He has concerns about the definition of terrorism. No doubt, we will return to those issues in future, and I   am sure that he will have the opportunity to make his concerns clear to the Committee again.

<p><a name="st_151"><a name="51103-15_spnew3"><b> John Bercow: </b> 
 I feel certain that the Minister did not intend simply and in a cavalier fashion to brush aside the extremely important point made by the hon. Member for Wolverhampton, South-West (Rob Marris), but I   put it to the Minister that this is not a wider issue: it is germane to clause 5. For an organisation to plan and commit an act of terrorism, it requires explosive devices, munitions or a combination of the two and they must be purchased, and in making such a donation, the hon. Gentleman is therefore providing the organisation with the wherewithal to do so. I would be very anxious if we lost his services. I might have made a financial contribution to the Karen National Liberation Army and therefore I also speak with the authentic voice of self-interest in the matter.

<p><a name="st_152"><a name="51103-15_spnew4"><b> Paul Goggins: </b> 
 I meant no disrespect to my hon. Friend&#151;I am sure that he did not take my comments that way&#151;and I certainly mean no disrespect to the hon.   Gentleman. He gives me an opportunity to make it clear to the Committee that the example of the Burma donation ignores the point that, under clause 5, the accused must himself intend to commit or carry out an act of terrorism or assist in doing so. So simply making a financial donation would not be caught by the offence.

 I just want to respond to the question asked by the hon. Member for West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine (Sir Robert Smith). The clause provides for such a penalty because an act preparatory to an act of terrorism, which can wipe out the lives of innocent men, women and children, is serious. It is quite right for such a serious act to carry the highest possible penalty.
</p>





<p><a name="st_172"><a name="51103-16_spnew5"><b> Mr. Grieve: </b> 
 I was about to try to help the Minister. The hon. Member for West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine (Sir Robert Smith) was suggesting that the   penalty was mandatory, but that cannot be correct. The words &quot;shall be liable&quot; in subsection (3) effectively mean that a person shall be at risk, on conviction on indictment, of imprisonment for life, so the sentence could be anything from a probation order to imprisonment for life.

 I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for his intervention. We have had many such discussions in   the past. It is of course not for us to define precisely what the penalty should be. A judge will decide the appropriate penalty after considering all circumstances. However, if a person is preparing for an act of terror that could wipe out people&#039;s lives, life imprisonment is an appropriate penalty that should be available.

<p><a name="st_174"><a name="51103-16_spnew7"><b> Mr. Heath: </b>

I add in parentheses that the offences in clause 6 regarding training for terrorism, which allows people to commit such ghastly crimes, carries a much lower penalty, which is perhaps surprising.

<p>
<a name="51103-16_para3">
<a name="stpa_106">May I start with training for terrorism? Clause 6 says:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_13">&quot;A person commits an offence if  . . . he provides instruction or training in any of the skills mentioned in subsection (3); and  . . . at the time he provides the instruction or training, he knows or suspects that a person receiving it intends to use the skills in which he is being instructed or trained  . . . for or in connection with the commission or preparation of acts of terrorism or Convention offences; or  . . . for assisting the commission or preparation by others of such acts or offences.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="51103-16_para4">
<a name="stpa_107">The Minister will acknowledge that those skills are very wide. They include:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_14">&quot;the making, handling or use of a noxious substance, or of substances of a description of such substances  . . . the use of any method or technique for doing anything else that is capable of being done for the purposes of terrorism  . . . and  . . . the design or adaptation for the purposes of terrorism, or in connection with the commission or preparation of an act of terrorism or Convention offence, of any method or technique for doing anything.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="51103-16_para5">
<a name="stpa_108">The Minister will be aware of examples of the people about whom we are talking that spring to mind from past experience, such as somebody who trains someone else in chemistry, which enables that person to make explosives. Another example is someone who might train someone else to fly a small aircraft, to which could be attached crop-spraying equipment through which noxious biological or chemical substances could be distributed. A further example is someone who teaches someone else to fly, and then the plane might be used as a missile, as happened in the events of 2001 in the United States. The range is vast.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51103-16_para6">
<a name="stpa_109">I do not suppose that the House of Commons would have any trouble criminalising someone who, in the knowledge that an individual was asking for instruction in any of the areas to which I have referred, knew also that that knowledge would be used for the purposes of terrorism. There would be no difficulty in saying that such a person should be treated as a criminal if they had that knowledge. However, the way in which the Government have worded the clause means that it applies not only to someone who knows, but to someone who suspects. The use of the word &quot;suspicion&quot; in this instance can be very wide. Many things can give rise to suspicion, but suspicion in itself need not necessarily be grounded in fact. Someone may suspect someone else, but it may turn out that they are wrong. Suspicion is when we start feeling a little uneasy.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51103-16_para7">
<a name="stpa_110">There are some obvious examples. There is that of a teacher of chemistry at university giving a lecture to students. The teacher is dealing with substances that could potentially be used for explosive purposes. A student in the room asks him a question, which although it might have an innocent explanation also suggests that he might have an interest in explosive properties. Experience of chemistry students at university suggests that many of them have a great deal of interest in the explosive properties of some of the substances that they use, but for frivolous purposes rather than terrorism.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51103-16_para8">
<a name="stpa_111">As I read the way in which the clause is drafted, unless the university lecturer immediately says to the class, &quot;I   am sorry, but this class cannot continue with the presence of the individual who asked that question&quot;, he would have committed a criminal offence. I do not think that that can be the way that the Government intend the provision to work in practice. No doubt we shall be told again about the discretion of the Director of Public 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>3 Nov 2005 : Column 1006</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>Prosecutions in bringing a prosecution, but in reality we must put something into the clause that provides a safeguard for the individual.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51103-16_para9">
<a name="stpa_112">One approach is that of amendment No. 57, which would provide that an offence cannot be committed merely on suspicion&#151;there has to be actual knowledge. However, although that amendment is the lead amendment in the group that is before us, it is not my favoured route. The Minister will be aware that other legislation we have considered, especially money laundering provisions, also had &quot;knows&quot; or &quot;suspects&quot; as the grounds for the commission of many criminal offences&#151;but it did at least have the saving clause that if someone believed that it was not his job to stop something, he should instead report his suspicion to a relevant authority.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51103-16_para10">
<a name="stpa_113">That, too, is far from ideal. The point has been well   made by the academic lobbies that have written, I   suspect, to many right hon. and hon. Members, that to an extent university lecturers and teachers, or anyone else, will be turned into potential spies. That would be an uncomfortable situation for them.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51103-16_para11">
<a name="stpa_114">The anxiety that has been expressed from many academic quarters&#151;I could quote the publication if the   Minister so wished&#151;about the implications of the clause is real. Amendment No. 58 tries to deal with that by providing:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_15">&quot;It shall be a defence to an offence under section 6(1), for the defendant to show that he reported any suspicion to the police or in the case of an employee to his employer or other person in authority over him.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="51103-16_para12">
<a name="stpa_115">That still leaves open the criticism that the Bill will turn university lecturers into spies. It is a valid point when they say:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_16">&quot;We believe the fundamental bond of trust between a lecturer and their students, along with the freedom of academic inquiry, would be potentially restricted if all lecturers in certain academic fields of study were, in effect, caused to spy upon their students. They would have to make a subjective judgment about whether they had any suspicion that any of their students may use their knowledge at some point in the future to commit a terrorist act. We believe this to be too broadly written.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="51103-16_para13">

<p><a name="st_193"><a name="51103-17_spnew0"><b> Chris Bryant: </b> 
 Clearly, the university lecturers are not making a frivolous point. However, at the other end of the spectrum is the chemistry lecturer or teacher who becomes convinced over time that one of the reasons for someone having joined their course is deliberately to gain information that they might then use to perpetrate terrorist offences. Would the hon. Gentleman like to rebalance a little along that spectrum?
</p>





<p><a name="st_194"><a name="51103-17_spnew1"><b> Mr. Grieve: </b> 
 That is right. We know from the past that many of the experts in weapons of mass destruction in Iraq&#151;technical engineers&#151;were all trained at Imperial college. The foundations of the Iraqi nuclear research programme were based on the knowledge of the students who had been on the relevant courses, to such an extent that I understand that now there is an informal system of regulation to try to provide a degree of vetting of those who undertake courses that may be particularly sensitive in terms of technology being imparted to such people.


<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>3 Nov 2005 : Column 1007</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>

<p>
<a name="51103-17_para0">
<a name="stpa_117">These are real issues, which I acknowledge, but we   must live in the real world. A university lecturer who   is delivering a course is placed in a difficult position if he begins to worry about a perfectly ordinary undergraduate. It is the same for someone who is training someone else to fly a small aircraft. Potentially, he might be committing a criminal offence. The worry for him is that if something subsequently emerges about the individual, the chain will be followed up in exactly the same way as it was after the events of September 2001. He will then be questioned and might even be prosecuted and liable to 10 years&#039; imprisonment. The Government must provide a let-out clause to ensure that people are not placed in an impossible position.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51103-17_para1">
<a name="stpa_118">The reality of most contractual relationships is that if a student pays money to acquire a skill, the classes cannot be discontinued half way through because it is thought that he is an unsavoury character. Either there has to be a fail-safe mechanism so that the student can be reported and the teacher told whether or not he should continue with the classes, or there must be some protection under the law. That is what amendment No.   58 is designed to achieve.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51103-17_para2">
<a name="stpa_119">I take amendment No. 58 seriously and regard it as more than a probing amendment. Unless the Minister can provide me with some assurance that the Government will reconsider this issue between now and next Wednesday, or can give me a positive response in this debate, I intend to put the amendment to the vote. There must be a safeguard that enables people to report to their employer or to someone in authority, saying, &quot;I   am troubled by this student but I cannot really say anything more about it.&quot; That person would know that he was protected and would not subsequently be open to prosecution.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51103-17_para3">
<a name="stpa_120">The same thing, but in rather a different context, will apply to attendance at a terrorist training camp. I am sure that we all agree that that should be made a criminal offence. There is ample evidence that individuals have attended places that provide terrorist training&#151;they went there because they wanted to be trained as terrorists. The difficulty arises over what happens if individuals find themselves at a place of terrorist training for good, valid or innocent reasons? There is no mechanism in clause 8 for any exoneration of such a person. The only fall-back position will be the discretion of, presumably, the Attorney-General&#151;I   hope that the terrorist training place is abroad, but I suppose that it could be in the UK&#151;or the DPP not to prosecute. There is a way through that difficulty that improves the clause, and that is what amendment No. 59 is designed to achieved. It states:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_17">&quot;It shall be a defence to an offence under this section for a defendant to show on the balance of probabilities&quot;&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="51103-17_para4">
<a name="stpa_121">so the onus will be on the defendant, which is not something I usually like, but to make the Bill bite I   accept that we should reverse the burden on the balance of probabilities&#151;

: I have some sympathy with the amendment, which is seeking to tease out the purpose of the clause. However, I am cautious about paragraph (b) because it is very broad. Anyone who merely sought instruction could use the defence that they were gathering information about instruction or training. By contrast, a journalist would be seeking to write an expos&#233; of a training camp in another part of the world. Would the hon. Gentleman accept a different wording for his amendment?
</p>





<p><a name="st_196"><a name="51103-17_spnew3"><b> Mr. Grieve: </b> 
 A different wording is, of course, possible, and I am happy to listen to any variants that the Minister may suggest. There is nothing sacred in being a journalist, just as there is nothing sacred in being a Member of Parliament or anything else. Categorising journalists as a separate group is not necessarily helpful. Someone may wish to be present to gather information about instruction or training, and an undercover journalist is an obvious example. However, I do not see   why the provision should be restricted. I fully acknowledge that it may provide a get-out clause because people could claim that they only attended the   camp to gather information. A jury, however, would ask, &quot;For what purpose?&quot; A coherent reason   would have to be provided. A BBC journalist, for example, could say that they had heard about a camp. The police were not interested, so they sent an undercover journalist to find out what was happening. If someone simply says that they went along because they were intrigued they are unlikely to be believed. Alternatively, someone could say that they heard what was going on and were worried about it, so they decided to find out what was happening before tipping off the authorities. That person needs to be covered as well as the journalist.

 Like my hon. Friend the Member for Rhondda (Chris Bryant), I   have great deal of sympathy with the hon. Gentleman&#039;s amendment, but I am concerned about placing the onus on the defendant. A community centre&#151;a mosque or a church, for example&#151;could be accused of being a training centre and, indeed, nefarious activities may have taken place in part of the building. Is the hon. Gentleman suggesting that everyone who attends has to prove their innocence? It is a complicated area.

<p><a name="st_198"><a name="51103-17_spnew5"><b> Mr. Grieve: </b> 
 The hon. Gentleman makes a good point. I suggested that in our legal system traditionally the   burden of proof lies with the prosecution who, on the whole, must prove a case. There are examples in criminal law, however, where once the main facts are established the burden of proof can be reversed, although never beyond the test of reasonable doubt. On the balance of probabilities, the defendant must give a   legitimate reason for doing something. I share the hon. Gentleman&#039;s discomfort because I am not usually in favour of such legislation, but the Government have a difficulty in dealing with a particular problem. Proving beyond reasonable doubt that someone was at a camp for the purpose of gaining instruction can be a very hard test. If the purpose behind the clause is to deter people from going to camps abroad to receive terrorist training, the Government are entitled to wield a heavy club. I am not unsympathetic to their aim, but a let-out clause is

<b>3 Nov 2005 : Column 1010</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>about the potential to fall foul of clause 6 as a result of people&#039;s suspicions. Amendment No. 42 offers a small measure of protection, because any such suspicion must be reasonable&#151;it does not cover suspicions borne of prejudice or mere fancy. The common theme of clauses 6 and 8&#151;we dealt with it at length yesterday&#151;is that it is all too easy to blunder unknowingly into a situation and fall foul of the legislation. I cannot see that that is what the Government intend, but it is unfortunately the consequence of the clauses&#039; drafting. As hon.

The Government might believe that suspicions should be investigated not by journalists but by the appropriate authorities. We all   know that in the real world matters can often be rather more complicated. The British Government of the day might choose, perhaps because of some wider concern, to ignore something that is going on in another   country that constitutes a training place for terrorism. Yesterday, we spoke about Uzbekistan. The Government of Uzbekistan have had the benefit of a great deal of very benign doubt from the British Government, if I may put it like that. Who is to say that, if a training camp were to be established in Uzbekistan, we might not go looking too hard for it? An investigative journalist, however, might want to undertake some sort of expos&#233;, but, under the clause, he or she could feel constrained from legitimately exercising professional freedom.

: I seek some reassurance from the Minister on amendment No. 58. For example, a university lecturer, lecturing in chemistry at the excellent university of Wolverhampton, could inadvertently fall foul of the clause by having suspicions but, not wishing to act on them, by ceasing to teach the pupil concerned for fear of   offending the pupil. I suspect that often in such circumstances a lecturer would initially downplay his or her suspicions because they did not want to cause offence in a social sense, but they would then be committing an offence in the legal sense, and there should be a middle ground, such as is set out in amendment No. 58, although I am not sure that its wording is quite right. Such suspicions could be reported to someone in authority, with the lecturer saying, &quot;I haven&#039;t yet confronted the student, but I want to alert you to the fact that I think that they are taking a rather unprincipled interest in the chemistry of what I am teaching them.&quot;

 The hon. Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Grieve) said that the range of activities is vast, and I am concerned with particular activities in Wales and north Wales, outdoor pursuit training and, pertinently in this case, white-water rafting on the Tryweryn river, in which some of the people involved in the events of 7 July were engaged. The range is vast, so how will the providers of such training decide whether they should suspect someone? There is a question about the degree to which they should suspect that people engaging in otherwise entirely legitimate and innocent activities are engaged in preparation for terrorism. I understand that terrorists often engage in such innocent activities for the purposes of team building and to increase a feeling of camaraderie. They might engage in such activities as part of a larger group. There is a lack of clarity for training providers.

<a name="stpa_129">A further question that I worry about is not directly related to the clause, but if a group of young Asian men, possibly Muslims, turn up in white, Welsh-speaking north Wales to go white-water rafting, is the provider of the activity to suspect them merely because they are a group of young Asian males? All kinds of possibilities are opened up that are entirely undesirable.

: Thank you, Mr. Cook. I support the   amendments moved by the hon. Member for Beaconsfield, because I have some serious concerns about clause 6.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51103-18_para7">
<a name="stpa_130">The Bill gives itself a universal jurisdiction and seeks to cast the net very widely over potential suspects. Many of us who represent inner-city constituencies are familiar with accusations that places such as community centres and mosques are being used for terrorist training&#151;it is easy to make such an accusation, in the same way as it is   easy for people to accuse their neighbours of being drug dealers. We must therefore be   extremely careful in drawing the net so widely that people are automatically guilty by association. I appreciate that any prosecution must occur within the terms of the Attorney-General&#039;s decision, but the matter poses some serious dangers.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51103-18_para8">
<a name="stpa_131">The Bill says that anyone who has visited a terrorist training camp anywhere in world is guilty by association, and I think that amendment No. 59 probably helps with   that problem. I have visited a number of refugee camps in central America that were characterised by their opponents and neighbouring Governments as terrorist training camps. During the war in El Salvador, El   Salvadorian refugee camps in Honduras were routinely accused of being terrorist training camps. I do not believe that they were terrorist training camps, but the accusation was and is made frequently. The Bill could lead to doubtful hearsay evidence of attendance at such places being used to accuse and prosecute somebody. The Minister must think carefully about amendment No. 59, which would improve clause 8.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51103-18_para9">
<a name="stpa_132">My final point applies to the whole Bill. The tenor of the Bill is to try to charge people as widely as possible with advocacy of, preparation for or association with terrorism, which will alienate large numbers of people who already feel quite alienated from normal British society. Many young Muslims who live in inner-urban areas already feel alienated. Are they in danger of being prosecuted for attending classes in which someone speaks or going to a community centre where it is alleged that training activities have taken place? We could end

<b>3 Nov 2005 : Column 1013</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>up not only criminalising the innocent by detaining them for 90 days without charge, but reducing the likelihood of co-operation with the authorities on genuine cases in which someone is seriously planning to commit criminal acts either in this country or anywhere else. We should learn from the experience in Northern Ireland between 1968 and 1971, when alienation grew so rapidly that it led to 20 years of troubles. I fear that we will alienate people who do not want to be alienated and who want to live in a decent, free-speaking, democratic society, because we are in danger of driving them in the other direction.

<a name="stpa_134">The Committee knows that it is a requirement of the Council of Europe convention on the prevention of terrorism, to which the UK is a signatory, to criminalise terrorist training. A number of those offences are already contained within British law in section 54 of the Terrorism Act 2000, which relates to weapons training, among other things. Clause 6 adds to section 54 of the 2000 Act to close the gap on other forms of training for terrorist purposes. That includes training to use noxious or hazardous substances, providing training in certain skills, methods and techniques where one knows or suspects that the person receiving the training is doing so for the purposes of terrorism and receiving any of that training with the intention of using it for terrorist purposes. There is currently no specific offence relating to attendance at a terrorist training camp, and clause 8 is intended to close that gap by criminalising attendance at such a camp. For the sake of completeness I should stress that that does not derive from an obligation under the Council of Europe convention on the prevention of terrorism.

<p><a name="st_224"><a name="51103-19_spnew5"><b> Jeremy Corbyn: </b> 
 The key words are &quot;wholly or partly&quot;. If someone attends a place where terrorist training is going on, but they know nothing about it and are training in, for example, white water rafting, they could be pulled into an incomprehensible net in which they are accused of terrorism.
</p>





<p><a name="st_225"><a name="51103-19_spnew6"><b> Paul Goggins: </b> 
 We will discuss the concept of &quot;attending&quot;, which implies that the person who is doing the &quot;attending&quot; knows what they are doing. I hope that my hon. Friend is reassured that an individual must have a purpose in attending a particular place.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51103-19_para3">
<a name="stpa_136">Amendment No. 57 removes any concept of suspicion, which, as the hon. Member for Beaconsfield has acknowledged, would significantly narrow the scope of the offence. If someone does not know that terrorist training is taking place, they will not be caught by the offence. If we remove the word, &quot;suspects&quot;, however, the   offence would not cover someone who provides training and who has every reason to suspect, but does not know as an absolute fact, that their students are planning to use their skills for terrorist purposes. What is more, that person could continue to provide such training with impunity for as long as their suspicions do not turn into certain knowledge, which is not a satisfactory situation.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51103-19_para4">
<a name="stpa_137">The hon. Member for Beaconsfield and my hon. Friend the Member for Wolverhampton, South-West (Rob Marris) have made the same point about chemistry lecturers and teachers, and I am prepared to think about that specific point a little more. But the hon.   Gentleman&#039;s description of the person of unsavoury character is not specific enough. The suspicion would have to be based on specific grounds. I   shall respond to him further on that point.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51103-19_para5">
<a name="stpa_138">Amendment No. 89 takes a rather different approach. It retains, rightly, the concept of suspicion, but would qualify it with the word &quot;reasonably&quot;. That is not necessary. Whether or not somebody suspects is simply a fact that the prosecution would have to prove in a given case.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51103-19_para6">
<a name="stpa_139">Amendment No. 58 would provide a defence of informing the police&#151;or, in the case of an employee, the employer&#151;of that suspicion. I understand the intention behind it, which is to provide a defence to those who take steps to make others aware, but it is unnecessary. In reality, it is highly unlikely that someone who had been to the police and reported his suspicions would ever be prosecuted. I doubt that the consent of the Director of Public Prosecutions would be forthcoming in such circumstances. However, we would certainly not want a person who had reported their suspicions to the   police to have carte blanche. Their suspicions could be reported in such a way as to play those suspicions down, or they could be so ambiguous that the police would find it difficult to follow them up, and the trainer could then carry on providing the terrorist training with impunity. Even if he was given ever-stronger reasons for knowing that the training would be used for terrorist purposes, he would fall outside the scope of the clause if the amendment were to be made.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51103-19_para7">
<a name="stpa_140">I turn to the amendments to clause 8. On amendment No. 42, it is certainly not the Government&#039;s intention to   catch people who could not reasonably be expected to know that they were at a training camp. Subsection (2) 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>3 Nov 2005 : Column 1015</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>provides that in order for an offence under the clause to be committed, the prosecution has to prove that the person knew or believed that training for terrorist purposes was taking place, or could not reasonably have failed to be aware of that. If the person had no reasonable grounds for believing that he was at a place where terrorist training was taking place, clearly he would not have committed any offence. The first part of the amendment is therefore unnecessary.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51103-19_para8">
<a name="stpa_141">The second part of the amendment would provide a defence of attending a terrorist camp &quot;for legitimate research purposes.&quot; That would create a major loophole, to say nothing of a significant definitional headache for the courts in having to interpret it. The Government do not believe that attendance at a terrorist training camp can ever be considered legitimate. It has been suggested, not least during this debate, that attendance at such a camp, perhaps by journalists or by a non-governmental organisation, may be considered valid. However, we consider that attendance at terrorist training camps by such individuals lends legitimacy to such groups and creates an environment in which terrorism may flourish. That is wholly wrong. The Government do not consider that there can be justifiable reasons for knowingly attending a terrorist training camp at which individuals are trained in acts of terror that would lead to innocent people losing their lives. Terrorism is not a valid form of political expression, in this country or abroad.

</p>

<p>
<a name="51103-20_para0">
<a name="stpa_145">The Government&#039;s argument to my hon.

</p>





<p><a name="st_232"><a name="51103-20_spnew2"><b> Sir Robert Smith: </b> 
 The Minister seems unwilling to address the point that someone might be attending the terrorist camp with the express purpose of exposing it and trying to get it closed down to prevent the threat of   terrorism. Under the current wording, without an amendment to provide some kind of defence, they could be found guilty of a crime when doing a public good.
</p>





<p><a name="st_233"><a name="51103-20_spnew3"><b> Paul Goggins: </b> 
 If somebody has reason to believe that they know where a training camp is, they should report it to the authorities so that they can deal with it. It is not for an individual journalist to go on a maverick expedition to ascertain the truth. If that journalist has grounds for believing that there is a training camp in place and that they are the only person to know that, they should report it to the authorities&#151;it is not for them to undertake their own investigation.

<a name="stpa_147">The Opposition also suggest that there should be a defence for those who try to prevent the training. Again, we are worried that that would create a sizeable loophole. If someone knows that terrorist training is happening, the appropriate course of action is to leave that place and alert the relevant authorities.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51103-20_para3">
<a name="stpa_148">Amendment No. 59 deals also with those who may, against their will, be at a place where terrorist training occurs. Again, I am not sure that that is necessary because clause 8 provides that a person commits an offence if he &quot;attends&quot; a place where training occurs. Attendance implies voluntary participation rather than being kidnapped or held against one&#039;s will. Attendance implies that the person has some intention of being there. The context is important but the change would create a loophole, which terrorists would not be slow to exploit.

 It is important to be pedantic about the matter and to explore all possible scenarios. I do not agree with the Under-Secretary about intention.

 I want to consider the point about the journalists and the mad trips. If journalists had heard a rumour that something might be going on but there was no substantial suspicion, gained entry to the relevant place, found that training was happening and then left, they would not be caught by the clause because they had left and reported the matter. It would therefore be possible for journalists to act, provided that they did not   knowingly enter something that was obviously a terrorist training camp. Is that how the clause would work?

<p><a name="st_239"><a name="51103-20_spnew9"><b> Paul Goggins: </b> 
 My hon. Friend is right. Journalists who found themselves in a terrorist training camp, realised what was happening, left and reported its existence to the authorities, would clearly not be caught by the offence. However, if they remained there, they could be caught. As I have made abundantly clear, if people know that terrorist training is taking place but continue to participate and be present there freely, not against their will, they could and should be caught by the clause.

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>3 Nov 2005 : Column 1027</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br></p>





<p><a name="st_268"><a name="51103-22_spnew6"><b> Paul Goggins: </b> 
 I wrote earlier this week to the right hon. Member for Haltemprice and Howden (David Davis) and the hon. Member for Winchester (Mr. Oaten) to explain the purpose of these amendments. The clause makes it a criminal offence to trespass on a licensed nuclear site. By their very nature, such sites contain hazardous material and hazardous activities are carried out there. Although all sites are guarded, unauthorised entry deflects the guard force from its primary duty of securing the site and could also be used by terrorists as cover for an attack. Unauthorised entry to sites could lead to dangers to individuals, not only from the possibility of injury from the plant and equipment present, but from the risk that they could be seen as a terrorist threat and met with an appropriate response. The Government therefore believe that it is right that in the current climate we do what we can to strengthen the security regimes at those sites.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51103-22_para0">
<a name="stpa_152">As currently drafted, the offence will apply to all areas of a licensed nuclear site, plus to any other premises that   sit within the secure perimeter boundary. That is because sometimes, the fences can sit just outside the area of the licensed site. Since the Bill was introduced, we have looked again at the provisions with a view to ensuring that no more land is covered than is strictly necessary.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51103-22_para1">
<a name="stpa_153">At a small number of licensed nuclear sites, there are significant pieces of land which are part of the licensed site&#151;
</p>





<p><a name="st_269"><a name="51103-22_spnew7"><b> Mr. Grieve: </b> 
 But outside.
</p>





<p><a name="st_270"><a name="51103-22_spnew8"><b> Paul Goggins: </b> 
 The hon. Gentleman reads my mind. There are some parts that sit outside the security perimeter.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51103-22_para2">
<a name="stpa_154">No licensable activities have ever taken place on that land; indeed, sometimes it is used by members of the public, under local arrangements with the site operator. It has never been the Government&#039;s intention to have the criminal offence of trespass apply to activity outside the secure perimeter boundary at nuclear sites, and it is clearly important that the premises to which the new offence applies should be evident and unambiguous.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51103-22_para3">
<a name="stpa_155">The group of four amendments will make it clear that the criminal offence applies only to trespass beyond the secure perimeter that is relied on to protect the nuclear site from intruders.
</p>





<p><a name="st_271"><a name="51103-22_spnew9"><b> Jeremy Corbyn: </b> 
 The amendment suggests that anyone outside the perimeter fence, whether at Fylingdales or somewhere else, would not be guilty of trespass. At what point, as they approach the fence, do they become trespassers? Do they have to touch the fence, climb it,   look at it, hang something from it, cut it&#151;[Hon.   Members: &quot;Sit on it?&quot;] That does not often happen in this place. Will the Minister clarify the amendment?
</p>





<p><a name="st_272"><a name="51103-22_spnew10"><b> Paul Goggins: </b> 
 I hope that I can clarify things to my hon. Friend&#039;s satisfaction. When people are outside the security perimeter any invasion beyond the perimeter fence would be an offence, but if they were on the licensed site, outside the perimeter fence, they would not 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>3 Nov 2005 : Column 1028</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>be caught by the offence. We want it to be clear that the perimeter fence is what counts. Any movement beyond the perimeter fence would be caught by the measure.
</p>





<p><a name="st_273"><a name="51103-22_spnew11"><b> Jeremy Corbyn: </b> 
 May I press the Minister a little on the matter? I have some experience of visiting nuclear sites and I want to know at what point I could become a criminal. If a group of wholly innocent people were encamped outside AWE Aldermaston to protest about the development of a new generation of nuclear weapons and if, to protect themselves from rain and wind, they attached the edge of a tarpaulin to an outside perimeter fence, but had not crossed the fence, would they be committing a criminal act?
</p>





<p><a name="st_274"><a name="51103-22_spnew12"><b> Paul Goggins: </b> 
 If they remained outside the perimeter fence they would not be caught by the offence, although I imagine that the people responsible for the site might want to engage them in discussion about the tarpaulin that they had put up against the fence. Provided they   remained outside the fence, they would not be committing an offence under these provisions.

</p>





<p><a name="st_277"><a name="51103-22_spnew15"><b> Paul Goggins: </b> 
 I give way to the hon. Gentleman.
</p>





<p><a name="st_278"><a name="51103-22_spnew16"><b> Mr. Grieve: </b> 
 Perhaps I can help the Minister. Unless the law has changed, the hon. Member for Islington, North (Jeremy Corbyn) would have to make an effective and substantial entry through the fence to be a trespasser, within the meaning of the clause as I understand it&#151;in exactly the same way as if one were a burglar. I do not know whether that is helpful or whether the Minister agrees; perhaps he would like to tell me.
</p>





<p><a name="st_279"><a name="51103-22_spnew17"><b> Paul Goggins: </b> 
 We seem to be getting into deeper water than anticipated. I think that my hon. Friend the Member for North-West Leicestershire (David Taylor) wanted to intervene&#151;
</p>





<p><a name="st_280"><a name="51103-22_spnew18"><b> Mr. Heath </b> 
 <i>rose&#151;</i>
</p>





<p><a name="st_281"><a name="51103-22_spnew19"><b> Paul Goggins: </b> 
 As does the hon. Gentleman. This is sparking a lively and interesting discussion. I do not know how many times I shall need to say that the point at which people go beyond the fence is when they will be   guilty of an offence under the clause.

My understanding is that the individuals concerned would physically have to go beyond the fence; in that sense there would need to be substantial entry to the site.

 My fear is that this is a rather academic argument. [Hon.

 I apologise for missing the earlier remarks; I was in Westminster Hall. Will the Minister clarify what happens when a site is de-licensed. From my dealings with British Nuclear Fuels Ltd over the years, I think that the rights of someone to enter such a site are perfectly clear at the moment. If the status of a site changes, will the provision remain in place, or will it go, as the site is de-licensed?

 I am delighted that the Government have moved the amendment. I had read the text as it stands and, indeed, had drafted an amendment, but I then discovered that the Government had got there first, whereupon it did not seem necessary to table such an   amendment myself. The Bill as drafted is deeply ambiguous about whether the provision would apply to   the area outside the perimeter fence that was subject to the current restrictions. As I understood that the Government wanted to restrict things in that way, I am delighted that they have made it clear that that is not their intention.

<p>
<a name="51103-23_para0">
<a name="stpa_156">As for the questions that were asked earlier, my recollection&#151;I may have this wrong&#151;is that the definition involves effective and substantial entry, so that touching the fence would not constitute entry, but cutting the fence with wire cutters and starting to crawl through it almost certainly would, apart from the fact that the criminal damage to the fence would enable one   to be instantly arrested. As for climbing over, when one is on top of the fence is the point where one would be caught by the provisions.

 I also welcome these amendments&#151;they are obviously a sensible adjustment to the original text&#151;but I want to enter an appropriate reservation. The Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005 was   enacted not many months ago, and it is slightly disappointing to be revisiting provisions that we extensively debated so recently during the passage of that Act. I wish that we could get legislation right and encompass the correct areas in the first instance, rather than having to return to it constantly, perhaps because it was introduced in haste and with insufficient care. Other than making that point, I support these amendments.

<a name="51103-23_para3">
<a name="stpa_159">Our debate relates closely to what has happened at RAF Fairford, which I have visited on several occasions to talk to my constituents and others. Part of the problem surrounding the dispute and the question of   section 44 powers under the Terrorism Act 2000 was   disagreement about where the actual perimeter was. During the course of the conflict&#151;it was a real conflict&#151;the authorities moved the perimeter, which forced people away from their original encampment because they were told that it was within the site perimeter.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51103-23_para4">
<a name="stpa_160">It might be that the boundary around nuclear sites is more established and understood, but I know from my experience at Berkeley that disputes are ongoing about exactly where the full perimeter goes. I know as someone who is trying to pursue the de-licensing of that site that   the matter is subject to arguments about land ownership. The situation is thus not as straightforward as simply saying, &quot;This is the site, so everyone knows where they are.&quot;
</p>

<p>
<a name="51103-23_para5">
<a name="stpa_161">Will the Minister clarify whether the exact perimeter of a site will have to be laid down before people are excluded from it? The matter might be fairly academic, as the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome (Mr.   Heath) suggested, but a nasty situation can arise in the case of a dispute, because people can feel that their rights are being taken away if the designation of a perimeter is changed.

Friend the Member for Stroud (Mr. Drew) that there is a question about what the actual perimeter is. I heard what the Minister said about the perimeter fence, but I can envisage a situation in which the people who are protesting at the Atomic Weapons Establishment site at Aldermaston and occupying the ground and car park outside the fence could rapidly find themselves encircled owing to an increase in the size of the fence and site. One can imagine a situation of continual encroachment.

<p>
<a name="51103-23_para6">
<a name="stpa_162">Why is clause 12 in the Bill at all? What is the purpose behind it? Its whole purpose seems to be an attempt to close down, limit and restrict legitimate and peaceful demonstrations against nuclear power, the development of nuclear weapons and nuclear missiles. It could criminalise many people who are undertaking legitimate protest against the immoral possession of nuclear weapons.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51103-23_para7">
<a name="stpa_163">When we think of the famous demonstration that took place at Greenham Common for a long time, the current demonstrations at Faslane and Aldermaston and the frequent demonstrations outside Fylingdales and several other places, we realise that we could end up   criminalising many people who are undertaking something that I believe to be a perfectly correct and   moral activity. The Government should explain why nuclear sites are covered by the Bill at all. The   Government amendments represent a bit of an improvement, but as my hon. Friend the Member for Stroud pointed out, they will be open to all kinds of misinterpretation and smart fiddles at a later stage.

<a name="stpa_164">Under the clause, as amended, the authorities in charge of any of the designated sites could presumably move the boundaries quite easily.

Such questions matter because the measure might cause people serious legal problems. I hope that the Minister will clarify my points, some of which have been expressed to me by many in the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament and a lot of peace protestors throughout the country.

Under the Bill, anyone who climbed into the Aldermaston site and painted something on the walls to the effect that they believed that nuclear weapons were dangerous, illegal and immoral and that this country should adhere to the non-proliferation treaty would not be accused of criminal damage or trespass, as at present, but would become

Are we advancing anything by designating as terrorists people who, by their very nature, are opposed to violence, terror and the existence of nuclear weapons, and who in many cases are equally opposed to nuclear power? I honestly do not see the point of the clause standing part other than gratuitously to criminalise a large body of people who act for entirely peaceful purposes and who have brought about significant political changes. That is simply not a sensible way to proceed. It will further alienate large sections of the population who do not want to be alienated, but do want to engage in serious political debate about the morality of nuclear weapons.

Anyone who plants a bomb commits several criminal acts, not least acts preparatory to murder, which are already within the ambit of criminal law. Why, therefore, are nuclear sites and bases included in the Bill? What information is displayed outside bases to make clear the point at which someone becomes a suspect under the terrorism legislation when they cross a threshold?

As much as we are trying to keep people out, this has implications for people who work on the inside of such an establishment. I am not sure whether this measure has been thought through sufficiently. If we are talking about someone who did something as a member of staff, that could bring in the whole question of whether they were acting illegitimately and therefore threatening the country and so would be subject to the Bill and deemed to be terrorists.

Notwithstanding the fact that that will be an offence under the Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005, will such a person be detained under the provisions passed yesterday?

 Will the hon. Gentleman reflect on a situation in which somebody, whether he is a terrorist or a protestor, trespasses on to a nuclear site, and those responsible for security must make a quick decision about that individual&#039;s purpose and intent? I assume that those responsible for security would fear the worst and act accordingly. Clause 12 makes it clear that people are not permitted to trespass on such sites and that there are consequences to doing so. The last thing that we want is for somebody who is a terrorist to stray on to a nuclear site and do dreadful harm with the machinery and power that exists there.

 Notwithstanding the Minister&#039;s explanation and justification, I find myself unpersuaded.

Given that the Minister refers to the consequences that must flow from the act, what would they be in terms of the range of penalties?

If the individual is not   a terrorist and is present for what many people, including the hon.

Will it be among the penalties in the 2005 Act, which I do not have in front of me and would need to know more about, or is the driving criterion the seriousness of the establishment that is being attended?

<br>&nbsp;<br>that if somebody was there as a protestor, albeit that he had committed an offence, the court would bear that in mind when setting the penalty.

 Like many hon. Members, I am oscillating about the clause. Like my hon.

I am worried that similar circumstances could arise under the Bill. Although I am clear about the boundary and I can understand that someone who crosses the boundary commits an offence, I remain unclear about the reason for including such a provision in the Terrorism Bill. If someone got over a   perimeter fence and proved to be a terrorist, surely he could be charged under other legislation rather than simply being charged with crossing the perimeter fence.

 Indeed, there may be other legislation. My hon.

I hope that I   can offer the clarity that my hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Selly Oak (Lynne Jones) seeks.

In other words, if anyone anywhere commits a crime that falls into the necessary categories and is a crime in the United Kingdom, that crime will be prosecutable in a British court of law. If that is the case, those crimes would become part of a small subsection of crimes that are prosecutable on that basis.

Britain would therefore provide a service in allowing for a prosecution where otherwise the person would go free because the crime of which they were accused was committed in a country that perhaps retained the death penalty, thus making extradition impossible. Will the Minister therefore confirm the categories of crime that he expects to be caught under the purpose of the clause, and that we are applying a principle of universal jurisdiction in this area?

 I fear, Sir Alan, that my right hon. and learned Friend&#039;s concerns are justified and that they can be mitigated only if amendment No. 90 is accepted. I put it to him that there is another concern in this context. Given that a large proportion of asylum seekers come to this country from countries where civil conflict or human rights abuse is a fact of life, is there not a real concern that if this clause is unamended, countries from which people are fleeing will demand that the terms of this legislation be used against those individuals, or that they be herded back en masse to face a pretty grim form of justice at home?

 That point had not occurred to me, but I   agree with it entirely. So far as I can see, successful asylum applicants could well find themselves immediately vulnerable to prosecution here under this provision, at which I have expressed my outrage. This is in no way a routine part of the Bill and I do not understand why we are being asked to give this provision universal application. It will take a great deal from the Minister to persuade me that we should take this wholly exceptional step in determining the jurisdiction of this country and the application of this Bill.

 I agree with what others have said about clause 17 and the two amendments to it, both of which I support. We have had this discussion about extraterritorial jurisdictions before, and the turning point was the case of General Pinochet. The case for his extradition to Spain was brought here, and the historic ruling of the House of Lords was that crimes against humanity, genocide and torture were universal in their jurisdiction. That is now accepted as fact, and everyone will agree that such major crimes should be universal. But I find it bizarre that this Bill seeks to make its many catch-all clauses universal, in terms of the jurisdiction of this country.

For example, an offence under section 54 of the Terrorism Act 2000 relating to weapons training would be caught by the Bill, even though weapons training that takes place abroad might be considered legitimate or even worthy if it were carried out by freedom fighters opposing a disgraceful regime.

Much would depend on the current state of our relations with a country, whether some fraught issue was coming up at the United Nations on which we might require that country&#039;s support or whether some trade negotiations were imminent. If the Egyptian Government suggested that someone here was encouraging terrorism in their country through their speeches or the way in which they sang songs that appeared to glorify terrorism, or if the Turks had trouble with some Kurds living here, or the Indians had   trouble with some Kashmiri, the Attorney-General would have to ring the Foreign Office for the public   policy on whether to be helpful, friendly and co-operative with the country concerned. The Home Secretary has to do that sometimes. I remember negotiating an extradition treaty with the Indian Government that was closely bound to their relations to the Foreign Office. However, it would be wrong to pass a criminal law and rely on the Attorney-General&#039;s diplomatic judgment at any given moment as to whether we should initiate criminal proceedings to cheer up some other Government who believe that somebody here is encouraging terrorism or attending terrorist training.

If they were aware of the provisions of the clause, they would know that, because they had constructed explosives or weapons before their attempt to overthrow their Government, they had committed a criminal offence under UK law which would make them liable to many years of imprisonment. In those circumstances, they would not try to come to this country.

<p><a name="st_386"><a name="51103-29_spnew6"><b> Paul Goggins: </b> 
 Indeed. Our obligations under the convention require that wider international context. That applies not only under the European convention but also under the UN nuclear convention. We need to consider the Bill within that wider context. The hon. Gentleman&#039;s amendments would limit the fight against terrorism only to instances where there was harm or threat of harm to a UK national. That would put the Bill out of kilter with existing legislation and would also mean that we could not prosecute those who prepare acts of terrorism against fellow human beings who are not British. For example, an attack planned against a British company in another country which employed only locally engaged staff would not be covered if the hon. Gentleman&#039;s amendments were agreed.

 The hon. Gentleman wisely cited his strongest point when he talked about the preparation of terrorist acts, which is covered by the   Bill. Speaking for myself, I would be prepared to contemplate British courts having jurisdiction over someone who came here if they were guilty of preparing to carry out a terrorist activity elsewhere. I hope that, before Report, he will try to think what the arguments are for extending that to the encouragement of terrorism, with all the arguments that we had about it yesterday, or to attendance at training places, given that he has said today that any kind of innocent attendance at a training centre is a loophole in the law that cannot be conceded. So a humanitarian worker is guilty of a criminal offence unless he leaves immediately when he suspects that some men are coming in from the woods in the evening and training somewhere on the edge of the village. Extending the proposal to those sorts of offence in the whole of part 1 makes clause 17 ridiculous and will impose all kinds of diplomatic and political problems for the Attorney-General and other Ministers as soon as other Governments realise that they can pursue their enemies here and try to get them arrested.

 I know from the right hon. and learned Gentleman&#039;s earlier comments, which he now reinforces, that he has serious reservations about the range of offences covered by clause 17. I do not share his view that some bits of terrorism are more important or serious than others. If anyone participates at whatever level in either preparing for or carrying out an act of terror that results in the loss of innocent lives, that is a serious role and it needs to be covered by the Bill. Of course the court will take a decision about the appropriate penalty in the given circumstances of the case. I do not agree with him that some offences should be excluded and others included.

I take people who glorify and encourage acts of terror that result in the loss of people&#039;s lives&#151;in whatever country they are, whatever their nationality and whatever their origin&#151;very seriously. The Bill puts   in place powers to enable us to deal with that not just here, but internationally. It gives effect to the obligations to which we have signed up through the various conventions to which I referred.
</p>





<p><a name="st_401"><a name="51103-30_spnew6"><b> Ms Keeble: </b> 
 May I flag up the opposite position to that put forward by other hon. Members? It is clear from several decisions of appeal tribunals that some people who apply for asylum here have been involved in activities that would rightly be considered to be offences under the Bill. Most of us would accept that the behaviour of some of those people has been unacceptable, but their lives could be at risk if they were deported. We must ensure that there is justice on both sides of the equation.

<p><a name="st_402"><a name="51103-30_spnew7"><b> Paul Goggins: </b> 
 The balance is clear. We have obligations to people who may have been convicted of an offence but cannot be returned to their country because they may be subjected to torture or may lose their lives as a result of their return. These are serious obligations that we honour, and we intend to honour them in future.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51103-30_para0">
<a name="stpa_210">There are clearly many hon. Members who wish to contribute to the debate. If they catch your eye, Sir Alan, I am sure that you will invite them to speak. I intend to resume my place.
</p>





<p><a name="st_403"><a name="51103-30_spnew8"><b> Rob Marris: </b> 
 I ask the Minister to have another think about these matters. I understood him to say&#151;perhaps I misunderstood him&#151;that clause 17 is being introduced in part to comply with our international obligations under the Council of Europe convention for the prevention of terrorism, and similar obligations. That confuses me because in the explanatory notes to clause 1, it states:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_26">&quot;The offence has been introduced to implement the requirements of Article 5 of the Council of Europe Convention for the Prevention of Terrorism&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>3 Nov 2005 : Column 1053</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>

<p>
<a name="51103-30_para1">
<a name="stpa_211">Clause 1 refers to the convention. Clause 17, as I read it, makes no reference to that convention and nor to the explanatory notes. I ask my hon. Friend to think again and either to explain tonight or at some other convenient juncture what it is in clause 17 that is needed for us as a country to comply with these international obligations.
</p>





<p><a name="st_404"><a name="51103-30_spnew9"><b> Mr. Heath: </b> 
 We have had an interesting debate. I began by saying that I was moving a probing amendment. Goodness, we probed. The amendment has had the effect of probing a hornets&#039; nest. We are now clear that what the   Minister is proposing goes well beyond what is necessary to meet international obligations. It goes well   beyond what some of us would see as a sensible extension of extraterritorial jurisdiction&#151;I almost said extraterrestrial again, to please the right hon. and learned Member for Rushcliffe (Mr. Clarke)&#151;in dealing effectively with those who commit or are to a serious extent planning terrorist offences abroad.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51103-30_para2">
<a name="stpa_212">Points have been made about the difficulty of those who seek asylum in our country. It is right that if someone is a terrorist they should not be given asylum in the United Kingdom. The problem with the Bill is that it goes well beyond the convention definitions of terrorism and introduces offences in this country that would be unknown to any other jurisdiction. It extends the scope well beyond that which is reasonable to exclude people from asylum in this country on that basis. That worries me. People have to give a truthful answer when they are asked what their experiences are in their country of origin when they apply for asylum. They are required to give evidence that will then be used to prosecute them because they have encouraged someone or a group within their country, whose members they believe to be freedom fighters in the context of their country&#039;s circumstances but in British law will be termed a terrorist organisation. That poses real problems.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51103-30_para3">
<a name="stpa_213">As I have said, the difficulty is still one of definition. It is a debate that we are still to have, unfortunately. When I listened to the Minister&#039;s response, including his truthful but extraordinary response to the right hon. Member for Southampton, Itchen (Mr. Denham), I was convinced that we could not leave the issue to Report. We need to express to Ministers that they need to tighten these definitions considerably if we are to agree to them at a later stage in our consideration of the Bill.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51103-30_para4">
<a name="stpa_214">On behalf of my right hon. and hon. Friends, I still maintain the position that there is a possibility of finding an extraterritorial jurisdiction that is based on clear definitions that meets our commitments by treaty that we would be happy to support. What we have heard from the Minister this evening suggests that we are a long way from that. On that basis, I think that we need to test the opinion of the Committee.

 Clause 18 extends a liability for offences under the Bill to bodies corporate. Where an offence by   a body corporate is committed, the liability will also lie with company directors and other officers. Under subsection (1), a

<br>
&quot;director, manager, secretary or other similar officer of the body corporate, or . . . a person who was purporting to act in any such capacity&quot;
<br>



<p><a name="st_413">will be guilty of an offence committed by a body corporate. Such an offence can be committed because the person consented or connived in it, or because it was attributable to neglect on his part.</p>





<p><a name="st_414">That is a fairly remarkable concept. I am familiar with the form of words, because my experience of practising in health and safety at work tells me that it is lifted 

<br>&nbsp;<br>

<br>&nbsp;<br>directly from that field. That may be appropriate when one is trying to achieve a degree of regulation, and when the maximum penalty is a fine, but it is a rather novel concept that a person should be sent to prison for life for having been neglectful in allowing his company to commit an offence.</p>





<p><a name="st_415">The provision could extend in directions that I suspect the Minister may not have intended. I am grateful to the   hon. Member for Wolverhampton, South-West (Rob   Marris) for giving me an example a moment ago. He suggested that if a licence was applied for to collect money in the street on behalf of an organisation that was acting unlawfully under the Bill, because it was raising money for terrorism, the mayor and the officers of the corporation who granted that licence would all be liable to lengthy terms of imprisonment for failing to carry out checks on the organisation concerned. I cannot believe that the Government genuinely intend that. Yet again, we have an example of a provision that has been drafted astonishingly broadly and is capable of having consequences that are not only unintended but manifestly unjust.</p>





<p><a name="st_416">The amendment would allow for the liability of company directors and other officers in cases of consent or connivance but remove it in the case of neglect. I hope that the Under-Secretary can accept it.</p>

 I support the amendment. As my hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Grieve) pointed out, the clause has a wide application. It covers part 1 and is therefore extremely broad in scope.

 Amendment No. 33 stands in my name and that of my hon. Friend the Member for Erith and Thamesmead (John Austin). I would also like to say a few words about the other amendments in the group. Amendment No. 33 covers an issue that I raised on Second Reading. I refer hon.

Hamas is definitely a terrorist organisation, and it is definitely proscribed under existing legislation. My reading of the Bill as it stands is   that such an act would become unlawful. That is ludicrous.

<a name="stpa_225">I appreciate his giving me that assurance, but I still do see that in the Bill. It is what is in the Bill that is important, so I would appreciate it if he would tell me what he can do to clarify this matter, perhaps on Report.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51103-31_para9">
<a name="stpa_226">The main question that we are dealing with in regard to this group of amendments is the definition of terrorism. Yesterday, I was struck by the speech made by my hon. Friend the Member for Nottingham, South (Alan Simpson), when he read out a passage from &quot;Homage to Catalonia&quot;. That book also had a major impact on my political thinking, particularly when I   became a student in the early 70s. Within a month of   my going to York university, Salvador Allende&#039;s Government in Chile was overthrown by the Pinochet regime. Throughout the 70s, while I was at university, I   found out a lot about what was going on in Chile. Exiled Chilean students came to my university, and I got to know them and learned a lot from them about what people were going through in Chile at that time. People were being herded into football stadiums; there were death squads. Some of those students said that they wanted to take up arms against the fascist regime, but I   could not regard them as terrorists. However, under the definition in the Bill, they would be.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51103-31_para10">
<a name="stpa_227">These amendments have to be considered in the context of clause 1. It would have been wrong if those people who opposed the Pinochet regime in Chile had murdered civilians. That would have been wrong even then. Even if they had urged such action, I would certainly have argued with them and disagreed with 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>3 Nov 2005 : Column 1061</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>them, but whether I would have wanted to criminalise them is another matter. However, clause 1 as it stands would criminalise them. If we are going to have such provisions in clause 1, it is essential that, when we define terrorism, we draw a distinction between actions taken against civilians and non-combatants&#151;which are not justifiable&#151;and actions taken against the forces of a regime similar to the Pinochet regime. That seems to be the crux of the amendment of my right hon. Friend the Member for Southampton, Itchen (Mr. Denham).
</p>

<p>
<a name="51103-31_para11">
<a name="stpa_228">One of the criticisms of the amendment is that it would not regard attacks on British troops as terrorist, which is true. In my view, however, anybody in this country who urged attacks on British troops would be guilty of at least incitement and probably also treason. The fact that someone is attacking troops does not of itself make the attack terrorism. It might make it unjustifiable, abhorrent or treasonable, but it does not necessarily make it terrorism. Let us remember that every regime in the world that has faced some kind of insurgency&#151;the South African one springs to mind&#151;always describes forces that take action against it, if they are not regular forces, as terrorist. While we might want to tidy up provisions to deal with matters regarding British troops, we must not get ourselves into a situation whereby we give succour to oppressive regimes who want to describe people as terrorists not because of what they do, not because they target civilians and not because they are involved in genocide, but simply because they oppose them. Such a tightening of the definition of terrorism is the purpose of this group of amendments.

 I wish briefly to support the remarks made by   the   hon. Member for Birmingham, Northfield (Richard   Burden) and to speak briefly to my amendment No. 75 in the same grouping.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51103-32_para0">
<a name="stpa_230">As the hon. Member for Birmingham, Northfield rightly remarked, clause 20 really applies to the entirety of the Bill as it contains the definition of terrorism. As   the hon. and learned Member for Medway (Mr.   Marshall-Andrews) reminded us yesterday, it applies particularly to clause 1, which he rightly described as the most offensive part of the Bill, and I agree with him. The question of what is terrorism brings us face to face with the most difficult decision: what is a   freedom fighter, and who is a terrorist? It is extraordinarily difficult. At the moment, the Bill applies equally to those whom this House would regard as freedom fighters and those whom the House would regard as terrorists. The definition makes absolutely no distinction between the two. The question that we must ask is whether that is what we really want to do.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51103-32_para1">
<a name="stpa_231">The question can be judged historically. If we look back to the struggle of the Fenians in Ireland in the 19th   century, was all of their violence improper, albeit that civilian casualties were involved?

Turning to the point frequently made by my hon. Friend the Member for Buckingham (John   Bercow), is that not also true of Burma?

<br>&nbsp;<br>

<br>&nbsp;<br>to   prosecute over terrorism overseas is not a legal decision; it is a political decision. In effect, it creates the whitelist. In this context, the Attorney-General is a Minister and his decisions will reflect not a legal but a political judgment. I do not believe that we should legislate for prosecutions only to follow a political judgment. I hope that the Home Secretary and his colleagues will think again about whether we can somehow restrict the definition of terrorism so that we strike only at that which is deeply offensive and do not find ourselves outlawing the freedom fighter or those who wish to support him&#151;as many right hon. and hon.

I want to discuss the problem of   definitions more narrowly. There is nothing magic about the definition in the Terrorism Act 2000. It is not   based on international law. Other definitions are significantly different. The European Union Council framework decision, for example, lists much the same offences, but involves a much higher threshold.

<p><a name="st_444"><a name="51103-32_spnew9"><b> Mr. Denham: </b> 
 I will touch on that issue, which relates   to the report from which I took the wording of my amendment, in a moment. That report was by the high-level working group established by the Secretary-General of the United Nations in preparation for the 60th anniversary world summit. The group addressed the problem of defining terrorism legally, politically and   specifically. It concluded&#151;I am paraphrasing, but I hope fairly&#151;that actions of states such as war, occupation and genocide are already covered by international law in one way or another. Attempts to agree international laws on terrorism, excluding specific offences, have so far always foundered on what has been described as the freedom fighter problem&#151;one man&#039;s terrorist is another&#039;s freedom fighter. In the past, that problem most obviously preoccupied the UN in respect of the Palestine Liberation Organisation, the Israeli occupation since the &#039;67 war, and so on.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51103-32_para10">
<a name="stpa_240">The high-level working group made a very persuasive point. It said that there should be some international norms, and it approached the issue not from the political basis of the action that might be carried out by civilian or non-state combatants, but according to the type of action that is acceptable. It said that it does not matter what the cause is&#151;deliberately targeting civilians is wrong. That is the basis on which it produced the wording that I have used in my amendment.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51103-32_para11">
<a name="stpa_241">There are two reasons to commend this definition to the House today. First, although it is not an intergovernmental agreement, it did come from a legitimate international process set up under the auspices of the UN. Secondly, it deals with the problem that this House has been wrestling with for the past few days, and for that reason it is to be greatly preferred, in dealing with the offences under consideration, to the Government&#039;s definition. Any Member of this House should be prepared to argue with their constituents that deliberately setting out to kill civilians and non-combatants&#151;be it in Burma, Chechnya, Kashmir, Palestine or any future trouble spot&#151;is wrong, no matter what the history, grievance or repression. That is why the wording of my amendment has been drawn directly from the working group report.

Terrorism is not new,   but the type of terrorism associated with al-Qaeda and the tactics that are used around the world are new. If that were not the case, we would not be debating the Bill. The definition of terrorism that we use should be focused as closely as possible on the new problem that we are trying to tackle. My amendment is not perfect, but it begins to show the way forward.

 It is unfortunate that, because of the way in which our debate on the Bill is ordered, we have come to this debate at this stage. I think that the Minister would have had an easier time this afternoon if we had resolved on a proper definition of terrorism from the outset. I have to say to the Home Secretary that it is clearly now the settled will of the House that a definition must be properly placed on the face of the Bill, because what is there is less than adequate. I do not know whether amendment No. 69, tabled by the right hon. Member for Southampton, Itchen (Mr. Denham) is perfect. It probably is not&#151;but it is certainly preferable to what is in the Bill, and if he is minded to press it to a vote, my hon. Friends and I will support him.

 I agree with everything that the hon. Member for Orkney and Shetland (Mr. Carmichael) has just said. The right hon.

It clearly goes a long way towards meeting the Committee&#039;s concerns. The definition may not be perfect, but because it centres on the idea of using violence against civilians and non-combatants to achieve an end, it goes to the heart of defining the sort of behaviour that we can universally deplore.

</p>

<p>
<a name="51103-34_para2">
<a name="stpa_259">Amendment No. 33 would remove the reference to the definition in the Terrorism Act 2000 and leave acts of terrorism undefined for the purposes of the Bill. Amendment No. 69 was tabled by my right hon. Friend the Member for Southampton, Itchen (Mr. Denham) and would limit the definition applying to certain parts of the Bill to attacks on civilians. My right hon. Friend has also accepted that attacks on British forces need to be covered, as well as perhaps attacks on property that recklessly endanger human life.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51103-34_para3">
<a name="stpa_260">Amendment No. 75 tries to achieve a similar aim by   providing that acts outside the UK that do not involve British citizens or interests count as acts of terrorism or convention offences only if they are not done with the intent of causing the death or serious injury of   foreign troops in a country. Amendment No. 61 provides that attacks on Governments and international organisations are not terrorism if those Governments or organisations have persistently been involved in breaches of human rights. Amendment No. 84 would change the definition of terrorism to remove the reference to &quot;serious damage to property&quot; and replace it with

Members on both sides of the Committee to try to reach the correct conclusion. As I said to the Home Affairs Committee when I gave evidence on the Bill, there is good reason why the new offences that the Bill creates should be governed by our existing definition of terrorism, which Parliament has approved and which 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>3 Nov 2005 : Column 1069</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>has operated effectively, without some of the fears that   have been expressed being realised, for five years. I   wrote to the Chairman of the Committee following my evidence on this very issue and I pointed out that there is no agreed international definition of terrorism and that all the existing alternative definitions are unsatisfactory in some way. I cited the EU code, to which my right hon. Friend the Member for Southampton, Itchen referred, and the state of affairs of the current United Nations discussions to try to address the issue.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51103-34_para5">
<a name="stpa_262">I need to be clear about this issue because of possible misunderstanding. I accept that it is a difficult issue and that there are problems with the definition in the Act. I   accept and acknowledge that those problems exist. However, I also think that there are problems with the definition that my right hon. Friend offers us, although I mean no criticism by that. Therefore, it is important that we discuss precisely how to deal with the issue so that we may reach agreement on Report about how best to proceed.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51103-34_para6">
<a name="stpa_263">Having acknowledged the difficult nature of the issue, I wish to make a couple of specific points. The whole terrorist/freedom fighter debate has been dominant for some time, but I must say&#151;I know that no one has suggested it&#151;that al-Qaeda is not in the same spirit of freedom fighting that many &quot;terrorists&quot; have claimed in the past. However, that does not absolve me from dealing with the problem that the hon. Member for Buckingham (John Bercow) mentioned about definition.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51103-34_para7">
<a name="stpa_264">I wish to make a couple of points about the possible definition that we could reach. It has been suggested that only attacks that endanger life should be covered and that we should exclude attacks on property. I find that difficult and I remind the Committee that our existing definition includes only serious attacks on property and ask Members to recall the Provisional IRA&#039;s attacks on the City of London in the mid 1990s. To suggest that such acts were not terrorist attacks seems to be missing an important point. The simple &quot;property or not&quot; definition does not entirely work.
</p>





<p><a name="st_460"><a name="51103-34_spnew1"><b> Mr. Denham: </b> 
 Although such an attack is clearly terrorist and would be defined as such in the 2000 Act, the point is that we are considering new laws that we never thought it necessary to introduce when we faced the PIRA attacks. That is why we need to look at the definition of terrorism that is appropriate to the new laws. My right hon. Friend is being very helpful, but I   caution him that relying on retrospective events for the basis of the definition, when we did not think that these proposed laws were necessary at the time, is a rather dangerous line of argument.
</p>





<p><a name="st_461"><a name="51103-34_spnew2"><b> Mr. Clarke: </b> 
 I understand that very real point, but if the 9/11 attacks had taken place when there was no one in the World Trade Centre or in the aeroplanes, the symbolism of the attack on property would have none the less been profound, as it would have been in an attack on the Pentagon or wherever it might be. I do not dispute my right hon. Friend&#039;s central point, which is that we need a different definition in the Bill than in other Bills. I understand that; his point is well made and I accept it for the purpose of the discussion. But simply to exclude property altogether raises certain questions that need to be addressed.

<a name="51103-34_para8">
<a name="stpa_265">Another suggestion is that only attacks on civilians should constitute terrorism. Again, I understand that; it is a logical point. However, I have to put to the Committee that there are definitional problems. Do the police count as civilians? What about off-duty soldiers who happen to be wearing their uniform? What about British soldiers currently serving in other parts of the world? I acknowledge that I do not solve those problems merely by referring to them, but they are real and they need seriously to be addressed.

 I will give them serious consideration, but I make the point&#151;not in an antagonistic spirit&#151;that the definition of civil war is often just as difficult to achieve as the definition of terrorist or freedom fighter. There is no easy definition that solves the problem.

<a name="stpa_266">I want explicitly to acknowledge the concerns raised by my right hon. Friend the Member for Southampton, Itchen in his amendment.

Friend the Minister for Policing, Security and Community Safety to look again at the issue of intent&#151;a key point to which my right hon. Friend the Member for Southampton, Itchen also referred. Clearly, if we have a tighter intent test, the number of people who would fall within the ambit of the new offences in clauses 1 and 2 would be restricted, which might meet some of his concerns about the type of terrorism we would be covering. However, those are difficult questions and we acknowledge the points that he and others have made, including my hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Hall Green (Steve McCabe) in his intervention today, and we are happy to see whether we can reach agreement in a way that achieves more consensus on that point for Report.

<p><a name="st_510"><a name="51103-36_spnew1"><b> Mr. Robert Flello  (Stoke-on-Trent, South) (Lab):</b> 
 I   am most grateful for being given the opportunity to initiate this debate on an extremely important subject. At the same time, I am disappointed that I need to join the long line of right hon. and hon. Members in speaking to and questioning Ministers about the funding of children&#039;s hospices. Such hospices have been in our communities for almost 25 years but there is still no proper means of funding their vital work.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51103-36_para1">
<a name="stpa_272">The current situation is disgraceful. We have a national health service that is being transformed for the   better by reform and new investment. It is a transformation that is designed to give local communities a proper say in how NHS money is used. It is a transformation that means that primary care trusts are receiving record amounts of money. I believe that the average PCT budget will grow by almost &#163;42 million by 2006&#150;07.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51103-36_para2">
<a name="stpa_273">In previous debates and questions Ministers have made various excuses for why children&#039;s hospices have   not been funded. For example, it has been said that children&#039;s hospices are badly supported by the NHS because they are relatively recent. After 23 years, that excuse can be dismissed.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51103-36_para3">
<a name="stpa_274">The single and most often repeated reason has been that it is not up to the Government to dictate to PCTs how much funding should be given to children&#039;s hospices. It has been said that there is no upper limit on how much money PCTs can give, but that it is up to the individual hospice to negotiate with the PCT on service delivery.
</p>





<p><a name="st_511"><a name="51103-36_spnew2"><b> Lynda Waltho  (Stourbridge) (Lab):</b> 
 I am pleased that my hon. Friend has been able to secure the debate on such an important subject. I wonder whether my hon.   Friend has shared my experience when speaking to   people involved with children&#039;s hospices; there is a feeling of utter frustration. On the one hand, Ministers say that money is available, but the problem appears to   be that it is allocated to the primary care trusts. That is where it gets stuck. Only today I was told by the chief   executive of a hospice that there needs to be joined-up thinking and joined-up working between the Department and the PCTs. That is where the biggest problem is.
</p>





<p><a name="st_512"><a name="51103-36_spnew3"><b> Mr. Flello: </b> 
 I am grateful to my hon. Friend for raising those issues, which I hope to cover in my speech. It is incredibly frustrating that staff who do a fantastic job in this sector do not receive the recognition and support that they need from the PCTs whereas our communities are supporting them all the way.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51103-36_para4">
<a name="stpa_275">I shall take a typical example, that of the engagement of Treetops children&#039;s hospice which is in my constituency, with the 10 PCTs in the area that the hospice serves. For the record, I am delighted to have been asked to serve as an unpaid member of the Donna Louise trust, which supports the work of Treetops.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51103-36_para5">
<a name="stpa_276">The Government have an excellent record on working to meet the needs of children. Indeed, they introduced the excellent national service framework for children as part of 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>3 Nov 2005 : Column 1076</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>the &quot;Every Child Matters&quot; initiative. That document set out a requirement for local statutory services to work with organisations such as children&#039;s hospices on the planning, funding and commissioning of local services. In practice, however, of the 10 PCTs contacted by Treetops&#151;it was Treetops that initiated the contact, not the PCTs&#151;only five agreed to face-to-face contact. One PCT has not replied to any letters and, in some cases, it took many months before a reply was extracted from the remaining four. Those replies basically said that the PCT was not interested. So much for full engagement by PCTs with service providers.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51103-36_para6">
<a name="stpa_277">How much have the five PCTs that met Treetops contributed to the hospice services that are recognised as important by the framework? One PCT chief executive asked that very question, and was suitably shame-faced when he was told, &quot;Absolutely nothing.&quot; Incidentally, he has not put the situation right. How much do PCTs pay Treetops for supporting about 135 life-limited children and their families, more than half of whom are referrals from the PCTs themselves?
</p>





<p><a name="st_513"><a name="51103-36_spnew4"><b> Lynda Waltho: </b> 
 Does my hon. Friend acknowledge that there is an additional problem for hospices that cover a larger area? Acorns children&#039;s hospice covers the west midlands, Shropshire, Herefordshire, Gloucestershire, Warwickshire and Worcestershire, so it has the tremendous problem of negotiating with 33 separate PCTs. I appreciate the problem my hon. Friend has raised, but in fact it can be even larger.
</p>





<p><a name="st_514"><a name="51103-36_spnew5"><b> Mr. Flello: </b> 
 My hon. Friend has highlighted the fact that hospices are dealing with a vast number of PCTs. It is a huge effort to extract any reply at all from some of them, and that problem is exacerbated if hospices have to write to even more PCTs.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51103-36_para7">
<a name="stpa_278">PCTs do not pay Treetops anything for supporting life-limited children and their families, more than half of whom are referrals from the PCTs. The hospice is funded almost entirely by public donations, and has also received some money from the New Opportunities Fund over a three-year period. The picture is the same up and down the country.
</p>





<p><a name="st_515"><a name="51103-36_spnew6"><b> Adam Afriyie  (Windsor) (Con):</b> 
 Like the hon. Gentleman I serve on a hospice committee, and I support the Sebastian Gates action trust in my constituency. He alluded to the voluntary sector and the private donations that help to keep children&#039;s hospices going. Will he join me in commending the people who donate their time, energy and resources to those private trusts and hospices, because that fills the gap in Government funding?
</p>





<p><a name="st_516"><a name="51103-36_spnew7"><b> Mr. Flello: </b> 
 The hon. Gentleman is quite right, and I   join him in commending the work done by many people who put themselves out no matter what the weather, and who work hard to raise much-needed money from communities that want those services.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51103-36_para8">
<a name="stpa_279">Given the lack of funding, one might wonder whether the Government genuinely accept the need for children&#039;s hospices. The national service framework, however, states:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_35">&quot;Palliative care services can include short-term breaks, counselling, family support services, pain management and symptom control.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>3 Nov 2005 : Column 1077</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>

<p>
<a name="51103-36_para9">
<a name="stpa_280">Those services, the framework states, should be
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_36">&quot;easily accessible, timely and in the setting of the family&#039;s choice.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="51103-36_para10">
<a name="stpa_281">It goes on to say that co-ordination and close liaison between agencies, including children&#039;s hospices, is thus essential. There is therefore strong Government commitment, which has been utterly ignored by PCTs.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51103-36_para11">
<a name="stpa_282">As for adult palliative care commitments by the Government, in the Labour election manifesto we gave a commitment to increase funding for palliative care, but that does not extend to children. We have the perverse situation at the moment whereby a 17-year-old with cancer is not deemed suitable to fund, whereas an adult is. Can we really be in a position to say that a child under 18 cannot be funded to die with all the support that a hospice can give, whereas a young person over 18 can have funded support? Does the Minister not agree that our manifesto commitment should cover children as well as adults?
</p>

<p>
<a name="51103-36_para12">
<a name="stpa_283">I am not, as the Minister might think, standing here asking for unlimited funding for all children&#039;s hospices, despite the Government recognising that there is no upper limit on the money that could be available, but I am standing here asking for fairness. It is quite simply shameful that PCTs can decide who to talk to and who to fund, and yet pay no heed either to what the Government are asking them to do with taxpayers&#039; money, or to those taxpayers themselves.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51103-36_para13">
<a name="stpa_284">The Government have previously said that they cannot blanket fund all the costs of running children&#039;s hospices. But, again, that is not what I am asking for. The cost of running all the services, using my example of Treetops, is around &#163;4,000 a day, a figure that I believe is comparable across the country, and yet the cost of medical care for each child is just &#163;240 a night. Is it really too much to ask the NHS to pay for medical care? Is not that part of its remit?
</p>

<p>
<a name="51103-36_para14">
<a name="stpa_285">In some parts of the country, PCTs are at least going some way towards meeting their obligations to the communities that they serve by providing up to 10 per cent. of running costs for some hospices. But I am looking for a directive from the Government to primary care trusts, not asking them to perhaps think about it and if they cannot be bothered even to reply to letters, not to worry, but ordering them to instigate a process whereby PCTs must passport the medical costs of children using hospices to the hospice in question.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51103-36_para15">
<a name="stpa_286">To return to Treetops, let us take the example of a wonderful little girl who was telling me recently all about her visit to see &quot;Disney on Ice&quot;. If she chooses, with her parents, to go to a hospice for respite care, the cost of the medical element should be met by the PCT covering the area where she lives. It does not need to be complicated; it just needs to happen. Where is the NHS free at the point of need for our children?
</p>

<p>
<a name="51103-36_para16">
<a name="stpa_287">I urge the Government, through the Minister, first to widen the scope of additional palliative care funding to include children; secondly, to put in place a process that will force PCTs to engage properly with children&#039;s hospices in accordance with the national service framework; and thirdly, to put in place a process that forces PCTs to commission properly children&#039;s hospice services in a manner that passports the funding for medical care.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51103-36_para17">
<a name="stpa_288">Before I close, I again pay tribute to everybody within the children&#039;s hospice movement and the caring public who support them.

<p><a name="st_517"><a name="51103-37_spmin0"><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Health  (Mr. Liam Byrne): </b> 
 I am grateful to my hon.   Friend the Member for Stoke-on-Trent, South (Mr. Flello) for instigating today&#039;s debate. I must congratulate him on his focus upon the work of children&#039;s hospices&#151;hospices that make such a difference to the lives of his constituents. I am shortly to visit his constituency, and I am looking forward to meeting some of the people about whom he spoke tonight. In particular, I congratulate him on his work with the Donna Louise trust&#039;s Treetops children&#039;s hospice, based in his constituency, and congratulate him too on his work to launch its Funding for Life campaign. Other hon. Members will have an equal interest in their own children&#039;s hospice and will want to hear what the Government have been doing to ensure that these and other support services grow and thrive.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51103-37_para0">
<a name="stpa_289">If the House will permit me, I should like first to set out the seven steps that the Government have taken since 1997 to weave a web of care around the protection and care of children. Since 1997, there has been a transformation in the understanding of the needs of children with life threatening illness and their families.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51103-37_para1">
<a name="stpa_290">Step one was the Department&#039;s immediate commendation of a report by the Association for Children with Life-Threatening or Terminal Conditions and their Families. That was closely followed by the second step, which was the NHS Executive guidance in 1998 which drew together the lessons learnt during a series of projects providing a range of care to families.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51103-37_para2">
<a name="stpa_291">Also in 1998, step three, a team headed by the Treasury invited applications to establish Diana children&#039;s community nursing teams throughout the country to build upon the work undertaken during the pilot project programme, and to blaze a trail for the development of home care for children with life-threatening illnesses. Additional funding of nearly &#163;1.5 million for England was provided by the Treasury enabling eight Diana children&#039;s community nursing teams to be introduced in England during 1999.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51103-37_para3">
<a name="stpa_292">Step four occurred in 1998, when the Association of Children&#039;s Hospices was registered as a charity to promote the interests of the children&#039;s hospice movement and to develop public awareness and support for children&#039;s hospices and paediatric palliative care. The Department of Health has worked closely with the association since then to develop a better understanding of the issues. In particular, it commissioned the association to provide a quality assurance package to enhance the quality of care provided by children&#039;s hospice services.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51103-37_para4">
<a name="stpa_293">Step five occurred in 2000, when we started discussion with the New Opportunities Fund, the Department for Culture, Media and Sports and voluntary organisations to promote palliative care services for children. That resulted in the 2003 NOF awards, in which more than &#163;45 million was awarded to 135 projects, including 71 awards to home-based palliative care teams.
</p>





<p><a name="st_518"><a name="51103-37_spnew0"><b> Adam Afriyie: </b> 
 I am delighted that this debate is taking place, because the mark of a civilised society is how we treat our children. The Minister has mentioned the New Opportunities Fund: will he make it perfectly clear that the moneys from the New Opportunities Fund have absolutely nothing to do with the Government and concern expenditure by lottery distribution funds?

<a name="51103-37_para5">
<a name="stpa_294">Furthermore, 39 awards were made to bereavement teams and 25 awards, totalling &#163;15 million, were made to children&#039;s hospices. Those projects are being assessed over a three-year period with a view to filling gaps in services and making children&#039;s palliative care provision far more mainstream.
</p>

<p>

<a name="stpa_295">Step six occurred in 2003, when the National Institute for Clinical Excellence commissioned the National Collaborating Centre for Cancer to develop service guidance on child and adolescent cancer services, including palliative care and bereavement support. NICE service guidance supports the implementation of the national cancer plan and forms an additional structure to provide for children&#039;s palliative care needs.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51103-37_para7">
<a name="stpa_296">Step seven involved work with the Association for   Children with Life-Threatening or Terminal Conditions. The Department of Health funded the production of and commended the ACT care pathway guidance, which was launched last year to complement the children&#039;s national service framework on disabled children and young people.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51103-37_para8">
<a name="stpa_297">As my hon. Friend has argued so eloquently, however, seven steps are not enough, and we can and must go much further. To identify how the Government can best support hospices, we must understand how hospices are started, how they work and how they provide the services that make such a difference. That difference is already being made in my hon. Friend&#039;s constituency, where I understand that Staffordshire Moorlands PCT hosts the children&#039;s community nursing team on behalf of all four PCTs in north Staffordshire. The provision of palliative care for children is implemented through a team that provides comprehensive packages of care through two respite workers who work closely with families, and a nursing team that has two part-time social care workers, one of whom is from the city council and one of whom is from the county council.
</p>





<p><a name="st_520"><a name="51103-37_spnew2"><b> Mr. Flello: </b> 
 I hear my hon. Friend the Minister&#039;s comments about the PCT&#039;s good work. Where was the collaboration?
</p>





<p><a name="st_521"><a name="51103-37_spnew3"><b> Mr. Byrne: </b> 
 I agree with my hon. Friend and will address that remark directly in a moment.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51103-37_para9">
<a name="stpa_298">Several key themes emerged from ACT&#039;s work. In particular, it highlighted the importance of positively influencing the planning and development of future hospices. The association&#039;s experience suggests that the desire to set up a hospice often comes from the tragic struggle of a particular family, which can generate enormous energy and a single-minded determination to see through an important dream. To help ensure that such energy is channelled in the right way, the Department can do a great deal more to support innovative services. Crucially&#151;this point lies at the heart of the debate&#151;we must ensure that such services are sustained in the long run once they have been started.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51103-37_para10">
<a name="stpa_299">To help those with ambitions to set up hospices, the Department has provided funding for ACT to develop a toolkit on how children&#039;s hospices work. The toolkit aims to provide references to the sources of information 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>3 Nov 2005 : Column 1080</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>that are required successfully to plan and establish a service, so that any new services can make more informed decisions about how a venture should look. The toolkit will provide a far better understanding of what is involved in starting and running a children&#039;s hospice service and an overview of the challenges and pitfalls that such a project may involve.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51103-37_para11">
<a name="stpa_300">Most importantly, the toolkit will emphasise the importance of consultation at the beginning of the process. It will also emphasise that children often need different sorts of services, particularly hospice-at-home services. ACT has commented that although establishing a hospice-at-home service is not an easy task, it is often possible to get it up and running far more quickly. Moreover, it can provide a more flexible option by responding to changes in families&#039; needs and expanding or reducing in response to other external factors. Day care and hospice-at-home services should not be viewed as second-class options.

 I appreciate all the work that is being done to assist with new hospices. However, I am concerned about current funding for hospices that are jumping through all the hoops. They are being assessed by the National Care Standards Commission and providing exemplary care, but they are struggling. That is the biggest problem.

   I   congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Stoke-on-Trent, South on securing this important Adjournment debate. I am sure that he is aware that I have tabled early-day motions on the subject and had a similar Adjournment debate in the last Parliament. I am pleased to see the Minister in his place, because he replied to that debate as well.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51103-37_para12">
<a name="stpa_301">The crux of the problem is that children&#039;s hospices receive only about 7 per cent. of their funding from the NHS, whereas adult hospices receive about 33 per cent. of their funding from the NHS. It is unfair to compare adult hospices with children&#039;s hospices, as the Minister said in the previous debate and today. Nevertheless, the fact is that adult hospices generally have to deal with only one, two or three primary care trusts because they   generally represent one town&#151;for example, the St.   Peter&#039;s hospice in Barnsley and the Doncaster hospice&#151;while children&#039;s hospices can be covered by up to 33 PCTs. The onus should be on the PCT to contact the children&#039;s hospice to set up an agreement rather than the other way round.

<a name="51103-38_para0">
<a name="stpa_302">Let me cut immediately to what the Government should now do, because we can and must do more. At the heart of the concern of my hon. Friend the Member for Stoke-on-Trent, South is the way in which the local

<br>&nbsp;<br>NHS works together to put in place services that make a difference to children&#039;s lives. He says that those services must change, and I agree. I will shortly launch dedicated guidance for that purpose&#151;work that will build on and realise the intentions expressed in the national service framework for children and young people, which is mandatory on the NHS. That guidance for commissioners of palliative care is in the final stages of development, and I will ensure that the comments made by hon. Members are brought to the attention of the officials who are drafting it, which will be beneficial. The   guide will support health care organisations, local authorities and other partners, working together with them in children&#039;s trusts to understand and develop children&#039;s palliative care services and to apply the mandatory children&#039;s national service framework in its delivery.
</p>





<p><a name="st_528"><a name="51103-38_spnew1"><b> Mr. Flello: </b> 
 It would be beneficial for the Under-Secretary to see a children&#039;s hospice for himself. I invite him to Treetops to see the work that is done there so that, when he reads the paperwork that his civil servants prepare for him, he knows exactly what that means in practice.
</p>





<p><a name="st_529"><a name="51103-38_spnew2"><b> Mr. Byrne: </b> 
 I look forward to visiting my hon. Friend in his constituency.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51103-38_para1">
<a name="stpa_303">The guidance will set out a service model, describe the elements that should be present in the services that are   commissioned and give practical examples of approaches to providing children and young people with the services. It will detail the role that we expect commissioners to play in ensuring that they commission the right services in the right place at the right time.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51103-38_para2">
<a name="stpa_304">As my hon. Friend pointed out, the local NHS receives record funding. There is no ceiling on the money that it can give to children&#039;s hospices, but the   funding must be co-ordinated. Hospices must not be trapped in a paper chase or, worse, at the end of a telephone, with no reply. The NHS and the local children&#039;s hospice sector have asked for guidance on important matters, and I am pleased that we can assist them through the publication of the guide. On publication, I shall ensure that copies are placed in the Library.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51103-38_para3">
<a name="stpa_305">The second step that we must take is ensuring that specialist commissioning is much sharper. My noble Friend Lord Warner made a ministerial statement on Wednesday 19 October announcing a review of NHS specialist services. A new taskforce will be headed by Scotland&#039;s former chief medical officer to investigate how the NHS currently commissions specialist services and consider ways in which to tighten those commissioning arrangements so that there is much greater consistency throughout the NHS. I undertake to ensure that the review is alerted to the specific needs of children&#039;s hospices.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51103-38_para4">
<a name="stpa_306">I want briefly to consider resources. My hon. Friend spoke passionately about the need to extend to children our manifesto commitment to provide funding for end-of-life care for adults. With the agreement of my hon. Friend the Minister of State, Department of Health, the Member for Doncaster, Central (Ms Winterton), I   confirm that we will extend the pledge to care for children and young people with life-threatening conditions. I will make further announcements to the House as soon as possible.

Hospices make an invaluable contribution to the mix of services that children and young people who have life-threatening or life-limiting illnesses need. As well as providing financial resources to the NHS, we give guidance to the commissioners of services and to hospices through the Association of Children&#039;s Hospices toolkit.

That partnership has thrived and grown stronger over the past few years, and it will be very important as we set about putting record extra resources into the national health service, taking its total funding to about &#163;92 billion, and creating a national health service that reaches the parts of communities that we have not yet been able to reach. We look forward to a continued good working partnership with the children&#039;s hospice movement, and, with the support of hon. Members, I believe that we will achieve that.
