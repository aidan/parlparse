 We want every pensioner to claim the benefits to which they are entitled, which is why we are making it easier and more straightforward for them to do so. Pensioners can claim a number of benefits by making a telephone call, and the Department will then send them forms to fill in for council tax benefit. Some pensioners do not send those forms in, so, as from October, the process will be done automatically, obviating the need to send in forms. Pensioners will be covered for state pensions, pension credit, housing benefit and council tax benefit&#151;one telephone call for all benefits.</p>

 We have access to information, particularly on winter fuel payments, that covers large numbers of pensioners and gives us quite a lot of data on where they are. We work with Help the Aged, Age Concern, citizens advice bureaux, Community Service Volunteers and others to increase the take-up of benefits, and partnerships have been developed with local authorities, too. The aim is to develop joint working partnerships so that we can raise take-up across all the benefits. There are no official links  with the NHS as such&#151;we co-ordinate through Departments, but there are not official links locally.

Will he look urgently at that decision, because the group of men who would claim that benefit are elderly, and we need to ensure that those who are eligible can claim industrial injuries disablement benefit and, in addition, explore whether there is a full and final payment of compensation, similar to that paid to their underground colleagues?

 The Minister says that he wants to increase take-up and I welcome that, but the Budget tells a different story. If the Government were intending to get the benefits to every eligible pensioner, by 2010-11, an extra &#163;1.75 billion would have been allocated in the Budget. Instead, the Budget assumes no increase in take-up over the next three years. How is he getting on with persuading the Treasury that getting the benefits to the pensioners who are entitled to them is not poor value for money, as the Treasury seems to assume?</p>

 We certainly want to get benefits to all the pensioners who are entitled to them. That is one of the reasons why, just before Christmas, I announced the introduction of automaticity, which sounds complicated but basically means that with one phone call a person can obtain four different benefits.</p>

One of the problems that we have had in getting people on to pension credit is that we have written to pensioners&#151;in some cases, four or five times&#151;asking them to apply, and some have chosen not to do so. We cannot force them to apply; it is their decision. However, for those who apply, we can make it easier to get the benefits. That is why, from October, we will introduce the new system of automaticity, where those who get one benefit will get four.</p>

 We certainly want everyone who wishes to have a concessionary bus pass to take up that concession. We will rely on local authorities to promote the project. One of the issues is that local authorities in different areas have different start and finish times.

 Any measures to boost take-up of benefits are welcome and long overdue, but has the Minister made any estimate of the number of pensioners who are forced to use their winter fuel allowance to pay soaring council tax and utility bills and to pay for basic foodstuffs?

 On Budget day, we published &#147;Ending child poverty: everybody&#146;s business&#148;, reaffirming the Government&#146;s target of halving child poverty by 2010 and eradicating it by 2020. The measures announced in the Budget will invest an additional &#163;950 million and reduce child poverty by a further 250,000 children by 2010-11. Combined with announcements in last year&#146;s Budget and pre-Budget report, that means an extra 500,000 children will be lifted out of poverty.</p>

 My hon. Friend is right that this is a vital move towards making work pay, and I congratulate him on his campaigning on the issue. I believe that his early-day motion 1736 called for this last year, so he has clearly had a big influence on Government policy. It is a good thing that he has, because this measure, combined with others, means that 250,000 children will be lifted out of poverty. People will not have to apply for it&#151;it will happen automatically&#151;but we will ensure that they know that it, combined with other measures, means that work really does pay and that they can lift their family and children out of poverty.</p>

The benefit delivery centres do not have the same system but they are planning to introduce it, and it will be in place by this summer, so they will be able to implement the system of call management and queue-busting that I referred to in the answer I gave to my hon.

One of my constituents is being chased to go back to work, and he is 61. I think that it is a bit much.</p>

 Of course we want to provide more support for those who are in greatest need. My hon.

People who are in the support group of the employment and support allowance will be an extra &#163;16 a week better off.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Transport to make a statement on the problems occurring for passengers at Heathrow terminal 5 and the security measures in place at the terminal.</p>

<p><a name="st_o118"><a name="0803312000166"><a name="80331-0004.htm_spmin1"><a name="0803312000498"><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Transport (Jim Fitzpatrick):</b>
 I thank the hon. Member for Chipping Barnet (Mrs. Villiers) for providing the opportunity to make a statement on the problems occurring for passengers at Heathrow&#146;s terminal 5. The Secretary of State sends her apologies for being unable to respond to the question herself, but she is on a pre-arranged regional visit; I believe that the hon. Lady and the hon. Member for Lewes (Norman Baker) are aware of that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o7"><a name="80331-0004.htm_para0"><a name="0803312000167">Heathrow&#146;s new terminal 5 opened to the public on Thursday 27 March. The terminal is operated by BAA plc, but British Airways is the sole airline using it. On 27 March, BA moved to T5 the majority of its short haul operations, which accounts for about 400 flights per day and some 34,000 passengers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o8"><a name="80331-0004.htm_para1"><a name="0803312000168">The management of terminal 5 is an operational matter for British Airways and BAA, but that does not mean that the Government are not taking a keen interest in seeing that the difficulties T5 has faced since it opened last week are addressed and resolved as quickly as possible. On it first day in operation, T5&#146;s bespoke baggage system was affected by a number of issues. First, there were technical software problems, but more significantly BA&#146;s challenge was integrating teams of staff, and it has been addressing this as a priority.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o9"><a name="80331-0004.htm_para2"><a name="0803312000169">Since 27 March, the baggage system became clogged as more bags were checked in than were being placed on aircraft. On a number of occasions, the system has stopped functioning, which has led to planes taking off without some or all of their luggage. BA has had to cancel short haul flights to ease the pressure on the baggage system. By the end of the weekend, some 28,000 bags had been placed in temporary storage. BA drafted in 400 volunteers over the weekend to help sort those bags and estimates that it will take up to a week to get them back to their owners.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o10"><a name="80331-0004.htm_para3"><a name="0803312000170">The issue is mainly a problem for departing passengers. BA has advised that the incoming arrival bag times have been coming down steadily over the past few days and the average first bag time is now seven to eight minutes. That is as good, if not better, than for other Heathrow terminals.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o11"><a name="80331-0004.htm_para4"><a name="0803312000171">As the Secretary of State has made clear, we expect BA and BAA to work together to ensure that solutions are found and that there is as little disruption as possible to passengers. Department for Transport officials have been in touch with BA and BAA at a senior level throughout. The Secretary of State spoke to the chief executive of BA, Mr. Willie Walsh, and to Mr. Colin Matthews, chief executive of BAA, on Saturday, and I visited the airport on Sunday to see the situation at first hand.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o12"><a name="80331-0004.htm_para5"><a name="0803312000172">We have also been assisting BA, where appropriate given the necessity of maintaining effective security, in  <br>

optimising all its security screening options, to help it tackle the backlog of bags that have yet to be reunited with their owners.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o13"><a name="80331-0004.htm_para6"><a name="0803312000173">As our discussion document &#147;Towards a Sustainable Transport System&#148;, published last October, makes clear, we want a much greater emphasis on the needs of transport users. Passengers should expect airline and airport operators to deliver a good standard of service; so, although we recognise the considerable challenges in opening a major new terminal, we agree that it is extremely regrettable to say the least that passengers using T5 have had to suffer an unacceptably poor travel experience. Although I am convinced that T5 will ultimately prove to be a significant benefit to the passenger, there is no denying that delivery so far has fallen well short of expectations. What struck me on Sunday was just how devastated individual staff members were, from chief executives through to staff on the shop floor, that this had gone badly wrong. They were working hard to restore their own pride, as well as that of the operation, as was shown by, among other things, the number of volunteers who were helping.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o14"><a name="80331-0004.htm_para7"><a name="0803312000174">The important thing now is to put things right. BA&#146;s and BAA&#146;s focus must not be deflected from resolving the problems affecting T5 and ensuring that the passenger experience improves significantly as a matter of urgency. That includes ensuring that those passengers who have been affected by disruption receive, at the very least, the assistance and compensation to which they are legally entitled. It is in both BA&#146;s and BAA&#146;s interests to work effectively together to deliver the necessary improvement. The travelling public are not mainly interested in who is to blame for which particular failing, but rather in being treated properly when things go wrong and in seeing real progress towards the high standards of customer service to which both BA and BAA aspire. Once T5 is on track, we will press both operators to identify the lessons learned and to explain their plans for ensuring that good service standards are not only delivered but maintained.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o15"><a name="80331-0004.htm_para8"><a name="0803312000175">Before concluding, I must comment on security at T5. As one would expect, I am unable to go into detail on the specifics of issues raised in the last few days, but I would like to reassure the House that the Government enforce a sophisticated airport security regime, which delivers many layers of protection to the travelling public. The Department works closely with airport operators to ensure that standards are met, and officials have worked particularly intensively at Heathrow in recent weeks, given the opening of T5. That is normal in respect of security when a new terminal comes on line and helps to identify any areas that require improvement. The Department then works with the operator to ensure that swift action is taken to ensure that appropriate mitigation is in place. The process has been no different with T5. Let me assure you, and the House, Mr. Speaker, that aviation security is of the highest priority for the Government.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o16"><a name="80331-0004.htm_para9"><a name="0803312000176">In conclusion, we accept the reality of the problems facing passengers using T5, we are monitoring the situation very closely to encourage BA and BAA to address the issues and we stand ready to assist in any way if it is appropriate to do so.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o17"><a name="80331-0004.htm_para10"><a name="0803312000178">Since terminal 5 opened for business in the early hours of Thursday morning hundreds of flights have been cancelled, thousands of bags have been delayed or have gone missing, and thousands of passengers have suffered severe inconvenience and frustration. Both BA and BAA have let down their customers badly and, yet again, the state of Heathrow is a national embarrassment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o18"><a name="80331-0004.htm_para11"><a name="0803312000179">Even more worryingly, yesterday&#146;s newspapers reported that Department for Transport inspectors had managed to bypass security checks on nine occasions during trials of the terminal&#146;s new systems and that the terminal&#146;s alarm system was not working properly. Will the Minister tell us what tests were carried out in relation to T5&#146;s security systems in advance of the opening? Will he give us the results, including details on the number of times inspectors were able to bypass security checks? What steps were taken to remedy the problems revealed by the tests carried out? Were the tests re-run and, if so, what was the result? Is it true that the fingerprint checks were dropped shortly before the terminal&#146;s opening to switch to a photographic recognition system? It is hard to believe that there would have been enough time to test that system appropriately in the short time available.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o19"><a name="80331-0004.htm_para12"><a name="0803312000180">The Secretary of State said of T5 that &#147;this building exhausts superlatives.&#148; At the launch, she said:</p>

</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o21"><a name="80331-0004.htm_para14"><a name="0803312000182">Given the impact of the project on our image overseas, to what extent did she or the Minister challenge BAA and BA about the adequacy of their preparations before the opening of T5? Did the Secretary of State or her officials scrutinise the plans that those two companies had for the first week of operation of such a crucial project for our national interest? How confident is the Minister that the problems will be resolved by the time terminal 4 flights switch to the new terminal? Is he confident that BA and BAA have kept passengers adequately informed during the crisis and given the best advice on the right compensation? Is he sufficiently confident that BAA&#146;s renovation of Heathrow&#146;s other terminals will be completed on time? What steps are being taken to ensure that the problems of the past week will not recur when the terminals reopen?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o22"><a name="80331-0004.htm_para15"><a name="0803312000183">What steps are being taken to ensure that BAA and BA plan properly for the huge influx of passengers during the 2012 Olympics? A repeat of the fiasco of the last few days would be a disaster for the 2012 games and would leave the country a laughing stock around the world. Surely a company faced with real competition would be less likely to make basic and complacent mistakes such as leaving staff without an overflow car park facility on the most important day for Heathrow for a decade.</p>

with the break-up? Finally, will the events of the past few days give the Government any cause to reconsider whether BAA is capable of managing the project to construct the third runway and sixth terminal that the Government are dead-set on building regardless of whether crucial environmental questions are answered or not?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o24"><a name="80331-0004.htm_para17"><a name="0803312000185">How can the Minister or the Secretary of State possibly hold BAA to account effectively on all the critical questions that I have asked? How can they get tough on BAA&#146;s performance on T5 when the Department has actively colluded with the company to fiddle the figures on Heathrow expansion? The cosy relationship between the Labour establishment and BAA on a third runway is notorious and means that the Government cannot possibly be objective in judging BAA&#146;s lamentable performance during the opening of terminal 5.</p>

 The hon. Lady has asked a series of questions and I shall try to respond to as many as I can. First, I rebut the allegation of collusion. The consultation that the Department recently concluded in respect of the expansion of Heathrow was based on the 2003 White Paper that followed years of examination of whether we could meet the strict environmental standards that we laid down on noise, emissions and access. We were confident that those standards could be met and that is contained in the consultation documentation&#151;the matter is out for consultation. Of course, the hon. Lady will have the opportunity to discuss the issues on Wednesday afternoon, when the Liberal Democrats have a half-day Opposition debate on Heathrow. I suspect that we will deal with the issues in more detail then.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o25"><a name="80331-0004.htm_para18"><a name="0803312000187">On the issue of fingerprint checks, they were not dropped as a matter of security, but there were questions about the system&#146;s efficacy and BAA decided not to proceed with it at that time. That was not a matter for the Department for Transport or for TRANSEC. On the question of scrutinising the plans, we had no reason to believe that the plans for T5 would not work. The building&#151;I believe that we all monitored its progress over recent years&#151;is an exemplary example of British engineering, architecture and construction. It is a magnificent structure. Officials of the Department for Transport, BAA and BA are always in regular contact and we had no reason to believe that it would not work. We were confident about that and we were sure that the terminal would operate effectively.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o26"><a name="80331-0004.htm_para19"><a name="0803312000188">This has been a great disappointment. As the hon. Lady said, national pride has been dented. Her Majesty opened T5 to national fanfare and delight in early March. The following week, when the A380 arrived for its first flight, many of us believed that Heathrow had turned a corner and that the bad publicity of recent years would turn into positive publicity, notwithstanding the importance of scrutiny as regards the expansion. Clearly, that was not the case.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o27"><a name="80331-0004.htm_para20"><a name="0803312000189">The hon. Lady asked about compensation. The European Union denied boarding and cancellation regulations set out an airline&#146;s responsibilities to passengers in the event of long delays on departure or the cancellation of flights. It is the responsibility of British Airways to comply with that regulation with  <br>

regard to the delays and cancellations experienced at terminal 5 in the past few days. From our discussions with the airline, it is clear that it is aware of its responsibilities under those regulations, and is endeavouring to comply with them. The Civil Aviation Authority is monitoring the situation to ensure that that happens.</p>

Incidents such as what has happened at T5 serve only to reinforce our resolve to ensure that we redouble our efforts and that the 2012 Olympics are a huge success.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o29"><a name="80331-0004.htm_para22"><a name="0803312000191">I believe that ultimately, and within a short period, terminal 5 will be a source of great national pride.

 Will the Minister join me in congratulating my constituents who work at Heathrow, who, despite the job cuts in recent years and despite BAA trying to attack their pension fund before Christmas, nevertheless loyally turned out in large numbers, many of them volunteers, to help the travelling public? May I ask him to start thinking again about the future expansion of Heathrow, given the grotesque incompetence of BAA in managing the terminal 5 project in recent weeks and given that all the Government&#146;s policies have been based upon the advice of BAA?</p>

 I am very happy to acknowledge the role of all those working at Heathrow, who have tried to put the situation right. As I said earlier, one thing that struck me in speaking to staff members at all levels within BA and BAA was the damage to their self-esteem, and the fact that they were taking it personally that the systems had failed them. They were working extremely hard to try to correct the situation, as was evidenced by the number who volunteered to come in and do so.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o30"><a name="80331-0004.htm_para23"><a name="0803312000194">The role of BAA in the consultation exercise was that it advised and supplied information. We set out in the 2003 White Paper that, for the economic interests of UK plc, we needed to increase the capacity at Heathrow, and that BAA had a role to play in that exercise.

I hear what the hon. Gentleman says about the British Airways website. I am sure the company heard it too and is no doubt correcting the website at the moment. I shall not criticise BA for that being the last thing it is paying attention to, because the company is trying to make sure that the operation at T5 is corrected and improved to serve passengers.

Notwithstanding the efforts and endeavours of front-line staff, to whom I paid tribute, both when I replied to my hon. Friend the Member for Hayes and Harlington (John McDonnell) and in my opening remarks, senior managers are working hard. When I was at Heathrow, I met Colin Matthews, Gareth Kirkwood and Mark Bullock, who had been working extended hours with ordinary staff members. They are responsible&#151;they are the management&#151;and were expected to be there, but they were working shoulder to shoulder with their colleagues, including volunteers, doing everything they could to put the situation right.

I must have been the first wheelchair passenger to enter the lift that takes passengers from to the gate down to the side of the plane.

Members have said, Heathrow is absolutely pivotal to the UK&#146;s economy. It is our major international hub and the gateway through which many of our business partners travel. If Heathrow is not functioning, the UK suffers. That is why we are committed to expanding at Heathrow; operating at 98.5 to 99 per cent. capacity is just untenable. I fully accept the hon. Gentleman&#146;s criticism. The Prime Minister is personally involved, to make sure that the matters are addressed as quickly as possible. Furthermore, as I outlined previously, my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State has also been involved.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o52"><a name="80331-0006.htm_para1"><a name="0803312000240">On the question of the Heathrow consultation, I should like to clarify that although, as I have said, we are confident of the analysis in the consultation document, no decisions have been made. The responses are being analysed and will inform final policy decisions. That is exactly what we have been saying since the consultation process started. The analysis is ongoing. We will report back to the House in due course, once the analysis has taken place. We hope to report by the summer, because Heathrow is far too important to Britain.</p>

 I have listened to my hon. Friend&#146;s responses to the points raised by Members from Scottish constituencies, but there is a more serious issue in relation to some of the northern English airports. There is no competition between Newcastle and Heathrow. Air travel is vital for the economy nationally and even more vital for our regional economy. Can we have some competition, or better regulation, to ensure that flights between Heathrow and Newcastle are not disproportionately affected? At the moment, any time there is a problem, as with Aberdeen, Edinburgh, Glasgow and, sometimes, Manchester, Newcastle flights are cancelled or badly delayed.</p>

 I wonder whether the Minister recognises that the shambolic opening of T5 is just the latest in a series of operational mismanagement experiences from BAA and BA and other members of the aviation industry. In the past, they have used the excuse that lack of runway capacity has caused trouble at Heathrow. Does he recognise  that it is time to be less gullible and not to take those statements, or the information that has been provided to him by the industry, at face value, and to  understand that that is not the cause of the problem and that the whole expansion project needs to be thought through again?</p>

 On a point of order, Mr. Speaker. I am conscious, as is the whole House, that you are extremely vigilant in seeking to protect the interests of the House to ensure that important announcements made by Ministers are made first of all to the House rather than to the media. This morning, the Ministry of Defence announced by way of a written ministerial statement that it has signed a contract with a consortium called AirTanker for the future strategic tanker aircraft. That contract was foreshadowed in 1997 as the largest private finance initiative the Ministry of Defence has produced, worth something like &#163;13,000 million.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o55"><a name="80331-0006.htm_para4"><a name="0803312000255">The MOD announced in February 2005 that it had selected AirTanker as the preferred bidder, yet it was only today that it issued a written ministerial statement. In fact, there was a press conference to tell the press all about the matter at 2 o&#146;clock last Thursday. I wonder whether you could advise me on what I might do, Mr. Speaker. I learned that there was to be such a press conference at 1 o&#146;clock when I was attending a conference organised by the Society of British Aerospace Companies. I asked my office to check with the Ministry of Defence, and the noble Baroness Taylor sent me a letter, in which she said:</p>
<a name="80331-0006.htm_brev0"><a name="0803312000349"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Due to the rapid pace of the final stages in closing this complex commercial and financial deal, it has not been possible to follow the normal parliamentary protocols in making this announcement.&#148;</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o56"><a name="80331-0006.htm_para5"><a name="0803312000256">However, the fact is that not only has this process been in gestation for 10 years, but the company concerned, Thales, produced a draft press release last Wednesday, in which there was a reference to the Secretary of State for Defence&#151;</p>

 On a point of order, Mr. Speaker. I believe that we are just about to move on to the housing legislation. I seek your guidance on what we might be able to do to extend the amount of time we have to debate it. Currently, given the limitations of time and the enormous number of amendments that have been submitted, we have 73 seconds per amendment.

 I heard exactly what you said, Mr. Speaker, but further to the point raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Montgomeryshire (Lembit &#214;pik), you were in the Chair when the Leader of the House said twice that, when significant numbers of Government new clauses and amendments were put forward on Report, she would look at whether there could be injury time, as it were. She repeated that last Thursday. I think that I am right in saying that there are 18 Government new clauses and 18 Opposition new clauses, but more Government amendments than Opposition ones. Have you had any indication, Mr. Speaker, that the Leader of the House is willing to come back to the House today, and would you allow her to come back as soon as possible to make a statement about proposed changes so that we do not have such a nonsensical procedural mess again?</p>

It is general Government policy that such transfers should be tax-neutral&#151;the transfers should not give rise to a gain or a loss. The new bodies should be entitled to any tax reliefs and allowances that applied to their predecessors immediately before the change.

We agreed to bring forward a number of things&#151;I will talk in a moment about the importance of tolerated trespassers&#151;and have tabled a number of minor technical amendments relating to the Committee&#146;s scrutiny and deliberations. I should also like to give the House notice of a significant series of amendments and a new clause&#151;new clause 27&#151;regarding the standards, the direction and the relationship between the Secretary of State, Oftenant and registered providers in the regulatory framework.

 I hope that you will bear with me, Mr. Speaker, while I make my final procedural point about the timing. The Minister must accept that we have a ludicrously short time in which to discuss an enormous number of amendments, as I am sure the spokesperson for the official Opposition agrees. Can the Minister therefore give us an assurance that, should we run out of time, he will not only meet us proactively to see what we can do to put things right in the Lords, but act informally to get feedback from all the many housing-associated organisations, which are extremely frustrated at not  <br>

 I reiterate the point that I have already made: we are not amending major parts of the Bill out of the blue. Many of the amendments are technical and complex, but the Bill has been through the Committee stage, which is important. I want to be as brief as possible, to give other right hon. and hon. Members time to speak, but let me first make the point again that the Bill has been through the Public Bill Committee stage. There was tremendously detailed clause-by-clause scrutiny, and I am satisfied that it is in a better state on Report, thanks to the deliberations of right hon. and hon. Members, than it was when it first started on 10 January.</p>

 I am grateful to the Minister for generously giving way. New clause 11 refers to the &#147;status of existing occupiers&#148;. Can he explain exactly how those occupiers will be protected when tenants have voted to stay with the council, rather than going with a housing association? How will those occupiers ensure that the finances are in place for the council to continue to maintain their properties properly, achieve the decent homes standard and deliver additional social housing units where they are needed, in constituencies such as Mr. Speaker&#146;s and mine?</p>

 Those are two important questions. On the first, there was detailed&#151;forensic, I would say&#151;scrutiny of the Bill in the Public Bill Committee, thanks to the hon. Member for Montgomeryshire, who played a sterling role. Despite taking to the field late in the day, he did an excellent job. In conjunction with the detailed and, importantly, forensic scrutiny of the Bill, there was an element of consensus in certain key areas, too, such as sustainable development, with regard to the Homes and Communities Agency, on which the hon. Gentleman tabled an amendment. He has tabled another amendment today&#151;off the top of my head, I think it is amendment No. 229&#151;which will become irrelevant, because we are bringing forward something else.</p>

 I am extremely grateful to my hon. Friend for those kind remarks, and may I return the compliment by saying that I, for one, am extremely pleased that a significant number of Government amendments have been tabled today that build on issues raised by hon. Members in all parts of the House in Committee? The hon. Member for North Southwark and Bermondsey (Simon Hughes) knows perfectly well that Opposition amendments are rarely accepted, because the way in which many of them are drafted makes it impractical to incorporate them in a Bill. He has been in the House long enough to know that the reality is that the key test is whether the Government respond positively to issues that have been raised, where there is a case for change, and I congratulate my hon.

 I am grateful for that contribution. My right hon. Friend makes the point well that we have been a listening Government when it comes to the Housing and Regeneration Bill. There were major concerns, particularly with regard to the regulatory framework. Accusations were made, and I hope to deal with that subject at length later in our proceedings&#151;if I stop taking interventions, that is. The point was made that there are major concerns about the regulatory framework. There were accusations that the Secretary of State could policy-passport matters for registered providers, that there was no freedom as regards the corporate direction of the boards of registered social landlords, and that there could be micro-management on the part of the Secretary of State. We have listened and we have learned, and I pay tribute to my right hon. Friend for helping to make that happen.</p>

 I am going to help the Minister to move on. I agree that the Government seem to have listened to some of the discussions that took place in Committee. I give credit to the Minister, who is a pleasure to work with because he does not always follow the line that is given at the beginning of a debate. However, in view of the terrible squeeze on our time, will he assist us by highlighting the interrelationship between the amendments tabled by me, by Conservative Front Benchers and by others, and the Government amendments? That would help us to see where the Government have adopted our thinking, and might avoid the need for us to argue a case for amendments that the Minister genuinely believes the Government have embraced in spirit&#151;if not in terms of the exact wording&#151;in their own amendments.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o88"><a name="80331-0008.htm_para1"><a name="0803312000324">The new clauses and amendments deal with the tolerated trespasser doctrine. They will resolve the problem for existing tolerated trespassers, and will ensure that no tolerated trespassers are created in future. The changes will apply to secure, assured, introductory and demoted tenancies. The new clauses and amendments were tabled following a commitment that I gave in Committee, and in response to concerns expressed by Members in all parts of the Committee&#151;I say that particularly to the hon. Member for Montgomeryshire&#151;and by stakeholders.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o89"><a name="80331-0008.htm_para2"><a name="0803312000325">An important group of amendments centres on Government new clause 12, which will allow all affordable housing providers, not just housing associations, to offer shared ownership properties for sale without the risk of so-called early enfranchisement, in which the sharing owner acquires the freehold of the property before he or she has acquired 100 per cent. of the equitable interest in the house under the terms of the shared ownership lease. Let me emphasise again to the hon. Member for Montgomeryshire that Members of all parties made points about affordable housing, the principles of shared ownership and, in particular, rural areas. To be fair to the hon. Gentleman and his party, I know that that last issue concerns the Liberal Democrats greatly.</p>

Amendments Nos. 32 to 39 will help to ensure that all shared ownership properties, irrespective of the provider, can be retained for future purchasers in protected areas. As I have already hinted, I am thinking especially of rural areas where replacement has proved difficult and where we need to do more to retain and replenish the stock.</p>

I risk incurring, at an early stage, the wrath of my hon. Friend the Member for Great Grimsby (Mr. Mitchell): I am ashamed to admit that I am a chartered accountant. I know how much my hon.

 In response to what the Minister said at the beginning of his speech, may I say that it might have been politic if he had briefly apologised to the House for waiting until almost the last minute before tabling 37 pages of amendments? The Bill had an unusually long lapse of time&#151;eight weeks&#151;between Committee and Report. Waiting right until the end before tabling 37 pages of amendments and then writing to members of the Committee an eight-page letter, which I received only today, does not give us enough time to consult the organisations that have an interest in the Bill. When the Minister replies to this group of amendments and new clauses, I hope he will find it within himself to apologise for any discourtesy. I raised this matter at business questions, and the Leader of the House promised to pass on to the Secretary of State my message that the first speech from the Government side should include an apology for this cavalier treatment of the House. I hope that the Minister can do that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o93"><a name="80331-0008.htm_para6"><a name="0803312000330">We had a harmonious and constructive Public Bill Committee stage, but I am slightly worried that we may not be able to give the same degree of scrutiny to the Government new clauses before us this afternoon as we did to similar proposals in Committee.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o94"><a name="80331-0008.htm_para7"><a name="0803312000331">I have a particular interest in new clause 9, which I tabled. It deals with ground 8 possession action for rent arrears in housing benefit. If the Minister had been looking for an issue on which to do some bridge building, my new clause would have provided the basis for doing so. When I moved what was then new clause 12 in Committee, I received support from the right hon. Member for Greenwich and Woolwich (Mr. Raynsford) and from the hon. Members for Luton, South (Margaret Moran) and for Edmonton (Mr. Love). All who spoke in that Committee debate were concerned about the use of ground 8.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o95"><a name="80331-0008.htm_para8"><a name="0803312000332">In a nutshell, ground 8 means that a court has no discretion whatever and has to give possession if the rent is in arrears for more than two months. The new clause I then proposed sought to exempt social landlords from that obligation and to give the court discretion not to award possession where, for example, the reason for the arrears was the local authority&#146;s failure to pay the housing benefit. I thought that I made a powerful case, and, indeed, when the Minister replied in Committee, he opened his remarks by saying:</p>

It was only when I managed to encourage the appropriate body language from him&#151;as can be seen in column 469, when I asked him to &#147;have another look&#148; at the issue on Report&#151;that I decided not to press the matter to a Division.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o97"><a name="80331-0008.htm_para10"><a name="0803312000334">In the meantime, the Minister kindly wrote to me on 19 March about ground 8 possession for rent arrears, but I have to say that I was not wholly reassured by what he said. Rejecting ground 8 amendments, he said:</p>
<a name="80331-0008.htm_brev1"><a name="0803312000354"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;However, it is also clear that these concerns are based on a very limited and predominately anecdotal evidence base.&#148;</p>

Towards the end of his letter, the Minister appears to concede the case, saying:</p>
<a name="80331-0008.htm_brev2"><a name="0803312000355"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;However, concerns appear to remain over the actions of a small minority of RSLs and I am keen to see that these are resolved.&#148;</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o99"><a name="80331-0008.htm_para12"><a name="0803312000336">Well, so am I, and the way to resolve them is to accept new clause 9, which gives the courts discretion not to award possession. Let me remind the Minister that Lord Justice Dyson said of the current position:</p>
<a name="80331-0008.htm_brev3"><a name="0803312000356"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;We acknowledge that this conclusion will lead to tenants who are in receipt of housing benefit having no defence to a claim for possession in circumstances where they are not at fault.

</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o100"><a name="80331-0008.htm_para13"><a name="0803312000337">The Minister will know that Scotland has already changed its law. Section 12 of the Homelessness etc. (Scotland) Act 2003 amends ground 8 to give courts discretion in rent arrears cases when housing benefit issues are outstanding. The Law Commission recommended in its April 2006 report &#147;Renting Homes: The Final Report&#148; that ground 8 should be abolished. The Minister has made other amendments to the law on repossession&#151;I think he has amended ground 1&#151;but he has not amended ground 8. I hope, however, that even at this late stage he will think again and see whether he cannot do in England what has already been done in Scotland and prevent the tenants of social landlords from being evicted when, through no fault of their own, they are in rent arrears because the local authority has not paid their housing benefit on time.</p>

 I have a great deal of sympathy with what the right hon. Member for North-West Hampshire (Sir George Young) said about new clause 9, but I want to speak specifically to new clause 8, which is not entirely unrelated and which goes to the heart of the Government&#146;s policy on council housing.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o101"><a name="80331-0008.htm_para14"><a name="08033113000087">There are three drivers behind new clause 8. First, the demand for social and affordable housing in the country at present far exceeds what could be accommodated by the Government&#146;s present plans for the sector. Secondly, it is unrealistic to rely on the private sector to provide decent, secure homes that people on lower incomes need at prices that they can afford; nor, unfortunately, is there evidence&#151;quite the contrary&#151;that housing associations are rising to the challenge to fill the gap. Thirdly, the funding for local  <br>

authorities to maintain and repair their existing stock, let alone to build the new homes that are so desperately needed, is grossly inadequate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o102"><a name="80331-0008.htm_para15"><a name="08033113000088">On the first point, the Government say that they propose to increase the number of houses built per year from 200,000 to 240,000, to reach a total, which we have heard so many times, of 3 million by 2020. But the current baseline, of course, is not 200,000; it is actually about 170,000. That figure is likely to fall, sadly, for a number of years ahead, because of the sub-prime market disaster gradually deepening and the credit crunch. The number of specifically social and affordable houses needed is estimated by Shelter to be over 50 per cent. higher than under the Government&#146;s current spending plans and more than 100 per cent. by Alan Holmans, who is a very respected housing economist, if the backlog of housing need is to be met within a reasonable period, which I am sure that all Members on both sides of the House would wish.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o103"><a name="80331-0008.htm_para16"><a name="08033113000089">On the second point, there is no way that the private sector in the current economic climate will be remotely able to fill the gap; nor, indeed, is it very wise for it to try to do so anyway. According to a parliamentary answer that I received in November, more than 200,000 households have already taken out mortgages with a house price to income ratio in excess of six to one, including 38,000 with a ratio in excess of 10 to one. That is clearly unsustainable. We are already in great danger of generating our own sub-prime market disaster, too&#151;not just in the US&#151;and we certainly do not want to make things any worse.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o104"><a name="80331-0008.htm_para17"><a name="08033113000090">The passion for private ownership, which I find very difficult to understand but with which the Government seem to be obsessed just as much as the previous Tory Government were, is absolutely fine for people who can afford it&#151;probably all hon. Members own their own house&#151;but it is not shared by the majority of people on low incomes at the bottom end of the scale. Probably a fifth of the population, or something of that order, have such low incomes and such uncertain employment prospects that they will never be able, under present circumstances, to afford to buy and maintain a home. For them, what is clearly needed is good quality, secure public housing at rents that they can genuinely afford. That is the issue at the heart of the Bill. Indeed, that is the message that, given current housing demand, people are crying out for the Government to hear.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o105"><a name="80331-0008.htm_para18"><a name="08033113000091">In 2006, 1.6 million households were on council waiting lists. I have not seen later figures, but I suspect that today the number is nearer 2 million. Indeed, 12,000 are currently on the council waiting lists in my Oldham constituency, yet the total council housing stock in Oldham is today only about 12,500, down from 27,000 some 20 years ago. In addition, across the country almost 100,000 households are homeless and in temporary accommodation, according to a technical view of homelessness.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o106"><a name="80331-0008.htm_para19"><a name="08033113000092">Let me turn to a key issue by relating a remarkable fact. There can be no clearer indication that the demand for council housing is both very strong and growing despite the pressure-cooker conditions that now prevail in terms of public rented housing, than that 2.5 million existing council tenants have opted to remain with their council even though the Government   <br>

<p><a name="st_o197"><a name="08033113000093"><a name="80331-0008.htm_spnew4"><a name="08033113000240"><b>Simon Hughes:</b>
 Does the right hon. Gentleman accept that some councils have supported their tenants in remaining council tenants not at arm&#146;s length or in any other such way, but as ordinary, straightforward, traditional council tenants? In my borough, all four parties on the council support that view. Some councils still resist Government attempts at bribing and blandishment to force them to have an arrangement that the tenants and all their elected representatives do not want.</p>

<p><a name="st_o198"><a name="08033113000094"><a name="80331-0008.htm_spnew5"><a name="08033113000241"><b>Mr. Meacher:</b>
 I fully accept that, and it is the background to the point I am about to make. Given the huge and swelling extent of unmet housing need, it is crucial that the funding of public rented housing&#151;in particular the levels of management and maintenance allowance and the major repair allowance&#151;is wholly adequate. It clearly is not at present. A new Government report out this month, &#147;Self-financing of council housing services: summary of findings of a modelling exercise&#148;, astonishingly states that current allowances undercut</p>
<a name="80331-0008.htm_brev4"><a name="08033113000158"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;basic investment needs by 43 per cent. over 30 years&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o107"><a name="80331-0008.htm_para20"><a name="08033113000095">Coming from an official Government report, that is a staggering statement: the funding provided for council housing is little more than half of what is needed&#151;that is official.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o108"><a name="80331-0008.htm_para21"><a name="08033113000096">The report was published by the Department for Communities and Local Government, and it also states that</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o110"><a name="80331-0008.htm_para23"><a name="08033113000098">That is also a remarkable statement. This shortfall in allowances is what is driving councils to privatise their homes in defiance of the wishes of their tenants&#151;and against the wishes of most of the councillors as well. It also means that many local authorities cannot meet the Government&#146;s decent housing standard, and that many who can at present will be unable to sustain the standard in the longer term.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o111"><a name="80331-0008.htm_para24"><a name="08033113000099">Other amendments in the group, notably new clause 1, protest at the bullying and blackmailing of tenants into stock transfer by some councils&#151;and by quite a lot of landlords&#151;but that will continue to happen unless the basic management allowances are substantially raised along the lines set out in new clause 8. That is my basic case.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o112"><a name="80331-0008.htm_para25"><a name="08033113000100">Perversely, the net funding trail is going in the opposite direction. Council rents are rising faster in order to close the gap on private rents in the locality. Ideologically, that turns the whole purpose of council housing on its head. Council rents are even rising higher than expenditure, so that tenants are paying what amounts to a tax to the Treasury, which works out at some &#163;180 million this year&#151;a parliamentary answer of 18 December last year even suggested that the figure could rise to &#163;900 million a year by 2022.

council housing revenue accounts, ostensibly to pay back historical debt. That, again, is odd because tenants do not own the stock and it is difficult to see why they should be burdened with having to service the debt.</p>

A further 10,000 people in my constituency have bought under the right to buy and are leaseholders of the council, so they, too, have a council interest.

It is not justifiable not to have a level playing field whereby the money put in can be put back into the housing stock for which it is raised. Where the tested democratic wishes of the tenants, plus their elected representatives, want council housing to continue, the Government cannot have it both ways&#151;they cannot say that they believe in the devolution of decision making and then force other outcomes and fiddle the financing to make things much more difficult, as the right hon.

The Liberal Democrats are the majority party in the joint administration, but that is the view of all four parties with elected representatives on the council&#151;the Liberal Democrats, the Labour party, the Conservative party and the Green party.</p>

It was built by a very eminent MP, Dr. Salter, who was originally a Liberal and then a member of the independent Labour party, and his colleagues in Wilson grove in Bermondsey. It is still there. People want to live in it. It is decent housing, built in the 1920s. Many other places followed that tradition&#151;it is a 20th-century version of the social housing tradition set by some housing associations, of which we are very proud.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o120"><a name="80331-0009.htm_para1"><a name="08033113000109">The Government seem to believe that the only happy council tenants live in council estates where every other resident is not a council tenant. That has never been my experience. People are happy to live next to other council tenants. If the management is good, they do not insist that the person next door is an owner-occupier or the tenant of a social landlord or housing association. They are happy that the other people are council tenants as long as the management is good. If management is good, council tenancies are often more popular. People would often rather be a council tenant than a tenant of a housing association, because councils are often much more accountable to their tenants. At least with councils, tenants can kick out the management every four years.</p>

For years, the tenants of Guinness Trust properties in my constituency&#151;one near London Bridge and Guy&#146;s hospital at Snowfields, one off the Old Kent road at Pages walk, and one in Kennington&#151;have felt that the service has been lousy and unresponsive. The chief executive comes to meetings. He is a nice man and he makes lots of promises, but he does not deliver on them. The same applies to the Peabody Trust, which is also based in my constituency. It is a good organisation, but often has not delivered. Housing associations, particularly the bigger ones, often fail. That is why council housing is a good thing. I would hope that a Labour Government would share that view.</p>

The Minister and his advisers will notice that they are familiar. That is because they feature in my Leasehold Reform Bill, which was number 14 in the ballot for private Members&#146; Bills and got off the runway a few weeks ago, when I was able to start Second Reading. If the Minister is not willing to buy these provisions&#151;if I cannot incorporate them into this Bill&#151;I hope that by the end of the next few weeks he will agree to either this wording or some other wording so that my Bill can become law as a complement to this Bill.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o123"><a name="80331-0009.htm_para4"><a name="08033113000112">New clause 29 is simple. It would allow local authorities to set up sinking funds. Councils used to have sinking funds, but they were abolished following a court case. Effectively, we will never again have a communal sinking fund, for all sorts of reasons with  <br>

which I need not trouble the House. Such a fund is a bit like a piggy bank. People often prefer to put in money up front against the rainy day when they will have to pay money for capital works. The new clause would allow councils to set up sinking funds that were specific to a property. That would mean that the leaseholder could put some money aside so that there was some money in the kitty five years later, when the roof had to be done or the lifts had to be replaced. The provision would be discretionary&#151;the leaseholder would not have to put money into the sinking fund&#151;but it would clarify the uncertainty of the legal provision. Such a provision would be widely welcomed&#151;I have consulted widely on that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o124"><a name="80331-0009.htm_para5"><a name="08033113000113">More important is new clause 31, which would fundamentally change for the better the way in which leaseholders are consulted about works on their estates. Most leaseholders in North Southwark and Bermondsey are on estates. The Government tell the council that it has to comply with the decent home standard by 2010, and the council says, &#147;Yes, Government. We are happy to do that.&#148; The date might slip a bit to 2011 due to the debate about the money. However, the implication is that although the tenant gets the work done at no significant extra cost as it is paid for by the housing revenue account, the leaseholder is billed for the work. They are not against it, but the bill can be very expensive. You may know, Mr. Deputy Speaker, although I do not know what the situation is in your constituency, that the bill for capital works can be as high as &#163;27,000. That can come out of the blue to a pensioner couple with no reserves. The new clause would ensure that the residents and the leaseholders were involved at all stages of the process.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o125"><a name="80331-0009.htm_para6"><a name="08033113000114">Proposed subsection (2), for example, would require consultation by the landlord, the council, with the leaseholders&#151;they are confusingly called &#147;tenants&#148; in the Bill and the Landlord and Tenant Act 1985, which the new clause would amend&#151;on specifications for any tenders. It would also allow tenants, or a tenants and residents association, to have a counter-proposal considered by the local authority if they were to get support from 25 per cent. of their total number. The council might say, &#147;We are going to replace all the windows and doors in your tower block.&#148; If there were support for a counter-proposal that actually the windows did not need to be replaced, just the doors, it would have to be put as an alternative in a ballot. If the counter-proposal were supported by 25 per cent. of the tenants or more, such a ballot would be agreed to.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o126"><a name="80331-0009.htm_para7"><a name="08033113000115">The new clause would require the documents on such matters to be kept and available for at least 10 years. One problem that has occurred, including on the Brandon estate in Walworth, on the Southwark-Lambeth border, has been whether proposals for new windows are acceptable and compatible with the style of the property concerned. That issue can be contentious, and it returns later when an idea is suddenly resurrected. People quite rightly say, &#147;We want to see the paperwork&#148;&#151;the justification of why the windows need to be replaced. Often, the documents are not available for as long as 10 years. In the life of a leaseholder, 10 years may be quite a short time to be in a property, so the new clause would set a 10-year minimum requirement for keeping the documents.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o127"><a name="80331-0009.htm_para8"><a name="08033113000116">Finally, the new clause suggests that local authorities should be able to set up independent local arbitration tribunals. The leasehold valuation tribunal, which is a national body, is a good thing, but somebody has to pay to have a case there. By definition, as it is national, it is not local. There are some good arbitration bodies&#151;we have a very good mediation service in Southwark&#151;but not every local authority has one. The new clause would allow a local arbitration procedure, so that if there were a dispute between the council and the leaseholders, both sides could agree to the case being resolved locally, at little or no cost. Tribunals would obviously have to be independent, not run by the council.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o128"><a name="80331-0009.htm_para9"><a name="08033113000117">With regard to amendment No. 145, sometimes, understandably, councils have to do things because the Government tell them to. That is okay, if that is what Parliament agrees and gives the Government the power to do. Decent homes policy is one such example. The Labour Government decided that there should be a policy of upgrading all social housing to minimum standards by 2010-11, and I supported them. That might slip slightly, but the principle is good. When that was agreed and imposed, however, there was no consultation with leaseholders about its impact. It is very important that, if the Government initiate a policy, there is consultation with leaseholders about its impact on them, not just on tenants.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o129"><a name="80331-0009.htm_para10"><a name="08033113000118">Tenants and leaseholders would be much better served if the new clauses on their issues were agreed to. You saved the Minister earlier, Mr. Deputy Speaker, from owning up to the fact that the Government have not yet accepted any amendments or new clauses. He has an opportunity to redeem himself, gain credibility and gain love and support from tenants and leaseholders. He can improve the prospects of the Labour party in the elections on 1 May in London and elsewhere. In the end, he can do what is right for tenants and leaseholders by accepting the new clauses. I hope that he will be brave enough to make his name by doing that. If not, I promise him that my Bill will come back in June, and will be back again and again until, eventually, he will have to give in.</p>

 I rise to speak to new clause 1, amendment No. 5 and new clause 8. My hon. Friend the Minister told us that he would continue to listen to the debate, and I assure him that the council house group in whose serried ranks I sit is also continuing to listen. Our proposals in the new clauses and the amendment, and in other measures that will be considered later, are meant to help the Government to achieve their proclaimed purpose of launching a housing drive.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o130"><a name="80331-0009.htm_para11"><a name="08033113000120">That will be difficult because the fall in house prices as a result of the sub-prime crisis will discourage builders.

that they would relaunch council house building and councils would be allowed to build. We welcome that and we want to move those proposals on, because the Bill&#146;s impact assessment indicates that only 2,500 council houses a year will be built under the measure. That may be an increase on the current pathetic totals, but it does not match demand&#151;1.6 million people are on council house waiting lists.</p>

It is unreasonable of the Government to keep up such pressure on councils that want to retain their housing stock, while at the same time trying to encourage councils to build. The Government should not bash councils by cutting funding while expecting them to contribute to the housing drive, which is necessary. Councils should contribute, because they know the needs of their area and can give a lead.</p>

It is a one-sided argument, which is why we tabled the new clause. We want to try to produce a fairer balance for tenants, whom the Minister wants to empower.

Friend the Minister admitted in a parliamentary answer last December that, on top of all those extractions, the national housing revenue account will go into surplus in the coming year. Effectively, that is another tax of &#163;180 million from housing revenue accounts taken out because, with the increase in rents, the fund has moved into surplus.

<p><a name="stpa_o153"><a name="80331-0010.htm_para1"><a name="08033113000150">I particularly want to talk a little about new clause 8. I became aware of the housing revenue account subsidy system only recently, when I realised that 20 per cent. of all the rents paid by tenants in Poole were taken by the Government to use elsewhere. Taking money out of housing revenue accounts&#151;in Poole, there is an arm&#146;s-length management organisation&#151;essentially means taking money from tenants in one area to subsidise tenants in another. As we have heard in this debate, well in excess of &#163;100 million is taken from some council tenants to subside others.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o154"><a name="80331-0010.htm_para2"><a name="08033113000151">I have always believed that need has to be the basis of housing policy. However, if it is to be that, it should be met by national taxation, not by using tenants in one area, who may be less well off, to subsidise tenants elsewhere. The figures have been mentioned today: well over &#163;180 million comes from tenants&#146; rents, and in the vast majority of districts and boroughs people make some contribution, predominantly to the larger cities and inner London. Nevertheless, the transfer of funds and money is very substantial.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o155"><a name="80331-0010.htm_para3"><a name="08033113000152">Nobody quite understands how the formula is worked out and I welcome the fact that the Government are having a review. However, I suspect that the review will be only modest and I know that some authorities that want to opt out of the subsidy system have been negotiating with the Department, which, as I understand it, wants them to buy themselves out of that system. At the end of the day, if the authorities have to buy themselves out of the system, it may not be worth their leaving it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o156"><a name="80331-0010.htm_para4"><a name="08033113000153">I have another point to make about the benefits of council housing versus stock transfer and everything else. If there is a subsidy system in which a local area is losing millions in rents, there is an added incentive for stock transfer, even if the tenants are not pleased with that option because they feel that they are being penalised if they remain council tenants. The contributing authorities include not only relatively leafy Poole and the Surrey boroughs and districts, but authorities such as Bolsover, Chesterfield&#151;I see the hon. Member for Chesterfield (Paul Holmes) sitting in his place&#151;Portsmouth and City of Durham. Many of the former mining areas have quite a lot of public sector stock. Money is coming out of the rents paid by tenants and being redistributed to the Camdens and other areas.</p>

In my own borough of Poole, we have very high house prices. That means that social housing takes more of the strain in relation to young couples.

When he made that statement, he was cheered to the rafters by Labour party members from constituencies across the country, who knew, as we did, what a housing crisis we were facing. I think that he gave that promise because he understood those problems. To be frank, it was an admission that the existing policy had failed. That policy was based on a belief that the private sector would provide the bulk of new housing that was required by our communities and on an antipathy to local government providing social housing, which led to a forced transfer of council properties into the housing association sector and, wherever possible, devices being used to prevent council houses from being built again.</p>

Last year, the figure dipped down to 80,000, but that is still a scandal. There is a crisis of housing and homelessness in my constituency such as we have not seen since just after the second world war.  <br>

 It has catastrophic effects for children, their families and the wider community. There is a continuous churning of families in temporary accommodation with contracts for some housing lasting no more than 12 months&#151;certainly no more than two years in many cases. I thought that the Prime Minister had been clear about what had gone wrong: we had simply stopped building council houses. I looked at some of the figures from the last 20 years. In 1990, the Tories built 16,000 council properties. I know that because I was campaigning at that time in local government about the scandal of so few being built. Last year, we built 251 council properties. The argument will be made that social housing will be picked up by housing associations and other social landlords. It is not. In 1997, when we were elected, 28,554 homes provided by social landlords were built, and last year that number had fallen to 27,000.</p>

The average price of a home is now &#163;219,000, and house price inflation last year was 9 per cent. Many families in my constituency, and I am sure throughout the country, have a debt burden that can only be described as grinding. Individual borrowing is now &#163;1.4 billion. In January alone, &#163;8.4 billion was lent and &#163;7.4 billion of that went on mortgages. It is a massive debt, and it is now predicted that 45,000 families will have their homes repossessed next year. That process has already started in my constituency and I am dealing with those families in my surgeries. Let us look at the Government figures again: 526,000 families, by the Government&#146;s assessment, are living in overcrowded conditions.

that will be the local authority. We know what has happened during the past 10 or 11 years when tenants have made decisions about who they prefer as their landlord. We know because it has happened in most of our constituencies. They are clearly told, &#147;If you don&#146;t vote to transfer to the ALMO or elsewhere, you won&#146;t get the money to repair and refurbish your properties.&#148; In any other circumstances, it would be called blackmail.

<p>My hon. Friend the Member for North Southwark and Bermondsey (Simon Hughes) was right to talk about the problems of leaseholders. Again, we need to be careful, but the amendments that he has tabled address those problems. I meet many leaseholders who want the local authority to buy back their properties, because they cannot afford the surprises that they face when, for example, a new roof is put on a block in which there are only two leaseholders. They are suddenly confronted with bills not for a few hundred pounds but for &#163;15,000 or &#163;17,000. The local authority says to them, &#147;You can&#146;t spread the payment over a period.&#148; People who are in their late 60s or early 70s, or who are even older, face that sort of dilemma, and may then get a court order forcing them to pay the amount. What should they do? Who do they turn to? Surely not a Labour Government. Those people are in that mess because a Labour Government, who were aware of the problem, did not put in place a regime that would allow the issues to be dealt with properly.</p>

Many of the people whom I represent, who live in real despair of ever getting a decent place to live, look to the local authority, the housing association and the Government, not for payment of housing benefit or for dilapidated bed-and-breakfast accommodation, but for a decent answer to a fundamental question. They want somewhere decent to live. The Government have failed miserably, not just over the past 18 months but over the past 10 years. As I have said, the Tories are not blameless either.</p>

However, we cannot deal with the crisis because our hands are tied and our legs are shackled, and we are, in the main, dealing with someone who does not want to listen, does not want to look at the problem, and is not saying much to lead me to believe that we will get the help that we deserve.</p>

That policy has been reaffirmed countless times on the floor in conference, and was spoken of by my hon. Friend the Member for Great Grimsby (Mr. Mitchell). I am sorry that I was able to hear him speak; I was with my hon. Friend the Minister for Housing, talking about community land trusts, an issue that will come up later. I know that my hon.

It would be good to hear what the Minister says on that, because I gather that, through new clause 1, the Government are moving towards providing even greater assurances that any ballot will be fair. The ballot held in my local area, admittedly some years ago, was not fair; it was rigged.

The first method by which it appears that they will be punished is through money being siphoned off. I face that issue daily, as local Liberal Democrat and Conservative councillors allege that the Government take money from authorities such as Stroud and use it to bail out other authorities. There is an easy way of dealing with that, and I am pleased to see that there are to be various pilots looking at how local authorities can relocalise their provision of local authority housing.</p>

have tabled so far. [Hon. Members: &#147;But?&#148;] But&#151;the rest of the picture may not be quite so rosy for the Minister.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o189"><a name="80331-0011.htm_para10"><a name="08033133000051">The need for amendments Nos. 14 and 15, tabled by me and by other Liberal Democrat Members, was brought to my attention by London Councils, an organisation of great standing that examines these matters in an objective and business-like way and seeks to add value to the Bill in that spirit. The amendments would do something very simple: they would protect both tenants and local authorities from having to pay any additional moneys after the completion of the sale of a right-to-buy property should it turn out that the valuation might not have been right at the outset.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o190"><a name="80331-0011.htm_para11"><a name="08033133000052">As aficionados will know, the Bill will put in statute the ability to correct an incorrect statutory determination of value and replace it with a correct determination, as long as that is done within 42 days. On the whole, London Councils and other organisations welcome that. The problem here is that there is no restriction preventing the revaluation from taking place after the completion of a right-to-buy sale. To put it simply, an individual can buy a property and then discover that it is subject to revaluation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o191"><a name="80331-0011.htm_para12"><a name="08033133000053">As I am sure the Minister realises, that arrangement is potentially unfair, as people acting in good faith could be landed with an additional bill. I hope that, on reflection, he will either accept the amendments now or assure me that he will seek to introduce amendments containing exactly the same words&#151;or, if he feels that it is better to save the Government&#146;s face, almost the same words&#151;in another place. If he cannot give such an assurance, I may be inclined, in the light of what he does say, to seek separate votes on amendments Nos. 14 and 15.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o192"><a name="80331-0011.htm_para13"><a name="08033133000054">That is all that I really need to say about the amendments. They are self-explanatory, and I cannot see for the life of me why they should evoke a partisan response, or anything less than agreement from the Minister that, in principle, this is a sensible suggestion. It is in the interests of the general public and individuals who are involved in right-to-buy purchases in good faith. It does not compromise any intent of the Bill, or any value or policy statement made by the Government at any time in the past.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o193"><a name="80331-0011.htm_para14"><a name="08033133000055">Finally, let me deal with what are self-evidently the most controversial elements of the Bill. In a lucid and erudite speech, the hon. Member for Great Grimsby (Mr. Mitchell) laid the ground for consideration of the key subject in this part of the Bill. Explanations of new clauses 1 and 8 have already been given, and need not be repeated. However, I think it worth drawing attention to the passion with which Conservative, Liberal Democrat and Labour Members believe that these provisions are entirely consistent not just with the interests of housing policy, but with specific housing commitments made by this Labour Government during their time in office.</p>

in his earlier campaign. The rest of us fall behind him, as once again, this issue is shown to be a cross-party concern.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o195"><a name="80331-0011.htm_para16"><a name="08033133000057">My worry is that the Government, as the hon. Member for Poole (Mr. Syms) implied in his interesting contribution, are using economic drivers to push forward a dogmatic agenda that assumes that a particular outcome is so desirable that they will bribe&#151;a word that others have used&#151;local people and to some extent local authorities to achieve that result. Why? Why use macro-economic tools to cause micro-economic effects in local governments? In non-jargonistic terms, why are the Government so certain that driving housing out of the council sector is a good thing that they are willing financially to incentivise that policy to the point where many local authorities will shrug their shoulders and say, &#147;What are we supposed to do?&#148; They wonder what they can do to protect themselves when the Government are throwing hundreds of millions of pounds towards a specific policy outcome.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o196"><a name="80331-0011.htm_para17"><a name="08033133000058">I encourage the Minister to respond to the hon. Member for Hayes and Harlington (John McDonnell), who rightly said that the existing circumstances in which housing stock remains under local authority control directly fulfils Labour&#146;s policy objectives. Will the Minister therefore explain to him and to the hon. Members for Stroud (Mr. Drew) and for Poole, my hon. Friend the Member for Portsmouth, South (Mr. Hancock) and myself&#151;not to mention others who are yet to speak&#151;what exactly it is that the Minister can see that we cannot? What is it that compels the Government to use those colossal amounts of money to enact such a ground shift in how we manage housing policy in this country?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o197"><a name="80331-0011.htm_para18"><a name="08033133000059">Another worrying point, already raised by others, is the lack of investment in council house building. With the number of homeless estimated at 100,000&#151;it could be substantially higher as there is an awful lot of hidden homelessness in this country&#151;it is quite obvious that we have a housing crisis. Another compounding factor is that, as far as I can see, the Government&#146;s policy, which is challenged by new clauses 1 and 8, is directly responsible for sapping investment from rehabilitating existing housing for council use in order to construct new housing.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o198"><a name="80331-0011.htm_para19"><a name="08033133000060">The hon. Member for Hayes and Harlington and others have pointed out that the average inflation rate for house prices is around 9 per cent., but in poorer areas, it is often a lot higher. A few years ago, house inflation in the less wealthy areas of my own constituency of Montgomeryshire&#151;in Wales admittedly, so it may not be directly affected by this legislation&#151;stood at 36 per cent. It compounds the offence of poverty when councils cannot ease housing demand because they do not have sufficient resources to tackle the problem.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o199"><a name="80331-0011.htm_para20"><a name="08033133000061">One of the great culprits has already been mentioned&#151;the housing revenue subsidy system.

provisions will make things even worse. It amounts to taking money away from less wealthy areas and giving it to what can easily be perceived to be more wealthy areas. Given that dynamic, it is almost incomprehensible to us or other people who believe that the Labour party is in favour of redistributing wealth to hear the Government defending something that increases the disparity. In a sense, we could say that the subsidy is redistributive: it takes money from poorer people and gives it to the more wealthy. I thus challenge the Minister, particularly after he has heard my hon. Friend the Member for Chesterfield and others, to explain why the Government have been so unwilling to right a wrong that is felt across the country. If the Minister really wants to redistribute wealth&#151;or, to be more precise, to give funding support to the councils that he believes most need it&#151;he should not implement a system that redistributes wealth from one set of tenants who are already badly off to another set of tenants, as that process amounts to redistributing poverty.</p>

There is a fairly simple reason for that.</p>

 On a point of clarification, the situation is worse than that. The average number of council houses built annually for decades after the election of the Attlee Government was, as I said, 160,000. However, 1 per cent. of that&#151;1,600&#151;is the total number built over the last 10 years, so the real figure is one tenth of 1 per cent.</p>

 Indeed. As the hon. Member for North-West Leicestershire&#151;a Labour Member&#151;points out, on the basis of the real figures, I was being 10 times too generous. I was blaming the Minister for only a tenth of the problem for which he is partly responsible, albeit not personally. Despite my concerns about Government policy, when the hon. Member for Great Grimsby suggested that the Minister was in some ways a role model for Robert Mugabe, I thought that that was pushing it a little bit too far. I cannot say, however, that I have detailed knowledge of the current council house building programme in Zimbabwe. The hon. Member for North-West Leicestershire is completely right: the true rate of house building in the past 10 years stands at 0.1 per cent. of the level achieved during a sustained period after the war.</p>

 My hon. Friend makes a good point. Perhaps the Minister is getting some sense of the cross-party concern on this matter. Even if he were to close his ears to hon. Members&#151;he is not the sort of Minister to do that&#151;he would need to remember that the Government themselves have set house building targets comparable to the sort of figures highlighted by the hon.

I can present him with a very simple solution&#151;to accept new clauses 1 and 8. Those new clauses are not rocket science and they do not contradict anything that the Government have said that they want to achieve. No great philosophical dilemma would be posed for new Labour by adopting those new clauses&#151;after all, it is not clause IV, in the historical context of the word&#151;so the Minister could make progress on a cross-party basis that sent all the right signals to local authorities. He should indicate his willingness to respond to what we are all saying: we are not saying it for any party political advantage, as it is also what local authorities of all political parties are saying to the Government in their efforts to resolve a desperate shortage of affordable housing across the land.</p>

There is no technical reason why they could not be absorbed into the Bill. As the Minister has heard, there is a robust logic to accept them to achieve the very goals that the Government seek.</p>

If he does that, it is no loss for the Government; it is a victory for scrutiny and, moreover, a great credit to the Minister and the Government for showing that they care more about solving a desperate housing crisis in this country than they are concerned about having things their own way at every stage of the Bill&#146;s consideration.</p>

 I start by agreeing with the hon. Member for Montgomeryshire (Lembit &#214;pik) on his opening remarks, in which he rightly praised my hon. Friend the Minister for introducing sensible amendments in response to debates in Committee. The hon. Gentleman&#146;s recognition of the Government&#146;s willingness to listen and respond positively was welcome and in rather marked contrast to the comments of the hon.

It strikes me that, when there appears to be consensus, as there appears to have been in the House today, it is often an occasion for ringing alarm bells. I want to ring a few alarm bells now.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o205"><a name="80331-0012.htm_para4"><a name="08033133000074">I have to tell hon. Members that the inheritance that the Government received when they came to office in 1997 was indicative of things that were in many ways fundamentally wrong with housing policy. Not only was there the huge legacy of substandard council housing that was in urgent need of improvement&#151;the funding for that improvement has been quite rightly a fundamental part of Government policy in recent years, and we will return to the details of that in a moment&#151;but there was the pernicious legacy of years in which tenure had been allowed to dominate the debate and politicians had argued the merits of tenure as master rather than the interests of the public for whom tenure should be the servant. So we had debates about the merits of owner-occupation, which obsessed the Conservatives at the time, in just the same way as we have heard rather an obsession about the merits of council housing as against social housing more widely. I believe that it is fundamental that we should think of tenure not as the master but as the servant and that we should try to provide a framework where people can opt for an appropriate tenure suitable to their needs and resources at different stages in their lives, without being trapped, as too many people have been in the past, in unsatisfactory and undesirable circumstances.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o206"><a name="80331-0012.htm_para5"><a name="08033133000075">The consequence of the obsession with tenure was that, for 50 years or more, we allowed all housing development in this country to be divided and polarised in a rigid and ultimately socially destructive way. We had estates that were almost exclusively owner-occupied on one side and estates that almost exclusively comprised social housing on the other, and ne&#146;er the twain did meet. That led to all sorts of problems. A lot of the market housing provided for owner-occupation was built wholly unsustainably, with people gobbling up acres of green space, seeking detached houses in rural settings. Of course, that created the concept of concreting over the countryside, which has become a rather significant issue in the debate about  <br>

how we meet housing need. A lot of the opposition to new housing is exactly the product of poor-quality, insensitive housing development, gobbling up the countryside, particularly in southern Britain, over many decades. The Government who were in power in the 1980s and early 1990s were fundamentally at fault for allowing that to proceed.</p>

 My right hon. Friend, whose knowledge and reputation on this subject are without parallel in the House, rightly points to the fact that tenure tended to dominate debate and that the interests of the tenant were not paramount, but is it not even worse dogma for a Government to deny the possibility of local authorities having any part to play in resolving the problems of affordable housing by undertaking the provision, management and maintenance themselves?</p>

 If that were the Government&#146;s policy, I would agree with my hon. Friend; but it is not their policy, and as I shall demonstrate in a moment, the right approach, which they are broadly following, is to pursue a policy that supports the provision of social housing by a variety of providers, so that there is both diversity and some competition to avoid the problems of monopoly, which became a serious problem in the 1970s, 1980s and early 1990s, when very large council housing estates were run by authorities that found them difficult to manage in many cases and that were opposed to the concept of stock diversification for ideological reasons. I do not think that that is part of the solution; I want a pragmatic approach that accepts the need for local authorities to play a positive role but not a monopoly role, and I would not want to see a return to that.</p>

to be addressed. The Government&#146;s initial approach in saying that the first priority must be to tackle the backlog of substandard council housing was correct. It would have been nice, if there had been more resources, to expand the new build programme as well, but the priority was to put an end to the scandal of millions of people living in substandard housing in which they had been neglected and left for decades because of a lack of investment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o208"><a name="80331-0012.htm_para7"><a name="08033133000081">There was some increased public investment, but the Government recognised that there would be no possibility of achieving the consequences that were set out in the decent homes programme of improving the entire social housing stock within a finite time without the injection of some additional private finance. That is where the stock transfer programme, which began when the right hon. Member for North-West Hampshire was Housing Minister, has played an important role. As I have said already, we should not approach these issues in an ideological or dogmatic way; we should consider the interests of the tenants and see what the outcome has been. If we look objectively at the evidence, we see that it is not as it has been presented to the House today, with tenants universally opposed to stock transfer. There has been a mixed view. Some tenants are opposed; others tenants have welcomed it. The evidence where stock transfer has taken place is that, in general, there have been huge improvements in the condition of the stock and high satisfaction among a large proportion of the tenants concerned. I take the view that we should listen to that, rather than to the views of people who want to put tenure ahead of the interests of the public.</p>

 Does the right hon. Gentleman accept that the picture is mixed, in that tenants in different places can have different views? In my borough and in other areas, whenever people have been asked they have been very clear that they want to be able to remain as council tenants. When the people and the parties represented on the council in question clearly express that wish, the Government should permit that and not give any financial disincentive for it to remain the position.</p>

 I agree that the position varies from area to area, and that Government should listen to the views of tenants, but it is also right to consider the merits of diversification to avoid large, monopoly landlords, which can be problematic. In my area, the local authority in Greenwich still retains the bulk of the housing stock, but it has agreed stock transfer in a particular area, which has led to a huge improvement in property conditions and a higher level of tenant satisfaction. Such a mixed approach is admirable and sensible, and it should be part of the solution. That is why I reject the approach implicit in new clauses 1 and 8. They adopt a &#147;back to the future&#148; attitude of saying, &#147;We simply want to return to a framework of council housing, and not to accept that there is a need for a pluralist world.&#148;</p>

injection of private money costs the public purse more than publicly funded capital investment? It is right that we should invest in the decent homes programme, but even that&#151;let alone the new-build programme&#151;has been woefully inadequate; certainly in Birmingham, thousands of homes have been demolished. So, not only have we not been building new homes, but we have been demolishing council homes, which has led us into this terrible housing and homelessness crisis.</p>

 I am certainly not going to defend the housing record of Birmingham city council, which is very unsatisfactory in many respects. However, my hon. Friend is wrong to suggest that the cost of bringing extra private money into the decent homes and stock improvement programmes is greater than the cost of providing public money. On the contrary, &#163;35 billion has been raised for housing investment because housing associations are able to borrow from the private sector to supplement the public funds that are available to them. That is extra investment that has improved many homes that would not otherwise have been improved.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o209"><a name="80331-0012.htm_para8"><a name="08033133000086">Also, contrary to the view that is often expressed, tenants&#146; interests have been protected. The idea that housing associations are unaccountable and irresponsible landlords is very different from my experience. I have worked with a range of housing providers, including small and large housing associations, and most of them achieve high standards and aim to be truly responsive to the needs of their tenants and the communities they work with. I strongly advocate an approach that recognises the merits of a mixed economy with a range of providers, and a programme that allows the continued attraction of private investment to supplement public funds, so that we get a larger programme and more work done than would otherwise be achieved.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o210"><a name="80331-0012.htm_para9"><a name="08033133000087">That must be applied more widely. There has been a dramatic change in new private house building development: unlike 10 years ago, house builders are now prepared to accept that new developments should be mixed developments with an element of social and affordable housing alongside market housing. That was not the case in the past. How often in the past did we hear private developers saying, &#147;We simply want our own exclusive estates, with no social tenants&#148;? That pernicious and wrong approach has largely been countered by the policies pursued by the current Government, and I hope that they will be maintained. The thinking in the Green Paper published in the summer, which is implicit in the policies advocated in the Bill, is encouraging mixed developments in which, side by side, there will be housing for sale, housing for rent and low-cost and intermediate options, and in which there will also be a commitment to raising energy efficiency standards and to doing so in new ways. If we pursue that, and we also accept the need to bring in an element of private finance, there will be an expanded programme, which is what we all want.</p>

coalition in Wales. The Housing Minister in the Welsh Assembly Government is a Plaid Cymru Member, and in a few weeks&#146; time she will have to confirm the decision made by the people in Merthyr, despite the fact that she is a strong supporter in principle of local authority housing.</p>

 As there is a coalition in Wales between Labour and Plaid Cymru, what does the hon. Gentleman imagine the position in Wales will be when they consider the outcome of this proposed legislation? Does he think Labour Members there will be persuaded by the arguments put here to reject new clauses 1 and 8, or that they will take a divergent view based on common sense rather than dogma?</p>

 I do not have a crystal ball to give me greater understanding of the views in the Labour party in Wales, but the broad political consensus among its members and activists, as well as those of Plaid Cymru and the Liberal Democrats in Wales, is in favour of maintaining a key role for local authority housing. As a result of the same financial pressures that we see in England, Labour-controlled Rhondda Cynon Taf county borough council initiated a ballot that was successful in transferring its stock, and Swansea&#146;s Liberal Democrat council initiated the ballot referred to by the hon. Member for Great Grimsby (Mr. Mitchell), despite the fact that the Liberal Democrat membership is probably against it. I suspect that Plaid Cymru&#146;s Gwynedd council feels the same financial pressures. It undermines people&#146;s faith in local democracy when the majority of the political parties&#151;the Conservatives in Wales are the exception&#151;are against stock transfer in principle but are being corralled down such a route because the financial cards are stacked against them. The two proposals merely seek to create a level playing field in the information provided to tenants in ballots and in the system of housing finance, so that people can have a genuine choice.</p>

In my area, the pattern of council housing was different, because its estates were smaller and thus did not have the attendant problems that have been mentioned. If there is a case for plurality, let us embrace plurality, but that is not the road along which we are accelerating. We are moving towards an end to an historic and important central role for local authorities, which are democratically accountable, in providing housing to their constituents.</p>

That option is the local elections, because people can vote in another party. What option will people have when there is an indirect and convoluted system of accountability? What right will future generations&#151;people who are not current tenants&#151;have to hold their local political leadership to account about what it is doing locally on housing and homelessness?</p>

landlords on a Rachmanite basis to exploit the housing benefits system. When housing is in such desperately short supply, democracy, competition or co-operation do not work. This is about housing supply. The numbers that we are supplying at the moment are clearly inadequate. Tonight, we are offering one of the vehicles that could meet that housing supply need. Whether or not there is plurality of provision, we know of one area in which we can develop housing with one vehicle. It can provide an acceptable form to the people who will then eventually be housed and it has delivered for us in the past: council housing.</p>

 I fully agree with the hon. Gentleman. I have seen the figures for England. I do not believe that a single council house was built in Wales last year. If Plaid Cymru is successful in regaining control of the authority in Caerphilly, we would be committed to having at least some council housing built next year. It would be great to have some positive competition from the Labour party on that&#151;perhaps we could have a bidding war on the number of council homes we will build.

 The hon. Gentleman is right. As the hon. Member for Great Grimsby said, the Government&#146;s study, based on the pilot for self-financing, has laid the facts bare for us. Unless a new system of finance is in place, even the Bill&#146;s new rules will not allow us to transform the parlous lack of investment in the council housing sector that we have seen for so many years. The Minister and a new Prime Minister have the opportunity to put right the mistakes made by a previous Administration and a previous incumbent.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman was talking about accountability. Is not a pitiable deception often peddled during the run-up to coerced stock transfer ballots? It is said that there will be accountability from or to the new housing associations, which are typically comprised of the great and the good, some nominated local authority members and some nominated tenants, but in practice people are hobbled, silenced and constrained by what they can say in public because of the fear of ejection from the housing association for bringing it into disrepute. That is the sort of accountability that people are promoting.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o219"><a name="80331-0013.htm_para1"><a name="08033133000107">We are entering into a different phase in more general terms. After the Northern Rock fiasco, the ideological position that public sector equals bad and private sector equals good is completely tarnished. We are also entering into a new financial era. People in the United State of America are talking about 10 days that have changed capitalism, because the private sector is no longer awash with the kind of money to which the right hon. Member for Greenwich and Woolwich referred. There was a demand for bonds and asset-backed securities, and that is one of the reasons why stock transfer and the kind of financial instruments that it could create were attractive to investors at one point. We are now in an entirely different era&#151;the credit crunch&#151;and we should not put our faith in the private sector when the money in it is drying up. We must examine other models that have served us well in the past. When facing such a housing crisis in this country we would be unwise not to grasp this political opportunity, given that there is such a consensus in this Chamber on the fact that council housing needs to be a far larger part of the solution than it has been for the past 10 or 15 years.</p>

<p><a name="st_o256"><a name="08033133000109"><a name="80331-0013.htm_spnew6"><a name="08033133000253"><b>Paul Holmes:</b>
 The fact that I wish to address my comments to new clauses 1 and 8 will come as no surprise, given that almost everyone who has spoken has done the same. Those new clauses have dominated the debate. This group contains more than 21 new clauses and amendments, and those two alone have taken up well over 90 per cent. of the discussion. That shows just how strongly people feel about this matter.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o220"><a name="80331-0013.htm_para2"><a name="08033133000110">The right hon. Member for Greenwich and Woolwich (Mr. Raynsford) discussed dogma about tenure and whether people should be buying houses or living in council houses, saying that that was not the key issue. One of the key issues is that the 11 years of dogma from this Government, saying that council housing is bad and that it must be forced into privatisation or stock transfer, has caused huge harm. I shall return to that in a moment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o221"><a name="80331-0013.htm_para3"><a name="08033133000111">New clause 8 concentrates on effectively establishing the fourth option&#151;or a level playing field for councils alongside housing associations&#151;and has two parts to it. The first is about equal access to resources to maintain existing housing stock. The second is about equal access to funding and borrowing and being allowed to build new houses. Like new clause 1, new clause 8 stands in the name of the hon. Member for Great Grimsby (Mr. Mitchell), who does an excellent job as chair of the all-party group on council housing. The second name listed is mine, as I am vice-chair of that group. Given the excellent speeches that we heard from the hon. Members for Poole (Mr. Syms) and for Carmarthen, East and Dinefwr (Adam Price), I look forward to having two new vice-chairs for the group so that we can turn it into a fully fledged all-party group. </p>

<p><a name="stpa_o222"><a name="80331-0013.htm_para4"><a name="08033133000112">I have no doubt that at the end of the debate we will hear from the Minister that all these issues are being considered and are under review. There is a review of the housing subsidy system, to which I shall return shortly. We have heard that from Ministers and the Government before. Members of the Labour party have heard it at conference. They heard it in the run-up to the 2005 election. They heard it last summer, in the run-up to the general election that never was. They heard promises that the Government were looking at  <br>

the problem and would sort it out, and that they would allow councils to have a level playing field and to build. As many hon. Members have pointed out, that is nonsense, and that has been the case for the past 11 years. The dogmatic thrust of Government policy is to bring an end to council housing. Those council tenants who vote against Government policy&#151;that is, more than half the social housing tenants in the country&#151;are penalised and punished.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o223"><a name="80331-0013.htm_para5"><a name="08033133000113">It is no good the Minister saying that he is looking into the matter, that there is a review and that the Government will come up with some answers next year, the year after that or maybe the year after that. We have heard it all before and it has not happened. The crisis is now. We all know what is happening in the private housing sector: repossessions are soaring and have almost reached the levels they were in 1990 during the last big negative equity crisis. People who bought in the sub-prime market or who are on three-year fixed interest mortgages and will come off them on to a much higher interest rate will begin to hit problems. The crisis will be much worse than the one in 1990 to 1992. After that crisis, the Conservative Government altered the regulations so that the benefit system no longer paid the interest on a mortgage for the first six months of unemployment. More people will be pushed straight into repossession, homelessness and seeking help from councils.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o224"><a name="80331-0013.htm_para6"><a name="08033133000114">Councils will not be able to provide that help because of the lack of council house building over the past 11 years. For the 50 years following world war two, the average number of council houses built was 150,000 a year, as we have heard. Last year, fewer than 300 were built, the lowest number since before world war one. Councils are not in a position to meet the high demand, which will grow over the next year or two because of the problems that are hitting the private housing market.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o225"><a name="80331-0013.htm_para7"><a name="08033133000115">As we have heard, waiting lists have soared over the past 11 years. Homelessness is up from 40,000 to 80,000. Waiting lists for council housing are up from 1 million to 1.6 million. In Sheffield and Chesterfield, waiting lists have trebled since this Government came to office. When the all-party group held its second evidence session a couple of weeks ago, a Labour councillor from Bolsover told us that someone who applies for council housing in Bolsover has to wait an average of 10 years before they can get any sort of quality accommodation. The old lady rattling about in a family house, whose husband is dead and whose children have grown up and left home&#151;that is the normal pattern that I see in my surgery most Friday afternoons&#151;cannot cope with the house, the stairs or the garden and wants to move out to a bungalow, but no bungalows are available because councils are not allowed to build any more. They cannot provide that replacement accommodation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o226"><a name="80331-0013.htm_para8"><a name="08033133000116">Every Friday at my surgeries I see young families who live in poor private accommodation and are being exploited, who are sleeping on relatives&#146; sofas or who live in upstairs flats that are council property. They say that they have one or two children and ask when they can move into a house with a garden. The answer in Bolsover would be that they have to wait 10 years. The situation is much the same in Sheffield, Chesterfield and hundreds of other local authorities.</p>

It is bad, but it will get much worse as we encounter further problems with the private housing market. In 1990, councils still had some capability to respond to such situations, but now they will not be able to respond to the growing problem. That is why the Government must do something today. They should accept the new clauses, rather than tell us that the subject is under review and make promises for the future. We have heard that for 11 years but nothing ever happens.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o228"><a name="80331-0013.htm_para10"><a name="08033133000118">The housing associations, to which the right hon. Member for Greenwich and Woolwich referred in such glowing terms, have not filled the bill. They were supposed to be the alternative and to meet the shortfall in what councils provided before. Over the past 11 years, housing associations have built 22,000 social housing units a year. The Government&#146;s reports have said that at least 46,000 are needed a year simply to allow the situation to stand still. That would not improve the 1.6 million waiting lists, but would simply keep up with right-to-buy losses, for example. The housing associations, which were supposed to be the great answer to all our problems, have managed to provide a pathetic 22,000 social houses a year, which does not even keep up with the right-to-buy losses.</p>

 I agree with hon. Gentleman. Does he accept that many housing associations now amalgamate into larger groups and no longer have a local, specialist focus? At least one big housing association has a chairman who aspires to be quoted on the stock exchange. He wants the association to be a property company and a big private landlord.</p>

 I thank the hon. Gentleman for that point, which was next in my scribbled notes. In the shotgun wedding ballots about which we have already heard, which are the subject of new clause 1, people are told that their friendly local housing association will come in and provide many wonderful innovations&#151;many of which do not happen&#151;and that the housing association is small, local and friendly. What happens? That process is followed by constant amalgamation. We can see from the experience of the past 11 years that those housing associations are not in the business of building houses or providing a friendly local service. It is one constant story of amalgamation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o229"><a name="80331-0013.htm_para11"><a name="08033133000121">The business plan of housing associations&#151;I will be corrected if I am wrong&#151;seems to be based on constant merger and on taking over council housing stock and smaller housing associations. Two or three housing associations operate in my constituency, and their head offices are in cities that are miles away. They have little local offices that are open a couple of afternoons a week, if we are lucky. If I contact them, as an MP, or a councillor contacts them, we get answerphones or end up ringing through to Rotherham, Bradford, Leeds and all sorts of places. They could be on the other side of the moon as far as the tenants of Chesterfield are concerned.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o230"><a name="80331-0013.htm_para12"><a name="08033133000122">When those properties belonged to the council, all people had to do was walk for 10 minutes or take a bus for a few minutes into the town centre. They could then bang on the door and go to see the council housing department. They could also vote the council out, as we were reminded earlier. That enabled those tenants to get some sort of response.</p>

Most people agree with that because, contrary to what the right hon.

Housing associations have not delivered the alternative in the wonderful mixed market that we have heard so much about. They have almost completely failed to fill the gap.</p>

If the 10,000 council tenants in Chesterfield were to switch to a housing association, that association would immediately get to keep all the rents. If they vote to stay with the council in Chesterfield&#151;tenants in Camden did that four times last year&#151;the council loses millions of pounds in rent: &#163;3 million last year, &#163;4 million this year, and &#163;5 million next year.

Why do council tenants have to pay higher rents so that people can borrow money in the private sector to build a house?

It merely stops discrimination against nearly 2.5 million council tenants who have voted no, sometimes three or four times, and want to stay with the council. If the Government are in favour of mixed tenure, diversity and democracy, surely they want to offer a level playing field rather than condemning 2.5 million council tenants in Conservative areas such as Poole, in Plaid Cymru areas, in Labour areas and in Liberal Democrat areas&#151;in areas across the country and the political spectrum&#151;to a constant spiral of decline. The only answer that the Government ever come back with is that there will have to be another ballot, and another &#163;500,000 blown on a failed ballot intended to force people to opt for a transfer.

 I would be delighted to do so. Of course, it is hard to prove in some ways, because if tenants have voted to transfer, how can we prove why they did so? In one case, the district auditor examining such a ballot said:</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o239"><a name="80331-0013.htm_para21"><a name="08033133000133">New clause 1 is intended simply to establish a fair, open, democratic ballot in which people who oppose transfer get an equal say. We should have no more one-sided ballots and no more lack of money to support tenants against councils and housing associations that spend &#163;500,000 or &#163;1 million, using DVDs, videos, roadshows, sandwiches and all the rest, trying to persuade people how wonderful it would be to switch.

which the only people allowed to speak were those in favour of opt-outs. Tenants&#146; posters campaigning against opt-out, for example in blocks of flats, have been ripped down by council employees, while posters in favour of opt-out have been left up on the same notice board. There is a huge catalogue of such things. If we end all that, will it prevent stock transfer? If free democracy, fair play and free speech prevent stock transfer, that is the democratic decision of the tenants, and we should respect it.</p>

If people want to buy their house, I have no objection so long as the money goes to providing replacements, which it has not over the past 20 years. That has caused a large part of the problem that we now face. If tenants vote to change their landlord, I have no objection. I have the sneaking feeling that, as Members have said, at least if people vote to switch from one political party to another as their landlord, they can vote to switch back later. That is called democracy. Once they are with a registered social landlord such as a housing association, it is a one-way route. The only way to go from there is into bigger and more remote housing associations, through amalgamations and mergers. That is not democracy.</p>

Cooper), the previous Minister for Housing, promised a review of all council housing subsidies at the end of last year. On that basis, it would be wrong to support the provision before we have more information about the success and efficacy of the pilot scheme and the review of the HRA subsidy. I accept what hon. Members have said about the delay and the time that it has taken to establish a review, but one is now under way, so it would be precipitate of us to go ahead and join some Labour Members in the Lobby in support of new clause 8, notwithstanding the eloquent comments of my hon. Friend the Member for Poole, and the speeches of the right hon. Member for Oldham, West and Royton (Mr. Meacher) and the hon. Members for North Southwark and Bermondsey, and for Hayes and Harlington, all of whom made strong, persuasive points. At this stage, it is sensible, rational and responsible to wait for the outcome of the review before making a decision. We should not make a knee-jerk or precipitate response on the housing revenue account.</p>

Let me start at the beginning, which seems a long time ago, with new clause 9, tabled by the right hon. Member for North-West Hampshire (Sir George Young). He will recall that we had an interesting debate on a similar topic in Committee in January. I am pleased that it has been raised again, so that I have the opportunity to update the House on our progress since then and my plans for moving matters forward.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o264"><a name="80331-0015.htm_para1"><a name="08033142000009">In responding to the amendments and the other points that have been raised, I am conscious of the need to address incredibly important points in other parts of the Bill, so I will seek to achieve a balance between responding to the comments of hon. Members and making progress with the Bill.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o265"><a name="80331-0015.htm_para2"><a name="08033142000010">New clause 9 does two things. First, it prevents registered social landlords from ever&#151;I stress the word ever&#151;using ground 8 in possession proceedings. Secondly, it provides that a court should not grant possession to any landlord under ground 8 if any of the arrears arose as a result of delays or failures in housing benefit payments, unless it considers that it is reasonable to do so.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o266"><a name="80331-0015.htm_para3"><a name="08033142000011">The Government have already made it clear that for registered social landlords eviction should be used only as a last resort in rent arrears cases, particularly&#151;I stressed this in Committee&#151;where the arrears have occurred as a result of delays in housing benefit payments. Good practice guidance published in June 2005 on improving the effectiveness of rent arrears management included advice and best practice on early intervention policies and proactive approaches.

the aim of ensuring that eviction is the last resort for all landlords in rent arrears cases. The protocol sets out various measures that social landlords must take before starting possession proceedings on the basis of rent arrears. However, both in Committee and on the Floor of the House today, the right hon. Gentleman made a strong case, and I recognise that there remain concerns about the actions of a small minority of RSLs and other private sector landlords. I am keen to ensure that those are resolved.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o268"><a name="80331-0015.htm_para5"><a name="08033142000013">I have therefore asked my officials to convene a working group meeting with the key stakeholders, including Shelter, Citizens Advice, the National Housing Federation, the Council of Mortgage Lenders and the Housing Corporation to examine those concerns and report back to me by summer, recommending options for a way forward. In light of the regulatory framework that we are putting in place, I am particularly interested in the role that Oftenant could play in addressing the problem for the registered social landlord sector. The reformed system of regulation, which will give a stronger voice to tenants to bring issues of concern to the regulator and a more targeted system of regulatory action, seems a good approach to dealing with the matter.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o271"><a name="80331-0015.htm_para8"><a name="08033142000016">New clause 8 would require the Secretary of State to take certain matters into account when determining what subsidy to give to local authorities to support their housing revenue accounts. In particular, it would require her to consider the resources needed to meet the decent homes standard and the need for affordable housing. But the Secretary of State is already required by public law to act reasonably in making the annual subsidy determination and to take into account all relevant considerations. Those considerations would include both housing needs and the resources available.</p>

 My right hon. Friend the Member for Greenwich and Woolwich (Mr. Raynsford) made the excellent point that there was something like a &#163;20 billion backlog and appalling standards. People were living in slums in local authority sectors. We have provided sustained investment in social housing, combined with private funding, to provide about 500,000 new kitchens, 500,000 new windows so that people are able to save on fuel bills and achieve greater energy efficiency, and 918,000 new central heating systems. One million children&#151;the equivalent of a city the size of Birmingham&#151;have been lifted out of inadequate social housing. That is a record that we should be proud of, and the hon.

 Let me address that point, which relates to the central point of the debate, about what system we should use to finance council housing. Let me put the debate in the context of the Bill. Clause 297 will enable us to exclude specified properties within a council from the housing revenue account subsidy system. We intend to use that power to allow councils to apply to exclude new homes that they build from being added to the housing revenue account. That will create an incentive among councils to build new homes by giving them more income from such properties. That issue seems to have cross-party consensus.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o273"><a name="80331-0015.htm_para10"><a name="08033142000027">As a former borough councillor, somebody who was proud to serve on my local authority, I think that councils have a range of roles with regard to housing. One is key: place shaping. Councils know what is needed in their areas and provide strategic housing assessments to determine the type of houses required and where they should be. They also have a direct delivery role. I am excited that the Bill, in conjunction with other things such as the housing revenue account review that, as Minister for Housing, my right hon. Friend the Member for Pontefract and Castleford (Yvette Cooper) announced in December, will move us into an exciting new era, in which we look fundamentally at how we finance council housing and, crucially, make sure that councils have that direct delivery role. I am proud to stand at this Dispatch Box and say that this is the return of the council house. I hope that the hon. Member for Chesterfield (Paul Holmes) will agree.</p>

 I only wish I could. However, I do not believe that what the Minister has described will happen; it has not in the past 11 years. How can councils start to build houses and keep all the rent when 75 per cent. of the right-to-buy money goes to the Government, whereas a housing association would keep it all, and when millions of pounds in rent&#151; &#163;4 million this year in Chesterfield&#151;goes to the Government, whereas a housing association would keep it all?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o274"><a name="80331-0015.htm_para11"><a name="08033142000029">Right to buy takes away from councils that guaranteed revenue flow from rents, whereas housing associations are not subject to the right to buy in respect of most of their stock, apart from that subject to immediate transfer. Councils have no security and income in that respect and cannot apply for social housing grant. Why can the Minister not accept new clause 8 and put housing associations and councils on a level financial playing field?</p>

 I thank the Minister for giving way; he is being very generous. My point is simply that councils should be treated as housing associations are. If the 10,000 council houses in Chesterfield were transferred to a housing association, they would be treated in an utterly different way financially. Let the council be treated the same as the housing association. Is the Bill a revolution in council housing? The impact statement for the Bill says that 2,500 houses are involved&#151;that is, an average of five per constituency. That is not a revolution in council housing.</p>

 Perhaps the Minister needs to take this message back elsewhere. What he has said means that our constituents have a two-year wait before the product of those deliberations and new legislation. One would expect an impact schedule after that of another year to two years. That means that homelessness will grow, that overcrowding will continue and that the 700 children now in bed and breakfasts will certainly multiply twofold. Does the Minister not see that the House is trying to relay a sense of urgency to him on this matter? The new clause reflects that sense of urgency.</p>

 I also share that sense of urgency; that is why I am keen to see the Homes and Communities Agency on the statute book as quickly as possible. It will be charged with helping to create the 3 million homes that we so sorely need by 2020. It will have about &#163;8.5 billion of public money to achieve that ambition.</p>

I am paraphrasing, but I am not being too inaccurate. With housing at the top of the political agenda and unprecedented sums of public money, I see the Homes and Communities Agency able to step up to the plate and make sure that the country has the homes that it needs in the next few years.

 I am most grateful to my hon. Friend. Another view is that 2.8 million people in council housing are being left to fester, without repairs and maintenance being done properly or on a sufficient scale because of the inadequacy of the management, maintenance and major repairs allowances, and that that will go on until after an election, which will almost certainly be in 2010. The amendment does not ask him to recast the whole business of the housing revenue accounts&#151;that is for the review, which will deal with questions of historical debt and redistribution between authorities&#151;but merely asks him to provide proper resources to manage, maintain and repair according to research into those areas, such as by building research organisations, and to provide a development allowance.  <br>

 I understand what my hon. Friend is saying and respect his views. I would point out to  him that in terms of management and maintenance allowances, there were above-inflation increases in 2004-05, 2005-06 and, I think, in 2006-07 of about 6 per cent., 6 per cent. and 4 per cent. respectively. The fundamental point is that the Bill helps to remove, as much as possible, the disincentives for councils to go ahead and build. I think that councils with good performances, in conjunction with other partners will step up to the plate and ensure that we really are building new council houses. There is nothing wrong with that. This country sorely needs it, and I fully welcome it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o279"><a name="80331-0015.htm_para16"><a name="08033142000049">However, we must also consider that in the wider context of the difficulties and complexities about how on earth we finance council housing. The housing revenue account is deeply unsatisfying for all concerned. It is so confusing that even my right hon. Friend the Member for Pontefract and Castleford does not understand it, which takes some doing. She has said on the Floor of the House that every time she had to deal with it she had to have a wet towel round her head. That is not good in terms of openness and transparency. We must ensure that it is fit for purpose in the modern age&#151;that there is a direct correlation between rents, services provided and moving on with new builds and improving quality. I would suggest that we are moving towards the level playing field that my hon. Friend the Member for Great Grimsby and other hon.

As I said, it is important that they have a strategic role in assessing the housing needs in their area and coming to a view as to what particular types of housing are required, whether it is housing for older people or accommodation for young families. That is the sort of thing that we need to be doing through the planning system. However, I genuinely believe that there is also a role for councils to have a direct delivery route. I hope that she will be encouraged by what we are doing in the Bill to move forward further and faster. The review of the housing revenue account subsidy system will make recommendations as to how we can fund that. The key point is how we increase transparency and fund this to ensure that everybody gets a fair deal. That is not as easy as has been suggested in the House today.</p>

 That is a difficult one to answer, but I will be open and up front with the House. In the regulatory impact assessment, we say that some 2,500 new council houses will be built on the back of the provisions in the Bill&#151;on an annual basis, I hasten to add. That contrasts with the 250 to 300 houses per annum that we are building at the moment. I think that we are moving on this and that there is not much difference on it between Members in all parts of the House. Councils do play a role, but I suggest, with the greatest respect to the House, that housing associations and other providers also have a key role in helping to lever in private borrowing.</p>

Friend the Member for Great Grimsby, who has acted as a true champion of ensuring that tenants get good and adequate information. I am very interested in the points that he has raised and I have been listening intently. He mentioned two key points with regard to the introduction of a code of practice, the first of which concerns the objectivity of the information that is provided to tenants. Before I expand on that, I must put it on record that he makes some very good points. I know that from personal and direct experience, because in a former life I was an auditor&#151;I apologise to the House for that&#151;and one of the things that we considered and undertook reviews on was the quality of information provided during large-scale voluntary transfers. At times, the information provided has been slightly one-sided; although in general, it is a good procedure, and most local authorities provide a fair, open, transparent and balanced view of the stock transfer options. However, I accept the point excellently made by my hon. Friend that there is a need for more objectivity, so with his permission I would like to take this issue away and look at it again. I would like Oftenant to have a role in this. I would also like the Homes and Communities Agency to play a role in relation to the information provided and perhaps in having some impact on the funding of such information. I want to look at this closely, and with my hon. Friend&#146;s co-operation and assistance, I hope to do so with a view perhaps to tabling amendments in another place or when the Bill returns here. He has a fair point, and I hope that he accepts that I am very keen to help him.</p>

 I am most grateful to my hon. Friend; it is good to find that he is listening. He did a good job of defending the indefensible on finance for council housing. However, there are certain points that I would like to reiterate. Now that I have the serried ranks of the Conservative party, the Liberal party and my hon. Friends, including my hon. Friend the Member for Hayes and Harlington (John McDonnell), behind my amendment, I would like to make it clear what we are asking for: a definite date for the ballot so that there is no jiggery-pokery in changing it all around; a fair and balanced debate; extension of the 28 days allowed in the Bill for tenants to raise concerns and ballots for ALMOs as well for large-scale voluntary transfers.</p>

 Certainly on my hon. Friend&#146;s first two points, I am keen to work with him and think that he has a fair argument. It is right, for example, that tenants should be given sufficient notice of the time when the ballot will be held in order to allow their proposals to be subject to the full consultation that they deserve. I think that I have dealt adequately with the objectivity exercise with regard to information. In terms of requiring the local authority to give adequate notice, again, I am keen to work with him, and others, to deal with that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o281"><a name="80331-0016.htm_para1"><a name="08033142000060">The third point is slightly more complex. On tenant ballots, the issue is a change of tenure as opposed to a change in management. Good practice always indicates that tenants should be fully engaged with regard to the change of management. The system works well in the main, but I pledge to my hon. Friend and others that when we look at the renewal of guidance, we might need to look at the issue again. I do not want to impose unnecessary restrictions and burdens on local authorities and others in order to move things forward, but I would like to meet my hon. Friend so that we can find that way forward. I hope that I have given him my clear pledge on the matter, and reassured him so that he can end the unholy alliance he is leading with Her Majesty&#146;s Loyal Opposition.</p>

 I am sure that everyone welcomes the idea of free and fair elections&#151;not just in Zimbabwe, but in the ballots we are talking about. I welcome what my hon. Friend the Minister has suggested, but if at the end of the process tenants vote to stay with the council, we are saying, &#147;So what? You won&#146;t get any money to do up your housing.&#148; That has been the problem all along. In Camden, the council did its level best to get tenants to vote for the ALMO, but 77 per cent. of tenants and 77 per cent. of the leaseholders voted against. People are left in a position where a Labour Government are refusing to find any money to do up housing. The council is now selling the most attractive individual houses on the streets to raise money in order to do up a small part of the rest of the estate.</p>

that my right hon. Friend has worked hard in that instance, but the roles are clear. I reiterate this point: far from being starved of funds, there has been a 30 per cent. increase in the amount of council funding from central Government. Private borrowing can be levered in so that more can be done more quickly. I was on a local authority when we had a large-scale voluntary transfer, and in many respects the problems of housing demand were exacerbated, because my registered social landlord, Housing Hartlepool, has been so successful that people who did not deal with it previously now want to move into a social landlord property. The problem of demand has been exacerbated, and we need to address it by building more homes. I want to reiterate my central message, and the central point of the Bill, which is that we need more homes of all different types.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o283"><a name="80331-0016.htm_para3"><a name="08033142000066">On new clause 29, I agree with the hon.

Friends the Member for Regent's Park and Kensington, North (Ms Buck) and the Member for Islington, South and Finsbury (Emily Thornberry) on this matter, and I am keen to make sure that we can help as much as possible. </p>

<p><a name="stpa_o284"><a name="80331-0016.htm_para4"><a name="08033142000067">I suggest to the hon. Gentleman, however, that the provision is unnecessary because councils already have the ability in question, where leases allow. We are aware of the practical obstacles that prevent that process from happening in practice, and it is currently difficult for a local authority to contribute to the sinking fund the precise amount that would represent the sums payable by non-leaseholders&#151;the so-called tenant&#146;s proportion. The local authority&#146;s contribution on behalf of the tenants would be needed to ensure that the fund was adequately resourced to meet the full cost of any such works and to provide the necessary clarity and transparency with regard to its real value. Earlier sinking funds lapsed largely because leaseholders were reluctant to make contributions when works were not carried out&#151;often because of a lack of resources. It has also been difficult to set contributions that balanced the need for affordability and the need to be realistic in meeting the costs of works.</p>

 I thank the Minister for giving way, and for the meeting that he held with a number of colleagues concerning this matter. Does the legislation, which he supports, allow local authorities to have a case-by-case analysis of the needs of leaseholders when major works are done? Like every other Member of this House, I have many poor constituents, who bought their properties under right to buy in the 1980s and simply cannot afford the requirements for the capital costs of new roofs and so on. We need a degree of flexibility when dealing with this matter.</p>

 My hon. Friend makes an important point and during my time in the Department I have tried to deal with the need for local authorities to be flexible. That is provided for in the Bill, and it went through Committee relatively successfully. Authorities should provide things such as equity loans and equity shares in order to have flexibility with regard to circumstances on the ground and should consider how best to address the concerns that my hon. Friend raises. In the meeting I had with him, he eloquently talked about the concerns of the more vulnerable people in his constituency and others. How do we deal with that issue? I do not want to suggest that the housing revenue account subsidy review will solve all of the world&#146;s problems, but in the wider context, it will consider how we balance affordability and realism in order to ensure that we have sinking funds and that the capital costs of service charges are dealt with.</p>

 I am grateful for the Minister&#146;s considered response, but the problem is that some leases do not allow for sinking funds. We need legislation to change to allow them for every lease, even if, originally, the terms of such leases did not allow for such a fund. Before the Bill is looked at in detail at the other end of the building, I hope that I can persuade the Minister that we might find a common formula that would allow every lease to have a sinking fund, which could be used by the local authority and the leaseholder.</p>

 I would certainly be happy to look at the matter on that basis because I am keen to ensure that we do something about it. I am concerned that in the constituencies of my hon. Friends the Member for Islington, North (Jeremy Corbyn) and the Member for Regent's Park and Kensington, North, people are suffering&#151;often the most vulnerable in society, for whom we need to do more&#151;because of that problem.

That is why we have put in a place a system of safeguards and measures that make people aware of what they are taking on when they buy a leasehold property and that involve them in decisions about works to their property. Provisions in the Landlord and Tenant Act 1985, which were amended by the Commonhold and Leasehold Reform Act 2002, already cover much of what is proposed by the hon. Member for North Southwark and Bermondsey. As the House will be aware, there are statutory requirements for all landlords, including those in the local authority and the social sector, to consult their leaseholders before carrying out works in their buildings and estates. Those requirements cover much of what is proposed in the new clause, including the requirement for landlords to give reasons for works, to provide details of works to leaseholders, to have regard to tenants&#146; observations, and to obtain nominations for potential contractors. On that basis, I suggest that the new clause is not necessary.</p>

The amendment would require landlords to consult tenants on all national Government consultations that affect them when the landlord intends to respond. From the face of the hon. Member for North Southwark and Bermondsey, he appears to agree with me that that is unnecessary and an unmanageable burden, without any real benefits to tenants, especially given that we already have excellent and effective consultation procedures nationally. I therefore hope that the hon. Gentleman will not press that amendment.</p>

I want to consider Government amendments Nos. 40 to 43 at the same time because I believe that our amendments, especially amendments Nos. 40 and 42, would achieve the same thing. Government amendments Nos. 40 to 43 are designed to do three things. First, they would ensure that, when a landlord or tenant makes a request to the district valuer for a review of his valuation of a property for right-to-buy purposes, the request and the reason supporting it should be in writing.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o288"><a name="80331-0016.htm_para8"><a name="08033142000075">Secondly, the amendments would clarify that the determination of value can be reviewed only if the sale has not been completed. I suggest that that is almost exactly the same as amendments Nos. 14 and !5, which reflect a suggestion, as the hon. Gentleman eloquently pointed out, that the London councils&#146; representative body made. I am glad that we can all agree on that sensible suggestion.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o289"><a name="80331-0016.htm_para9"><a name="08033142000076">Thirdly, our amendments are designed to ensure that, in the review process, which clause 290 introduces, the district valuer knows the date from which specified time limits are calculated. Clause 290 will allow district valuers to withdraw determinations of value and make new ones if they decide that their original valuation was factually flawed, acting either on their initiative or in response to a request from the landlord or the tenant.

 To finish the sentence, &#147;not press the amendments.&#148; I would love to comply, but I want clarification of some practical matters. The Under-Secretary says that Government amendments Nos. 40 and 42 would achieve the same outcome as amendments Nos. 14 and 15. That means that he believes explicitly that it would not be possible to reopen the question of the valuation from the point of completing a right-to-buy purchase. First, is he saying that that is the case? Secondly, exactly which part of the amendments makes that case?</p>

 I apologise for taking up the hon. Gentleman&#146;s time.

 My principal concern is about powers that are exactly analogous to those held by other quangos&#151;powers to consult but never to change the decisions being consulted on. For instance, 8,100 houses in Cheltenham have been accepted by everybody locally for development in the urban area, but that has been pushed up to 13,800 houses, which will therefore overflow into urban sprawl, over miles and miles of green land and green-belt areas. Inevitably, we now have a growing cross-party campaign called &#147;Save the Countryside&#148;. When we have bodies that trust the people, new housing will be accepted.

 To respond to what the Minister said, I see that my hon. Friend has assiduously read the reports of the Public Bill Committee. He is citing the exact point that I made, which is that the HCA has incredible powers&#151;indeed, almost unfettered powers. He is expressing concern that the HCA has such a wide remit that it can walk into just about any other quango&#146;s activities without having to check with anybody else.

that. According to the Treasury&#146;s own projections, those numbers are now simply wrong. However, as a result of new growth point status initiatives, to which I hope Cheltenham&#146;s Conservative administration will not sign up&#151;although the signs are not good&#151;greenfield sites may well be developed first and not last, because the growth points focus on greenfield development. I hope that the Minister can spare the time to respond to that point. If we are not careful, when the economic crisis bites, greenfield sites may well end up being the only land that is developed. That is why the amendments that refer to sustainability and the prioritisation of greenfield sites over brownfield sites are so important.</p>

The South West of England Development Agency responded in its regional spatial strategy by increasing the number of houses in the Cheltenham and Tewkesbury area by 3,700, and now yet another unaccountable, unelected quango is being created under the Bill.

 I am not entirely certain whether the hon. Gentleman was in the House when I mentioned the issue in debate on the first group of amendments, but Sir Bob Kerslake, the chief executive designate of the Homes and Communities Agency, recently said in a letter, with regard to the transitional arrangements, that he sees the agency as the best local delivery partner for local authorities. The measures will only improve housing supply and regenerate infrastructure and communities if there is a close link between the agency and local authorities. Does the hon. Gentleman not agree?</p>

 The Minister has put his finger on one of the key problems with the Bill. In trying to reassure the House that the Bill provides enough safeguards, democratic measures and for sustainability relating to the new agency, he refers us to a letter from its designated chair and not to any provision in the Bill.

we had a bit of discussion about CLTs and whether they could prosper if they were legally defined as an entity. As he knows, the purpose of CLTs is to ensure that affordable and other sub-market housing is available to people at below market rents or costs&#151;something of which I think he would approve. That would make a great deal of sense in an environment where we are trying to do everything possible to provide low-value and affordable housing. In some areas of the country, local people are effectively priced out of the housing market because house prices are not at the national average, which is eight or 10 times salary, but are 20 times the local average salary. Community land trusts can do a great deal to assist in that regard, and new clause 32 seeks legally to define the CLTs once again.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o346"><a name="80331-0018.htm_para6"><a name="08033142000161">The Minister told us in Committee that it was not necessary to define CLTs, as that would not be of any great advantage to them; he said that legislation already provides for them and that they are already being created, and that that proved that the Bill did not need to address the issue of definition in any greater detail. However, I have since discovered that he is wrong. I recently visited a good CLT in Cornwall, where a group of residents have got together and have managed to purchase some land. It is called a self-built community land trust. I commend it to him; it is in the village of Rock. The Minister will be interested to hear that when I say self-built, that is what I mean. At 5.30 pm when the residents have finished work, and at the weekend, they go and build the community themselves, literally.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o347"><a name="80331-0018.htm_para7"><a name="08033142000162">The residents spent a full year trying to get funding for that very sound project. There was no real reason why they should not get funding; it was nothing to do with the more recent credit crunch. The reason why they could not get the funding was that no commercial organisation understood what a CLT was. That is despite the fact that the residents had the backing of their local housing association, which was trying to explain the situation. When lending societies looked at the plan they could not get their heads around  it, because community land trusts are not defined anywhere in law. Along with amendment No. 151, new clause 32 would solve that problem.</p>

 I am a little confused. Could the hon. Gentleman be a little more explicit about the obstacle in that case? When I was chair of housing in Lewisham, we sponsored some of the first self-build projects in the country.

I am genuinely excited by this part of the Bill and I really believe that the Homes and Communities Agency will be the vehicle to help us to build 3 million homes by 2020, playing a key role in the regeneration of our infrastructure and our communities.

Although the rhetoric has been about 3 million new homes, I have said time and again that this is not just about more homes, important though that is to address the housing needs of this country; it is about better homes and greener homes. That is what the Bill will do for design, with the Academy for Sustainable Communities being placed in the agency and with the requirements in the code for sustainable homes. It is vital that homes, if they are to be truly sustainable, are not just plonked in a field; we need the related infrastructure, such as health facilities and schools. I hope that the HCA will build on the work done by English Partnerships in creating 11 new schools to provide the confidence to the market to ensure that development takes place.

 That is an important point. The presumption is always to have brownfield development, and we have been very successful in that regard over the past 10 years: some 75 per cent. of development is now brownfield. However, my hon. Friend makes the point that we must not accept the myth that brownfield is essentially factories and that greenfield is the rolling, beautiful hills of the English countryside. That is not the case, and the agency needs to have the flexibility to be able to allow an area that is designated as greenfield to be classed as just &#147;shrubbery&#148; if it can be built on without any loss to the bio-environment. With regard to planning and sustainability, we could in many respects go further and faster to make sure we attract better biodiversity. I therefore agree with my hon. Friend on this matter.</p>

The amendments place the agency under a duty to have regard to the Mayor&#146;s recommendations contained in the London housing strategy. They will enable the Mayor to recommend to the Secretary of State how much money should be allocated to the HCA in respect of housing in Greater London. They will also enable the Mayor to recommend to the agency how it should exercise its functions of giving housing financial assistance in Greater London, including such matters as the amounts that should be given for different purposes and the number, type, tenure and location of houses that should be provided through housing financial assistance. We are providing the Mayor with more scope to shape the nature of housing and regeneration in London&#151;that will be a key priority for Ken Livingstone as he secures a third term as Mayor in the next few weeks. All this is also consistent with our recent announcement of the proposal that the agency is to establish a London sub-committee to be chaired by the Mayor, and with the chief executive of the agency, Sir Bob Kerslake, as its vice-chair.</p>

I am keen to avoid narrow sectional interests at board level. An approach such as that which the amendment proposes would prevent full representation from other interest groups; all might be perfectly reasonable and have a perfectly valid case, but be impossible to accommodate. Such a move would make the board unwieldy and hinder its ability to deliver the necessary improvements in housing supply and quality, and in regeneration, investment and infrastructure.

 I am keen to meet the hon. Gentleman to talk about that, because I want these things to work. My concern is not that what is in the Bill is bothering lenders, but rather that after all that has happened across the Atlantic, where financial institutions have had their fingers burned over the past few months, institutions are becoming more risk-averse. This House must stop downplaying the fundamental health of the British economy&#151;we should not talk ourselves into a recession, especially when the fundamentals are sound. Also, we must work with lenders to ensure that they have confidence, but we do not necessarily need to prescribe this in the Bill.</p>

 I appreciate the Minister&#146;s consensual approach to the Bill&#151;we had the same approach in Committee&#151;but I am not convinced by his argument. He is arguing that there is a great deal of uncertainty in the market, but he is failing to do the one thing in the Bill that would create certainty. He is failing to include in it a provision about what a community land trust is. We describe all sorts of things in law, and many things are described in this piece of legislation. He has no problems tabling 147 amendments to the Bill today. The one new clause that I am discussing could do a great deal of good for CLTs, and I would have thought that he would welcome it. I am not convinced that I should seek to withdraw it.</p>

 I agree. I pay tribute to my hon. Friend and the valiant manner in which she battled about that concern.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o501"><a name="80331-0026.htm_para20"><a name="08040110000252">The other key element involved the whole regulatory regime. Members of the Committee expressed anxieties about the risks of policy passporting and micro-management by the Secretary of State through the regulator of registered providers and registered social landlords. That was never our intention and I believe that locks in the Bill will prevent that. However, we listened to hon. Members&#146; concerns and tabled amendments to address them.</p>

<p><a name="st_o393"><a name="08040110000253"><a name="80331-0026.htm_spnew5"><a name="08040110000454"><b>Mr. Raynsford:</b>
 I thank my hon. Friend personally for the extremely careful attention that he gave to those issues and for agreeing to bring forward amendments dealing both with the definition of the Secretary of State&#146;s power to direct and with the role and intervention powers of the regulator. All have helped to ensure that the objective&#151;a proportionate but hands-off style of regulation&#151;can be carried forward. If that is achieved, we will definitely have made an improvement to the Bill.</p>

<p><a name="st_o394"><a name="08040110000254"><a name="80331-0026.htm_spnew6"><a name="08040110000455"><b>Mr. Wright:</b>
 For my part, I thank my right hon. Friend for all the personal assistance that he has given me on the amendments. His work and experience have been invaluable to me.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o502"><a name="80331-0026.htm_para21"><a name="08040110000255">The amendments that we tabled address the sector&#146;s concerns. We are reinforcing the view that the Secretary of State&#146;s role should be limited to strategic directions, with direct influence only on key issues such as rent, physical maintenance and tenant empowerment, which is right. The regulator&#146;s standards should be outcome focused wherever possible, should not threaten the status of charitable providers and, crucially, should take account of the desirability of registered social landlord boards managing their own business and setting their own corporate direction.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o503"><a name="80331-0026.htm_para22"><a name="08040110000256">Finally, an important group of amendments ensure that the regulator should be able fully to intervene to address tenants&#146; concerns only where there is a material breach of standards, including on a single estate. You might rule me out of order for mentioning this, Mr. Deputy Speaker, but that will for ever be known as the &#147;Emily Thornberry test&#148;, after my hon. Friend the Member for Islington, South and Finsbury (Emily Thornberry), who on Second Reading rightly mentioned the rat-infested estates and the lack of co-operation that housing associations have to deal with in her constituency. That group of amendments and the powers of the regulator allow it to intervene on those points, but not on minor or trivial points.</p>

It has been a pleasure to serve with them. I particularly want to thank those titans, the Privy Councillors on the Committee, the right hon.

Members to participate in this Third Reading debate, so I conclude my remarks by saying that the Bill is an important piece of legislation. It sets in statute two new housing bodies: the Homes and Communities Agency, which will invest in regeneration and new housing supply and play a key role in achieving our ambition of delivering 3 million homes; and the new social housing regulator Oftenant, which will place tenants at the heart of social housing, driving improvements in standards.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o506"><a name="80331-0026.htm_para25"><a name="08040110000259">I am pleased by the wide consensus on the benefits of establishing of those organisations, which was clear from our Committee deliberations and the oral evidence that we took from stakeholders.

 I agree with my hon. Friend that the debates in Committee were useful. One of them was about potentially amending some of the clauses dealing with domestic violence, on which he made some commitments. We tried to ensure in previous housing legislation that survivors of domestic violence would not be penalised through losing their homes and would be safeguarded under homelessness legislation, but we have apparently failed, because there is still a postcode lottery in provision and safety for them. Will my hon. Friend say briefly what he intends to do as a result of that discussion?</p>

 I am glad that my hon. Friend has mentioned that. She is a champion of trying to prevent and minimise domestic violence, and the amendment that she and my hon. Friend the Member for Edmonton (Mr. Love) tabled was important. I want to help as much as possible, and she will be aware of the meeting that we had last week. I am keen to pursue policy on the basis of evidence and for that reason was concerned about what was said in Committee about policy passporting and differing interpretations of the term &#147;vulnerability&#148;. I therefore agreed last week to work with her on a review to see to what extent that policy postcode lottery and that test of vulnerability apply to different parts of the country. I am keen to move forward on that, but I want to do it on the basis of clear evidence. I hope that she agrees with me and will co-operate with me on that basis.</p>

 The Bill initially contained more than 300 clauses, and on Second Reading I mentioned its size; little did I know that down the line in Committee there would be another 242-odd Government new clauses, and that today a further 137 amendments would be tabled at the last minute, with no time to debate them properly. Today&#146;s debate demonstrated just how ineffective the House has been made to be. There was limited time to consider literally hundreds of amendments and new clauses to the Bill. It is completely unsatisfactory.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o508"><a name="80331-0027.htm_para0"><a name="08040110000264">It is not that the Bill is inherently evil, or that the Minister and the Government are intent on destroying homes and creating bureaucracies that will prevent people from being able to live in affordable housing; they just fundamentally misunderstood the best way of delivering their objectives. They know that they have a lamentable record on housing delivery over the past 10 years. We know that the average number of homes built every year during our time in office was 176,000, and that the figure is only 146,000 under this Government. Social housing, which was mentioned today and many times in Committee, is being built at a very limited rate. We were building more homes on average in each of our 18 years in office than Labour built in any of their 10 years&#151;a situation that has greatly frustrated Labour Back Benchers, as the Minister knows. In addition, homelessness among children has risen dramatically under this Government. There are twice as many homeless children as there were 10 years ago. The figure has doubled to 130,000.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o509"><a name="80331-0027.htm_para1"><a name="08040110000265">We know that there are all sorts of problems in the supply and provision of housing, but the Bill does very little to resolve them. It seeks to resolve them through more top-down management&#151;exactly the kind of problem that got the Government into a low-level house building programme in the first place. The Bill is Whitehall driven, centralised and bureaucratic, and it gives powers to a new quango. We do not know how that quango will behave in future. The Minister mentioned earlier that Sir Bob Kerslake, the new chief executive of the Homes and Communities Agency, said that the agency would be able to act on local vision and work in a local way with local partners. That may well be true, but that is not what it says in the Bill. The problem is that despite the fact that one chief executive thinks that he can act in that way under the terms of the Bill, what matters is what is actually in the Bill and the way in which it is written. It has been written to dictate centralised targets from above to people  down below.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o510"><a name="80331-0027.htm_para2"><a name="08040110000266">However one cuts it&#151;however one reads the Bill&#151;one realises that it is about creating targets and the Government trying to drive through their famous target of 3 million homes by 2020. Never mind the fact that the Government are already missing the target that enables them to reach that 2020 target, or the fact that they have missed their targets for the past 11 years, as I described; misguidedly, they still think that the solution is to put a top-down weight on local people. What came out most clearly both in Committee and&#151;to a limited extent, because of the brevity of this debate&#151;today is the idea that there is a better way of doing things.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o511"><a name="80331-0027.htm_para3"><a name="08040110000267">We could work with, trust and rely on local communities by incentivising them to build the housing that we need. For some reason, the Government feel that that is a dogma that they could not possibly adopt. The idea of working with, rather than against, local people&#151;the idea that people should not have to create campaigns to try to protect their local area&#151;is anathema to the Government. It does not need to be like that. We can encourage local communities to create the homes that are needed by incentivising them. We can do that by ensuring that infrastructure follows housing, and by ensuring that local communities are  <br>

financially benefited as and when housing comes to an area. There must also be joined-up thinking, so that when the people in an area agree to build more housing, there is something in it for local people.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o512"><a name="80331-0027.htm_para4"><a name="08040110000268">When we ask ourselves honestly what incentive the Bill provides for local people to agree to or even encourage the building of housing in their areas, the answer is &#147;Absolutely none.&#148; The truth is that it will invariably destroy the quality of life rather than enhancing it. We do not believe that things need to be like that: housing and development should not have a bad name. It is the policies that have been followed for the past 10 years, gold-plated by the Bill, that have got us into this mess.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o513"><a name="80331-0027.htm_para5"><a name="08040110000269">What has happened in this instance is a bit like what has happened to the word &#147;consultation&#148;. Under the present Government, no one believes that a consultation is genuine. The very meaning of the word&#151;its definition in the Oxford English Dictionary&#151;has been degraded by the sham &#147;consultations&#148; of the past few years. The same muddied cloud now hangs over the word &#147;development&#148;, and the Bill does nothing to address that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o514"><a name="80331-0027.htm_para6"><a name="08040110000270">It could all be so different. Local areas could vie with each other to build sustainable housing in which everyone would want to live. Existing communities could benefit, enjoying the extra services and improving their areas by backing developments. However, the Bill does nothing to favour that approach. Instead, it looks to the heavy hand of top-down government from Whitehall. When local people object to development proposals, do you know what? The Homes and Communities Agency will have the power to override their objections. There is very little to commend the Bill to the House. We had a great opportunity to provide the amount of housing that we know we need in order to accommodate a nation, but that opportunity has been missed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o515"><a name="80331-0027.htm_para7"><a name="08040110000271">The Minister claimed today that the purpose of all those amendments had been to take account of the will of the Committee and the House, but he was unable to answer a simple question about the number of Opposition amendments that he had accepted. in fact, the reason there were so many amendments is not that this is a tremendous Bill, but that the Minister has dithered a great deal.</p>

 I do not want to take up other Members&#146; time. I will simply say that it is difficult to understand why Oftenant should apply to some houses and not others. The Minister was unable to explain that in Committee, and he has been unable to explain it today. The Bill is, if nothing else, inconsistent.</p>

As the hon. Member for Welwyn Hatfield (Grant Shapps) observed, if it is given free rein to wander into the activities of other quangos it may become a great, burdensome monster that will get in the way. However, I am choosing to be an optimist.

 On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker. I seek your guidance as a result of frustration. I appreciate that this may not be a matter that you can deal with now, but four of the groups selected by Mr. Speaker for debate were not touched on at all and in one group we debated only one provision and the bulk of amendments and new clauses were not debated. In addition to taking other steps outside this place, I seek your guidance on whether it would be possible during Report, if the Government were minded to do so, to change the timetable for debate. Could a motion to change the timetable be brought forward when it was absolutely obvious, once Report stage had started, that nothing like the bulk of the work set out was going to be done? Will you confirm whether that would be acceptable, Mr. Deputy Speaker, as it would help us to understand how to deal with Bills that have so many Government amendments and new clauses appended to them in future? The Leader of the House said that she was willing to look further into that as a major parliamentary issue.</p>

As one reads through the documents, the gamble that the Prime Minister and the Chancellor took by nationalising Northern Rock last month becomes clearer and clearer. Whether we get back all the money lent by the taxpayer depends on Ron Sandler&#146;s being able to turn around the business, shrink the mortgage book and rebuild the deposit base.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o525"><a name="80331-0027.htm_para17"><a name="08040110000288">Yet it has taken the Government since September to get us to this point and it took them five months to decide the future of Northern Rock&#151;five months from when Northern Rock was offered emergency funding to the point of nationalisation and five months of uncertainty for its employees, customers and the business. Although the problems at Northern Rock were a consequence of the management&#146;s strategy, it is clear that the Government exacerbated the problem through their handling of the crisis.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o526"><a name="80331-0027.htm_para18"><a name="08040110000289">Just look at the way the Government handled the decision to provide Northern Rock with emergency funds. The announcement triggered a run on the bank, which could be stemmed only by a guarantee of retail deposits, but as the Treasury Select Committee made clear in its excellent report &#147;Run on the Rock&#148;:</p>
<a name="80331-0027.htm_brev1"><a name="08040110000432"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;The cumulative effect was... to make the run on the deposits of Northern Rock more prolonged, and more damaging to the health of the company, than might otherwise have been the case.&#148;</p>

 Does my hon. Friend agree that there is a contradiction in that rapid repayment of the Treasury money requires contracting the business, whereas fattening the business up for resale requires growing it? It is quite difficult to understand how the management can do both.</p>

 Indeed. My right hon. Friend identifies an important issue at the heart of the matter. The business plan before us today in the form of the Chancellor&#146;s written ministerial statement talks about repayment of the loan, but does not provide a date by which Northern Rock will exit public ownership. There is a contradiction there, but the first priority must be to repay the loans to eliminate the taxpayer&#146;s exposure.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o528"><a name="80331-0027.htm_para20"><a name="08040110000293">Of course the problem that Northern Rock will have after the five months of dither and delay is that the business itself has made no progress in that time, as the interim management waited for the Treasury to decide what it would do with Northern Rock.

in stark contrast to the prompt action on Bear Stearns by the US authorities, which were able to organise a private sector solution over a weekend. Of course, we know from the Treasury Committee report and elsewhere that a private sector solution was on the table for Northern Rock before September, but it is clear that the Government turned it down. I wonder how much the Chancellor regrets making the decision back in August, when he washed himself of all sorts of problems, not to accept the offer that was apparently on the table at the time.</p>

 I share the hon. Gentleman&#146;s frustration about the use of the weekend takeover as an excuse not to act earlier. I think that I share his frustration that a Lloyds TSB bid was not accepted. I certainly share the frustration of many people that the Bank of England did not increase liquidity late last summer, when it could have done so. I understand what the Opposition are trying to do with the annulment motion today, but does he not feel that, if they annul the order, it might further weaken confidence in the banking sector, which is&#151;how can I put this gently&#151;rather brittle at the moment?</p>

 It would be to the benefit, because there are better solutions to Northern Rock&#146;s problems that the one before us today. We have argued that case for some time, and I shall touch on that briefly towards the end of my speech.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o529"><a name="80331-0027.htm_para21"><a name="08040110000296">To go back to the comparison with the US, Bear Stearns shareholders now have certainty over the value of their shares&#151;unlike Northern Rock shareholders, who have to wait until the independent valuer tells them how much their shares are worth. Of course, JP Morgan Chase will pay for the compensation and buy the shares, not the US taxpayer; whereas, in the UK, the UK taxpayer will have to compensate Northern Rock shareholders for the nationalisation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o530"><a name="80331-0027.htm_para22"><a name="08040110000297">In reality, although for some people nationalisation was the end of the story and the solution to the problem, it is not an end in itself and the publication of the business plan and accounts today demonstrates that. The two documents clearly point out the risks that the taxpayer has assumed as a consequence of nationalisation. The order transfers ownership of Northern Rock from its shareholders to the taxpayer, but it transfers the risks, too. The regulatory impact assessment published alongside the order gives no assessment of the risks assumed by the taxpayer. When the Chancellor signed off the RIA, he said that it represents a reasonable view of the likely costs and benefits, yet no numbers were attached to the RIA to back up that assertion; whereas the accounts and the business plan make plain the scale of the challenge that faces Northern Rock and therefore the risks borne by the taxpayer.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o532"><a name="80331-0027.htm_para24"><a name="08040110000299">Yet even the statement that the debt will be repaid by 2010 is at odds with the views of Ron Sandler, who wrote to Northern Rock customers&#151;I have here a letter that was passed to me by a mortgage holder at Northern Rock&#151;about repaying the bank&#146;s debt in full and said:</p>

They will come about as Northern Rock wants to shrink its mortgage book over the next three years. In 2011, its share of the mortgage market is forecast to be about 2.4 per cent. compared with 7.5 per cent. last year, and its assets will shrink from &#163;107 billion to &#163;49 billion.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o537"><a name="80331-0027.htm_para29"><a name="08040110000305">To achieve that, Northern Rock customers coming to the end of their fixed terms will need to be encouraged to move to other providers. In the current circumstances, that will be relatively straightforward for customers who present a low risk, who have low loan-to-value ratios on their mortgages, or who have good credit histories. Is there not a danger, however, that the more risky customers will have to stay with Northern Rock, thereby reducing the overall quality of its loan book and exposing taxpayers to greater risk of defaults&#151;and defaults would, of course, be a cost we would pick up? The overall quality of the loan book will deteriorate as people who cannot find an alternative are forced to stick with the standard variable rate that Northern Rock offers. Therefore, there is a risk to the value of the assets.</p>

It refers to net assets before fair value adjustments. Is that to do with further write-offs of structured investment vehicles, or is it to prepare us for the write-off of further Northern Rock assets? If there are further write-offs, will the taxpayer not have to pick up the tab?</p>

Northern Rock&#146;s impairment figures have deteriorated between two and three times the average of the Council of Mortgage Lenders figures for residential mortgages. The accounts also make it clear that the more aggressive approach to arrears that Northern Rock has introduced has led to a fourfold increase in the number of homes that it owns  <br>

That depends on Northern Rock&#146;s ability to rebuild depositor confidence. However, there is a challenge here, because we are now entering into a more competitive phase for deposits as a consequence of the closing off of wholesale markets to financial institutions. What assessment have the Government made of the likelihood of Northern Rock doubling its deposits by 2011, and what will be the impact on achieving the 2010 deadline if it does not?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o542"><a name="80331-0028.htm_para3"><a name="08040110000310">Will the Chief Secretary also confirm that the commitment given in the appendix to the business plan that Northern Rock will rank outside the top three in any one of the &#147;Moneyfacts&#148; retail deposits categories for the remainder of 2008 extend beyond then? One of the concerns raised when this House and the other place discussed the Banking (Special Provisions) Act 2008 was the impact that the Government guarantee arising through nationalisation could have on competition for both loans and savings. People are rightly concerned that Northern Rock might take advantage of its privileged status as a Government-backed bank to offer better rates than its competitors. Will the commitment on savings extend beyond 2008?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o543"><a name="80331-0028.htm_para4"><a name="08040110000311">The taxpayer&#146;s exposure to Northern Rock will depend not only on the loan book and the ability to rebuild customer deposits, but on the operating results of the company in public ownership. In 2007, it made a loss of &#163;141 million. The business plan predicts that it will make substantial losses in 2008 and will return to break-even only in 2011. How much will Northern Rock cost the taxpayer over the next three years, simply in terms of its operational results? In deciding to acquire Northern Rock, did the Treasury understand that it would be loss-making from 2008 onwards?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o544"><a name="80331-0028.htm_para5"><a name="08040110000312">My next point refers back to one made by my right hon. Friend the Member for Wokingham (Mr. Redwood). The plan sets out a timetable of the repayment for the taxpayer-backed loans and releasing the guarantee, but contains nothing to indicate when either the Government or Northern Rock expect the bank to return to the private sector. Will the Minister tell us whether or not privatisation will happen as soon as the loans are repaid? Have other conditions been set that will trigger the bank&#146;s privatisation?</p>

the Commission&#146;s approval of Northern Rock&#146;s business plan? Until that clarification is received there will clearly be an important uncertainty that affects the way in which the business is run. There are potential risks in respect of the objective that the taxpayer-backed loans will be repaid by 2010.

Can the Chief Secretary tell us why Parliament was not presented with the document earlier? Why did we have to wait until today&#146;s debate and the publication of today&#146;s accounts for the document to be placed in the Library?

nationalisation before it takes place, rather than debate it retrospectively. Parliament should have the power to veto these proposals, rather than be treated as a doormat by an over-mighty Executive.

The Government&#146;s mishandling of the Northern Rock crisis has led to the risk that taxpayers will not get back all the money we have lent to the bank. The repayment depends on the bank&#146;s ability to manage down the mortgage book and to rebuild customer deposits and the viability of the remaining business, EU state aid approval, and the state of the housing market. The Government have gambled our money on Ron Sandler and his management team, but we know it need not have been like this.

 We are debating the transfer order to take Northern Rock into temporary public ownership. I am disappointed that the hon. Member for Fareham (Mr. Hoban) and his party have chosen to pray against it. This morning, Northern Rock published its annual accounts for 2007 and a more detailed business plan. I shall refer to them in responding.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o555"><a name="80331-0028.htm_para16"><a name="08040110000324">We need to be clear about the purpose of the order. It will take Northern Rock into temporary public ownership in order to safeguard the financial stability of the banking system and the financial interests of the taxpayer. The Chancellor set out three objectives that have guided everything that we have done in relation to Northern Rock: maintaining financial stability; protecting consumers; and protecting the taxpayer. The decisions that we have made have shown how seriously we take the financial stability of the banking system. The Government are prepared to take strong action and make difficult decisions in order to safeguard that financial stability. Given the turbulence in the financial markets in the summer, the ongoing credit squeeze  and the series of problems with Northern Rock&#146;s business model in the autumn, it is clear that without intervention Northern Rock would have gone down. That would have had serious risks not only for  <br>

depositors and creditors but for the stability of the banking system. That would not have been in the public interest. That is why we took action and why it was right to do so. That is why we authorised the Bank of England to provide support and stepped in with the Government guarantee arrangements last autumn. That was supported by hon. Members from both sides of the House at the time.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o556"><a name="80331-0028.htm_para17"><a name="08040110000325">We have searched for alternative options, including private sector takeovers. In trying to ensure that we protect the taxpayer, we have made it clear that temporary public ownership is the best deal. That is in part because of the state of the market. The alternative deals were simply not good enough for the taxpayer.</p>

 Will the Chief Secretary enlighten the House on whether the Chancellor took advice or was given guidance during his discussions with the US Secretary of State, Secretary Paulson, on his experience in securing a rapid decision-making process to take a bank that was getting into difficulty into private sector ownership? What lessons did the Chancellor learn from those discussions?</p>

 Interestingly, the experience on the other side of the Atlantic has shown that banks across the world are facing serious pressures as a result of global economic and financial market turbulence. In many ways the situation with Bear Stearns was very different from that with Northern Rock. Bear Stearns is not a retail bank and does not have retail deposits, and so the implications for depositors as opposed to creditors were very different. There is a different legal framework and the situation was different as there were viable private sector offers on the table.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o557"><a name="80331-0028.htm_para18"><a name="08040110000328">Clearly, decisions have to be made about what is the best alternative in the circumstances faced in particular financial markets at particular times. Equally, it is important that we do not simply pretend that there are alternatives when they do not exist. That is why Opposition Members need to take a bit of responsibility. The decision was taken last autumn to support Northern Rock, through the Bank of England&#146;s loans and through Government guarantees. I reiterate my view that that was the right decision to take at the time, and it was supported in all parts of the House. Once it was taken, there were knock-on consequences that had to be faced up to. Opposition Members have repeatedly refused to do so.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o558"><a name="80331-0028.htm_para19"><a name="08040110000329">The hon. Member for Fareham repeatedly raised his concern that it was the decision to take Northern Rock into temporary public ownership that created exposure for the taxpayer. That is not the case. The taxpayer&#146;s exposure was created by the decisions that were taken in the autumn on both the Bank of England loan and the guarantees that were put in place. Having done that, and been clear that that was the right decision in the interests of protecting the financial stability of the banking system, it was then important that we ensured that the taxpayer&#146;s interest was protected. The options of insolvency, administration, Bank of England-led administration and wind-down, which were put forward by Opposition Members, would all have been a worse deal for the taxpayer than temporary public ownership and the business plan that we have now set out.</p>

 Surely the Chief Secretary can see that, if the Bank of England had simply acted as bank manager, and provided tough love to Northern Rock and managed it through it, we as taxpayers would not have had to absorb all the responsibilities and potential losses of sacking staff and losing on current trading. Will she confirm that she is accepting a business plan that means that the taxpayer will have to pay the losses in 2008, 2009 and 2010? Why do we need those as well?</p>

 The right hon. Gentleman describes what he says would have been &#147;tough love&#148; by the Bank of England in managing it through. I presume that he is talking about the proposal, which Opposition Members have described, of a Bank of England-led administration. That would effectively use powers that do not currently exist. We think that there is a strong case for introducing a new special resolution regime, and that that would be the right thing to do. However, it would involve major changes to the law and the current approach to insolvency and failing or troubled banks. It is right that such proposals should be consulted on seriously and introduced through legislation. For Opposition Members to pray in aid powers that simply do not exist on the statute book, and think that they would somehow magically come to the rescue of Northern Rock, is pie in the sky and irresponsible. They are simply not facing up to the serious problems that Northern Rock faced.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o559"><a name="80331-0028.htm_para20"><a name="08040110000332">As hon. Members know, Northern Rock&#146;s new management team has presented the Government with a detailed business plan for their approval. It details how the new board intends to repay the Bank of England&#146;s loan, release the Government guarantee arrangements and return the business to the private sector. It is based around four strategic priorities: to contract into a smaller, sustainable business, reducing the asset base; to repay the Bank of England loan by the end of 2010, while increasing the level of retail deposits, although keeping them below 2007 levels; to restructure the organisation and its operations; and to strengthen risk management in key areas. The bank envisages repaying the loan by 2010, and &#163;2.5 billion has already been repaid since the end of 2007.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o560"><a name="80331-0028.htm_para21"><a name="08040110000333">The business plan also addresses a concern that has been widely raised about Northern Rock&#146;s business model&#151;its excessive dependency on the wholesale funding markets&#151;and addresses that over-reliance by reducing the size of Northern Rock&#146;s asset base and also by increasing its retail deposit base. It is important, and we have stressed throughout, that Northern Rock should not cause unfair competition in the rest of the financial markets. The business plan recognises that. Although the retail deposits will increase over the next three years, both Northern Rock&#146;s level of retail deposits and its share of the retail savings market will remain lower than at the start of last summer. The competitive framework that Northern Rock published as part of its business plan also commits it to not appearing in the top three of the best-buy tables for the rest of 2008. The framework will be kept under review and will remain subject to the requirements of the European Commission.</p>

I remind Members that we have always said that we would engage in detailed discussions with the European Commission to make sure that we are compliant with the state-aid approach. With regard to the overall financial position for Northern Rock and for the taxpayer, we have made it clear that such an approach gives us the best deal for the taxpayer, who already had exposure as a result of the Bank of England loan and the guarantees that were put in place.</p>

 Today, Northern Rock set out in its accounts what its financial position was for 2007, and it has set out its business plan for the next few years. It has set out a clear framework as part of the business plan, which involves repaying the loans from the Bank of England. It is important for the taxpayer that the loans are repaid, and we should be clear that under the approach repeatedly proposed by Opposition Members those loans from the Bank of England would be at stake&#151;they would be put at risk. Opposition Members have never faced up to the fact that their completely incoherent and all-over-the-place approach would seriously put at risk not only support from the taxpayer as a result of the guarantees, but the approach taken by the Bank of England.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o562"><a name="80331-0029.htm_para0"><a name="08040110000345">Opposition Members have referred to the level of arrears as a result of Northern Rock&#146;s decisions. The level of arrears for Northern Rock has increased, just as it has across the market. However, it is still significantly below the Council of Mortgage Lenders average, so Northern Rock is in a very different position compared with other banks across the market. We know that Northern Rock had an unsustainable financial model; the bank needs to change its approach and it is right that it should do so. That is what the business plan does.</p>

It is right to reflect on whether alternatives were available and whether they are still available. Opposition Members have asked us to oppose the transfer order, as they believe that the decision should be reversed&#151;an utterly irresponsible approach at a time when the financial markets continue to be in global turbulence and when we face a continued credit squeeze in the markets. It was right to seek private sector alternatives, and we made no secret of the fact that we would have preferred such an alternative. We were not prepared to go with a private sector bid at any price&#151;we were determined to protect the taxpayer&#151;and that was the right thing to do.</p>

 The Minister said that she was not prepared to accept a deal at any price, and that is rather sensible. If all the stories are to be believed, however, early in the process it was going to be &#163;2 a share from Lloyds TSB with a &#163;10 billion credit line, which is a far better deal than &#163;110 billion of potential liabilities should it all go wrong. Surely to goodness, &#163;2 a share and a &#163;10 billion credit line is a much better deal than a potential liability of &#163;110 billion, which we are sitting on today.</p>

 I caution the hon. Gentleman against making decisions on the basis of speculation about different alternatives. The clear view of the tripartite authorities was that there was not a viable private sector alternative, and we spent time seeking such an alternative and seeking private sector bids. However, we have not received an appropriate private sector bid that meets the terms that we require to ensure that we get a good deal for the taxpayer. It is right that we should make such a requirement. Transferring Northern Rock into temporary public ownership, by contrast, means that the taxpayer will receive any upside from a future sale of the business, which better aligns risk with reward.</p>

 Once again, I have to remind Opposition Members that the decision that they supported in the autumn to support Northern Rock through Bank of England loans and Government guarantees exposed the taxpayer. Those decisions were supported by hon. Members at the time, and there are consequences that flow from that. As a result of those decisions at the time, it is important to ensure that the taxpayer&#146;s exposure is limited and their interest is protected.

 My hon. Friend makes an important point. The proposals set out in the business plan are for the contraction of the overall Northern Rock business, returning it to its more modest roots and putting it on a more sustainable footing. As a result, it is proposed that staffing should be reduced by about a third. We have had discussions with One NorthEast, and Northern Rock has had discussions with Unite trade union, to consult on job losses and make sure that people receive proper support to find new jobs. There are vacancies in the financial sector in the north-east, and it is important, when there are job losses on such a scale in a particular area, that serious support is available to help people find new jobs. Had we not stepped in in the autumn, which was the right thing to do to protect the financial stability of the banking system, we would have seen job losses across the board. We would have seen Northern Rock go under, so it would not have continued to be a significant employer in the north-east. The business plan envisages that Northern Rock will continue as a significant employer in the north-east, with a viable future for the operation.</p>

If people are looking to the United States for inspiration, the extent of the taxpayer commitment in the United States in terms of underwriting mortgage securities is far greater than any that has been undertaken in this country.

The Minister is right: not a great deal can be done about something that was undertaken when the bank was under private ownership and that is now subject to contractual arrangements. However, it sends the most appalling signal&#151;not just to the work force, but to the shareholders who have lost everything. We need at least to record that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o572"><a name="80331-0029.htm_para10"><a name="08040110000362">The other thing that the balance sheet brings out is the size of the Bank of England loan, which is &#163;28.5 billion. It is the first time that I have seen the figure in black and white. One of the problems has been that in the past we have had to deduce the figure indirectly from the accounts of the Bank of England. It is very odd that the Bank refuses to disclose that important piece of information and that we have eventually got it in precise terms from the balance sheet of the company. That is an odd approach to freedom of information, and I hope that it will be rectified.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o573"><a name="80331-0029.htm_para11"><a name="08040110000363">The other issue, which has already been touched on several times, is the profit and loss account, the summary and the operating and financial review, and the deterioration that took place between the &#163;626 million profit and the &#163;167 million loss. Several items are worth commenting on. For the most part, we are talking about exceptional items. There is a very large sum&#151;&#163;127 million&#151;for non-recurring administrative expenses, and a large chunk of that is for professional fees. I do not know whether the Chief Secretary is responding to the debate, but if she is, will she explain the process by which the professional fees of the lawyers and advisers have translated through to the bank?</p>

those have been accepted and some rejected, but it seems that as much as &#163;50 million may well have made its way to the company. It would be useful to have some reassurance that the more outrageous claims have been pruned out&#151;because some of them were outrageous. The largest quantitative sums were the impairment charges, which were &#163;658 million. That sounds like an awful lot of money, but it is a great deal less than 1 per cent. of the assets. Given the doubts that are now beginning to creep in about the quality of the assets, the figure strikes me as conservative rather than very large.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o575"><a name="80331-0029.htm_para13"><a name="08040110000365">A second set of questions relates to the business plan. The hon. Member for Fareham made the right points on that: there is clearly a tension between the attempts to get taxpayers&#146; money back as quickly as possible and preparing the company for eventual sale. If the two objectives are not in direct competition, they are certainly in tension. I understand that the current management are redeeming mortgages and realising cash from that, and also trying to sell them on to other banks; inevitably, the better-quality mortgages are being sold on. That raises the issue of whether the latter stages of the repayment of the taxpayer will be achieved. The question that we need to answer is about not merely whether there is a general commitment to repay the taxpayer by 2010, but what the specific staging posts are, and how much we can expect to be repaid and when.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o576"><a name="80331-0029.htm_para14"><a name="08040110000366">The third set of points relates to the quality of the assets. My understanding of this has advanced a little since our previous debate, much of which centred on Granite. There was concern that the Granite mechanism potentially transferred into the Granite vehicle the bank&#146;s better-quality mortgages. When I talked to the new chairman about this&#151;I think it is public knowledge and I am not breaching any confidentiality in the conversation&#151;he sought to reassure me that there is a computer model at the bank that ensures that the mortgages that go into Granite are chosen entirely at random, so they are a mixture of good and bad. If so, there may well be problems with Granite but they will not result in the sort of cumulative impairment that we were worried about. None the less, there are clearly problems with many of the mortgages that were advanced last year, and I would expect the repossession problem and the difficulties flowing from that to get progressively worse over the next year or so.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o577"><a name="80331-0029.htm_para15"><a name="08040110000367">Let me say a little about a controversial matter. Several of us have had e-mails during the day from shareholders who see this transfer order as a mechanism for raising again the issue of compensation. I support the Government&#146;s view that the argument that there needs to be some kind of fair settlement in the direction of generous compensation is unrealistic. The simple fact is that the valuation of the shares before nationalisation was based almost entirely on artificial Government support, and it is unrealistic to expect substantial compensation in those conditions. The hon. Member for Fareham talked about the helpful certainty of the Bear Stearns compensation. I am sure he followed that as closely as I did, but my understanding was that the shareholders were offered about 2 per cent. of the value of the shares and, after a lot of negotiation over a two or three-day period, that was increased to about 10 per cent. However, it was  <br>

This is clearly not just a Northern Rock problem; many of the other banks are rocky as well. As has happened in the United States, we will get continuing pressure from the rest of the banking system for the public sector to take over the risks and for it to retain the potential upsides of any improvement. The Governor of the Bank of England is under a lot of pressure from the City and financial commentators to take over poor assets and poor mortgages in return for liquidity. He is absolutely right to take a strong line on that. I believe that the Bank of England&#146;s position has changed slightly and it is now willing to accept mortgage assets in return for liquidity while insisting that they are of very high quality.</p>

Before we can agree to any order, therefore, we have to be satisfied that the arrangements will be satisfactorily monitored by the FSA. I should add in passing that Northern Rock will not be a publicly owned company for the purposes of the Freedom of Information Act&#151;a key element in the whole Northern Rock picture. After the regulatory failure of Northern Rock as a public company, is the Minister satisfied that there will be adequate resolution of that issue by the FSA with regard to Northern Rock in its new state? It is worth remembering that the reliance on wholesale markets helped to bring Northern Rock down when banks became reluctant to lend to each other.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o585"><a name="80331-0030.htm_para1"><a name="08040110000379">The interest rate offers on the website that I mentioned are pretty generous. Despite the modifications to the business plan, we must consider what is happening in the marketplace today. For example, LIBOR, which is the interbank lending rate, is back over 6 per cent.&#151;its highest level since 27 December. That indicates the real nervousness among financial institutions, despite the additional liquidity provided by the Bank of England. In the build-up to the situation that confronted us, we saw the failure of the tripartite system introduced by the Prime Minister. Given the poor regulatory performance of the FSA, what assurances can we get that it will meet regularly and monitor lending and borrowing practices carefully? Given the clear illiquidity I referred to in the wholesale markets&#151;and there is real pressure out there&#151;will the FSA work closely with the Bank of England? There is no easy divide between liquidity, compliance and solvency. Last summer, the FSA presumed that the Bank of England would provide sufficient liquidity to bail out failing banks. We have to see the order in that context.</p>

of Bear Stearns with the support of the Federal Reserve. The point for us to consider when comparing Bear Stearns with the fiasco of Northern Rock is simply this: it is impossible to discern, because we cannot get a clear answer, what the Lloyds TSB offerings happened to be. However, we know enough to know that something could have been worked up to ensure a satisfactory takeover, but something called &#147;the general election&#148; intervened.

having the best possible security for the taxpayer and the best possible supervision and management overlooking the board, as a bank manager should do, to ensure that the money would be repaid in good time. That was the obvious thing to do.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o591"><a name="80331-0030.htm_para7"><a name="08040110000388">The problem with the current model is that the Government are trying to do two contradictory things. Of course, the Chief Secretary is right to tell the House that she views getting back the &#163;24 billion&#151;the remaining outstanding loan, we were told tonight&#151;as an urgent priority. I suspect that she can do that and I wish her every success. We all represent taxpayers and it is important that we get the money back. It is also important that the Bank of England get its money back as quickly as possible because it is a small bank trying to deal with a large and complex system. All the time that it is so committed to Northern Rock, it does not have the firepower that it needs to deal with the obvious imperfections and difficulties in the money market.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o592"><a name="80331-0030.htm_para8"><a name="08040110000389">How can we get the money back? The Government and the bank&#146;s recently appointed management admit that the money will be repaid&#151;we trust in reasonable time&#151;by squeezing the business, perhaps halving it, getting people to repay their mortgages early because they remortgaged with someone else and making sure that new advances are not made through Northern Rock to replace advances that are maturing as people pay them off, so that business can be transferred to other organisations in the financial world, and some of the assets can perhaps be sold on, as appropriate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o593"><a name="80331-0030.htm_para9"><a name="08040110000390">That is a perfectly good working model for getting the Treasury money back, but it is not what the owners of a bank would be doing if they were trying to sell it on to someone else for maximum value. Indeed, doing so will diminish the value of the assets under control, because the bank will have to battle constantly to cut its costs, by sacking its staff and reducing its administrative overheads, to bring it closer to the reality of the falling revenue. Instead of having one or two years of rising profits before returning the business to the private market, which would be best for securing a good price, we have been told tonight that it will definitely have three years of losses. We know, too, that it will have a much smaller business, so it will be quite difficult for it to explain how it can suddenly turn all that round.</p>

 Does the right hon. Gentleman accept that the logic of what he is saying points to a longer period for the repayment of the bank&#146;s loan than the period to 2010 and to putting less pressure, by the reduction of business, on the rest of an already struggling mortgage market?</p>

 I do not think that the circle can be squared. If the loan were made permanent for, say, 10 years, it would give the business more chance, but there would then be enormous competition issues with the European Union, which might prevent it from exploiting that chance. Indeed, my next point is that given that the Government are forecasting perhaps three years of quite serious losses, they will have to argue hard to our bosses in Europe that they are not making a direct Treasury subsidy to allow unfair competition, even though the business is slimming itself down.</p>

Friend the Member for Fareham (Mr. Hoban) has already put his finger on the issue, which is that although it would be quite easy to defend ourselves against a charge of anti-competitive practices in making new advances, because the business would be shrinking its advances portfolio, it would be more difficult to defend against that charge on the deposit front. I looked at the Northern Rock site today, as many others preparing for this debate no doubt did too, and saw offers of 6 per cent. with the full Treasury guarantee. That seems a pretty attractive rate, but a justification will need to be made to the competition authorities in Brussels if such rates are supported by direct Treasury subsidy, because the company is a loss-making business offering those rates to collect capital to replenish its capital base.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o595"><a name="80331-0030.htm_para11"><a name="08040110000394">We have a business with two conflicting aims. I trust that the repayment of the moneys will be completed before the next general election&#151;it would be a neat order to do so&#151;but the Government will then have a weakened, loss-making business with far fewer staff and an unpleasant impact on the north-east, which is one of the tragedies of the situation that they have created, that will be quite difficult to return to market for a sensible price. Ministers must accept that they are responsible not just for getting back the &#163;24 billion that has been lent, but for getting a fair value for the assets that they have taken over, rather than going through three of four years of writing them down, showing that they are impaired, losing lots of money on them and ending up with a second set of losses for the taxpayer, in addition to the running annual loss that will have to be paid for out of taxpayers&#146; money, as the Chief Secretary knows but will not admit, because once someone owns 100 per cent. of the shares, they are clearly responsible for paying the losses.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o596"><a name="80331-0030.htm_para12"><a name="08040110000395">There are other oddities. It is interesting that Northern Rock appointed new non-executive directors on &#163;90,000 a year, plus &#163;10,000 for every committee, shortly before the nationalisation went through. Will that become the standard level of remuneration for such posts in the public sector, or will an attempt be made to bring Northern Rock into line with the more normal public sector levels? That is an issue for Ministers, who have naturally been telling the public sector that they want good wage and salary control, because they are worried about the inflationary effects of doing otherwise.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o597"><a name="80331-0030.htm_para13"><a name="08040110000396">One interesting point to emerge in the business plan is that there is to be a continued transfer of new money into the Northern Rock Foundation. We have been promised a minimum of &#163;15 million, but we have to ask whether that has been through the proper public expenditure assessment processes and whether other parts of the country would be eligible for such treatment, as we are now talking about a public subvention to a particular part of the country for particular purposes.</p>

I think that they have set themselves an impossible task.</p>

 It is a great pleasure to follow my right hon. Friend the Member for Wokingham (Mr. Redwood), whose closing remarks form a pr&#233;cis of the calamitous state of affairs regarding the nationalisation of Northern Rock that economics students will, in years to come, turn to first to get a proper understanding of what went wrong. The Chief Secretary to the Treasury has unfortunately again left the Chamber. It seems to be becoming a habit that whenever I stand up she goes off, perhaps to get help. I shall start my remarks by explaining to her colleague, the Exchequer Secretary to the Treasury, why the parallel with Bear Stearns is so pertinent; Ministers seem to have failed to pick up on that. I am pleased to see the Chief Secretary return. I should tell her that I am trying to explain why the parallel with Bear Stearns is so clear and direct.</p>

They received an indicative proposal that was dependent on substantial, Government-guaranteed financing. If the authorities had sat round a table in the same room as the financiers, just as Secretary Paulson did with JPMorgan Chase, a deal would have been done over the weekend, and the Government would have avoided all their subsequent problems. It is for the Government to reflect on why that did not happen, and to repent for years to come.</p>

that Northern Rock&#146;s asset book is good, and that Northern Rock was solvent. He was confident about that because he had been told by the Financial Services Authority that that was the case. One of the final notes of the accounts&#151;note 41(B) on capital management, on page 99&#151;says that on 19 April 2007, the FSA was told that</p>
<a name="80331-0030.htm_brev0"><a name="08040121000086"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Northern Rock&#146;s regulatory capital was below the capital requirement imposed by the FSA by &#163;85.5m&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o603"><a name="80331-0030.htm_para19"><a name="08040121000011">As long ago as last spring, months before the problems emerged in the credit markets, the FSA was aware that Northern Rock was operating outside its capital regime. However, it did little about it&#151;so little, indeed, that despite its having identified Northern Rock as one of the so-called high-impact firms, its regulatory regime was so lax that its own internal review, published last week, describes it as being</p>
<a name="80331-0030.htm_brev1"><a name="08040121000087"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;at the extreme end of the spectrum&#148;</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o604"><a name="80331-0030.htm_para20"><a name="08040121000012">of regulation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o605"><a name="80331-0030.htm_para21"><a name="08040121000013">The FSA&#146;s decision that, alone among 38 high-impact firms, Northern Rock did not need a risk mitigation programme implies considerable scrutiny during &#147;close and continuous&#148; meetings. However, it is clear from the FSA&#146;s commendably frank and candid appraisal of its own performance that the number of such meetings held by the FSA in the three years from 2005 until 2007 amounted to none in 2005, one in 2006 and seven in 2007. Of the seven, five took place on the same day&#151;I would describe that as a single meeting&#151;and two took place by telephone. I calculate that that represents an average of less than one day of meetings per year during the three years in which Northern Rock was supposedly a high-impact firm. The organisation in which the Chancellor has placed such confidence said repeatedly that Northern Rock was a good bank, solvent and with good assets. It beggars belief that the Chancellor can have placed such trust in the regulator, given its performance over that period.</p>

That &#163;432 million is now guaranteed by the taxpayer, although the company itself admits that the loans were greater than the security on which they were pledged. As for the second-worst-secured assets, those with a 95 to 100 per cent. loan-to-value ratio, the figures are remarkable. Since the end of 2006 the amount lent increased from &#163;2.1 billion to &#163;4.1 billion, an increase of &#163;2 billion.</p>

 I readily agree that the overall book has increased substantially, which means that all categories of loan have increased. My point is that the risk of the book has increased significantly over the year&#151;and this is the book that the Chancellor keeps telling us is of very high quality. The least-high-quality lending has risen by nearly &#163;2.5 billion, and that is the part that is most at risk, not least given what is happening in our present housing-market environment.</p>

 Perhaps my hon. Friend will remind Labour Members that there are a good many unsecured loans as well. People were being lent 125 per cent. or so of the value of the houses involved, including the top-up unsecured loans, and I believe that the 2007 accounts show particularly large increases in provision against those unsecured loans.</p>

 I am very grateful to my right hon. Friend for reminding me of that. Indeed, the unsecured lending book is of the order of &#163;7.7 billion as at the end of 2007 and the impairment charge was in excess of &#163;200 million, much of which was secured against that portfolio.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o608"><a name="80331-0030.htm_para24"><a name="08040121000020">Hometrack, which provides one of the widest analyses of the housing market, published some statistics today confirming that we have entered the sixth month in a row of declining house prices. The increase in high-risk residential mortgages places a sharper focus on the Chancellor&#146;s confidence that the book will be good and that taxpayers&#146; money will be secure. I wish I could share his confidence.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o609"><a name="80331-0030.htm_para25"><a name="08040121000021">In an earlier discussion of the possible consequences of administration, the Chief Secretary referred to its leading to fire sales of assets. Of course, we have been in a state of uncertainty over this company since mid-September, and the company has successfully sold a portfolio of assets&#151;its commercial loans&#151;for a premium over the book value at a time of considerable uncertainty for the company as a whole. That firmly demolishes the argument that an administration would have somehow made it more likely that losses would have been incurred on the sale of the loan portfolios. Good assets will sell for a good price in these circumstances irrespective, as has just been proven, of whether the company is in distress.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o610"><a name="80331-0030.htm_para26"><a name="08040121000022">That brings me on to my main point, which also comes out of a reading of the accounts. Much was made in earlier debates about Granite of whether or not the business plan will feed the beast. Enough has already been said about that this evening. However, Northern Rock established another financial vehicle, which has not been referred to in previous debates. I refer to the Saphir Finance vehicle, a special purpose vehicle, which issued &#163;400 million in tier 1 notes; they were issued against the &#163;400 million of preference shares issued by Northern Rock. The preference shares were provided as collateral to the holders of the notes issued by Saphir Finance.</p>

I am not sure whether she is able to give us that assurance now. I am more than willing to give way to her&#151;<i> [Interruption.] </i>She indicates that she is not in a position to do so, so perhaps she will be kind enough to write to me&#151;<i> [Interruption.] </i>Once again, she is not indicating either way.</p>

 She will be happy to write to me about that. I am very grateful because the issue is causing concern outside this place. Given the lack of information about how the Government intend to implement the transfer order and compensate shareholders if any compensation is due, if the Government choose to ignore the standard ranking of securities, it will blow another hole in the confidence of financial institutions in the Government&#146;s respect for the ordinary workings of the market. I am not arguing that preference shareholders should necessarily receive anything, as that will come down to a judgment on what compensation should be paid at all; but if any compensation is due, it is due first to the preference shareholders, and if that does not happen, I would urge the Chief Secretary to think very carefully, as it will raise ripples right across the financial sector. The House will be pleased to hear that that brings me to my final point.</p>

Friend the Member for Wokingham asked a question about the business plan objectives that are set out quite succinctly in the annual report, both in the executive chairman&#146;s statement and in the operating financial review, where the company&#146;s objectives are referred to as, first, the repayment of the Bank of England debt; secondly, the release of Her Majesty&#146;s Treasury&#146;s guarantee; and thirdly, a successful return of the company to the private sector. Where within those objectives sits the priority donation out of income&#151;by the way, the company is generating none at the moment&#151;of &#163;15 million to good causes? Of course, we would all like to give plenty of money to good causes, but it is not within the company&#146;s objectives. The company is not generating a profit at the moment, so out of what pot of reserves will it make such a payment for 2007 and subsequent years if profits are not made?</p>

 Perhaps the hon. Gentleman could make it clear whether the Conservatives&#146; position is that those moneys should not be made available to the Northern Rock Foundation.

 I understand the hon. Gentleman&#146;s enthusiasm for spending money in his region, but that is not the point. I am trying to make a point not about whether a company should distribute money that it does not have, but about the fact that the Government have made a determination that Northern Rock, which is being nationalised and is owned by the Government, will make that payment&#151;but from where?

 We have had a very full debate on the order. I was a little disappointed in the Chief Secretary&#146;s speech. I expected that she would set out very clearly the rationale for the Government nationalising Northern Rock, that there would be some substance to her arguments and that we would not have to rely on the vague assertions that this represents a better deal for the taxpayer, without some information to prove that that was so. She gave us no comfort on the quality of assets that the taxpayer will acquire. Northern Rock&#146;s payment ratios are deteriorating faster than those of the industry as a whole. She gave us no comfort that taxpayers would get all their money back. She said that this was the best deal possible, without providing the substance to demonstrate that it is the best deal possible.</p>

The Treasury has access to all the financial information that supports the plan, and I am disappointed that she chose not to share those figures with the House, because that indicates that a significant loss could occur over the next three years. Ron Sandler refers to a substantial loss. The taxpayer would be right to be concerned about their exposure going forward as a consequence of the transfer order before us. The Chief Secretary talks about there being no alternative, but the reality is that the Government have yet to prove the case for nationalisation, have yet to make the substantive arguments that this House deserves to hear, and have yet to be fulsome in disclosure of information about Northern Rock&#146;s financial position going forward in their forecasts and projections. They are just hoping that the money will be repaid by 2010. Even Ron Sandler is not giving Northern Rock customers that same degree of assurance.</p>

petition I seek to present this evening relates to the Perry family of Thorpe Thewles in my constituency. Mr. Perry went to South Africa many years ago and met Karen, his current wife. Having married, they had three sons and after many years Mr. Perry repatriated himself to this country, took up a secure job and established a home in Thorpe Thewles, and was joined by his wife who, sadly, did not take care of her travel documents and was then considered to be out of time as far as immigration status is concerned. This is an example of the triumph of bureaucracy over common sense or the formulation of arid regulation without any degree of human compassion&#151;or perhaps if Mrs. Perry had been born fleet of foot and had expressed a wish to represent England in the Olympics and change her name to Zola Budd, it might not have been necessary for me to present this petition.</p>

 The outcome of this debate will decide whether an elderly constituent of mine, Betty Phillips, will spend her remaining years supported by the love and care of her daughter and granddaughter or separated, lonely and at risk.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o628"><a name="80331-0031.htm_para17"><a name="08040121000052">The issue that I wish specifically to address is the prospective deportation of Deborah Phillips, the daughter of my constituent, Betty Phillips. That deportation is a matter of weeks away if the Minister does not use his powers to act. Let me start by describing Deborah and how she came to be in the position she is in today. The story starts when Betty, Deborah&#146;s mother, falls in love with a sailor in the US navy, a world war two veteran, when he is on shore leave in Hull. They then get married, and go to live in America, where they live on a variety of military bases. Deborah was born in 1959 and her brother David was born in 1962. In 1963, the family returned to Hull. Mr. Phillips, who was an American citizen, got indefinite leave to remain in the UK, as did their children, and he took a job at the university, where he stayed until he retired in 1992.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o629"><a name="80331-0031.htm_para18"><a name="08040121000053">Deborah grew up in, and was educated in, Hull from the age of three. After leaving school, she worked in Hull city council&#146;s offices until she was 21. She then joined the US navy, where she remained until she retired. Her US navy record always showed her home address as England. During the period between 1981 and 1990, on returning to the UK her passport was variously stamped first, &#147;Indefinite leave to remain&#148; and then, &#147;Allowed to enter for six months.&#148; She wrongly assumed the latter to be a mistake. That was an error on her part, but one that was encouraged when her new passport in 1990 was once again stamped, &#147;Indefinite leave to remain.&#148; She knew that she would have to get the stamp issue resolved, but assumed that that would be a simple administrative issue. She had never had any trouble returning to England, and, despite her American citizenship, thought of herself as English. That is hardly surprising, given that she had grown up in England. The issue did not strike her as important&#151;wrongly, of course.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o630"><a name="80331-0031.htm_para19"><a name="08040121000054">It is true to say that at that point the needs of her parents were not pressing, but in 2003, her father was diagnosed with Alzheimer&#146;s disease and she returned home to Hull to help her mother care for him. By then, she had a daughter of her own&#151;Alexandra. Deborah helped her mother to nurse her father until he died. After he died, the family went on holiday together to Corfu in June 2005. On re-entering the UK, she was told that she did not have leave to remain and that she had two months to rectify the problem. She was told at that point that indefinite leave to remain ceases after two years outside the UK, but she had been provided with no previous advice on this either from the Home Office or at any time after she had re-entered the UK.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o631"><a name="80331-0031.htm_para20"><a name="08040121000055">From that point on, Deborah started a series of applications to obtain indefinite leave to remain in the United Kingdom, the first of which was in August 2005. She was told that it would take three weeks, but  <br>


<meta name="Date" content="31 Mar 2008">

<notus-date day="31" month="3" year="2008" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><b>31 Mar 2008 : Column 602</b><br>
instead it took seven months. As the Home Office retained her passports, she was also unable to return to America to bury her father&#146;s ashes in Arlington national cemetery. At the end of the seven months, her application was refused and she was told to leave the country.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o632"><a name="80331-0031.htm_para21"><a name="08040121000056">Deborah made her second application from America, and then returned to Britain to return her child Alexandra to the school in Hull to which she was accustomed. After that application failed, she and her daughter were in effect deported. Her third application was also turned down. She stayed in America between May 2006 and June 2007, where she and her daughter lived from motel to motel. They had no particular place in which to live. Her mother, Betty, had to go out to America in July 2006 for a surgical operation because she had nobody to look after her here in Britain. In June 2007, Betty fell ill with a series of mini strokes and so Deborah rushed back to the UK on a military flight.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o633"><a name="80331-0031.htm_para22"><a name="08040121000057">Let us be clear that Betty Phillips is 80 years old, and although she is a robust Yorkshire lady in many ways, she is physically very frail, and is in constant need of help. As each month passes she, of course, grows more fail. From Deborah&#146;s arrival in Britain last year, there have been a series of stays of deportation, the latest of which runs out in some weeks&#146; time. We are now in a position where a daughter of my constituent, who received her entire education in Hull&#151;whose own daughter is more used to English education than any other&#151;and who wants simply to care for her mother is on the brink of being deported. She will not be a burden on the state, because she has a pension from the American navy. She is indeed likely to save the state money, as she will be looking after her mother, who would otherwise be dependent on state care. She will create no housing pressure, because she will stay with her mother. Most importantly, her mother would not have to face the emotional agony of having her daughter and granddaughter wrenched away from her at a fragile time of her life.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o634"><a name="80331-0031.htm_para23"><a name="08040121000058">Frankly, if I wanted to score easy political points it would be too simple. I could ask why Deborah is being wrongly deported, in my view, when the Government cannot deport Muktar Ibrahim, the 21/7 bomber, or Mustaf Jamma, who has been charged with the murder of Sharon Beshenivsky. I could ask why Deborah has to be deported when the murderer of Philip Lawrence cannot be. I could list rapists, murderers and terrorists galore whom we cannot deport, while the daughter and carer of my 80-year-old constituent cannot stay.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o635"><a name="80331-0031.htm_para24"><a name="08040121000059">Those questions were certainly put to me by Mrs. Betty Phillips, and they are questions for which I have no answer. I do not want to score political points. I have a great deal of respect for the Minister and I simply want a civilised answer that prevents this terrible prospect for Mrs. Phillips. I suspect the Minister is as conscious as I am that, whatever the technicalities, Deborah Phillips is a victim of a weakness in the law that means that someone born of a British father before 1961 has a right to citizenship, but someone born of a British mother at the same time does not have that right. That morally dubious distinction arises, I believe, from a mistake in the legislation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o636"><a name="80331-0031.htm_para25"><a name="08040121000060">The British Nationality Act 1981 was amended by the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002, which inserted new section 4C to correct an historical  <br>


<meta name="Date" content="31 Mar 2008">

<notus-date day="31" month="3" year="2008" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><b>31 Mar 2008 : Column 603</b><br>
wrong and an historical discrimination. The discrimination that the amendment sought to correct was that before 1983 legitimate children born to a British mother and foreign father would not become British citizens by descent through the maternal line, whereas if they were born abroad to a father of British descent and a mother who was a foreign national, they became a British citizen by descent through the paternal line.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o637"><a name="80331-0031.htm_para26"><a name="08040121000061">Unfortunately for Deborah, the new law to correct the discrimination, that is section 4C of the 1981 Act, was limited to children born after 7 February 1961. Deborah was born on 5 November 1959. Therefore she still does not benefit from Parliament&#146;s intention to correct the historical wrong. The issue is even more profound in her case, as her brother, David Phillips, who was also born in the US, was born on 20 March 1962 and therefore qualifies to register as a British citizen. The law therefore discriminates between Deborah and her brother, even though they have the same parents, were born in the same place, and were born only two years and four months apart. That is ludicrous.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o638"><a name="80331-0031.htm_para27"><a name="08040121000062">A further policy consideration arises from the case. There will not be a large number of people in the same situation as Deborah Phillips, but a high proportion of those who are will have parents who are entering an era of frailty as they enter their &#146;70s, &#146;80s and even &#146;90s. Those parents need support from their adult children.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o639"><a name="80331-0031.htm_para28"><a name="08040121000063">My request to the Minister is straightforward. First, in the legislation that he is due to introduce to the House, will he please review the operation of the law to correct the anomaly? Secondly, since any change in the law will be too late for Deborah, will he use his discretion to allow Deborah Phillips to stay in the United Kingdom? That is acutely necessary in this case at this time, since a change in the law that comes into effect tomorrow&#151;in fact, in precisely 17 minutes&#151;means that if Deborah has to leave the UK, she will not be allowed back in for 10 years, as far as I can tell, under any circumstances. That means that she will not be allowed even to visit her mother, whatever the circumstances, because the effect of the law is mandatory. So, no matter how ill her mother is, no matter what goes wrong, no matter what the circumstances, Deborah will not even be able to visit her.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o640"><a name="80331-0031.htm_para29"><a name="08040121000064">I repeat that my request is straightforward. We all like to claim that our preferred immigration policy is both firm and fair, but both parts are important. Policies should be both firm and fair. Let the Minister demonstrate today that he believes that too, and prevent Mrs. Betty Phillips from having to live out the latter stages of her life in loneliness and unhappiness, forcibly separated from her daughter and granddaughter by a law that was simply not thought through properly.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o641"><a name="80331-0031.htm_para30"><a name="08040121000065">The Minister is a civilised man. I hope that he will give us a civilised answer to the problem.</p>

consensus in all parts of the House that is sometimes not revealed or seen in the public domain. Tonight may be another example of the consensus between us being greater than the things that divide us.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o642"><a name="80331-0032.htm_para0"><a name="08040121000067">The right hon. Member for Haltemprice and Howden (David Davis) mentioned a specific case in his constituency, but it raises wider points of policy, as he said, which will command the attention of the House both this evening and, I hope, in months to come. I thank him for the courteous and careful way in which he has made representations to me over the past few months.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o643"><a name="80331-0032.htm_para1"><a name="08040121000068">I congratulate the <i> Hull Daily Mail </i>on championing the case. I have not always agreed with the direction of its editorial policy, but judging by some e-mails that I received this afternoon&#151;from the right hon. Gentleman&#146;s constituents, I think&#151;telling me that many local people disagree with the <i> Hull Daily Mail</i>, it is doing something that it feels is right even if it is not popular with all sections of its readership.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o644"><a name="80331-0032.htm_para2"><a name="08040121000069">I wish to delineate two issues: the way in which decisions are made, and why they are made. Those are the wider policy issues to which the right hon. Gentleman alluded. I shall conclude by proposing a way forward. The basic chronology of the case is a matter of agreement between us. As the right hon. Gentleman said, Deborah Phillips was born in the United States and spent the first years of her life there. She came to the United Kingdom and spent a considerable period of her childhood and early adulthood here before returning to the United States. In other words, although she was educated in the UK, she built her life in the United States, in the services and then, I think, in business. I believe that her brother remains there.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o645"><a name="80331-0032.htm_para3"><a name="08040121000070">I first wish to set out how decisions are taken. It is often forgotten in the public debate that it is rarely Ministers who make such decisions. The decisions are taken by independent Crown civil servants and, often, independent immigration judges. In this case, the right hon. Gentleman&#146;s constituent failed in her appeal to the asylum and immigration tribunal in December 2006. The judge found that:</p>
<a name="80331-0032.htm_brev0"><a name="08040121000092"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;The situation as between mother and daughter&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o646"><a name="80331-0032.htm_para4"><a name="08040121000071">was not</p>
<a name="80331-0032.htm_brev1"><a name="08040121000093"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;so exceptional that to deprive her of the right...to live with her mother would place this country in breach of its obligations under Article 8 of the Human Rights Convention&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o647"><a name="80331-0032.htm_para5"><a name="08040121000072">In reaching its finding, the AIT held that Miss Phillips&#146;s mother was financially independent and could afford to pay for her own care, that her mother had travelled to the United States in 2006 for an operation, and that Miss Phillips had a brother in the US. That is simply a summary of some of the things that the judge said.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o648"><a name="80331-0032.htm_para6"><a name="08040121000073">I do not think that when judges make decisions of such force and clarity the House would want Ministers overturning them left, right and centre. The question that we must turn to is whether the framework within which the judgment was made was not quite right, and whether justice demands a different solution. In this case, as the right hon. Gentleman set out, the question is whether the framework of the British Nationality Act 1981 and its amendments is quite right.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o649"><a name="80331-0032.htm_para7"><a name="08040121000074">Before 1983, British women were unable to pass on citizenship, but there was discretion in the British Nationality Act 1948 to confer citizenship on any minor  <br>

by registration. That was why Merlyn Rees, when he was Home Secretary, said on 7 February 1979 that he would exercise discretion in favour of any minor of a UK-born mother who applied for registration before his or her 18th birthday. In other words, that concession would benefit anybody born after 1961, as long as they registered before their 18th birthday.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o650"><a name="80331-0032.htm_para8"><a name="08040121000075">In the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002, this Government widened that concession through an amendment to the 1981 Act, which meant that people could register after the age of 18. The nub of the argument was that there may well have been children in some parts of the world who were unaware of the proceedings of the House of Commons, incredible as that might seem. New section 4C was introduced and added on Third Reading in the Lords without dispute.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o651"><a name="80331-0032.htm_para9"><a name="08040121000076">However, the problem in the right hon. Gentleman&#146;s case is that the provision does not help Ms Phillips, as she was born before 1961, in 1959. That issue was addressed by Lord Filkin in 2002, when he said:</p>
<a name="80331-0032.htm_brev2"><a name="08040121000094"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;British women did not acquire the right to pass on their citizenship until 1983. One can only go so far towards righting the wrongs of history before the number of &#145;what ifs&#146; to be taken into account becomes unmanageable.&#148;&#151;[<i> Official Report, House of Lords,</i> 31 October 2002; Vol. 640, c. 295-6.]</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o652"><a name="80331-0032.htm_para10"><a name="08040121000077">Any geographical or time limitation in the new registration provision would have produced hard-luck cases. At the time, the Government felt justified in drawing a line around people who, had they applied in time, would have been registered as citizens under the terms of the policy in 1979. Nevertheless, the Government accept that those born to British mothers before 1961 are at a disadvantage, so I can confirm that we shall seek to bring forward a legislative remedy at an early stage, perhaps in the immigration reform Bill we have already proposed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o653"><a name="80331-0032.htm_para11"><a name="08040121000078">Ms Phillips is one of the hard-luck cases referred to by Lord Filkin, so the question for us is whether there is a unique combination of factors that warrants leave outside the rules.

people in that category; none the less it is important to look first at whether there are particular extenuating circumstances, and in this case I believe there are.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o654"><a name="80331-0032.htm_para12"><a name="08040121000079">Many of those circumstances could come under the existing carer&#146;s concession in the immigration rules. It allows Ministers and caseworkers to exercise discretion, and in compassionate circumstances a period of leave of up to 12 months can be granted. I think that that would be appropriate in this case because of a combination of factors that include the following: first, Ms Phillips&#146;s role as her mother&#146;s full-time carer; secondly, Ms Phillips&#146;s inability to apply for citizenship, as a result of the legislation that I propose soon to amend; thirdly, the length of time of Ms Phillips&#146;s residence in the UK; fourthly, the ties that Ms Phillips&#146;s daughter has built up during their four years&#146; residence in the UK&#151;as the right hon. Gentleman told me last week, and confirmed today, her daughter is in school in the UK; and finally, and perhaps most important, the news that the right hon. Gentleman conveyed to me about Deborah Phillips&#146;s mother&#146;s condition and the role that Deborah Phillips wants to take as her carer.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o655"><a name="80331-0032.htm_para13"><a name="08040121000080">The combination of those factors points to a requirement on me to exercise discretion in this case, so it is appropriate to grant leave of 12 months, exceptionally, outside the rules.</p>
