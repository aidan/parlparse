<p><a name="qn_0">1. <a name="41115-01_wqn0"><b> Simon Hughes  (Southwark, North and Bermondsey)</b> 
 (LD): What assessment he has made of the effectiveness of (a) community support officers and (b) neighbourhood wardens.  [197729]
</p>



<p><a name="st_1"><a name="41115-01_spmin0"><b>The Secretary of State for the Home Department  (Mr. David Blunkett): </b> 
 Community support officers and wardens have been widely welcomed across the country, wherever they have been deployed. Twenty-seven forces have undertaken evaluations, which are now being collated and will be published in December. The Nuffield Foundation funded a report by Leeds university, which was published on 28 October, and an independent review of wardens was published in May this year.
</p>








<p><a name="st_2"><a name="41115-01_spnew1"><b> Simon Hughes: </b> 
 The Home Secretary will know that my borough joins in the view that community support officers and wardens are welcome. Indeed, we already have 72 neighbourhood wardens and we are looking forward to a further 30.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41115-01_para0">
<a name="stpa_0">I would be grateful if the Home Secretary would look further into a London-wide issue. The neighbourhood policing fund, as I understand it, will contribute &#163;24,500 per community support officer, whereas the average cost of recruiting and training CSOs in London is &#163;28,500. Will the Home Secretary ensure that the Metropolitan 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>15 Nov 2004 : Column 1010</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>police and the 33 London local authorities will not be disadvantaged when they put in bids in the future, as other authorities around the country are doing?
</p>








<p><a name="st_3"><a name="41115-01_spnew2"><b> Mr. Blunkett: </b> 
 For understandable reasons connected with recruitment, the Metropolitan force took the view that salaries should be generally higher than in the rest of the country. It now has 1,800 community support officers and, as far as I am aware, faces no difficulties with recruitment. We will ensure that London is not disadvantaged, but it is a fact that the Met&#039;s own evaluation reveals a 70 per cent. improvement in reassurance and confidence in policing in areas where CSOs have been heavily deployed.
</p>








<p><a name="st_4"><a name="41115-01_spnew3"><b> John Cryer  (Hornchurch)</b> 
 (Lab): My right hon. Friend will know that community support officers have played a crucial and effective part in the creation of ward-based neighbourhood teams, which have started to spread across the London boroughs. There are two in my own constituency, led by Sergeants John Fish and Paul George. The schemes have proved very effective and are highly thought of, certainly in my area. Will the Home Secretary ensure that the funding of the Met is sustained at an appropriate level to ensure that the future creation of neighbourhood teams continues at the present rate? All wards in Greater London should have neighbourhood teams as soon as possible.
</p>








<p><a name="st_5"><a name="41115-01_spnew4"><b> Mr. Blunkett: </b> 
 I am grateful to my hon. Friend. We saw the scheme working well when I was in Bexley with the Prime Minister last week. The &#163;50 million allocated by the Chancellor this autumn will fund additional community support officers across the country. The Metropolitan force will receive, of course, a generous share of the fully funded posts for the forthcoming 12 months. In addition, there is the neighbourhood policing fund allocation and the police grant. As I said last week, we are doing our utmost to ensure that the police grant provides encouragement for forces to sustain and continue the investment that they are already making.
</p>








<p><a name="st_6"><a name="41115-01_spnew5"><b> Mr. Elfyn Llwyd  (Meirionnydd Nant Conwy)</b> 
 (PC): Bearing in mind that the local government settlement in Wales will be 4.8 per cent. and the North Wales police force requires 7.4 per cent. just to stand still, does the Home Secretary realise that there will have to be a substantial real increase in the police grant for Welsh police forces? That applies if community support officers are to be retained, let alone further recruited.
</p>








<p><a name="st_7"><a name="41115-01_spnew6"><b> Mr. Blunkett: </b> 
 I have a great deal of sympathy with forces trying to ensure that they can manage competing demands. However, given the funding that Welsh police forces have generally received over recent years and the substantial specific funding they have received not just for community support officers but for the introduction of Airwave, DNA forensics, reinforcement of training and other programmes, I do not accept for a minute the hon. Gentleman&#039;s figures on what is needed to stand still. I hope that Members will weigh with a degree of common sense the claims made by police authorities at the moment, because we are trying to ensure that their original fears can be allayed.

 (Lab): I thank the Home Secretary for visiting my constituency last month, where he saw at first hand the excellent work and effectiveness of community support officers in the Weston community in Weymouth. I ask him to ensure that Dorset gets its fair share of the &#163;50 million that he has announced so that we can extend community support officers to other communities such as Portland in my constituency.
</p>








<p><a name="st_9"><a name="41115-01_spnew8"><b> Mr. Blunkett: </b> 
 I will certainly do my best to do that. I may tell my hon. Friend that that was the first visit I have ever made during which I met the entire majority in one day&#151;<i>[Interruption.]</i> It was a great pleasure to do so.
</p>








<p><a name="st_10"><a name="41115-01_spnew9"><b> Angela Watkinson  (Upminster)</b> 
 (Con): The similarity in uniforms of police community support officers and police constables is such that many of my constituents have been fooled into thinking that there are more police on the streets of Upminster. Is not that what the Home Secretary really means by effectiveness?
</p>








<p><a name="st_11"><a name="41115-01_spnew10"><b> Mr. Blunkett: </b> 
 I think that the hon. Lady will find that there are more uniformed police on the streets of her constituency, thanks to the enormous investment we have made and as part of the 13,000 uplift in police over the past seven and a half years. It is very important, however, not to confuse things. What we are seeing on our streets is a uniformed presence with the authority to be able to work with local people to find solutions. The Nuffield report found that where those officers were deployed correctly alongside and working to uniformed police officers, they had a dramatic impact on reduction in crime.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41115-01_para1">
<a name="stpa_1">There is a simple message here. Not a single Member of this House has to have community support officers or has to press for additional resources for those officers for their area. If the hon. Lady is so strongly against them, I suggest that she starts to petition in her community against deploying community support officers. I am sure that the new Metropolitan Police Commissioner will take what she says very seriously when it comes to the allocation of resources to her constituency.

 (Lab): What plans he has to visit Dover to discuss the impact of his measures to control illegal immigration.  [197730]
</p>



<p><a name="st_12"><a name="41115-01_spmin1"><b>The Minister for Citizenship and Immigration  (Mr. Desmond Browne): </b> 
 Unfortunately, I have no immediate plans to visit Dover in the near future, but I welcome the opportunity to highlight the impact that the asylum and immigration measures that we have taken have had there. We have significantly strengthened our borders by the closure of Sangatte, by deploying new detection technology in France and by developing our juxtaposed controls in northern France, culminating in full United Kingdom immigration controls in Calais, Boulogne and Dunkirk since 3 October 2004. As a result, clandestine entry in Kent fell by 65 per cent. during 2003, compared with 2002. That fall has continued in 2004, with a 23 per 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>15 Nov 2004 : Column 1012</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>cent. decrease in clandestines in Kent in the first six months of 2004, compared with the last six months of 2003.
</p>








<p><a name="st_13"><a name="41115-01_spnew11"><b> Mr. Prosser: </b> 
 I thank my hon. Friend for that answer. I assure him that it reflects the situation in Dover, where illegal immigration and working have been reduced hugely. Does he accept that there is still far more to do? Although the number of asylum seekers coming through the port has reduced to just one or two a day, which compares well with figures we had in previous years, we can still take further action. Does he agree that the introduction of a secure identity card will go further towards cracking down on illegal immigrants and on traffickers and illegal working?
</p>








<p><a name="st_14"><a name="41115-01_spnew12"><b> Mr. Browne: </b> 
 I thank my hon. Friend for his question, and I agree that the introduction of a secure biometrically based identity card will go a significant way further to secure our borders.
</p>








<p><a name="st_15"><a name="41115-01_spnew13"><b> Mr. Eric Forth  (Bromley and Chislehurst)</b> 
 (Con): How?
</p>








<p><a name="st_16"><a name="41115-01_spnew14"><b> Mr. Browne: </b> 
 A sedentary voice asks &quot;How&quot;, and the answer is comparatively simple: it will be done by ensuring that those who are in this country legally have to have a biometrically based identity card. We are confident in the knowledge that the absence of such an identity card&#151;which has, of course, been part of the culture of this country&#151;has been a pull factor to illegal immigrants for many years.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41115-01_para2">
<a name="stpa_2">To my hon. Friend the Member for Dover (Mr. Prosser), I may say that there is further evidence on the impact of our measures. The number of detections in Calais increased by 36 per cent. in the first six months of 2004, compared with the first six months of 2003. In addition, my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary met the French Interior Minister Mr. de Villepin in Calais only this morning, and he was shown evidence that when Sangatte was open there were routinely about 2,000 asylum seekers in the Calais area. The police in France now know that there are only about 100 at any given time.

<p><a name="st_17"><a name="41115-01_spnew15"><b> Mr. Julian Brazier  (Canterbury)</b> 
 (Con): Will the Minister confirm that the number of work permits granted in-country has more than trebled? Will he say where all those people come from and whether or not they are all perfectly legal?
</p>

<p>
<a name="41115-01_para3">
<a name="stpa_3">Will the Minister also tell the House why Amin Buratee, from Whitstable, was picked up at six in the morning one day last week, just six months before he is due to take his A-levels? His entire family in Afghanistan has been murdered, as is accepted by the Home Office. Could not he at least be allowed to get as far as his A-levels? Is it really necessary to pick soft targets to massage the figures?
</p>








<p><a name="st_18"><a name="41115-01_spnew16"><b> Mr. Browne: </b> 
 I thank the hon. Gentleman for his question because it is important for the House to know that the number of work permits granted has increased significantly. As he knows, applications for work permits are made by employers. They are a reflection of the needs of employers and can be granted only if the 

<br>&nbsp;<br>

<br>&nbsp;<br>criteria are met. Work permits do not necessarily mean that those who are granted them will receive entry clearance to remain in or enter the country.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41115-01_para4">
<a name="stpa_4">I understand why the hon. Gentleman raises an individual case, but he will understand why I cannot, as an Executive Minister, go into the detail of that case. In general terms, all cases are robustly and fully examined by the immigration and nationality directorate and by the independent appellate authorities before any removal action is contemplated. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman would not want me to re-judge cases that have been judged by the independent appellate authorities or to substitute my decision for theirs as to the appropriate action in any individual case. I hope that he does not seek to persuade me to do so.

 (Lab): May I take my hon. Friend the Minister back to Dover, which is the subject of the question? No doubt the work of Dover harbour police has complemented that of the immigration authorities and Customs and Excise. That good practice should be extended to all the ports in the UK, because the absence of a national ports police service leaves us vulnerable. Will my hon. Friend consider the provision of such a service for ports that have no policing to tighten them up?
</p>








<p><a name="st_20"><a name="41115-01_spnew18"><b> Mr. Browne: </b> 
 I am grateful to my hon. Friend for that suggestion. He will know that a review of border controls is under way, involving all the agencies that operate at the border.

 (Lab): If he will make a statement on the backlog of immigration cases at the immigration and nationality directorate.  [197731]
</p>



<p><a name="st_33"><a name="41115-02_spmin0"><b>The Minister for Citizenship and Immigration  (Mr. Desmond Browne): </b> 
 Asylum cases awaiting initial decision are now at the lowest level for a decade, continue to fall and are likely to reach frictional levels by the end of the current financial year. The number of asylum appeals awaiting processing in the IND is at a record low. At June 2004, 9,000 asylum appeals awaited processing&#151;reduced from 30,000 in December 2002. Figures for non-asylum appeals are not published. There are minimal backlogs of charged cases in the general group. Although the non-charged work-in-progress cases have increased in certain specified areas, the aim is to get all that work to frictional levels by 31 March 2005. Over the past six months, work permit backlogs have increased owing to substantial additional pressures on resources as a result of new work streams, new processes, increased applications and difficulties in recruiting.
</p>








<p><a name="st_34"><a name="41115-02_spnew0"><b> Keith Vaz: </b> 
 I appreciate the real efforts made by Ministers and senior officials at the IND to reduce the backlog of immigration cases. However, what shall we, as Members of Parliament, say to constituents who come to our surgeries&#151;as many did to my most recent surgery&#151;clutching letters from senior IND officials, with dates such as April 2003, telling them that they would get a reply to their cases within 16 weeks, yet 18 months later no decisions have been made? Is it not right that we should seriously consider trying to address the problems that we inherited in 1997 by giving the 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>15 Nov 2004 : Column 1015</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>IND additional resources so that we can complete the important work begun when this Government were formed?

<p><a name="st_35"><a name="41115-02_spnew1"><b> Mr. Browne: </b> 
 I thank my hon. Friend for that question. Of course, if he wishes to bring individual constituents&#039; cases to my attention I shall be happy to look at them, but I cannot deal with them at the Dispatch Box. He is right to suggest that there were significant delays&#151;for example, when we came to power in 1997 it was routinely taking 22 months for an initial decision to be made on asylum applications. That is now down to two months. Charged general casework, to which he referred, is at frictional levels for this time of the year, and that accounts for about three quarters of the work in the IND. We continue to deliver good service levels and are improving them by the injection of resources and the training of caseworkers. Of course, the Conservatives wish to strip out all that cash, because without it they will not be able to get anywhere near to their promises about police officers.
</p>








<p><a name="st_36"><a name="41115-02_spnew2"><b> Miss Julie Kirkbride  (Bromsgrove)</b> 
 (Con): Does the Minister accept that one of the reasons why the Government find it hard to keep on top of asylum applications is that it is too easy to claim asylum in the United Kingdom? What plans do they have to renegotiate the UN conventions governing asylum, given that they were designed to deal with the problems of refugee Europe after world war two, not with the problems of economic migration that we face today?
</p>








<p><a name="st_37"><a name="41115-02_spnew3"><b> Mr. Browne: </b> 
 The hon.

Lady now wishes to ask me another question, but the point that she made was that it was easier to claim asylum under the convention here than elsewhere, and it is not.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41115-02_para0">
<a name="stpa_6">The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees has a process known as convention-plus, which we support, for the modernisation of the convention to enable it better to meet the circumstances of the 21st century. She is right to say that that convention was drafted in post-war western Europe, but what she does not say is that it has also been informed by the developments of the whole of the second part of the 20th century, and by the experience of the whole world. Derogations from the convention would be a denial of that history and would put the United Kingdom in a unique position, which I am sure that most people in this country would not wish to occupy.

Friend the Member for Leicester, East (Keith Vaz): at times, it seems that improvements to asylum claims are at the expense of other claims in the IND, especially for exceptional leave to remain. When will we be in a position to set targets across all the functions of the IND, so that all the people who come to

 I thank my hon. Friend for that question. He is right to suggest that leave to remain is experiencing delays, as I said in association with work permits. Currently, it takes about 12 weeks to process such applications. We have, as he suggested, increased decision-making staff in that sector by 30 per cent. since April 2004 and further staff are being recruited, but Members will appreciate that staff have to be recruited and then trained to do that complex work, so we shall not see the benefits of those recruitments until the training has taken place.

In August, 685 applications were outstanding, but in September the number was 2,670. Can the Minister tell us why the figure quadrupled during that period, especially as the number of applications has gone down? Is not that just another example of failed bureaucracy in the Home Office?

 The hon. Gentleman is right to suggest that at one stage in the worker registration scheme there was an accumulating backlog, but that has now been significantly reduced. In fact, the majority of applications are dealt with in a week. However, the real concern about the backlog was the fact that the IND was holding on to people&#039;s passports while their applications were being processed. We have now changed the rules and passports are being turned around and returned to applicants within 48 hours, so significant improvement has taken place. I think that the hon. Gentleman will discover that we will be at frictional levels in terms of backlog within the comparatively near future.

This is not about privatisation; it is about having a service that remains in the public sector but is privately delivered&#151;a public-private partnership. The reason that we have to look at the situation is that six police forces account for about 47 per cent. of the revenue of the Forensic Science Service. In the past year, the Metropolitan Police Service has moved a share of its work to the private sector, and Thames Valley police force moved its final share of work to the private sector. We want a Forensic Science Service that can deliver for the future, but it has to work in a world where the competition is greater than it has ever been.

 None. We are satisfied that the range of penalties available for dealing with shoplifting&#151;prosecution, caution, warning and fixed penalty&#151;is sufficient.


<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>15 Nov 2004 : Column 1018</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br></p>








<p><a name="st_50"><a name="41115-03_spnew0"><b> Mr. Bellingham: </b> 
 Does the Minister agree that any form of stealing&#151;whether from a shop, a large corporation or an individual&#151;is very serious crime indeed? Does she feel that it is the Government&#039;s duty to ensure that all crimes that involve stealing and dishonesty are deal with equally harshly? Surely, any other approach would not only send quite the wrong signal to the criminal fraternity, but undermine the credibility of a criminal justice system.
</p>








<p><a name="st_51"><a name="41115-03_spnew1"><b> Ms Blears: </b> 
 The hon. Gentleman is correct on one point&#151;retail theft is an extremely important matter&#151;but I am afraid that he is wrong in almost every other respect. We have given the police a range of options: prosecution, caution and fixed penalty notices. The introduction of fixed penalty notices has been universally welcomed by the police because it enables them to do their job quickly and get back out patrolling the streets, which is what the public want them to do.
</p>








<p><a name="st_52"><a name="41115-03_spnew2"><b> Ross Cranston  (Dudley, North)</b> 
 (Lab): Does my hon. Friend agree that deterring shoplifting also involves quickly and effectively dealing with offenders? In that light, will she welcome the street bail pilot scheme introduced in the west midlands in line with Government initiatives, whereby people are arrested and immediately bailed so that the police do not have to take them back to the police station or wait for responsible adults to arrive, but can get straight back on patrol to deal with other offenders?
</p>








<p><a name="st_53"><a name="41115-03_spnew3"><b> Ms Blears: </b> 
 I am delighted to endorse my hon. and learned Friend&#039;s support for the street bail scheme, which is yet another example of the way in which we are changing the service to try to free up police officers to do the front-line work that the public want them to do. I am also delighted that in Lancashire the police have already started to use fixed penalty notices for shoplifting&#151;they have issued 22 fixed penalty notices in the first week. Where police forces really feel that they have a &quot;can do&quot; attitude, they can make a big difference.
</p>








<p><a name="st_54"><a name="41115-03_spnew4"><b> Mr. Nick Hawkins  (Surrey Heath)</b> 
 (Con): Does the Minister recognise the fact that her astonishingly complacent answer to the question asked by my hon. Friend the Member for North-West Norfolk (Mr. Bellingham) will cause huge anger among the law-abiding public? Are the Government aware that former professional shoplifters have been interviewed and have said that if fixed penalty notices had existed in their time, all that they would have done is shoplift more to enable them to pay the fixed penalties? This is a nonsensical introduction of a new system that will do huge harm. The Government must take such serious dishonesty much more seriously.
</p>








<p><a name="st_55"><a name="41115-03_spnew5"><b> Ms Blears: </b> 
 I am afraid that the hon. Gentleman is talking absolute nonsense. People who would have previously received perhaps no punishment at all, or perhaps just an informal ticking-off, will now get an &#163;80 on-the-spot fine. With the fixed penalty notices for disorder, we have found that almost 50 per cent. more people have been punished than previously. Not only the police, but shopkeepers will welcome the 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>15 Nov 2004 : Column 1019</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>introduction of fixed penalty notices because they will see people being punished on the spot for shoplifting in their premises.
</p>








<p><a name="st_56"><a name="41115-03_spnew6"><b> Mr. Peter Pike  (Burnley)</b> 
 (Lab): Does not the instant fixed penalty system cover a crime that all of us pay for at the end of the day because the cost of the stuff that is stolen from shops must be met by other consumers? In addition, the system involves a quick penalty, which must surely be a bigger deterrent to the petty shoplifter than having to go through the legal system, given that such cases are often not proceeded with and those involved just receive a warning. Is it not a better system than we have had before?
</p>








<p><a name="st_57"><a name="41115-03_spnew7"><b> Ms Blears: </b> 
 My hon. Friend is absolutely right. We have made it clear in the guidance, which we are about to issue, that fixed penalty notices will not be used for persistent shoplifters. They are very much a warning to those people who might be tempted to shoplift that doing so will cost them a great deal of money, so perhaps they had better think twice about it.
</p>








<p><a name="st_58"><a name="41115-03_spnew8"><b> David Davis  (Haltemprice and Howden)</b> 
 (Con): To bring the Minister back to her responses to my hon. Friends the Members for North-West Norfolk (Mr. Bellingham) and for Surrey Heath (Mr. Hawkins), she gave it away when she intimated that half the fixed penalty notices issued in the pilot schemes replaced criminal action. [Hon. Members: &quot;No, she did not.] Yes, she did. Does she not see that it is intrinsically wrong for someone to be fined only &#163;80 for stealing &#163;100, let alone the &#163;200 that she originally intended? The real terms of trade are even worse. The average shoplifter gets prosecuted once every 20 offences, so they can steal &#163;2,000 for every &#163;80 fixed penalty. Does she not realise that in the longer term this policy will lead to a large increase in shoplifting?

</p>








<p><a name="st_59"><a name="41115-03_spnew9"><b> Ms Blears: </b> 
 Not at all. In fact, the position will be absolutely the opposite. People who were not prosecuted previously will find that there is a sanction on their behaviour, which is exactly what the Government want. We want to make sure that the police have the tools and the powers to do the job properly. That means not only that they can prosecute and caution, but that they can now issue fixed penalty notices. As I said in an earlier reply, the number of those punished for offences under the public order provisions has increased by 50 per cent. as a result of the introduction of fixed-penalty notices. That means that more offenders are being brought to justice; something that the Government are determined to see happen.
</p>








<p><a name="st_60"><a name="41115-03_spnew10"><b> David Davis: </b> 
 Perhaps the Minister should read her own pilot studies. Is she aware, however, that more than half of shoplifting is done by drug addicts to pay for their addiction? Shoplifting provides a large part of the funds flow for the drug trade. Does she not realise that decriminalising the first and, as is discussed on her internet site, second and, perhaps, third shoplifting offence could lead to a significant increase in the problems of drug-dependent petty criminals? Does she really think that this is being tough on the causes of crime?


<br>&nbsp;<br>

<br>&nbsp;<br></p>








<p><a name="st_61"><a name="41115-03_spnew11"><b> Ms Blears: </b> 
 The right hon. Gentleman really ought to know that fixed-penalty notices for shoplifting will not be used where people have problems with drugs or other substance misuse. They are not intended for use with persistent offenders. They are intended for first-time or perhaps second-time low-level offenders. The average fine in the courts is about &#163;78. Now, people will get an on-the-spot fine of &#163;80. That will be significant deterrent. Indeed, the Association of Convenience Stores, the British Retail Consortium and the Rural Shops Alliance have welcomed this additional disposal, which will now be available to our police services to deal with a very important crime.

<p><a name="st_62"><a name="41115-03_spmin1"><b>The Minister for Crime Reduction, Policing and Community Safety  (Ms Hazel Blears): </b> 
 The data requested by the hon. Gentleman are not centrally available. We know from the publication on 22 September of the police performance monitoring reports for 2003&#150;04 that the average time spent by all police officers on front-line duties is 63.6 per cent., and we expect that the police service as a whole can improve on that to something nearer 73 per cent. by 2008.
</p>








<p><a name="st_63"><a name="41115-03_spnew12"><b> Mr. Allen: </b> 
 The people of Nottinghamshire know that we have a record number of police officers in post in Nottinghamshire, but they also ask, &quot;Where are those police officers?&quot; Rather than give senior officers the temptation to backfill the absence of front-line officers who are in station by using police community support officers or neighbourhood wardens, would not it be more sensible to have specialist grades, retired officers or civilians to progress from arrest to charge? Will my hon. Friend look at that? If she does, will she give us some idea of how many extra police officers will be on the streets without a single extra officer needing to be employed?
</p>








<p><a name="st_64"><a name="41115-03_spnew13"><b> Ms Blears: </b> 
 My hon. Friend makes a very important point, and I am aware of his personal interest in the matter; indeed, he had an Adjournment debate in Westminster Hall just last week. I am also aware of his hands-on experience, and I know that he has been out with his own force in Nottinghamshire to look at these issues. It is important to involve the police and the Crown Prosecution Service in looking jointly at charging, but we are increasingly seeing more and more civilian staff building cases, taking over roles that were previously carried out by police officers. For example, in Surrey, we now have civilian staff completing case preparation, releasing a whole number of detectives to do the jobs that only they can do.
</p>








<p><a name="st_65"><a name="41115-03_spnew14"><b> Mr. Roger Gale  (North Thanet)</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>have, of course, to work in pairs on Friday and Saturday nights, there do not need to be many arrests before there is no cover whatever. How many forms does the police officer on the beat have to carry? How much time is spent filling those forms in on the beat, and why are the Government so intent on increasing it?
</p>








<p><a name="st_66"><a name="41115-03_spnew15"><b> Ms Blears: </b> 
 We are absolutely intent on doing the reverse. I can tell the hon. Gentleman that nearly 8,000 forms have been made obsolete since we cracked down on the bureaucracy in the system. We are ensuring that more civilian staff are taking over the custody function so that officers are not tied up with unnecessary bureaucracy. I wonder whether he is aware that we have introduced video ID parades, which are freeing up officers. We have also introduced automatic number plate recognition and much better access to fingerprint data, and fixed penalty notices are being issued. I am sure that he will join me in welcoming the fact that a range of measures has been designed with the intention of freeing up our police officers so that they can fight crime on the front line. Once we push up the proportion of officers in front-line policing, we should be able to release an extra 12,000 officers over the next three years to do their jobs on behalf of the public.

</p>








<p><a name="st_68"><a name="41115-03_spnew17"><b> Ms Blears: </b> 
 My hon. Friend is right; the public want not only a more visible and reassuring presence on their streets, but forces to catch and convict criminals. The best police forces are doing both.

 The right hon. Gentleman will know that we introduced the &quot;Diary of a Police Officer&quot; scheme a couple of years ago to find out exactly how time was spent. We have also introduced activity-based costing to determine how police officers spend their time. For the very first time, we have started the process of compiling data about exactly what police officers do. The previous Government did not do that; they did not seem to care what police officers did. They took officers off the streets, put them into cars and got them away from the public. We are determined to get police officers out of their cars and police stations and on to the streets so that they can reassure the public who pay their wages.

 I do, as a victim of crime. Will the Minister guarantee that in the near future she will examine ways of speeding up the process so that police officers may work faster? That would make things easier for victims and allow us to get police officers out on the beat again.
</p>








<p><a name="st_74"><a name="41115-03_spnew23"><b> Ms Blears: </b> 
 My hon. Friend is right that freeing up our police officers must be a priority. Many police forces are introducing a system of mobile data so that officers can key data into portable computers straight away without necessarily going back to the police station. Civilian staff are taking statements in many cases; some are better at doing that than police officers themselves. We are absolutely determined to get the right people in the right place at the right time, doing the right job.

What I am seeking are sensible contributions to how we can square the circle of protecting the sources of the advice that we receive and ensuring that those who are in front of the courts receive a fair hearing and fair representation, while protecting the well-being of the British nation. The proportionality and care that we adopted in passing the Anti-terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001 is reflected in the limited use of the certification powers, which, when we passed the Act exactly three years ago, were described as a charter to hold hundreds of people without trial.

 My hon. Friend is right, and there are two aspects to consider.

Secondly, some countries with judicial systems and human rights lawyers take a different view from human rights lawyers and the judiciary in our country. I respect their right to do so, which is why we have been careful not to remove people to countries where they might be threatened with death and torture. There is a paradox, however, and to be accused of taking away human rights when we are not removing people because we are concerned about their human rights really takes the biscuit.

 (LD): What his policy is in respect of maintaining custody suites in operational use.  [197736]
</p>



<p><a name="st_88"><a name="41115-05_spmin0"><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department  (Paul Goggins): </b> 
 The management of the police estate is a local operational matter for the chief constable or commissioner and the police authority. The Home Office has issued the police buildings design guidance and is in the process of producing a design quality guide for police buildings.
</p>








<p><a name="st_89"><a name="41115-05_spnew0"><b> Mr. Heath: </b> 
 We do not hesitate to talk about operational matters in the House. We have heard the Minister for Crime Reduction, Policing and Community Safety say that a policeman spends one working hour in every three in the station rather than on the streets fighting crime, and is this not another false economy? Every time a cell is not available for use, police officers who have made an arrest must travel 20 or 30 miles to take a prisoner to a custody suite. Alternatively, they are deterred from making an arrest at all, because they know that they will not be available to fight crime in their own community. Should the Home Office not have a policy of ensuring that as many police cells as possible are available in local communities so that we can fight crime effectively?
</p>








<p><a name="st_90"><a name="41115-05_spnew1"><b> Paul Goggins: </b> 
 It is a Home Office responsibility to make sure that there are adequate custody facilities in each area. Over this year and last, we made available &#163;4.7 million in grant aid so that police authorities can provide such facilities, but it is for the police authority to decide where they are located, bearing in mind the need to balance the strategic use of resources and the accessibility of resources to the community. The hon. Gentleman may be encouraged, as I am, to hear of the pilot project in Northumbria, where civilians are staffing custody suites. That has released 91 police officers, who are out doing the job in the community that they joined the police to do.

 (Lab/Co-op): In my constituency, a relatively recently built police station has a first-rate custody suite which spends most of its time in mothballs, as the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome (Mr. Heath) described. That means that those arrested have to be taken considerable distances to Loughborough and beyond. The argument is, as my hon. Friend knows, that the framework for the staffing of custody suites is so onerous that chief constables are reluctant to open them up too frequently. Will he look at the legal requirements in respect of the staff required to operate custody suites, so that those facilities can be brought into use much more frequently, saving all the travelling time to which the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome referred?

<p><a name="st_92"><a name="41115-05_spnew3"><b> Paul Goggins: </b> 
 I should be happy, as would my hon.

I draw my hon. Friend&#039;s attention to the example I gave of the pilot initiative in Northumbria, and I hope that in time he will benefit from such an approach in his area as well.

 (Con): May I take the Minister beyond Loughborough to Wigston, also in Leicestershire, in my constituency? The police station in Bullhead street in Wigston Magna is made of 1960s concrete and is quietly falling to bits. We desperately need a new police station in the borough of Oadby and Wigston. Will the hon. Gentleman please have urgent discussions with the police authority and the chief constable to ensure that a new site is found as quickly as possible, and ensure that, preferably, the new station is made of some sort of concrete that lasts more than 30 or 40 years?

 May I remind the Minister that in my constituency in Milton Keynes there are a number of urban parish councils, which for the most part do an excellent job? However, it is my experience that many of them are unaware of their duty under the Race Relations Act positively to promote good race relations, and in some cases they appear to be unaware of their duty not to indirectly discriminate. May I urge my hon. Friend to look again at the way in which advice is given to parish councils and to make sure that they are all aware of their duty, like other local authorities, to positively promote good community relations?
</p>








<p><a name="st_99"><a name="41115-05_spnew9"><b> Fiona Mactaggart: </b> 
 My hon. Friend is right that parish councils have that responsibility. At the same time as the CRE issued the statutory code of practice in 2002, it issued a guidance booklet to all parish councils. At that time there was a survey of parish councils&#039; awareness of that duty. The replies suggested that a majority of parish councils were aware of their responsibilities, but I will raise the matter that my hon. Friend describes with the chairman of the CRE when I next meet him. I agree that it is important that parish councils throughout the country, in urban or rural areas, are aware of their legal responsibilities in that regard.

 Will the Minister confirm that intermittent custody is a tough and demanding sentence? Will he tell the House how he is dealing with the barriers to progress on midweek intermittent custody and whether his discussions with the Department for Work and Pensions have been successful?

<p><a name="st_102"><a name="41115-05_spnew11"><b> Paul Goggins: </b> 
 I begin by welcoming the right hon. Gentleman&#039;s remarks, his support for the prison in his constituency and his support for intermittent custody. Some difficulties occurred in working out the benefit entitlement for jobseeker&#039;s allowance claimants who might be subject to intermittent custody, but we have resolved those issues. The message that intermittent custody is, as the right hon. Gentleman indicated, a tough punishment is going out loud and clear to the probation service and sentencers.

Why did it take so long to sort that problem out? Has that problem now been sorted out? How can we have confidence in the Home Office, which is reorganising the whole prison and probation system, when it cannot sort out the problems in a small, two-prison experiment?

 The initiative is important, but it is a pilot; we are meant to learn from pilot initiatives, which is what we are doing.

The pilot is already a huge success.

<p><a name="st_0"><a name="41115-06_spmin0"><b>The Secretary of State for Northern Ireland  (Mr. Paul Murphy): </b> 
 With permission, Mr. Speaker, I wish to make a statement.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41115-06_para0">
<a name="stpa_0">I announced on Friday 12 November my intention to despecify the Ulster Defence Association, incorporating the Ulster Freedom Fighters. I signalled my intention to lay an order before this House to give effect to that decision, and today I have taken the earliest opportunity to do so. The House will also be aware of the statement made yesterday by the Ulster Political Research Group on behalf of the UDA. I welcome that development, which is positive, and will say more about the detail in a few moments.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41115-06_para1">
<a name="stpa_1">First, I want to explain my actions in terms of despecifying the UDA. I have reviewed the status of all specified and other paramilitary organisations, as I am obliged to do under legislation, and concluded that there are sufficient grounds to despecify the UDA-UFF. For some time now, there has been contact between my officials and its political representatives, whom I, too, have recently met. I view that as part of an overall strategy to bring final closure to the problems that have hindered progress in Northern Ireland and to set in place an inclusive future for all, based on an enduring political settlement.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41115-06_para2">
<a name="stpa_2">The UPRG announced a 12-month period of &quot;military inactivity&quot; by the UDA-UFF, known as the Gregg initiative, on 23 February 2003, and it announced an &quot;indefinite extension&quot; of that initiative on 24 February this year. I have taken advice from the Chief Constable and others and, as I am obliged to do under the terms of the Northern Ireland (Sentences) Act 1998, I have reviewed the status of all specified and other paramilitary organisations. It is my judgment, made in the round and having regard to the 1998 Act and other relevant issues, that the UDA ceasefire is now holding and is genuine.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41115-06_para3">
<a name="stpa_3">I appreciate that some may question this decision in the light of negative comments in recent Independent Monitoring Commission reports. I have carefully studied both relevant IMC reports and support the strong language directed against a range of paramilitary organisations, but it is clear that UDA activity decreased between the first and second relevant reports, and other material provided to me endorses that view.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41115-06_para4">
<a name="stpa_4">I am persuaded by the advice I have received that it is appropriate to despecify the organisation, but I have taken the decision cautiously and prudently, considering the full consequences of my actions and the effect on others, especially victims. I am only too conscious of the impact on victims of violence and the terrible consequences of both sectarianism and feuding within communities. I reassure victims that this Government have not forgotten their suffering and that we will continue to support and to work with them.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41115-06_para5">
<a name="stpa_5">There is, however, now an opportunity to move forward. The statement made yesterday by the UDA contained a number of important undertakings. First, there is its commitment to work towards the day when, to use its own words, there will no longer be a need for the UDA or the UFF; its reaffirmation that the UDA 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>15 Nov 2004 : Column 1030</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>will desist from all military activity and its declaration that the organisation&#039;s strategy will focus on community development, job creation, social inclusion and community politics. Secondly, there is its agreement to enter into a process with the Government that will see the eradication of all paramilitary activity. Thirdly, there is confirmation that it will re-engage with the Decommissioning Commission, and indeed I understand that that has already begun.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41115-06_para6">
<a name="stpa_6">Those undertakings, which are commitments, not aspirations, are positive. The Government agree with the UPRG when it says that the loyalist community&#039;s enemies are issues such as poverty, social deprivation, drugs and crime, and we will work energetically with them and others to tackle those problems. The other issue is to end paramilitarism, and we will be discussing equally urgently with them how that is to be achieved.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41115-06_para7">
<a name="stpa_7">The UDA says that it wants lasting peace and that it can prove to the people of Northern Ireland that it can change. I believe that it should be given the opportunity to do so.However, the Government have always made it clear that we would judge paramilitary organisations by their deeds, but also, of course, by their words, so I shall be watching the UDA&#039;s actions very carefully over the coming weeks to ensure that it lives up to the commitments that it has made. The UDA remains a proscribed organisation and the police will pursue relentlessly any criminal activity undertaken by its members or those of any other group.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41115-06_para8">
<a name="stpa_8">In coming to a final judgment on this matter, I would wish to acknowledge the work that has been done in terms of political leadership by the UPRG. I also want to recognise the contribution that members of other political parties have made to creating the conditions in which loyalism can take these important steps. I take this opportunity to call on other groups engaged in violent activity to take similar steps.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41115-06_para9">
<a name="stpa_9">I know that the House will agree that the time has long since passed for all paramilitary groups, loyalist and republican, to cease their activities once and for all and to decommission the weapons that have brought so much suffering to the people of Northern Ireland. As my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister said in Belfast in 2002, the Government want to see all paramilitary groups complete the transition from violence to exclusively peaceful means. I believe that yesterday&#039;s announcement by the UDA, together with the political dialogue that is currently taking place with other interested parties, constitutes a significant step towards achieving that goal&#151;a goal that unites every Member of the House and every decent person in Northern Ireland.
</p>








<p><a name="st_1"><a name="41115-06_spnew0"><b> Mr. David Lidington  (Aylesbury) (Con):</b> 
 I thank the Secretary of State both for his statement and for his customary courtesy in giving me early knowledge of its contents.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41115-06_para10">
<a name="stpa_10">Yesterday&#039;s words by the Ulster Political Research Group were welcome, but they need to be matched by action that is both swift and consistent with the pledges that were apparently given yesterday. Less than a fortnight ago, the Independent Monitoring Commission reported that, in the six months between March and August this year, the UDA was responsible for shootings, assaults and at least one vicious sectarian attack on Roman Catholics.


<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>15 Nov 2004 : Column 1031</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>

<p>
<a name="41115-06_para11">
<a name="stpa_11">The IMC concluded in its most recent report that the UDA


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_0">&quot;remains heavily involved in many kinds of organised crime, and remains an active organisation capable of more widespread violence, with the will to commit it if judged appropriate.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="41115-06_para12">
<a name="stpa_12">All this at a time when UDA leaders were reiterating their commitment to the cessation of military activities, which they first announced 10 years ago. That discrepancy between words and conduct in the past is in itself good reason for caution, and so too was the wicked attack last night on an SDLP councillor in Larne&#151;an attack which the victim&#039;s family have blamed specifically on the UDA.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41115-06_para13">
<a name="stpa_13">I have a few questions for the Secretary of State. First, the UDA has now committed itself to the eradication of all paramilitary activity. Does he agree that that must include an end not only to shootings and assaults, but to the organised crime that has enabled the UDA to impose what can only be described as a mafia-style terror on loyalist communities? What assurances has he been given that the drug dealing, racketeering, exiling and intimidation will now stop?
</p>

<p>
<a name="41115-06_para14">
<a name="stpa_14">Secondly, the Secretary of State said that the UDA had agreed to engage with General de Chastelain&#039;s commission. Do the Government believe that it has now accepted that it will have to decommission all the weapons and explosives that it currently holds? Will he also take the opportunity to deny the claims made in some of yesterday&#039;s media that the Government have secretly agreed that terrorists should be allowed to keep hold of small arms rather than decommissioning them? I hope that he will agree that such a concession would be an insult to the courage of democrats, whether nationalist or Unionist, who serve on the Policing Board and on local partnerships and have to put up daily with intimidation from the paramilitaries.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41115-06_para15">
<a name="stpa_15">Thirdly, I welcome the indications that the Secretary of State reported that people who previously supported the UDA intend in future to commit themselves to democratic politics and to working to attract the new investment and jobs that are sorely needed in loyalist areas, but I hope that he can also assure the House that the Government will have no truck with any suggestion that a paramilitary or former paramilitary organisation could in some way become the intermediary between the agencies of Government and the people of those areas. People who have been members of the UDA need to put that past behind them. Will he confirm that if the UDA fails to deliver on its promises, he will have no hesitation in putting it back on the specified list?
</p>

<p>
<a name="41115-06_para16">
<a name="stpa_16">The Secretary of State referred to there being no let-up in work by the police to track down and bring to justice people who are responsible for crimes, and I welcome that assurance, but can he also make it clear that there will be no soft-pedalling in the work of the police or the Assets Recovery Agency in pursuing the UDA or other godfathers who have amassed vast fortunes on the back of crime and terror?
</p>

<p>
<a name="41115-06_para17">
<a name="stpa_17">Finally, there will be speculation in Northern Ireland that these announcements are part of a sequence designed to bring about the restoration of the political institutions at Stormont. That is an objective that I certainly share, but I hope that the Secretary of State 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>15 Nov 2004 : Column 1032</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>will confirm that, in seeking that objective of restoring devolution, there can no longer be any room for fudge or ambiguity, and that nobody, and above all the paramilitary organisations, must be in any doubt about what they now have to do, and that their talk must now be matched with action.
</p>

<p><a name="st_2"><a name="41115-07_spnew0"><b> Mr. Murphy: </b> 
 I entirely agree with the point about talk being matched by action. As I said in my statement, we have had the words and the deeds must now follow. I think that everyone in Northern Ireland is expressing exactly the same view.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41115-07_para0">
<a name="stpa_18">Today&#039;s announcement, and the events of the past few days, have not been part of any choreography or sequence. I have held a parallel series of meetings over recent weeks. There is, however, no doubt that if the UDA is genuine, as I believe it is, that is bound to help the political process.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41115-07_para1">
<a name="stpa_19">Obviously the Government condemn any attack on Mr O&#039;Connor, the Larne SDLP councillor, or indeed on his mother, who I believe was involved; but I assure the House that there is no evidence to suggest that the attack was the work of any specific organisation. The police are currently investigating.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41115-07_para2">
<a name="stpa_20">The hon. Gentleman is right to mention drugs and organised crime. The drugs trade in Northern Ireland&#151;if it can be termed thus&#151;is a scourge on society. It is a particular scourge on young Protestant women and young Protestant men who must live in that society. I made it absolutely clear in my discussions with the UPRG that dealing with the problem would have to form a major part of any development involving the UDA and despecification, and I must say that the response was very positive. The UPRG recognises that drugs are a scourge on the community.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41115-07_para3">
<a name="stpa_21">I agree with the hon. Gentleman that there must be no let-up in the pursuit of criminality in any form, particularly&#151;in this case&#151;among loyalist communities. The Assets Recovery Agency must continue its good work, and the Northern Ireland Organised Crime Task Force will continue to examine the issues.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41115-07_para4">
<a name="stpa_22">As I said, the UPRG held a meeting with the Independent International Commission on Decommissioning last week, and there will be further meetings. I myself will have further meetings with the UPRG to stress the importance of decommissioning, which it already recognises.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41115-07_para5">
<a name="stpa_23">As for reports in the newspapers about some sort of deal involving small arms, I assure the hon. Gentleman and the House that that was a load of nonsense. Such a deal would not be tolerable.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41115-07_para6">
<a name="stpa_24">The hon. Gentleman mentioned intermediaries. I accept that when dealing with the problems of loyalist areas we must deal with public representatives&#151;in the House, in the Assembly or in local authorities&#151;but also with those involved in community groups. I should like the widest possible consensus on our wish to do something about the problems of deprivation. As all Members know, deprived areas breed paramilitarism. The best remedies are education, training, jobs and housing.

In that context, does the Secretary of State recognise the UDA as a legitimate representative of those communities when it comes to, for instance, community development? If so, in my judgment the UPRG is a very willing and sensible organisation that is committed to reforming that organisation. What support will the Government be giving the UPRG leadership to enable it to transit from a paramilitary infrastructure to an organisation with a primary focus on democratic and peaceful means of campaigning for the communities that it is rightly interested in defending and promoting?

 With regard to the IMC, there has been a change in the period between the two reports, as I mentioned in my statement. To give the details to the hon.

I draw the right hon. Gentleman&#039;s attention to the statement made by the UDA that it needs to be assured that the current political efforts are for real. It would be ironic if those efforts were to stumble just as we are seeing some progress in this area. Is the right hon.

 My right hon.

Is it not the case that any political grouping in Northern Ireland that declares itself to be in a ceasefire should be starting to work constructively with the Police Service of Northern Ireland so that they can work together with their communities to deliver a final end to paramilitary violence in those constituencies? What assurances and commitments has my right hon. Friend received from the UPRG or, indeed, the UDA to enter into constructive dialogue with the police service on these matters?
</p>








<p><a name="st_10"><a name="41115-08_spnew1"><b> Mr. Murphy: </b> 
 My hon. Friend is right. On the drugs issue, for example, it is very important for the UPRG and others to work closely with the Police Service of Northern Ireland to deal with those particular matters, which I have already described as a scourge. It is then for the organisation and the Chief Constable to decide whether a meeting would be fruitful. I agree with the general thrust of my hon.

That applies to republican organisations as well as to loyalist ones. Will the Secretary of State also accept, as I and elected representatives in these areas have an overwhelming electoral mandate, that he and the Government must deal urgently with the serious social and economic issues in loyalist areas that we have highlighted, in a way that has the confidence and support of local people in those communities?

He is also right to point out that paramilitary groups of all sides are still proscribed and that there should be no let-up in pursuing criminality. The economic and social problems that have bedevilled these areas must be dealt with. If we can do that, we will go a long way towards ensuring that there is no return to violence, which the hon.

Will my right hon. Friend ensure that the PSNI reports back to him regularly on whether those crimes on estates are decreasing? That will be the real measure of success. As politicians, we can welcome this move forward, but people living on estates who continue to have those crimes committed against them will be the real judge of whether the UFF and UDA are genuine and reasonable in their intent.

It is the chance to show the world that things are going to change.

We need to see a complete turnaround so that people in those organisations&#151;and there are thousands of them&#151;turn their energies to addressing those very issues that have provided the basis for paramilitarism in the past. They need to concentrate on education, training, schools, jobs, housing and health.

If we do that, there will be no need for paramilitary activity; indeed, there is never any need for that&#151;the hon. and learned Gentleman knows what I mean&#151;but we can take away any excuse for it.

<a name="41115-10_para0">
<a name="stpa_45">Most widows&#039; and widowers&#039; pensions come into payment only when the recipients are in their 70s, so little is likely to be saved by introducing what would, in any case, be an entirely arbitrary age point. The other point about the proposed amendment is that it is just not possible to ring-fence the armed forces on that issue, which brings me to the read-across point made by the hon. Gentleman. We have given that question careful consideration and I have revisited it in the light of the clear concerns expressed both in this place and in the Lords. Any concession to the widows and widowers of service personnel would inevitably read across to the other public service schemes, where individuals frequently leave service, for all kinds of reasons, before normal retirement age.

The Government have no provision within their programme for the &#163;300 million to &#163;500 million that might be involved, and could not justify making such provision.

In that case, the significant improvements to the pension scheme, which have long been sought by serving personnel and are strongly supported by the chiefs of staff, and also by many veterans organisations, including the Forces Pension Society and the Royal British Legion, would be lost; as would the benefits under the new compensation scheme, of lump sum payments and a new deal for the more seriously disabled. I cannot believe that the hon.

<a name="stpa_50">No one has grounds for saying that the Government have been insensitive to the needs of our older veterans or widows. Indeed, my noble Friend Lord Bach announced in the Lords on 8 September a tightly-defined concession for the pre-1973 war widows, reflecting the very special circumstances of that group of generally elderly and relatively poorly off war pensioners. That concession was targeted on that deserving group, which the War Widows Association has regularly highlighted for special treatment, and will cost the Government more than &#163;20 million. However, that is as far as we can afford to go and further than any previous Government have gone.

 Does the Minister accept that most of his argument turns on cost?

Therefore, bearing in mind that the sum of &#163;300 million to &#163;500 million may seem a lot by comparison with the issues and principles at stake, it pales into insignificance when compared to the very considerable amount of inefficiency that has been occasionally highlighted by the PAC, although I should like to add one thing&#151;

<a name="stpa_52">I do not believe that the Lords amendment can achieve what its proposer is seeking. There were no pensions before 1975 for those with less than 22 years&#039; service as another rank and 16 years&#039; service as an officer. In other pension schemes, arrangements were even less generous, as no pensions were payable with less than 40 years&#039; service. The measure would therefore benefit very few of those who may have decided to delay marriage out of deference to the constraints of service. We would expect the main beneficiaries to be those remarrying later in life after either the death of the spouse or divorce. There can be no compelling case for the special treatment of those in that group who are in the same position as many others across the public services.

I am therefore again asking the House to send a clear signal to the House of Lords about the wishes of the elected House on this matter. I hope that, in the light of the debate and in the knowledge that we could not allow the Bill to proceed if it contained the Lords amendment, the Lords will agree that it is now time to accept the will of this, the elected House, and allow the Bill to proceed to Royal Assent later this week.

It is disappointing that they have proved unwilling to consider any form of compromise on a number of key issues, including the burden of proof, on which the Select Committee on Defence offered a very sensible compromise solution, the reduced early departure payments scheme and the refusal to allow our servicemen and women to earn a full career pension.

They have made plenty of efforts both here and, in particular, in another place, where Lord Freyberg introduced the amendment and secured the support of their lordships in the vote. They reduced the entitlement and narrowed it down to those over the age of 75 in an endeavour to meet the Government part way. Indeed, as one of my hon. Friends pointed out to me a moment ago, when we calculate these figures, we also have to take into account the fact that there will be some saving in social security. Although these pensions will be payable out of the public purse, many of those who would be the beneficiaries if the amendment were accepted are currently in receipt of social security payments. Given that they would no longer apply, there would be a counter-balancing saving to the public purse.

<p><a name="st_52"><a name="41115-11_spnew10"><b> Mr. Brazier: </b> 
 Surely there is a second argument besides the strong one that my hon. Friend puts. The armed forces are in a unique position, with the possible exception of the diplomatic corps, in which people are moved about quickly and sent abroad for long periods. As a result, many personnel have less opportunity for marriage. Above all, unlike all other forms of public service, they typically retire in their 40s, so half their life&#039;s pension, which they acquired in the armed forces, cannot be read-across to a later marriage. The problem does not usually arise for someone who retires at a later age in any other part of public service.

That provision was said to have been made for a &quot;uniquely deserving category&quot;. Surely those widows of post-retirement marriages over the age of 75 today, like the lady from Oxfordshire whose case I quoted, should qualify as another uniquely deserving category. We were talking about read-across earlier, but it was not an issue when my noble Friend Lord King made that special gesture. The Ministry of Defence was clearly not telling him that if he made that concession, there would be a read-across to every other Government Department. It is unacceptable and outrageous that the Ministry and its officials should insist that if we look after a unique category of people, similar provisions should be made for every other Department so that an expenditure of &#163;7 million on that small group would become &#163;500 million across Government.

I confess that I am surprised that the Minister has chosen to snub the widows as his parting shot. As he activates his ejector seat and parachutes back into the world of personal finance&#151;my assumption may be unreasonable&#151;which was comprehensively mucked up by the Government, he will surely want to be remembered with affection by that small but valiant group.

We have discussed the Bill seven times, and I hope that he agrees that when primary legislation is introduced it is not just a time to look forward and lay out plans for the years and decades to come, but to address perceived injustices in systems that have been in place for some time. There is widespread acceptance of the fact that certain injustices ought to be put right by the Bill. The group that we are discussing falls into that category.

The only way in which perceived injustices from the past can be put right is through retrospective legislation. There are examples of the Government doing that. The hon. Member for Aldershot (Mr. Howarth) gave one recent example and there are others. It would be churlish of the Government to rely on the argument that they cannot act retrospectively.

<a name="41115-12_para4">
<a name="stpa_73">A more important consideration is cost. Bearing in mind all the resources at the Government&#039;s disposal, we should by this stage have some clear actuarial figures to show what the measure would cost. The Minister says the cost could be substantially more than &#163;7 million, but we do not know how much more, how the cost was calculated or whether it includes social security benefits that will not become payable. Given the length of time that we have been considering the Bill, there should be something rather more solid for us to debate, rather than our bandying figures across the Chamber.

<p><a name="st_61"><a name="41115-12_spnew3"><b> Mr. Hogg: </b>

 The right hon. and learned Gentleman makes my point exactly. That would have enabled us to define the extent of the read-across, and would have served the House in two respects. It would have given us a more solid estimate of the cost and provided boundaries to the read-across. As I understand it&#151;I do not possess anything like the legal experience of the right hon. and learned Gentleman&#151;there would have to be some comparability among the various schemes to which read-across applied.

I was a member of a Government who, for many years, declined to reopen the question. We were satisfied that the reasons for not doing so were sound; they are two in number.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41115-12_para7">
<a name="stpa_76">One should be very cautious about reopening contractual arrangements retrospectively. Contractual arrangements are based on a contract&#151;certain payments to obtain certain benefits&#151;and one should be slow to give benefits for which contributions have not been paid. Once one starts to do that, one abandons the basic rule that one should not make retrospective changes and opens oneself to a range of demands with huge public spending implications.
</p>








<p><a name="st_64"><a name="41115-12_spnew6"><b> Mr. Gerald Howarth: </b> 
 My right hon. and learned Friend is right that one must exercise a great deal of caution, but I put it to him that such issues have been reopened on a number of occasions. He will remember that Tony Barber, when he was Chancellor of the Exchequer, made an ex gratia payment to war widows, and I have cited the individual, special case that occurred when Lord King of Bridgwater was Secretary of State for Defence&#151;my right hon. and learned Friend was a Minister at that time and, indeed, may have been a Cabinet Minister. Those at the top end of the age bracket&#151;in that case, over-75s&#151;have a long history of special consideration, which we are trying to introduce here.
</p>








<p><a name="st_65"><a name="41115-12_spnew7"><b> Mr. Hogg: </b> 
 The fact that my hon. Friend has identified only two cases&#151;I am not saying that other cases do not exist&#151;after, I suspect, considerable research, indicates the caution with which Governments have approached that proposition over the years. If one reopens contractual arrangements for over-75s, one immediately faces the question of why an arbitrary age limit should be imposed&#151;why not 70 or 65? Once one breaches the 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>15 Nov 2004 : Column 1051</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>principle of not making retrospective changes, one opens oneself to considerable demands with huge public spending implications.
</p>








<p><a name="st_66"><a name="41115-12_spnew8"><b> Mr. Cash: </b> 
 My right hon. and learned Friend referred to comparisons with people in other activities. Does he apply that principle to those in the fire service or other dangerous activities, irrespective of whether the widowing took place as a result of that activity&#039;s danger or merely because that occupation is dangerous in general terms? I am sure that he recognises that the war widows situation arises explicitly when a war widow, such as my mother, is widowed as a result of her husband being killed in action.
</p>








<p><a name="st_67"><a name="41115-12_spnew9"><b> Mr. Hogg: </b> 
 However, that is not true of the amendment, although it is, of course, true in some cases. The amendment does not deal with such a tragic situation; it deals with a wholly different situation in which a person in the armed forces continues to serve for many years and does not die in service, which is different from my hon. Friend&#039;s example.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41115-12_para8">
<a name="stpa_77">One must face this question: if one makes such a change in respect of a deserving group of people, what does one say to widows in comparable circumstances&#151;for example, the widows of policemen or firemen who die in service? Indeed, leaving aside dangerous occupations, what does one say to the widows of those in public service? By making such a change, one accepts changes to one kind of pension provision, and I find it difficult to resist the argument that pensioners or prospective pensioners married to other public servants should be entitled to the same benefits. I ask myself whether one can ring fence the surviving spouses of servicemen and have great difficultly in defining that principle.

<p><a name="st_68"><a name="41115-13_spnew0"><b> Mr. Gerald Howarth: </b> 
 We have done it, and I pointed out the case in which it was done.
</p>








<p><a name="st_69"><a name="41115-13_spnew1"><b> Mr. Hogg: </b> 
 The case has been made, but it is not a justification in principle. My hon. Friend must give us a principled argument as to how one can properly make a distinction between the surviving spouses of servicemen and the surviving spouses of other individuals in thousands of other public sector occupations. it is very difficult to make that distinction as a matter of principle. As it happens, I would like to be able to benefit that group of surviving spouses but we have to understand the consequences of that. My hon. Friend the Member for Aldershot has not dealt satisfactorily either with the point about retrospection or with the point about read-across. Unless he can do so, I shall not support him.
</p>








<p><a name="st_70"><a name="41115-13_spnew2"><b> Mr. Caplin: </b> 
 Perhaps I could begin where the right hon. and learned Member for Sleaford and North Hykeham (Mr. Hogg) ended. There seems to be some confusion in the House in relation to the suggestion by the hon. Member for Aldershot (Mr. Howarth) about the single change that Tom King made when he was Secretary of State for Defence. I want to try to clarify that. There was a change to the war pension scheme, which is not an occupational scheme. It does not raise 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>15 Nov 2004 : Column 1052</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>the same issues that we have debated this afternoon. As the right hon. and learned Gentleman pointed out, the benefit is not in relation to the terms of service, which were set separately for service personnel at the time of their service, and there is no direct pay adjustment.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41115-13_para0">
<a name="stpa_78">Furthermore, the war widows already had an entitlement to benefit in 1989 and all that happened was that the value of the benefit was increased for pre-1973 widows. That was an honourable thing for the Secretary of State at the time to do. It was also the right thing to do. The post-retirement marriages measure that we are debating today and that has been debated in the House of Lords would introduce a completely new entitlement. That is why I ask the House to disagree with their lordships. It is a completely different area. It is not right to make a comparison with the change that Tom King made at that time.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41115-13_para1">
<a name="stpa_79">I wanted to start on a point of consensus in winding up this short debate. I welcome the comments of the hon. Member for Aldershot about our inclusion of the Armed Forces Pay Review Body and of the hon. Member for South-East Cornwall (Mr. Breed) in relation to the Bill in general. I want to say how much I have enjoyed the &quot;trio debates&quot; that we have had for the best part of eight months. When this Bill got into Committee in February, I did not expect us to be debating it in the last week of the Session, but there we are.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41115-13_para2">
<a name="stpa_80">I want to try to make it absolutely clear where I stand in relation to post-retirement widows. The House will recall from our previous debate that I had a meeting with Lord Freyberg and the Forces Pension Society. I hope that I can build on the comments that I made then with some further comments. I make it clear that I remain open-minded on the possibility of a measure that may make further improvements for particularly vulnerable groups of armed forces widows, in particular some of those who are older and less well provided for. As I have already indicated to the society, I am prepared to meet it and Lord Freyberg once the Bill has received Royal Assent to consider the issues raised throughout our debates. I hope that the House will accept that commitment from me on behalf of the Government and, in consequence of it, will allow the House to disagree with the Lords and send a clear message back to their lordships on this issue.
</p>








<p><a name="st_71"><a name="41115-13_spnew3"><b> Mr. Gerald Howarth: </b> 
 I am aware that the Minister had a meeting with Lord Freyberg and others. I find it surprising that the Minister, having said at the outset of the debate that, if the amendment were insisted upon, the Bill would have to be pulled and all these benefits to the armed forces would be lost, chooses at the end of the debate, when there is no real opportunity for us to reply, to say that he is open-minded about it and willing to reconsider.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41115-13_para3">
<a name="stpa_81">If the Minister is saying that he is prepared to consider righting this injustice at some point in the near future, that is fine; but if he is saying that he is prepared to talk, but in fact there is nothing new to say, frankly, I do not see what purpose there is in his talking further. Can he give us some more definite commitment?

</p>








<p><a name="st_72"><a name="41115-13_spnew4"><b> Mr. Caplin: </b> 
 I have given a clear commitment both today and in what I have said previously. My words have been carefully chosen and reflect a further conversation that I had with the Forces Pension Society last week. I am saying that I am open-minded on the possibility of a measure that might make further improvements for especially vulnerable groups of armed forces widows, and in particular some of those who are older and less well provided for. It seems to me that that is clear and unambiguous, and it is a matter that we can discuss afterwards.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41115-13_para4">
<a name="stpa_82">The hon. Gentleman knows, as we have already debated it today, that this is an enabling measure. It is right and proper to discuss these issues. He said to me in Committee when the matter was raised on, I think, 22 February, that it was a probing amendment. We did not divide on it then and he did not appear to wish to pursue it further. That is a normal consequence of House business, but in these circumstances I am trying to make it clear to the House and to the other place that there are opportunities for further discussions, and I am not ruling anything out and remain open-minded. He will simply have to accept that that is as far as I can go in making a commitment today.
</p>








<p><a name="st_73"><a name="41115-13_spnew5"><b> Mr. Howarth: </b> 
 I am afraid that, from what I have heard so far, I do not feel sufficiently confident that there is a real intention to deal with this issue. I welcome the idea that the Minister is prepared for further negotiations, but I find what he has said so far unpersuasive, and unless he can give a certain commitment I am likely to seek to divide the House on this issue, because he has shown nothing but intransigence thus far, so I cannot place huge reliance on his delivering if he comes to further negotiations.
</p>








<p><a name="st_74"><a name="41115-13_spnew6"><b> Mr. Caplin: </b> 
 I did not use the word &quot;negotiations&quot;, and I reject the charge of intransigence. That was not a sensible point to make, and in fact the concession that we made to the pre-1973 widows, at a cost of more than &#163;20 million, was welcomed by the hon. Member for South-East Cornwall and should perhaps have been welcomed by the hon. Gentleman, too.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41115-13_para5">
<a name="stpa_83">I want to respond briefly to two points, the first of which concerns the Civil Partnerships Bill and retrospection&#151;the two are not the same, and it is worth my placing on the record why that is the case. The regulations under that Bill will provide equality, as they will allow registered same-sex partners to accrue survivor pensions in public service schemes from 1988. That puts registered same-sex couples in the same position as married couples. This new legal status is akin to marriage and inevitably produces corresponding benefit rights. That is different from the issues relating to any retrospective improvements for pension benefits that have arisen in debates on our Bill both today and previously.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41115-13_para6">
<a name="stpa_84">Secondly, it is simply not true that the Lords amendment would cost &#163;7 million. The Government Actuary has confirmed that limiting the threshold for payments to age 75&#151;I made this point in my opening remarks&#151;does not reduce significantly the one-off cost, which I have stated clearly throughout this debate is in 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>15 Nov 2004 : Column 1054</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>the region of &#163;50 million to the Ministry of Defence, and the read-across of that is the other figures that we have heard: &#163;300 million to &#163;500 million.
</p>








<p><a name="st_75"><a name="41115-13_spnew7"><b> Mr. Howarth: </b> 
 Are those costs net of social security payments that will be saved?
</p>








<p><a name="st_76"><a name="41115-13_spnew8"><b> Mr. Caplin: </b> 
 It really was not worth my giving way. The Government Actuary works the figures out, and I have given the House a clear understanding of them. It is not &#163;7 million; it is much, much more. Reading across to the public services and rectifying all the legacies, we would be talking about billions of pounds. I do not believe that the hon. Gentleman would expect any Government to present such a case.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41115-13_para7">
<a name="stpa_85">We have now discussed this matter on seven occasions. I believe that the House should disagree with the Lords, and I urge it to do so by rejecting the amendment.

 I have not got to the very exciting bit yet, but will happily give way if the hon. Gentleman cannot contain himself.

<p><a name="st_85"><a name="41115-14_spnew2"><b> Mr. Waterson: </b> 
 I am grateful to the Minister, and I do not want him to get too excited too early in his speech. Will he confirm that it is still the Government&#039;s thinking, as emerged in Committee, that at least to begin with the self-same person will be both the pensions ombudsman and the PPF ombudsman?
</p>








<p><a name="st_86"><a name="41115-14_spnew3"><b> Malcolm Wicks: </b> 
 Yes, I am happy to confirm that. Clearly, in the early months of the pension protection fund&#151;perhaps the first year or so&#151;there should be little demand on the ombudsman. We therefore think it important that the same individual&#151;the same man in this case&#151;should undertake both roles. <i>[Interruption.]</i> I can deal with this matter relatively briefly, Mr. Deputy Speaker. Whether the House can is out of my hands.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41115-14_para1">
<a name="stpa_88">When we debated the clauses on the pension protection fund ombudsman in this House on 20 April, the Bill made provision for the costs of the ombudsman and his office and staff to be provided by grant-in-aid by the Secretary of State. That would require the general taxpayer to foot the bill.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41115-14_para2">
<a name="stpa_89">On reflection, we introduced an amendment in the other place allowing regulations to be made to allow the grant-in-aid to be recouped by a levy on pension schemes. That brings the funding of the PPF ombudsman into line with the approach already in place for organisations such as the pensions ombudsman, the PPF board and the pensions regulator. <i>[Interruption.]</i> I know that the hon. Member for West Derbyshire (Mr. McLoughlin) follows such things with great interest.
</p>








<p><a name="st_87"><a name="41115-14_spnew4"><b> Mr. Michael Fallon  (Sevenoaks) (Con):</b> 
 I am grateful to the Minister for giving way so early. Can we just be clear about what he is saying? When he refers to the levying of a charge, what he actually means is a stealth tax on business.
</p>








<p><a name="st_88"><a name="41115-14_spnew5"><b> Malcolm Wicks: </b> 
 We think that as this measure is of benefit to people in, to use the jargon, final salary schemes or defined benefit schemes, and not to the general public or even to the general body of all people 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>15 Nov 2004 : Column 1059</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>in personal pensions, it is not unreasonable that that group rather than the general body of taxpayers should pay the cost.

 Will the Minister give way?
</p>








<p><a name="st_90"><a name="41115-14_spnew7"><b> Malcolm Wicks: </b> 
 Let me make a little more progress; the hon. Gentleman can polish his question even further if I give him a few more seconds. <i>[Laughter.]</i> Well, I have heard him before, and a little more polish always helps.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41115-14_para3">
<a name="stpa_90">This measure brings the funding of the PPF ombudsman into line with the approach already in place for similar organisations. We do not envisage that the costs involved will be major. For example, the total costs of the existing pensions ombudsman in 2002&#150;03 were under &#163;1.5 million, which covered all the disputes and complaints referred to him. By contrast, the PPF ombudsman&#039;s remit covers just the pension protection fund, so we do not expect substantial costs.
</p>








<p><a name="st_91"><a name="41115-14_spnew8"><b> Mr. Bercow: </b> 
 It is always a pleasure to listen to the Minister&#039;s mellifluous tones, but none of us would want him to proceed at an excessive pace. He referred a moment ago to regulations. Will those regulations be subject to the negative procedure or to its affirmative counterpart?
</p>








<p><a name="st_92"><a name="41115-14_spnew9"><b> Malcolm Wicks: </b> 
 That is an extremely good question, and I thought that I might deal with that point very shortly. I am bound to say that it is always useful to give the one-nation tendency in the Conservative party&#151; I think that the hon. Gentleman is still a member of that group&#151;an opportunity<i>. [Interruption.]</i> I can now reply in the affirmative: the regulations will be subject to the affirmative procedure.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41115-14_para4">
<a name="stpa_91">While the costs will be payable by all eligible&#151;<i>[Interruption.]</i> There is a certain degree of end-of-term amusement on the Opposition Benches, which is slightly premature at this point. Opposition Members have obviously read the jokes that I took out of my speech. While the costs will be payable by all eligible pension schemes, the PPF ombudsman will be independent, because he will be appointed by the Secretary of State and not the PPF board. Although I have been urged by the left wing of the Tory party not to rush my remarks on this important matter, I shall do so on this occasion, and I therefore commend the motion to the House.

<p><a name="st_93"><a name="41115-14_spnew10"><b> Mr. Nigel Waterson  (Eastbourne) (Con):</b> 
 The key words in this apparently harmless piece of verbiage are &quot;the levying of charges&quot;. Of course, the Minister, in his habitual fashion, has tried, with honeyed words, to suggest that that is the right and sensible thing to be doing. However, it is nothing of the sort. As my hon. Friend the Member for Sevenoaks (Mr. Fallon) pointed out, this is yet another stealth tax on business.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41115-14_para5">
<a name="stpa_92">The Minister was good enough to establish one point, which arose out of a proposal made by our side in Committee, which is that we should draw on the experience and wisdom of the existing ombudsman, so 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>15 Nov 2004 : Column 1060</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>that&#151;at least to begin with&#151;Mr. Laverick will be both the pensions ombudsman and the PPF ombudsman. Sadly for Mr. Laverick, I do not think that that dual role will require two salaries, but I suspect that it will mean extra staff, so we should not allow the Minister to persuade the House that no extra cost is built into this part of the elaborate bureaucracy that the Bill has set up.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41115-14_para6">
<a name="stpa_93">The real issue is the switching of the burden of this new office, and its back-up staff, to business and industry. Only a few days ago, the Department sneaked out a written statement, very quietly and without fanfare, that made it clear that the pension protection fund would, in some respects, be retrospective and might take into account companies such as Turner and Newell, if their pension schemes got into difficulties between now and when the Pensions Bill comes into effect. Of course, one can see the motivation for that. It is becoming apparent, almost day by day, that the Government&#039;s financial assistance scheme is woefully inadequate for its purpose of compensating people&#151; I should say, of assisting people. The Secretary of State has made a distinction between compensation and assistance. The latter is a handout of only a tiny fraction of the benefits that would have been available to the people involved if they had been lucky enough to qualify under the PPF after April next year.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41115-14_para7">
<a name="stpa_94">The boundaries have been blurred&#151;we will no doubt debate the point at greater length tomorrow&#151;between the pension protection fund and the financial assistance scheme. However, the point is that the PPF will be financed by a levy on business. Because of the slowness in introducing a risk-based levy, that levy will be a flat rate for a significant period, reflecting no risk and not distinguishing between good schemes and bad schemes, well run schemes and badly run schemes, or schemes with poor investments and schemes with better investments. The result, of course, will be that the good will subsidise the bad, and the measure that we are asked to approve today is an example of that. The Government&#039;s default position throughout the Bill has been, wherever possible, to heap more burdens on business, and the motion is another clear example of that.
</p>








<p><a name="st_94"><a name="41115-14_spnew11"><b> Malcolm Wicks: </b> 
 Is the hon. Gentleman&#039;s position on behalf of the Conservative party that the taxpayer should pay? As I recall, in Committee the Conservative Opposition supported the idea of an ombudsman, for perfectly sensible reasons. That position has to be paid for. How does the hon. Gentleman think it should be paid for?
</p>








<p><a name="st_95"><a name="41115-14_spnew12"><b> Mr. Waterson: </b> 
 The Conservatives resist attempts to heap more taxation on people. The reality is that we suggested&#151;in fairness, I must add that the Minister took up the suggestion&#151;that a new person was not needed to carry out the job of the new ombudsman. We hoped that there would be some saving, because the same person would be involved. We are trying to make the point that&#151;<i>[Interruption.]</i> If the Minister stops chuntering, he may learn something. Well run companies with decently run pension schemes will already face a flat-rate levy from the start of the pension protection fund. That will be a significant burden on them, and yet another reason for the decline of defined benefit schemes.


<br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>

<p>
<a name="41115-14_para8">
<a name="stpa_95">Following the Minister&#039;s announcement the other day, we now know that, on top of that, the PPF may well open its doors with a substantial deficit caused by schemes swept up prior to April next year. Incidentally, that announcement was not adverted to at all either in the debate in the House of Lords, or during departmental questions on the same day.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41115-14_para9">
<a name="stpa_96">Leaving that aside, there is already a significant burden on business. That may explain, in part, why the Minister&#039;s rather naive hopes that industry would come forward voluntarily with money to boost the financial assistance scheme seems not to have borne any fruit. As I said, the motion will mean yet another burden on companies that support the PPF from April next year, because of the flat-rate levy that they will be paying. There will be no option for the better companies to pay less because they are better organised and run better pension schemes; the motion will simply add to the levy that they will already be paying.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41115-14_para10">
<a name="stpa_97">As I have made clear, the Conservatives regret the fact that the Government continue to regard British business as merely a milch cow from which they can draw ever greater contributions to help pay for this flawed layer of bureaucracy that they are setting up, to try to deal with a pensions crisis that they have done so much to create.

 I am not sure whether that was a yes or a no. It is unclear to me whether Her Majesty&#039;s official Opposition are going to vote against the motion&#151;<i>[Interruption.]</i> The tension is almost palpable.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41115-15_para0">
<a name="stpa_98">The Ways and Means motion proposes that we work on the assumption that there will be an ombudsman for the pension protection fund. As a constituency Member who regularly finds that going to an ombudsman is the only way to resolve complex and difficult disputes independently, I think it entirely appropriate that there should be such an ombudsman.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41115-15_para1">
<a name="stpa_99">I was rather surprised that the Minister did not tell us how much might be raised by the levy, and that was a rather regrettable omission. He said that the sum would be less than &#163;1.5 million, but there is a big gap between &#163;1.5 million and zero. I hope that, in responding to the debate, the Minister will at least give us some flavour of the amount of money that the House is giving the Secretary of State permission to levy. To ask how much might be raised seems a basic question to make of a Ways and Means resolution. The Minister did not tell us; he said, or implied, that it would not be more than &#163;1.5 million, but will he give an idea of the order of magnitude that he is talking about?
</p>

<p>
<a name="41115-15_para2">
<a name="stpa_100">The Liberal Democrats are of the view that there should be such an ombudsman, that that ombudsman has to be paid for, and that those who will benefit from the existence of the ombudsman are those with final salary or other defined benefit occupational schemes that are covered by the PPF. It is rather difficult to see why, if this body has to be paid for, it should be paid for by those who do not even have final salary or defined benefit pensions. In other words, in pensions, increasingly there are&#151;to use an old phrase&#151;two nations: those who have final salary, high-quality pensions and those at the mercy of the stock market. It seems odd to suggest that people whose pensions have 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>15 Nov 2004 : Column 1062</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>no promise attached be asked to pay for a dispute resolution procedure for those who have better pensions, or indeed that the general taxpayer, who may have no pension at all beyond that provided by the state, be asked to pay for such a procedure.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41115-15_para3">
<a name="stpa_101">It is hard to understand what the Conservative response actually meant. I think it was against a levy on PPF scheme members, so I take it that it supported a levy on the general taxpayer. That point will have been noted far and wide, as our debates are followed closely.
</p>








<p><a name="st_97"><a name="41115-15_spnew1"><b> Mr. Fallon: </b> 
 Presumably, the hon. Gentleman has noticed that if the levy is to be charged on other final salary schemes, it will fall on us&#151;on the parliamentary pension fund, as a successful final salary scheme. Has he consulted his colleagues about voting in favour of the motion?
</p>








<p><a name="st_98"><a name="41115-15_spnew2"><b> Mr. Webb: </b> 
 On the assumption that our scheme is not covered by the pension protection fund, the levy would not fall on us, but I am open to amendment or correction on that point.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41115-15_para4">
<a name="stpa_102">I have a question for the Minister. In his remarks, he referred to the fact that when we first discussed the issue in April&#151;was it really all that time ago?&#151;the original assumption was that the cost would be funded by the general taxpayer. Nothing changed, as far as I can see, between April and September, when his noble Friend Baroness Hollis said, on reflection, that it would be funded by a levy, so can the Minister explain why the Government changed their mind on that point? What changed? Or was it yet another of those last-minute changes to the Pensions Bill that we have grown all too fond of seeing?
</p>

<p>
<a name="41115-15_para5">
<a name="stpa_103">The Bill will come back to us tomorrow and we shall debate the substantive issues then, but even on the eve of those final discussions, things are still changing. It is another hallmark of a Bill that has not been properly thought through or prepared that on the eve of its final return&#151;perhaps not even its final return&#151;to the House we are still debating last-minute changes of mind and Government second thoughts. It is worrying that a framework that affects the whole pensions system and which should be in place for a generation is being written on the back of an envelope and cobbled together by the Government as they go along.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41115-15_para6">
<a name="stpa_104">On this specific last-minute change, however, the Government have got things right. If the ombudsman service has to be paid for, as clearly it does, it is appropriate that it be paid for by people who will benefit from its existence and not by those who may have no pension at all. I am not sure whether the Conservatives disagree with me, as it is a complete mystery to me what points&#151;if any&#151;the hon. Member for Eastbourne (Mr. Waterson) was trying to make. I assume that his colleagues will try to extend the debate to its full 45 minutes, so I shall stand in their way no longer.

</p>

<p>
<a name="41115-15_para7">
<a name="stpa_105">The decision on how the ombudsman scheme should be funded is a harbinger of what is in store for us. We debated the whole matter about six months ago and it is 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>15 Nov 2004 : Column 1063</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>already becoming clear that under the legislation there will be more and more disputes to be sorted out&#151;whether they involve the financial assistance scheme on the one hand, or the PPF on the other. As I shall point out in our debate tomorrow&#151;if I am fortunate enough to catch your eye, Mr. Deputy Speaker&#151;we are, in essence, setting up a new form of business regulator and, as the Minister has finally realised, that regulator has to be paid for.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41115-15_para8">
<a name="stpa_106">The Minister&#039;s real fear is, of course, that the costs of the new regulation will be large and much more substantial than originally envisaged, because there will be disputes all over the place. There are already disputes about the scope of the financial assistance scheme&#151;when it should apply and to whom, which schemes will be covered and so on&#151;but they are as nothing to the disputes that will occur under the PPF once it is established. All that new regulation must be paid for.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41115-15_para9">
<a name="stpa_107">Ombudsmen are almost becoming a new form of regulator. When they were first set up, they were to deal with individual cases of injustice&#151;to rule on those cases and advise the House on them&#151;but they have now become part of the regulatory system itself. The Minister clearly expects many cases to go to them.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41115-15_para10">
<a name="stpa_108">Who should pay? What is clear from the motion is that the levy will fall on successful schemes. I hope the Minister has considered the fairness of that. If the levy is to be straightforward, and with no variation according to risk, as my hon. Friend the Member for Eastbourne (Mr. Waterson) pointed out, it will be even more unfair, as it will bear more heavily on schemes that happen to be well funded and well managed than on those that are not. That is not particularly fair.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41115-15_para11">
<a name="stpa_109">Will the levy also bear on the smallest schemes? We read that those companies that have set up small-scale schemes to benefit small work forces are already fearful of the additional costs involved under the Bill in having to bail out those schemes that are on less secure ground. Of course, the House has a parallel: we were asked, under the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000, to set up the new, all-powerful Financial Services Authority. That, too, is an example of a regulator with its own power to tax; it can set its own scale of charges, thus imposing on the good the cost of policing the bad. We should not authorise this new stealth tax on business without being sure that the Minister is doing everything possible to reduce the scope of disputes that are likely to be referred to the ombudsman.

<a name="stpa_110">As we shall see tomorrow, we will end up at the end of the Pensions Bill with the worst of all worlds: fewer final salary schemes, but more and more disputes about them. That brings me, finally, to the way in which we on the Opposition Benches should decide to vote. In my view, as we can see with the last-minute haste with which the Ways and Means resolution has been introduced this evening, the Pensions Bill has been a mess. This has been a very sad story from beginning to end. A raft of clauses was added to the Bill in Committee. All those clauses have been revised in the other place, as we shall see tomorrow. Even last Friday, the Government were still making announcements about how the burden of the new legislation would be financed. The Pensions Bill is

 It is always a great pity that these apparently innocuous Ways and Means resolutions attract such relatively little attention from colleagues in the House, because they are, of course, a very important part of what remains of the House&#039;s influence on the sort of measures that flow from legislation. I should like to think that in some ways Members would be more interested in Ways and Means resolutions than in many other aspects of the Bills themselves.

<a name="stpa_111">Some of the Minister&#039;s phrases&#151;innocuous and soothing though they were intended to sound&#151;rang a number of alarm bells, certainly in my mind. I made a note of the one that sticks out. He actually had to the gall to say, almost with a straight face, that all was okay, as the ombudsman would be independent because he will be appointed by the Secretary of State. That is a new doctrine altogether. We are now expected to believe that someone will be independent because he or she is appointed by the Secretary of State. I should have thought that that was a complete contradiction in terms, and it immediately set me worrying about what we are being asked to do.

<br>&nbsp;<br>they are. I say that not only because they may have been appointed by the Secretary of State, which immediately puts a question mark over their usefulness, but because, generally speaking, they have no powers. We therefore get frustrated citizens coming to us time and time again because they expected miracles of this or that ombudsman, only to find subsequently that very little happened as a result of the ombudsman&#039;s ruling.

 Yes, indeed, Mr. Deputy Speaker. I am devastated that I am unable to give the hon. Gentleman a comprehensive reply. Perhaps we will leave that for another day; indeed, it might even be tomorrow if we follow the example of my neighbour and hon. Friend the Member for Sevenoaks (Mr. Fallon).
</p>

<p>
<a name="41115-16_para2">
<a name="stpa_115">The proposition that the Minister has brought before us is that the operation of the ombudsman will be paid for by the levy, which has quite rightly become the main object of our attention in the debate because it is the reason why the Ways and Means resolution has had to be brought to the House. Quite rightly, therefore, we are involved in a proper debate about the nature of the levy. This debate takes place against the background of the fact that, as we all know, the whole pensions industry&#151;the whole institution of pensions in this country&#151;is under severe strain and likely, sadly, to continue to be so. As if to add insult to injury, the Government have come forward with additional bureaucracy, whose virtues I am unable to extol because of your ruling, Mr. Deputy Speaker, and I have no problem with that at all. However, this additional bureaucracy will involve additional cost and will therefore give rise to a levy on the very pension funds that are already under strain. That simply adds to the general accusation that we can make against the Government that the pensions industry is in dire straits largely because of actions taken by the Government over a period of time. Sadly, the resolution, which we are being asked to approve, will add to that phenomenon; it does not help the industry in any way. Personally, I would question whether it helps pension holders or beneficiaries, but we are not here to explore that on this occasion, are we Mr. Deputy Speaker?
</p>

<p>
<a name="41115-16_para3">
<a name="stpa_116">So, we have the levy. The Minister tried to reassure us by saying that we were not to be too worried about it, because it would cost a mere &#163;1.5 million&#151;he threw that figure in as if it were a bagatelle. We are all too used now to Ministers coming to the House and bandying such figures around as if they were of no consequence whatever. Of course, to Ministers in this Government, a million here, a million there and a billion somewhere else are of little consequence. However, if they spend a 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>15 Nov 2004 : Column 1066</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>billion here and a billion there, it adds up to real money in the end. Therefore, it is our duty as representatives of taxpayers or indeed, as on this occasion, of pension holders to worry about such things and to wonder whether this &#163;1.5 million will be well spent and whether there will truly be beneficiaries. Lurking at the back of my mind is the suspicion that this may be yet another bureaucracy or yet another enhancement to an existing bureaucracy&#151;it really makes very little difference&#151;that has little or no benefit in the end.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41115-16_para4">
<a name="stpa_117">Under the guise of this apparently innocuous Ways and Means resolution, there lurk all sorts of very worrying issues&#151;the levy, the amount of the levy, the bureaucracy that will be created and, worst of all perhaps, the Minister&#039;s assertion that we need not worry, because the Secretary of State will see it all right in the end. I am sure that the Minister has the greatest respect for the Secretary of State, and would that he were with us today to give us some reassurance as to how the independence of this person whom he will appoint will be maintained. Again, however, that is not something that we should be pursuing on this occasion. However, the thought must linger.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41115-16_para5">
<a name="stpa_118">So, all in all, this apparently innocuous little measure has a number of very unsatisfactory aspects.

 I am reluctant to have to chide publicly my right hon. Friend, but it really is about time, after his 21 years in the House, that he told us what he really thinks. His tendency to self-effacement is pretty unsatisfactory. I want the gravamen behind his argument to be clear in my mind. Is he saying to the House that the problem with the ombudsman will be that he or she will tend to be the craven lickspittle of the Government, that he or she will make no decisions, or that he or she will, in the end, be inclined simply to prevaricate?

</p>








<p><a name="st_114"><a name="41115-16_spnew10"><b> Mr. Forth: </b> 
 Yes, indeed, which prevents me from saying that I could not agree more with my hon. Friend the Member for Buckingham (Mr. Bercow)&#151;you, Mr. Deputy Speaker, would not want to say that in these circumstances. I am grateful to my hon. Friend because given that the resolution refers explicitly to the ombudsman, we must give a passing thought to whether we will get value for money from the levy that is linked to the ombudsman. That gives rise to speculation about how effective the ombudsman might be, which was, I think, the point that my hon. Friend was trying to get at, although I would of course not dream of pursuing it because it is not for me to dwell on lickspittles, prevarication, or any other aspect of what the ombudsman might be able to do on behalf of pension holders.

<a name="stpa_122">I was not quite sure what the hon. Member for Eastbourne (Mr. Waterson) was saying, which was a difficulty that I had with him in recent months in Committee. I think the Tories&#039; position, despite the variety of views expressed by their renegade Back Benchers, is that they support the ombudsman, but I am unclear about how they would pay for it. The hon. Gentleman talks about stealth taxes on business, but if he is against funding the ombudsman through schemes, he is saying, by implication, that the taxpayer should fund it. Why? I can tell the hon. Member for Northavon (Mr. Webb) that having reflected on the matter, we thought that it would be fairer for schemes to pay for the ombudsman. The Tory position is, as usual, absolutely unclear. I shall not be tempted into talking about risk-based or flat-rate levies because they are not relevant to the modest, yet important, motion.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41115-16_para10">
<a name="stpa_123">The levy will be relatively small. The &#163;1.5 million figure that I cited is the current cost incurred through the pensions ombudsman. If that were replicated for the pension protection fund ombudsman, the cost would be 10p per member per year. However, we expect the cost to be much less&#151;no more than perhaps 6p per member per year. Although I appreciate what the right hon. Member for Bromley and Chislehurst said, we are talking about only a few pence per year, which must be far less than the cost of several hon.

</p>








<p><a name="st_133"><a name="41115-18_spmin0"><b>The Minister for Housing and Planning  (Keith Hill): </b> 
 I am delighted to introduce this Adjournment debate on the Thames gateway in the immediate aftermath of our announcement of a further &#163;100 million of investment in infrastructure and community facilities in the gateway and at a time of intense media interest in the area.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41115-18_para0">
<a name="stpa_126">A Thames gateway is not a new idea. Indeed, London owes its very existence to the Thames acting as a gateway to England. John Burns who, with Keir Hardie, was one of the first MPs to be elected on a socialist platform, termed the Thames &quot;liquid history&quot;. As a Liberal Minister, John Burns was responsible for steering the first ever planning Act through Parliament in 1909. As the House will know, I have recently been responsible for steering the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004 through Parliament, so I feel an affinity with him, even though he crossed the Floor. I hasten to reassure the House, however, that I have no intention of following that precedent. John Burns said that his planning Act aimed to secure


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_9">&quot;the home healthy, the house beautiful, the town pleasant and the suburbs salubrious.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="41115-18_para1">
<a name="stpa_127">Those words, in the phrasing of the time, express a vision of the future. In some places, that vision was fulfilled, but in others we failed to deliver it. Today, we have a new opportunity to do so in the Thames gateway.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41115-18_para2">
<a name="stpa_128">In the Thames gateway, there are nearly 4,000 hectares of brownfield land&#151; 17 per cent. of the total in the region&#151;located between London and mainland Europe. It is a massive area of market failure and relative deprivation, lying amid the buoyant economy and prosperity of the rest of the south-east. The regeneration of the gateway as a national, regional and local priority has been in plan since the early 1990s. Since then, a great deal of valuable and vital work has been done to set the stage for new development. Far-sighted decisions were taken, for example to route the channel tunnel rail link through the gateway, and create new stations at Stratford and Ebbsfleet to act as development hubs.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41115-18_para3">
<a name="stpa_129">That has taken us a critical part of the way, but we need to do more. What was in the past desirable about the gateway is now essential. Housing growth will happen, and it is inevitable. For various reasons, including economic expansion, household growth in this country will continue at a high rate for the foreseeable future. The Government Actuary&#039;s Department estimates that household growth will average 189,000 homes a year between 2001 and 2021. Most of that growth will occur in London and the south-east, and most of it will be generated within the south-east. Indeed, the current draft of the Kent and Medway structure plan indicates that no less than 73 per cent. of household growth between 2001 and 2021 in the county arises from indigenous demographics and household growth and change. The serious question is not whether to have the growth, but how we manage it for the benefit of our communities and the environment.


<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>15 Nov 2004 : Column 1074</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>

<p>
<a name="41115-18_para4">
<a name="stpa_130">We should seek to focus that growth within our existing urban areas, and that is exactly what we are doing. Within the wider south-east, London is the motor of growth, but it has the lowest housing density of any world-class city. The potential for housing growth in London is enormous, and it is already under way. In 2003, housing completions in London and south-east showed a year-on-year increase of 14 per cent.&#151;9 per cent. in the south-east outside London and 24 per cent. in London itself. In the first six months of this year, there was a huge annual increase in completions in London of 30 per cent, and there is more to come. I am delighted that we have identified a considerable appetite for further housing development among the London boroughs. The Government office for London has recently created a London housing delivery unit, and we are already engaging with no fewer than 17 London boroughs to explore the opportunities for housing development. Much of the housing growth planned for the gateway itself will take place on the great brownfield sites of east London in the London Thames gateway. Stratford city has the potential to deliver about 20,000 homes; the Greenwich peninsula, about 10,000 homes; and Barking Reach has a maximum capacity of about 12,000 homes.
</p>








<p><a name="st_134"><a name="41115-18_spnew0"><b> Richard Ottaway  (Croydon, South) (Con):</b> 
 The Minister has set out the number of houses that will be built on brownfield sites, but could he say how many houses he expects to be built on greenfield sites?
</p>








<p><a name="st_135"><a name="41115-18_spnew1"><b> Keith Hill: </b> 
 I shall come on to that and, indeed, I wish to dwell on the issue. The short answer, as I shall explain, is that all the planned development in the gateway is on brownfield sites, and we expect the vast majority of housing growth in the gateway to be on recycled land.
</p>








<p><a name="st_136"><a name="41115-18_spnew2"><b> Jonathan Shaw  (Chatham and Aylesford) (Lab):</b> 
 Following the question asked by the hon. Member for Croydon, South (Richard Ottaway), is not the point that we know where the brownfield sites are? Before 1997, there was no audit of brownfield sites and people did not know where they were. We have done the work, however, and have identified the sites.
</p>








<p><a name="st_137"><a name="41115-18_spnew3"><b> Keith Hill: </b> 
 My hon. Friend is quite right. Before 1997, there was but a feeble commitment by Government to development on brownfield land. This Government&#039;s record, however, is extremely impressive, and I shall give the figures in due course.
</p>

<p><a name="st_139"><a name="41115-18_spnew5"><b> Keith Hill: </b> 
 The hon. Gentleman is hovering, so I shall give way to him.
</p>








<p><a name="st_140"><a name="41115-18_spnew6"><b> Mr. Davey: </b> 
 The debate about brownfield and greenfield sites also involves a debate about definitions. In a suburban constituency like mine, many local residents are surprised to learn that their gardens are deemed to be brownfield, and backland development can completely change the nature of a residential area. Will the Minister comment on that problem, which is causing great stress among some of my constituents?


<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>15 Nov 2004 : Column 1075</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br></p>








<p><a name="st_141"><a name="41115-18_spnew7"><b> Keith Hill: </b> 
 I accept that that is a concern in suburban areas&#151;indeed, it is a concern in my own constituency. Of course, the hon. Gentleman&#039;s constituency is not in the gateway, and it is the long-standing policy of this Government and our predecessor that such development is permissible. A balance about the appropriateness of such backland development, however, must be struck.
</p>








<p><a name="st_142"><a name="41115-18_spnew8"><b> Bob Spink </b> 
 (Castle Point) (Con)<i> rose&#151;</i>
</p>








<p><a name="st_143"><a name="41115-18_spnew9"><b> Keith Hill: </b> 
 I shall give way to the hon. Gentleman because I am especially fond of him, but then I wish to make progress.
</p>








<p><a name="st_144"><a name="41115-18_spnew10"><b> Bob Spink: </b> 
 I am grateful to the Minister for his kind words. I am equally fond of him and look forward to meeting him shortly to discuss park homes. He will accept that my constituency is part of the Thames gateway and that we have an increased housing target of 4,000 new houses. Does he accept that there is no way in which we could find brownfield sites in Castle Point for all those homes? Will he confirm that to accommodate those 4,000 additional houses, it is Government policy to release greenfield sites in Castle Point?
</p>








<p><a name="st_145"><a name="41115-18_spnew11"><b> Keith Hill: </b> 
 The hon. Gentleman would not expect me to go into the detail of specific site allocations. I do not deny for a second that there is an element of greenfield release in the housing programme in the Thames gateway. I am familiar with the hon. Gentleman&#039;s constituency, having campaigned fruitlessly for his predecessor in Castle Point, and know that there are brownfield opportunities there.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41115-18_para5">
<a name="stpa_131">Elsewhere in the gateway, we will pursue our housing growth agenda through the redevelopment of neglected town centres, extensions to existing urban settlements, and the development of derelict industrial landscapes. Nobody who has viewed the vast swathes of worked-out quarries at Ebbsfleet and Eastern Quarry can be in any doubt about the huge benefits to the environment and to existing and future communities that will result from the development of the new urban villages planned for those sites.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41115-18_para6">
<a name="stpa_132">No reasonable person can doubt the Government&#039;s commitment to securing the maximum development on recycled sites. The latest land use change statistics published three weeks ago show that 67 per cent. of all new dwellings in England were built on brownfield sites in both 2002 and 2003. That compares favourably with the 56 per cent. that we inherited in 1997. Those statistics also show that new dwellings in England were built at an average density of 33 dwellings per hectare in 2003. That compares with 27 dwellings per hectare in 2002, and only 25 in 1997. We have even more ambitious density figures for the Thames gateway. Indeed, as I said, all planned development in the gateway is on brownfield land.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41115-18_para7">
<a name="stpa_133">The Thames gateway represents the largest collection of brownfield land next to a capital city in Europe. The vast majority of development in the gateway can be accommodated on existing derelict land. As I indicated, densities of development will be higher than those previously tolerated, and this will guard against profligate land use. At an average density of 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>15 Nov 2004 : Column 1076</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>40 dwellings per hectare, there is more than enough brownfield land in the gateway to accommodate the housing growth targets that the Government propose. So much for the doomsday scenarios of the &quot;concreting over the countryside&quot; brigade, the head-in-the-sand, die-in-the-ditch opponents of all, or any, change&#151;the green Tories, as I prefer to call them.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41115-18_para8">
<a name="stpa_134">In the context of the demands for growth in the south-east and the need for an affordable solution to its housing needs, the gateway offers the region&#039;s key opportunity for sustainable growth&#151;growth that will not only deliver a housing solution, but will address the underlying weaknesses of the area by providing economic and employment opportunities, environmental improvement and community renewal that will bring benefits to new and existing residents. It is this that lends it national significance.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41115-18_para9">
<a name="stpa_135">Of course, we are determined to reduce the economic differential between north and south, and we are pursuing policies such as the northern way to address that. But choking economic growth in the south does not mean more prosperity for the north. Someone going on the dole in Dartford does not mean a job for an unemployed worker in Sunderland. It simply means more jobs for our global competitors. That is why the gateway forms the cornerstone of the sustainable communities plan launched by my right hon. Friend the Deputy Prime Minister last year, and that is why we have put in place the arrangements necessary to take forward this sustainable programme.The gateway agenda is about accelerating delivery and expanding the scale of growth that can be achieved by 2016. At the same time, we will reinforce the quality and sustainability of the development that takes place, and ensure that the benefits reach the gateway community as a whole.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41115-18_para10">
<a name="stpa_136">A further and major boost for the Thames gateway is the UK&#039;s bid to hold the 2012 Olympics in the lower Lea valley, near Stratford. As the House is aware, today is the day that we are submitting our candidature file to the International Olympic Committee. If our bid is successful, an Olympic park will be built close to the new Stratford international station to house the Olympic stadium, Olympic village, aquatics centre, velodrome and other facilities, including the administrative nerve centre for the games. A successful bid would accelerate the new homes and jobs planned for the lower Lea valley, transform the environment and provide a legacy of first-class sporting facilities. Together with the development of Stratford city, it will create a modern new quarter for London and a new metropolitan role for the area, which will help to drive regeneration for many years to come.

 As the hon. Gentleman surely knows, all regional planning guidance falls to be reviewed after a period of time. It is true that RPG9 is in the process of review by the regional assembly, and I dare say we shall hear more about that in due course.

<a name="stpa_138">The creation of a new development hub at Ebbsfleet, centred on the new channel tunnel rail link station, and the consolidation of other regional centres at Medway, Southend and Thurrock will provide the region with competitive locations for modern business services. The modernisation of the gateway&#039;s port and distribution economy&#151;by tonnage, the ports in the gateway already collectively represent the largest in the UK&#151;will help to ensure the future of this vital sector. The renewal of the gateway&#039;s existing town centres will provide improved local services, new housing and employment. The creation of new and improved green spaces on a strategic scale will transform the image of the area, and the creation of new sustainable settlements at locations such as Barking Reach, Greenwich peninsula and Ebbsfleet will provide new high quality housing.

<p>
<a name="41115-19_para1">
<a name="stpa_139">The Mayor of London and the regional planning bodies for Kent and Essex endorsed this framework for growth in their recent inter-regional planning statement for the gateway, which was published in August. The statement supports the housing target of 120,000 that we put forward in the communities plan. In fact, it proposes to increase that figure by 8,000, which we heartily welcome. The statement also, for the first time, distributes this growth across the gateway to reflect the area&#039;s pattern of brownfield land.
</p>

I place on record my thanks to the Minister for that decision. However, I have a question about infrastructure. All the house building that is envisaged, be it on greenfield or brownfield sites, will place severe pressure on our infrastructure in the gateway area, not least NHS infrastructure.

 I am grateful to the Minister for giving way a second time. In answer to my hon. Friend the Member for Rayleigh (Mr. Francois), he spoke about the NHS. The key to development of the gateway is transport. Will he set out the transport proposals to deal with plans with which, by and large, I agree?

<p><a name="st_153"><a name="41115-19_spnew7"><b> Keith Hill: </b> 
 I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for that expression of support. My feeling is that there is a broad consensus on the gateway programme. It is worth bearing in mind that the majority of the local authorities with which we are working closely on the gateway project are Conservative authorities, and we have an excellent working relationship with them. The answer to the hon. Gentleman&#039;s question about transport infrastructure is yes, I propose to say a few words about that in due course, and my hon.

Furthermore, the Government are committed to a gateway investment programme of almost &#163;900 million, much of which will be devoted to transport infrastructure. In addition, I shall say a word in due course about the forthcoming community infrastructure fund, which will be jointly administered by my Department, the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister, and the Department for Transport.

The Thames gateway bridge, the concept for which dates back to before the middle of the last century, is now a real proposition. Hon. Members will have seen the pictures of the fantastic new channel tunnel domestic trains for which orders have now been placed. Those are massive boosts for the gateway, particularly when they are set against the competing budgetary pressures that those projects have faced. The newly established &#163;200 million community infrastructure fund, which my Department and the DFT jointly administer, will provide additional grants to support transport infrastructure up to 2008 in the four growth areas, including the Thames gateway.

<p>
<a name="41115-19_para10">
<a name="stpa_148">The third ingredient in our gateway strategy is local delivery capacity. The gateway may be a strategic idea, but it will actually happen locally.

<a name="stpa_149">It is critical that we have organisations in place with the capacity to define local priorities, to develop the necessary local programmes and, fundamentally, to integrate both the growth strategy with other local programmes and new communities with the old.

Mainstream programmes are also in place, and I have already mentioned the transport programme and the new universities. Much of the expenditure required, particularly for social infrastructure such as health facilities, hospitals and schools, will be drawn down from national budgets in the conventional way.

<p>
<a name="41115-19_para15">
<a name="stpa_153">Those costs are not unique to the gateway, but reflect the planned increase in population forecast in the gateway. The critical issue is not funding, but effective planning and management. However, additional Government investment will be required in certain critical areas. The ODPM has allocated a substantial new gateway budget to address those areas and other priorities, which represents an &#163;850 million commitment to the area for the first five years of the programme.

<a name="stpa_157">The fifth principle of the gateway strategy lies in securing the key policy goals to achieve sustainable objectives, which involves quality and imagination of design and construction and the reuse of brownfield land. We have taken steps nationally to promote higher densities and better design. For example, English Partnerships has already used urban design codes at Greenwich Millennium village.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41115-20_para2">
<a name="stpa_158">The Government have also made a commitment to developing a sustainable buildings code to establish higher standards for energy and water efficiency, waste and use of materials.

The gateway will rightly be in the vanguard of new design and construction standards.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41115-20_para3">
<a name="stpa_159">It goes without saying that the gateway is a big project. It will require time, resources, imagination and a lot of effort to realise, but it offers enormous rewards. It is currently fashionable to say how complicated the scheme is.

 My hon. Friend speaks of post-war success. If I had made a third intervention on the Minister, I would have reminded him that there was an urban development corporation for docklands. If the Thames gateway were made into an urban development corporation with powers, Ministers would be even more certain about the proposal. Does my hon. Friend have a view on that?

<p><a name="st_158"><a name="41115-20_spnew4"><b> Mr. Syms: </b> 
 I understand that there is consultation about whether to create a corporation for some of the area, but the concern is that the corporation would take in three regions: the eastern region, the southern region and London. A good deal of co-ordination will be required if that is to be successful. I see no reason why that should not happen, as long as there is the clear vision that the Minister mentioned.

<p><a name="st_160"><a name="41115-20_spnew6"><b> Mr. Syms: </b> 
 The Government and the Opposition agreed that it is best to build on brownfield sites. There are many opportunities in the Thames gateway. It would be a pity if we did not look at those opportunities before we took decisions that meant that we had to build on greenfield sites.

 Would the hon. Gentleman comment on the plan of the right hon.

He envisages a major city with many thousands of houses&#151; more than the number currently agreed. I wonder whether that is now Tory party policy and whether the hon. Gentleman agrees with the right hon. Gentleman.
</p>








<p><a name="st_162"><a name="41115-20_spnew8"><b> Mr. Syms: </b> 
 It is not policy. The key issue is that the sensible thing for any politician to do is to look first at urban areas where there are brownfield sites and opportunities. Otherwise, businesses and investment will be driven towards greenfield sites, which, as we all know, are cheaper to develop than many brownfield sites. With this development&#151;120,000 new homes, 180,000 jobs, 80,000 hectares, 40 miles by 20 miles&#151;we are talking about a major concern. If it is a success, it will be a major area of growth and building for the next 20 to 30 years.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41115-20_para15">
<a name="stpa_171">What needs to be done to make it a success? We need to set more targets, so that we can measure how we are getting on. Up-front investment is the key. If there is confidence among the financial institutions, they will invest because they will see the long-term ability to make profit from those areas. The Government have talked about levering in &#163;2 billion of investment. We all know that the area will develop and grow only if private sector funds, pension funds and other major financial institutions feel that it will be profitable and take an interest in those areas.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41115-20_para16">
<a name="stpa_172">The key difficulty is transport and infrastructure. We all know that there is a shopping list of transport projects, some of which are coming to fruition, some of which are planned. We have heard about the channel tunnel rail link, which we think will be finished by 2007; 

<br>&nbsp;<br>

<br>&nbsp;<br>the Greenwich waterfront and east London transit scheme; the east London line extension; the docklands light railway extension to City airport by 2005 and further extensions. The proposal for the Thames gateway bridge at the moment is for a private finance initiative scheme with a toll to link both sides of the estuary, which will open lots of opportunities. Substantial road improvements are also proposed. The Government have so far committed about &#163;600 million for these schemes. It is important to get the transport right. In docklands, there was growth but the extension of the underground was delayed. Transport should come first if we are to lever in investment for housing and development.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41115-20_para17">
<a name="stpa_173">There is concern that there has already been some backtracking on certain schemes. Transport for London&#039;s scheme for linking Barking Reach and Barking town centre is now proposed to be a bus route rather than a transit scheme. The rail passenger committee for southern England says that the poor rail network in the region could cripple development.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41115-20_para18">
<a name="stpa_174">The Minister did not mention Crossrail. The City of London and many hon. Members have long felt that Crossrail, with its Stratford link, is essential to the development of the area, but we are also aware that it is a remarkably expensive scheme. Whenever Crossrail has briefed me, it has said that most of the track is there, but it just needs to link up this area and that area. As a Transport Minister is to wind up the debate, perhaps he can enlighten us a little more about progress on Crossrail and how it could affect investment in the area.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41115-20_para19">
<a name="stpa_175">Infrastructure is key, but as the region covers not only London but parts of Essex and Kent, it needs to be fairly distributed between the urban and non-urban areas. Most of the schemes that I have seen so far tend to concentrate on the London bit rather than on Essex or Kent. My hon. Friend the Member for Castle Point (Bob Spink) has tabled several parliamentary questions about services in Essex. Those communities must get the investment if they are expected to take additional housing and development. If development is to be forced in, the investment must come first. The siting of hospitals, for example, is a key issue.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41115-20_para20">
<a name="stpa_176">The Mayor and the regional planning bodies of both the south and the east believe that there is substantially more capacity to build in the area if sufficient investment is made. As many as 300,000 houses have been mentioned; again, investment is the key. The Campaign to Protect Rural England, which, along with some of the Labour Members present today, is not all that keen on development in rural areas, has also cottoned on to the fact that one could lift some of the levels and targets in the Thames gateway. The investment has to be up front.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41115-20_para21">
<a name="stpa_177">When the housing is built, it is important that the communities are as self-contained as possible, with health, education, culture, media and open spaces all provided for. The Minister mentioned that in his speech. It is important that all the facilities be included in planning guidance. It is important also to be able to get in and out of the Thames gateway, as one suspects many people will need to do for employment purposes. It is also important to minimise the number of people who have to move around.

 The hon. Gentleman mentioned media in passing. I trespass on his speech to say that if the BBC listens to the debate or reads his speech it should take cognisance of the fact that there is no Thames gateway television or radio. In Tilbury, on the north bank, I get Kent BBC television, and the area does not get London services. The media must take account of what is demonstrably a new area. The BBC in particular is way behind, but commercial television is not really meeting the challenge either.
</p>








<p><a name="st_164"><a name="41115-21_spnew1"><b> Mr. Syms: </b> 
 That is a good point. Although we may disagree about regional identities, TV station identities certainly inform the way in which people think about their region. I am in the Meridian area, and Meridian claims to serve people not too far from the hon. Gentleman&#039;s region, so the service stretches all the way from Dorset to the Thames gateway. Media can certainly define an area very successfully.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41115-21_para0">
<a name="stpa_178">The Minister said clearly that most of the identified sites for development were brownfield, but the majority of the area is greenfield, and there is green belt within it. It is important to tease out the priorities for development. I know that the CPRE is concerned about the temptation to go for some of the greenfield sites in Essex and Kent before investing in some of the more expensive redevelopment sites in London. Given that the Government have on occasions encroached on green belt, we need a clear statement on how they feel about the piece of green belt on this side of London.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41115-21_para1">
<a name="stpa_179">The Minister spoke a great deal about density levels but gave no specific commitment. Figures of 90 to 100 per hectare have been mentioned, and perhaps the Minister who winds up can be more specific about what level the Government consider appropriate. In previous developments, shortcuts have sometimes been taken, so it is important to have high-quality as well as high-density development.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41115-21_para2">
<a name="stpa_180">The Environment Agency and others have estimated that perhaps &#163;4 billion will have to be spent on flood defences in the area. The Environment Agency issues maps, and PPG25 should inform planning authorities, but it is clearly a matter for concern. If there is a flood on the site in 20 years&#039; time, when many houses have been built, people will ask how we could let the development go ahead without proper flood prevention measures. The time to consider the issue is now, not after the houses have been built.
</p>








<p><a name="st_165"><a name="41115-21_spnew2"><b> Mr. Francois </b> 
: My hon. Friend will be aware that flooding is an emotive issue in Essex, going all the way back to the great flood of 1953&#151;the terrible events of that night are not lost on us in the county even today. That being the case, it is a great pity that the Government decided to abolish the Essex local flood defence committee, which had a tremendous track record. Does he agree that safety must be paramount and the Government must be more careful about the flooding implications of the proposed developments?
</p>








<p><a name="st_166"><a name="41115-21_spnew3"><b> Mr. Syms: </b> 
 Of course. The Minister will have heard what my hon. Friend said, and indeed he mentioned flooding in his speech. Of course we must take sensible measures to ensure that any development is safe.

<p><a name="st_167"><a name="41115-21_spnew4"><b> Keith Hill: </b> 
 I am sure that neither the hon. Gentleman nor the hon. Member for Rayleigh (Mr. Francois) is in the business of scaremongering. The Thames is protected to a level of one in 1,000 years, and that will remain the case up to 2030. In the meantime, much work is being done, led by the Environment Agency, to put in place appropriate defences for the future beyond that year. Furthermore, the hon. Gentleman is absolutely right: PPG25 informs every aspect from regional to local planning decisions in terms of flood risk and assessment. Every ODPM and local vehicle delivery project is also subject to rigorous flood risk assessment, and we are using the opportunity of the greening of the gateway to think creatively about sustainable flood defences. I want to establish it absolutely on the record that the Government are seized of the issue and every possible measure is being taken to increase the already high levels of flood defence in the Thames gateway.
</p>








<p><a name="st_168"><a name="41115-21_spnew5"><b> Mr. Syms: </b> 
 I thank the Minister for his assurance that Conservative Members are not scaremongering. It is obviously sensible to think before building lots of houses.
</p>








<p><a name="st_169"><a name="41115-21_spnew6"><b> Mr. Francois: </b> 
 I, too, am grateful for what the Minister has said. As my hon. Friend will know, there has been a lively debate on these issues between the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister and the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, but the Minister has given us some reassurance. I hope that he will continue to bear the issues in mind as development proceeds.
</p>








<p><a name="st_170"><a name="41115-21_spnew7"><b> Mr. Syms: </b> 
 My hon. Friend has made his own point.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41115-21_para3">
<a name="stpa_181">The Minister mentioned skills. There is concern about whether there are enough skills to deal with this level of development, especially in regard to the built environment. The way in which development is going means that there are already shortages of planning officers, which is why planning appeals sometimes take so long. I was pleased to learn that the Minister had announced a skills audit by the Learning and Skills Council. It would be a pity if people affected by unemployment above the national average could not take advantage of the growth and inward investment that will result from this project.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41115-21_para4">
<a name="stpa_182">Other anxieties have been expressed. For instance, there is the possibility of people building up land banks on brownfield sites in order to sit on rising land values. There are also general environmental worries. There is, for example, a substantial water shortage; indeed, all the public utilities need to undertake major investment. Given the degree of development involved, we should ask whether we should try to improve environmental standards in some of the homes. In Australia, there are double flushes on lavatories to conserve water.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41115-21_para5">
<a name="stpa_183">I will not detain the House further, because many Members with local interests want to speak. There is considerable common ground, and we have a great opportunity. Investment must be made at the outset to give confidence to the private sector; we need design of a decent quality; and we need to involve people in the area, because much of the development will change its geography considerably. If it is all done properly, however, I think we can offset some of the pressures affecting greenfield sites.

<p><a name="st_171"><a name="41115-21_spnew8"><b> Dr. Howard Stoate  (Dartford) (Lab):</b> 
 I welcome the opportunity to speak in such an important debate.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41115-21_para7">
<a name="stpa_185">The people of Dartford are extremely proud of their heritage, which they see as one of the engine rooms of the Kent economy. Dartford has been home to many great engineers and thinkers of bygone ages. Hiram Maxim, who made such a contribution to powered flight, lived there. Trevithick did much of his engineering work there. Burroughs, Wellcome, one of the first and most important drugs companies in the world, set up shop in Dartford and has done extremely well. Dartford is also reported to be the site of the first-ever commercially successful paper mill. It has a long and proud heritage. We recognise, however, that we have moved into a post-industrial age, and that businesses that have long outlived their usefulness need to be regenerated. Dartford needs new jobs, new investment, better and more modern housing and a cleaner environment if it is to be an exciting area of which we can be proud in future.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41115-21_para8">
<a name="stpa_186">That is all very well and good and the people of Dartford are certainly onside, but development must take place in a measured way. We must ensure that the area can sustain so much investment, and we must pay careful attention to detail in terms of infrastructure. The area must be enhanced rather than being damaged further.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41115-21_para9">
<a name="stpa_187">The right hon. Member for Wokingham (Mr. Redwood), the new shadow Secretary of State for deregulation, has called for the creation of a new city to be called Thames Reach, with its heart in the Swanscombe and Greenhithe areas. He wants to see thousands of extra houses built in Kent Thameside, in addition to the proposed brownfield developments at Eastern Quarry, Swanscombe peninsula and Ebbsfleet, to meet the housing needs of the rest of the south-east. He has said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_10">&quot;there is a large area suitable for development bounded by the settlements of Northfleet and Greenhithe along the river banks, with Swanscombe, Bean and Darenth to the south&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The idea is to add to the development projects already identified and up and running for both Kent Thameside and the Swale and Medway Districts. We need a new city centre to the south of the planned Swanscombe and Greenhithe developments, with better community facilities alongside more housing to the south of the current planned developments.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="41115-21_para10">
<a name="stpa_188">The right hon. Gentleman&#039;s proposal amounts to nothing less than the concreting over of north Kent, with large swathes of green belt and farmland in Dartford bulldozed to make way for new housing. It will destroy the character and integrity of existing communities such as Swanscombe and Greenhithe, which every effort is being made to preserve. It will effectively swallow up the communities of Bean, Darenth, Betsham and Southfleet, pleasant Kent villages that currently enjoy the countryside and the rolling green fields that surround them. It undermines the claims of local Tories that their party is committed to the defence of the green belt and the countryside. Moreover, it demonstrates that the Tories want to use 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>15 Nov 2004 : Column 1088</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>parts of north Kent to meet all the south-east&#039;s future house-building needs, thus ensuring that their own heartland areas are not affected.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41115-21_para11">
<a name="stpa_189">Even if this madcap scheme could somehow be brought to fruition, I seriously doubt that the local infrastructure could begin to cope with so much strain on its limited resources. A recent report by the planning committee of the South East regional assembly questions whether even the projected housing growth in the Thames gateway is sustainable, given the limitations of our water supply and sewage treatment network and the fact that one of the lowest levels of annual rainfall in the country is found in the south-east, and north Kent in particular.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41115-21_para12">
<a name="stpa_190">The Environment Agency has pointed out that per capita water consumption has risen by between 3 per cent. and 5 per cent. in the last 10 years, and that 80 per cent. of water in Kent comes from groundwater. The level of rainfall received by the south-east is the lowest among UK regions: it is only about 740 mm a year. All that will obviously put a huge strain on existing supply, and Kent county council estimates that an additional &#163;70 million will be needed in Kent Thameside in the next few years to speed up utility connections, flood defences and land reclamation. We are already seeing signs that the infrastructure needs to be upgraded significantly even to deal with the planned development, let alone another entire city.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41115-21_para13">
<a name="stpa_191">What about the effect on air quality? Dartford borough council has set up an air quality management area around the A282 tunnel approach road to mitigate the impact of traffic emissions. Traffic emissions in the area 72 per cent. above the Government&#039;s nitrogen dioxide objective, and 54 per cent. above the PM2&#151;that refers to particulate matter&#151;objective. Through traffic along the A282 accounts for at least 25 per cent. of emissions in the area.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41115-21_para14">
<a name="stpa_192">As traffic levels in Kent Thameside increase over the next 20 years, air quality in Dartford could easily deteriorate further. Additional air quality management areas are already being planned at the Bean interchange, St. Clements way, East Hill and Park road, the Brent-Watling street junction and Lowfield street. Dartford council is at least doing its bit to monitor air quality, but we must ensure that an appropriate standard is maintained. Additional funds to promote more sustainable local transport solutions are urgently needed.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41115-21_para15">
<a name="stpa_193">One obvious source of income is the Dartford river crossing. Each year it generates &#163;55 million in income. Only about &#163;1 million of that is earmarked for local transport uses in Kent Thameside. I believe that its share must be increased, as a matter of urgency.

<p><a name="st_172"><a name="41115-22_spnew0"><b> Bob Spink: </b> 
 I believe that there is currently a &#163;60 million surplus from the operation of the Dartford crossing. It lies in the coffers unspent. Legislation has stated that the money should be spent on local infrastructure improvements. Will the hon. Gentleman accept this offer from me? I will back his being given, say, 25 per cent. of that&#151;&#163;15 million&#151;for his local road improvements if he will back my being given &#163;15 million to help build Canvey&#039;s third road.

<br>&nbsp;<br></p>








<p><a name="st_173"><a name="41115-22_spnew1"><b> Dr. Stoate: </b> 
 That is an intriguing idea. I wonder whether the hon. Gentleman will be my agent and I will be his agent in this deal. Certainly, the hon. Gentleman is right that we need to ensure that a good chunk of the money is put into a local transport infrastructure that mitigates the effects of increased traffic and air pollution generated by the extra traffic that we see.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41115-22_para0">
<a name="stpa_194">Even with improvements to public transport and with a rail freight network, additional capacity needs to be built into the road network in Kent Thameside. Urgent consideration needs to be given to upgrading the A2/B255 Bean interchange. The junction currently serves the Bluewater regional shopping centre, Greenhithe village and the A206, which runs to the Dartford river crossings. It is also due to serve the Eastern Quarry development, a 740-acre development that will contain about 7,250 new houses.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41115-22_para1">
<a name="stpa_195">The route management study, which has been recently published by the Highways Agency, has acknowledged that the junction must be improved. Dartford borough council and Kent county council have also recognised the importance of this work. However, despite this there is little prospect of the necessary funding being forthcoming in the next few years.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41115-22_para2">
<a name="stpa_196">Another factor is pressure on school places. There is a desperate need for the expansion of secondary school places in Dartford. Currently, there is no wide ability county boys&#039; school for children living in most of the north, west and east of Dartford. Many 11-year-olds are now faced with a half-hour train journey just to get to school, which I believe is not acceptable. Kent LEA is proposing to increase the number of secondary places in the area over the next few years but it has no plans to build a new county boys&#039; school in Dartford, where the need is greatest.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41115-22_para3">
<a name="stpa_197">What about higher education? The Government&#039;s original planning guidance for Kent Thameside&#151;RPG9a&#151;which was published in 1994, highlighted the importance of creating a higher education facility in Kent Thameside as a means of raising the skills profile of the area and helping to encourage the growth of spin-off companies requiring higher levels of skill in north Kent. RPG9a envisaged the development of a 5,000-student campus and also a London science park, supported by GlaxoSmithKline, the borough council and the university of Greenwich. However, neither of these projects came to fruition. In fact, the university of Greenwich has now closed its remaining Dartford campus. North West Kent college is now the only post-18 education provider in Kent Thameside.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41115-22_para4">
<a name="stpa_198">The Government&#039;s recent skills audit report found that the number of people with skills in the Thames gateway is 20 per cent. below the national average. It warned that unless the problem was addressed, businesses could be forced to move elsewhere. The report says that 112,000 of the 194,000 new jobs that will be created by 2016 in Thames gateway will need applicants with A-level and degree level qualifications. Compared with the rest of London and other parts of the UK, Thames gateway has a significant skills gap, particularly among local residents.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41115-22_para5">
<a name="stpa_199">At present, most Kent Thameside residents with higher skills are forced to commute to London. Almost 100,000&#151;that is, 12 per cent. of the Kent and Medway 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>15 Nov 2004 : Column 1090</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>work force&#151;commute to London. The percentage is as high as 38 for those who commute from Dartford. About 15,900 people commute from Dartford to London. We need to reverse this trend if Kent Thameside is to be genuinely sustainable.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41115-22_para6">
<a name="stpa_200">We must give urgent consideration to the rebuilding of Greenhithe and Dartford stations to increase capacity. Furthermore, the damaging proposals of the Strategic Rail Authority to reduce service levels at the Greenhithe, Stone crossing and Swanscombe must be rejected and reversed. The existing Kent line is already running well over capacity and the plans that have been put forward, when the CTRL phase 2 is open, are significantly to cut back services on the north Kent line. That will have a damaging effect on my local area and it is something that must be examined carefully.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41115-22_para7">
<a name="stpa_201">Greenhithe station is at the heart of Kent Thameside and passenger levels at this station are projected to rise considerably in the next five to 10 years, as the housing developments at Ingress Park&#151;900 homes&#151;Eastern Quarry&#151;7,250 homes&#151;Stone Castle&#151;500 homes&#151;and Greenhithe waterfront&#151;950 homes&#151;get underway and are completed.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41115-22_para8">
<a name="stpa_202">Dartford station, despite being the busiest station in north Kent, is housed in a 40-year-old building and does not have the platform capacity to meet the level of services that use it at present, let alone in the future. Consideration must be given to increasing the capacity at London Bridge and renewing the north Kent network&#039;s antiquated signalling system. It is woefully inadequate to meet future needs. It currently takes between 45 and 55 minutes for trains to travel to London from Dartford owing to the inadequacies of the current network. This must be put right.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41115-22_para9">
<a name="stpa_203">I asked the mayor of Swanscombe and Greenhithe town council, Councillor Brian Fitzpatrick, who is a senior traffic engineer, to give his thoughts on how he thought the new development would affect the areas of Swanscombe and Greenhithe. He certainly came up with some interesting ideas. He stated that a lack of attention to detail and to local knowledge pervades many of the applications submitted for planning at the moment. Knowledge of the existing situation and the needs and aspirations of the in situ community must be a firm component of all applications, but at the moment it is not given adequate consideration. He believes that true integration can be achieved only if we address fully the needs and wishes of the existing settled community with the needs of an incoming community.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41115-22_para10">
<a name="stpa_204">The good news is that Brian Fitzpatrick accepts that there are good and sensible reasons why there should be new communities in Kent Thameside, but unless we get the planning issues right we will come unstuck. That will cause divisions in the local community rather than encouraging integration, which is what we so desperately need.

: I am following the hon. Gentleman&#039;s argument with interest. He is talking about many contemporary problems. He knows, however, that the gateway is for the future. Does he support the gateway proposals, and will they resolve some of the issues that he is raising?

<p><a name="st_175"><a name="41115-22_spnew3"><b> Dr. Stoate: </b> 
 That is an extremely good question. The answer is that I entirely support the gateway proposals, but they will work only if we pay particular attention to the issues that I am raising, which I am sure that other hon. Members will raise. I see that the hon. Member for South Holland and The Deepings (Mr. Hayes) is nodding. I am sure that he agrees.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41115-22_para11">
<a name="stpa_205">Kent Thameside and the Thames gateway development is a marvellous opportunity to regenerate the whole of the south-east, but it will work only if we get the infrastructure right before we go ahead with the development. The greatest mistake that we could make would be to press on with development with already overstretched existing capacity, which in many areas is already at breaking point. That would lead to more damage. There are huge opportunities that can be realised if only we get the development right. It is all a matter of attention to detail. The people of Dartford are behind the development, but whenever I talk to them on the doorstep they say that that is provided we can improve the road network, provided that we can improve the rail network, provided that we can get enough school places for our youngsters, and provided that we have enough health care facilities to meet the needs of the future. We are all in agreement, but the development must be done in the right way.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41115-22_para12">
<a name="stpa_206">The people of Swanscombe and Greenhithe want careful co-ordination of what is proposed for the future with what we have now. Again, if we get that right, they will be totally on side with this type of development. The point made by Councillor Fitzpatrick is that no one from Swanscombe and Greenhithe is on the delivery board. No one from the town council in Swanscombe is able to participate in these planning issues. Councillor Fitzpatrick thinks that that is also a mistake. The people of Swanscombe and Greenhithe are asking that it is ensured that there is integration with existing and planned new communities and also that Swanscombe and Greenhithe residents are not disadvantaged by the scale and pace of developments surrounding them.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41115-22_para13">
<a name="stpa_207">These people are asking for a few quite simple things. They want the inclusion of the local community in discussions about the size, location and required infrastructure of the planned development. They are asking that more resources be given to Dartford borough council to enable it better to represent its residents. They are asking also for another look at the Kent traffic model to ensure that it is run more often and kept up to date with existing traffic movements. Further, they are asking for targets for air quality that are enforceable to ensure that we do not damage our environment. In addition, they are asking for a close look at the numbers and situations of new developments to ensure that they are sustainable in terms of bus transport and air quality. I do not think that these requests are unreasonable.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41115-22_para14">
<a name="stpa_208">If we get these things right, we will all be happy with what we see. If we get them wrong, we will live to regret that. I believe that by proper attention to detail, proper integration of what local people want and proper working with local councils and development boards, we can achieve the aim of us all, which is a bright future that includes the regeneration of old worked-out sites. That is a proud future for the whole of the Thames gateway area.

 The hon. Member for Dartford (Dr. Stoate) has done the House a service. He has made the &quot;yes but&quot; speech. When we listened to the hon. Member for Poole (Mr. Syms) and the Minister, there was a danger that we were getting consensus and hearing that everything was all right. That was particularly so when the Minister was sketching the Nirvana that was growing up in the east of London. I almost felt that the House was going to sing &quot;Jerusalem&quot;, given the way in which the Minister was lauding the progress and the prospects.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41115-23_para0">
<a name="stpa_209">That is not to say that the Minister was not right to say that there were some exciting opportunities. The hon. Member for Dartford was right to mention the excitement around the east of London and in the various communities in Kent and Essex. There are real prospects for solving some long-term problems, such as unemployment or the need for economic regeneration and affordable housing. Many potential prizes are there to be gained, but it is the House&#039;s job and duty to question Ministers to ensure that they are getting it right. Otherwise, the opportunity could be wasted and there are already a number of signs that the Government have not learned the lessons from the past and are not listening carefully enough to those who will be affected. When the Minister for Transport replies to the debate, I hope that he will answer some of the questions that will be posed.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41115-23_para1">
<a name="stpa_210">Regeneration on this sort of scale can present real problems. We saw with the new towns of the past that much hope and excitement was generated by the prospect of new projects, but the optimistic scenario was frequently not fulfilled. Three-quarters of the English new towns are among the most deprived 50 per cent. of local authorities. All but two are more deprived than the counties in which they reside. Many of them never grew as planned. Skelmersdale was supposed to have a population of 80,000 but never made it beyond 40,000; Corby was planned for 100,000 but never made it beyond 50,000. Much of the hope in those new projects was never delivered, and I hope that the Minister will reassure the House that the Government have learned from problems of the past when expectations were raised but never met.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41115-23_para2">
<a name="stpa_211">There are many and huge difficulties in building the Thames gateway. I shall deal with the problem of flood plains in more detail later. Contaminated land is another problem, which makes the project quite expensive. The lack of transport infrastructure for the initial stages is another difficulty. There will be real problems; it will not be easy, and the Government should recognise that. The vision and planning will have to be that much more effective. I want to ask several specific questions about the problems. Some may arise because we are at the initial stages of the process and others because Government Departments are making mistakes, but the House must have some of these points answered.

I have to say that it gets pretty complicated when one tries to work out who is doing what, who is leading the project and who is accountable for what. We need accountability because huge amounts of money are being spent.

The Minister puts his eye to the ceiling at the sight of it. Eighteen local authorities are listed in the web, followed by a wonderful list of bodies, including the Thames estuary partnership, English Partnerships, the Environment Agency, the sustainable communities taskforce, English Heritage, Transport for London, East of England Development Agency, South East of England Development Agency, the Greater London Authority, London Development Agency, Thames gateway London partnership, green giro network, architecture and urbanism unit, Thurrock UDC, London Thames gateway UDC, heart of Thames gateway, Thames gateway South Essex, Thames gateway Kent partnership, Kent county council, British Waterways, London First, Gateway to London, Invest Thames Gateway, Thames Gateway strategic executive&#151;and no doubt many others.

 To return to my earlier intervention on my hon. Friend the Member for Poole (Mr. Syms), the corporation will cover all of this within one overall body. The great success of Lord Heseltine&#039;s docklands was the establishment of the London Docklands development corporation. Does that not provide a sensible solution to the hon. Gentleman&#039;s problem, meeting the point that he is putting to us?

<p><a name="st_178"><a name="41115-23_spnew2"><b> Mr. Davey: </b> 
 I am not sure that that corporation was the great achievement that the hon. Gentleman assumes. There were many problems with the experience, particularly when local communities were not consulted and their interests were overridden. Some of the development was not as sustainable as we want to see for the Thames gateway. I am not in favour of having one all-embracing body. It is important to ensure that accountability structures are in place.

<a name="41115-23_para5">
<a name="stpa_214">As the Minister knows, we debated these issues in connection with statutory instruments for setting up the Thurrock urban development corporation. The Liberal Democrats were concerned with the lack of accountability in the structure. I should add&#151;the hon. Member for Thurrock (Andrew Mackinlay) may want to join the debate on this point&#151;that party control of Thurrock council changed recently. However, after the change, the Labour councillors appointed to the UDC did not change. The newly elected Conservative councillors did not assume the local authority places on the board. That is why we raised questions of accountability when we debated the statutory instrument, but that point did not come out. We were given assurances that the UDCs would be more accountable, but that does not appear to have happened when the recently elected councillors failed to take up their places.

On the contrary, it has created confusion and Ministers must explain how that confusion will be cleared up. We have heard about directorates on the Thames gateway within the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister; we have heard about a Cabinet Committee; we have heard about a new office&#151;until hearing the Minister&#039;s speech, I knew nothing about it&#151;being launched somewhere in the Thames gateway earlier last week.

Sandra Hunt, the director of the Thames gateway-based consultancy, Regenfirst, said:

</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="41115-23_para9">
<a name="stpa_218">Others make the very same point. To be fair, some believe that the Government are getting it right in some parts of the Thames gateway. The leader of Medway council in Kent&#151;

 Yes, Rodney Chambers&#151;Rod to his mates, presumably&#151;believed that in his area the Government were following a democratic model and he was pleasantly surprised that the local authority was given the powers to go ahead and deliver it, with accountability to the people. That is the sort of model that many in the House would prefer. I hope that Ministers can get through this alphabet soup that the Government have created in the Thames gateway and that there will be clearer lines of accountability and fewer organisations in respect of this important project.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41115-23_para10">
<a name="stpa_219">Related to the number of organisations is the cost. A plethora of bodies means a plethora of chief executives and a whole range of people wanting jobs and coming in with their different lackeys. The Government talk positively about the Thurrock urban development corporation, but it has a chief executive, director of resources, director of planning and strategy, director of delivery and director of marketing and communications. How many similar sorts of positions will apply to the partnerships that I listed with concerns in the Thames gateway? When he replies to the debate, can the Minister for Transport tell us how many chief executives there will be in all the bodies dealing with the Thames gateway? If not, will he write to us with the answer and include information on the collective salary involved?

 The hon. Gentleman is in danger of ruining a good point about the plethora of organisations. It is important that we have posts for the Thurrock urban development corporation, which is the rocket motor for that area&#039;s regeneration. We want the positions appointed and under way. The hon. Gentleman should not knock that aspect, but otherwise, he makes a valid point about the plethora of quangos and other organisations and the bewilderment that comes from it.
</p>








<p><a name="st_182"><a name="41115-24_spnew1"><b> Mr. Davey: </b> 
 The hon. Gentleman is right to pull me up on that. I am not saying that those posts are the wrong ones for that particular organisation. The point is that if they are mirrored in all the organisations I have listed, huge amounts of money will be spent paying the same people to do the same things in the same area. That is both bewildering and a total waste of money. I hope that the Minister can give us some assurances on the costs of those organisations. How many heads of marketing will there be for the Thames gateway? We need to know.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41115-24_para0">
<a name="stpa_220">Transport is the other issue that has come up, and the Minister who will reply to the debate at least has some responsibility for that. It seems to most people that transport is the absolute key. If the state sector can do anything to unlock the potential in the east of London, it has to be in its provision of a public transport network. I am sure that the Government will say they are doing an awful lot, talking about everything from the extension of the Docklands light railway to the east London line extension to the plans for Crossrail and so on. At the moment, though, none of us is clear whether some of the bigger projects are actually going to happen. There is lots of talk about them, but when the Secretary of State for Transport made a statement on Crossrail, there was not a clear commitment on the cash that would enable us to know that it will happen.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41115-24_para1">
<a name="stpa_221">I say that not as a party political point but to ask what the best use of public money is. Spending on public transport infrastructure is probably the most effective use of public money to unlock potential. If a lot of money was channelled that way, we could save a great deal on other aspects of the projects. Will the Minister say a little about the key role for transport?

<a name="41115-24_para2">
<a name="stpa_222">One project on the drawing board and ready to go could improve some road links in the south of Essex and create jobs, and that is the Shell Haven port and distribution park development. The planning application has been on Ministers&#039; desks for some time. Because of the sensitivity of the proposal, the Minister may not wish to comment directly, and nor do I expect him to, but a lot of people across the House support that application and look to the Government to give it the go-ahead. To those of us who have had even limited involvement, it seems to have dealt sensitively with the community environmental issues, and it promises a huge amount for early delivery on jobs, economic regeneration and transport links.

</p>

<p>
<a name="41115-24_para3">
<a name="stpa_223">Let me turn to the environmental challenges in the gateway and how the Government are responding to them. The Government are right to focus their attention on the gateway because brownfield developments there could ensure that land is successfully reused. They also have to ratchet up construction standards so that materials are used in a sustainable way and to make sure that the buildings are designed so that they are efficient in terms of energy use, water use and all the other things coming from advisory groups.
</p>

<a name="41115-24_para4">
<a name="stpa_224">There is continuing concern about the flood plain and about how the Government are tackling that issue. I have asked questions about this, particularly in trying to get information about the maps. I was told in an answer on 20 May 2004 that maps are provided to local planning authorities every three months and updated as new information comes on board. The Minister said that there is a lot of certainty and stability, but in fact there are many changes in the analysis of the flood plain in the Thames gateway. This is not a minor point; some 11 of the 14 designated growth areas in the Thames gateway are in the flood plain. It is pretty essential that we get this right. I hope that the Minister is right, and I know that the Department and others are spending a lot of time on the matter. He has given assurances that none of the developments will go ahead unless and until there has been a flood risk assessment.
</p>








<p><a name="st_185"><a name="41115-24_spnew4"><b> Keith Hill: </b> 
 May I dispel the possibility of scaremongering on flooding and the flood plain? The fact is that something in the order of 17 London boroughs lie within the flood plain. Some &#163;85 billion of property assets are located within the flood plain, but it is protected. Provided the flood plain is protected, which is the Government&#039;s commitment, practice and intention, there is not a significant problem. The hon. Gentleman is simply wrong to conjure the expression &quot;flood plain&quot; out of the firmament and imagine that that is in itself a threat. It is not, and he is doing wrong in even ventilating the possibility of a threat arising from the existing flood plain in its own right.
</p>








<p><a name="st_186"><a name="41115-24_spnew5"><b> Mr. Davey: </b> 
 That is an extraordinary statement from the Minister, containing the idea that Members of Parliament should not ask questions about some of the key risks. It is not just hon. Members who are doing so. Peter Dower, chair of the Association of British Insurers Thames gateway working group, said in a press release issued by the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_13">&quot;Insurers remain committed to offering as wide a range of insurance solutions as possible to home-owners and businesses.

That updating may even require a completely new barrage to be built, according to some analysts. That would be an important investment. We are talking about &#163;4 billion or &#163;5 billion, and the project will be critical to many of the developments that we are talking about tonight. I am not making this point to scaremonger or to try to suggest that it will blow away all the potential. I hope that the problems, issues and risks can be managed properly so that we can develop brownfield land. It is in the interests of everybody, including my constituents, that we do that. We must be reassured by Ministers, however, that serious risks are being properly considered.

<a name="41115-24_para8">
<a name="stpa_228">I want to raise a few more specific issues to ask whether the Government have thought about them in their overall strategy, particularly relating to the people who will live in the homes in the Thames gateway. One thing that concerned me about the Barker report was that it was very much a top-down analysis of housing demand. It did not analyse the types of people concerned&#151;the age groups or the family distribution and organisation involved, such as one-parent families or families with two or three children&#151;and therefore did not analyse the type of homes that will be needed. Can the Minister assure us that the demographic needs are being considered in the plans being developed? For example, will there be any developments for older, retired people in the Thames gateway?
</p>

<p>
<a name="41115-24_para9">
<a name="stpa_229">We have heard about other aspects of the infrastructure such as health, education and transport. Are there any proposals for prisons, for example? From the Minister&#039;s reaction, he does not appear to think so, but all such aspects need to be considered.

<p>
<a name="41115-24_para10">
<a name="stpa_230">Some transport issues, especially the river crossings, do not appear to be linked to the environmental and public transport needs of the communities. For example, a huge debate has arisen over the Thames gateway bridge. It clearly has to have a road link, but will the bridge also be able to take trams or pedestrians? What are the plans for guaranteed bus lanes? If we could have some assurances on those aspects of the bridge, many people would have their fears assuaged.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41115-24_para11">
<a name="stpa_231">As other colleagues have mentioned, the developments are a real opportunity. We hope that the Government will get it right and we want to help them to do so. I hope that Ministers will take my remarks in that light.

 In congratulating the Government on their vision for the Thames gateway, I wish first to focus on the meaning of Thames gateway regeneration for the London borough of Redbridge, which lies along on the border of London and Essex, and the importance of local authorities in providing leadership when building tomorrow&#039;s communities.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41115-25_para0">
<a name="stpa_232">To many people outside Redbridge, the borough is a leafy suburb of London. To some in Essex, Suffolk and Norfolk, Redbridge is known only as &quot;the place you park your car when you go to London&quot;. However, our borough contains a diversity of urban, suburban and rural communities, a diversity of faiths and races, and also some of the richest and poorest areas of the country.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41115-25_para1">
<a name="stpa_233">Redbridge has seen enormous changes in the past decade. Some two and a half years ago, the local council launched an ambitious vision for the future of Ilford, &quot;Progressive Ilford&quot;, to fulfil local demand for homes, jobs and services for a generation. I worked out that when it was completed I would be 85, so I hope to be still around when it all comes to fruition. I was pleased that my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Constitutional Affairs, in his previous capacity as a Minister in the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister, was able to attend that event with me. However, the launch of that regeneration plan coincided with a change of political control in Redbridge, which has led to a disturbing shift in the council&#039;s regeneration priorities.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41115-25_para2">
<a name="stpa_234">The first apparent shift by the new Tory council was to deprioritise public consultation. Dialogue with the public did take place, but it rarely did so in a form that gave consultees the impression their concerns had been heeded. I should like to take the Gants Hill area as an example. Gants Hill is situated on the border between my constituency and Ilford, South at the heart of Redbridge. It has a Central line tube station; a crossing of the A12, the Woodford avenue, which links to the north circular road; and Cranbrook road, a major local route.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41115-25_para3">
<a name="stpa_235">Gants Hill has been in need of regeneration since the late 1960s. However, for two years, the Tory council tried to force through a plan that would have flattened dozens of homes to make way for a supermarket, despite four other supermarkets being within a mile of the site, and in the face of massive public opposition. The council also proposed to close the much loved and architecturally significant Gants Hill library, regardless once again of public opposition and the desperate need in the area for better community facilities. The library and its car park have been designated by the council for commercial or leisure use.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41115-25_para4">
<a name="stpa_236">In the last four years, Gants Hill residents association has complained to me about the neglect of the Woodford avenue area. Mustafa Redif, the manager of Serene&#039;s fish and chip shop on the Woodford avenue, told me recently that he felt that his corner of Gants Hill had been overlooked when it came to regeneration&#151;a view shared by other residents in Gants Hill&#039;s &quot;forgotten quarters&quot;. <i>[Interruption.]</i> I am sure that my hon. Friends are thinking of other forgotten quarters in their constituencies, especially if they have Conservative councils.

<a name="stpa_237">Perhaps our most well known landmark was the Odeon cinema on the A12 at Gants Hill. It has now been demolished for the construction of over 200 high-rise flats, which has taken from our community part of its identity and fuelled the demonisation of young people who have little to do in the area. A similar story is told by residents of Barkingside, who are threatened with the loss of Fullwell Cross library, which serves as a cultural landmark in the community, to be replaced with blocks of flats.
</p>

<a name="41115-25_para6">
<a name="stpa_238">Those travesties of regeneration stem from a difference in principle. When under Labour control, Redbridge&#039;s plans for the future were based on the needs of local people, but now, young people in my constituency are priced out of the local housing market, forcing them out of the communities in which they grew up. Everyone can see the slow erosion of community life in our area, but still the Tories fight tooth and nail to minimise any allocations for affordable housing on major developments,

<a name="41115-25_para7">
<a name="stpa_239">As populations grow, there is increasing need for community centres, libraries, youth clubs and other facilities, but the Tories&#039; regeneration plans have lost coherence.

<a name="stpa_242">The plans for the gateway could realise up to 30 per cent. of London&#039;s required new homes, including provision for affordable housing, which is very important to my constituents, and the creation of job opportunities. That will help London to accommodate the predicted increase in population of 700,000 people over the next 10 years, without encroaching on greenfield sites or the green belt. The Thames Gateway London Partnership has highlighted the insufficiency of rail networks and interchanges connecting key town centres and development sites. As with other areas of London, Crossrail will provide rapid, frequent and convenient access for business and leisure travellers from the Thames gateway areas to the City, central London and Heathrow.

It will also play an essential role in securing London&#039;s future as a financial and international business centre vital to the UK economy and with benefits for the whole country. For residents in my constituency, it will mean a practical alternative to being crammed into overcrowded carriages on the Central line, which operates at capacity no longer just during rush hour but throughout the day and evening.

It boasts the wonderful and historic Hadleigh castle, St. James&#039;s church in Hadleigh, St. Peter&#039;s church in Thundersley and Benfleet church, which was built on the site of the battle of Benfleet, in which we defeated the Vikings about 1,110 years ago.

<br>&nbsp;<br>excellent man, as is the Minister of State, Department for Transport, who has taken over. I am sure that he will pick up some of these points when he sums up. However, the Ministers have a very tough job in selling the gateway to my constituents. Local people and the local press do not simply accept without question the soft soap and the hard sell on the number of houses, which is the nub of the matter for us.

<a name="stpa_248">We need some additional housing, but the question is where it should go. Should it be on the green belt? My constituents feel that it should not. How many houses should we have? My constituents feel that 4,000 additional houses, which the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister is trying to foist on us, represent a totally unsustainable level, which could not possibly be built without consuming parts of the green belt in my constituency.

They know best. My constituents are completely bewildered&#151;that seems to be the word of the night&#151;that the decisions are taken away from them and given to what I suppose is a quango. Certainly, my constituents do not know who the people in Go East and the regional planning authority are, and they cannot vote them out if they disagree with their decisions. Such people simply seem to be placemen&#151;yes men&#151;intended to deliver whatever number the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister comes up with and seeks to force on us.

There is no inevitability about it at all. There is regeneration in the north of England, and some communities there want more housing. Our communities do not. We should trust those local communities.

<a name="stpa_256">On housing, the gateway is a Trojan horse. It brings a massive increase in building but offers no improvement in infrastructure. Canvey Island really needs new access, but there will be none. The East of England Development Agency will be spending a few million pounds on developing new industrial sites in a new industrial park on Canvey Island, yet there are empty sites all over the island. If only that money were spent on a road, we would not have to spend any more money on developing industrial sites on Canvey Island. The private sector would take over and do it for us; the development would be organic, driven by people. What we need on Canvey Island is an additional access road&#151;nothing less. We need no further development at all until we have that infrastructure.

It goes through a densely built-up area, so there is no solution for the already wholly unacceptable congestion, yet only two weeks ago a proposal was made to build 310 more houses in that green belt. My constituents are full up with housing and fed up with congestion. In fact, one of them, Eric Fenwick, rang me this morning to say, &quot;Dr. Spink, when you&#039;re writing your election address, use the slogan, &#039;Full up and fed up&#039; because that describes how the residents of Castle Point feel.&quot;

Our kids have nothing to do, so they hang about on the streets, sometimes&#151;not always&#151;making a nuisance of themselves, although I stress that Castle Point kids are basically fantastic and deserve more facilities from us. We should not be dragging in more kids, without such facilities. I hope the Government are taking note and that the Minister will receive a note from his officials about the 4,000 houses in Castle Point and give us the very good news that he has decided to reduce that number. Does he accept that a major new development of hundreds of houses feeding on to already congested roads is nonsense, and will he pull that development, because of the highways issues, pending improvements to the infrastructure?

<a name="stpa_267">There has been criticism of the bodies involved. Large parts of the Thames gateway strategy are not included in urban development corporations&#151;I am fortunate in that one is dedicated to Thurrock. The Thames gateway is not in one English region, which is a mistake. Thurrock is in the eastern region, but we have no relationship with a region that is largely run from Cambridge and goes right up to Norfolk and Norwich. The maps of the English regions are wholly artificial. I remember that, when the London Government Act 1963 was passed, the boundaries of Greater London were fixed at 2 o&#039;clock in the morning during a debate in Committee in the House of Lords, almost by accident, depending on who could be present at the time.
</p>

<a name="41115-27_para3">
<a name="stpa_268">Things have moved on. I would liken the shape of the Thames gateway to an Osram light bulb laying on its side: it includes not only Greater London, as we know it, but goes down both sides of the Thames. That is the reality of the London region. People commute into London; Londoners have moved eastwards; and the region includes London&#039;s river and London&#039;s motorway, albeit largely outside the Greater London authority&#039;s area. Those issues need to be addressed if we are to manage the area&#151;London, the Thames and its gateway&#151;in the long term, and in my view it should come under just one English region, which would have some coherence.

Friend the Member for Bexleyheath and Crayford (Mr. Beard) and I agree that the responsibility for developing the docklands fell between a number of local authorities, all of which were well motivated, but there was no single body to drive through any plan. Only when such a single body was created did we see what we now know as the docklands. Of course, there might be some warts and deficiencies, but, overall, the docklands are a massive success commercially, environmentally and in terms of regeneration.

 We must be sensitive about that. The local authority discharges a multiplicity of functions very well, but the essence of the urban development corporation is that it is focused on creating a new environment, attracting funds and marshalling funds and land&#151;it has one purpose&#151;but all that fails to happen when such things are vested with a local authority.

That is not a matter for me&#151;I took the point that he made earlier&#151;and I am fairly comfortable with the new arrangements. In any event, I also recognise that the urban development corporation can badger other departments in a way that local authorities cannot. For example, I regret to say that Thurrock has some of the lowest general practitioner provision in England, not just in the region. I told Health Ministers in the Chamber a few weeks ago&#151;I do so again to my hon. Friend on the Front Bench now&#151;that they and the urban development corporation must get those other agencies to ensure not only the necessary GP provision to meet people&#039;s existing demands, but the necessary growth as the urban development corporation is extended and developed.

Moreover, we have a large number of single practitioners, which is not the most efficient way to deliver health care. So there is much work to be done, and I hope that the Minister with responsibility for London will join me in taking an initiative to bring together the Department of Health, the primary care trust and other agencies to discover whether we can address those deficiencies, perhaps by channelling some funds to put us on the starting grid by creating GP provision that is appropriate to our area.

In passing, may I therefore express my regret and frustration that, when there is a major hiatus on the M25, a statement is never made in the House of Commons? However, when there is a comparable hiatus on the rail network, a statement is made.

A similar incident occurred near junction 30 a few months ago, and given the cost, losses and frustration caused to commerce and people travelling on the M25, we should consider big hold-ups and closures on the M25 much more seriously than we do at present. That raises the question of whether we should have a dedicated traffic police for the M25 rather than relying on the different constabularies of Kent, Essex and the Met, who do not communicate adequately with each other about the quadrants for which they have responsibility.

I resent that on behalf of my constituents in Thurrock and south Essex and of people in north Kent. The charges collected are not returned to our areas. The motorists who use the bridge to go from south Essex to work in Kent and vice versa have an additional &#163;10 a week tax on them to pay for the wider highways network.

I am not suggesting that the crossing should be sited there but, tantalisingly, he might consider the possibility that an additional road to Canvey Island should be incorporated in a highway across the Thames that gave access to the ports in Kent.

However, this issue is extraterritorial to my constituency; we are not in Greater London and I am not advocating that we necessarily should be in the GLA area. However, I am saying that the boundary of Greater London makes no sense. We should be included in the considerations for the extension of the docklands light railway.

Friend the Member for Basildon (Angela Smith), who shares my frustration at the number of crossings in our area. They cut off communities and create problems for emergency vehicles. That issue needs to be addressed urgently because if the decision goes in favour of the development of the port at Shell Haven, even greater burdens will be imposed on the limited resources of the c2c rail line.

 My constituents certainly need new homes before there is next a Conservative Government.

I sometimes ask them whether they bought their council houses, and many did&#151;good luck to them, because if I had been a council tenant, I am sure that I would have bought my house too. Such people, however, must realise that we need a way of supplying additional housing units, especially those that may be rented or bought at low cost. Such houses do not fall like manna from heaven each night to appear on the grass each morning. We need to use our energies to find out how we can build houses at low cost to meet such demand, yet still protect and enhance our environment.

It is therefore appropriate to evaluate what progress has been made in the year and three quarters since then. The project is a huge opportunity, but it poses a huge danger as well if the Government do not think it through properly, because our great capital city could end up functioning less well 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>15 Nov 2004 : Column 1111</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>than it does now. I want London to prosper as one of the world&#039;s great capitals. The Thames gateway project gives us an opportunity to achieve that, but it also poses considerable dangers.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41115-28_para8">
<a name="stpa_291">The point was made that London will grow by more than 700,000 people in the next 10 years. The gateway project will last for 13 years. One can assume that in the time in which it is to take place, London will have grown by almost 1 million people. The project envisages the building of 120,000 houses. That presages the possibility of at least 250,000 newly housed people. However, Transport for London has estimated that only 35,000 to 55,000 jobs will be created. This is the most important thing that Ministers should listen to&#151;<i>[Interruption.]</i> I wish the Minister would listen instead of talking to his colleague, because this is an important point.

<a name="stpa_292">If 250,000 people live in the new houses in the Thames gateway and there are jobs for only 55,000 of them, and as every piece of literature and study that I have seen on the project is predicated on the basis that the Thames gateway will have transport links within 45 minutes of central London, it is inevitable that a large number of those newly housed people will have to commute back into jobs in central London. Commuting into and from central London every morning and evening is pretty much hell for thousands, if not millions, of people. If we are not going to put in the transport infrastructure at least at the same time as, but preferably ahead of, some of the new houses, we will be in great trouble.

We also know from the Minister that the Deputy Prime Minister is setting up a new quango. I regret that I was not in the Chamber to hear about that and apologise for being late, but I was at another meeting. If we are not careful, the project will have too many chiefs and not enough doers.

<a name="stpa_294">We need to take a strategic approach to see where new jobs will be created in the next 13 to 20 years. Which industries will be successful in that time? The Government have not done that strategic thinking properly, and they need to do it. We need to see what new industries we could create in the east of London and what new jobs would follow from that. It will be a quagmire if we create all those new houses and there are no jobs in that area. It is environmentally unsustainable&#151;the great buzz words of our time&#151;and we need people to have jobs near their houses.

It is no good building all those houses if we do not consider how we will provide public services in the area. With a general election looming, the Government must clarify the development criteria that they expect in the next five to 10 years. Will they follow Kate Barker&#039;s proposal for a development land tax? How will section 106 and the social housing requirement work?

<b>15 Nov 2004 : Column 1113</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>to consider carefully where all those houses will go. I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Castle Point that the Minister was incredibly sensitive about flooding. We must all be completely open about the problem of the flood plain and where we should build houses, because it would be monstrous to build houses that have any chance of being flooded whatsoever. Recently, there was a controversial planning application in Fairford in my constituency. It was nonsense&#151;the local council turned down the application because the houses were likely to flood, but the Minister&#039;s inspector came along and said, &quot;No, you can build the houses there, as they are not likely to flood and we have a proper flood attenuation scheme in place.&quot; The Minister said tonight that there is only a one in a thousand chance of houses flooding in the Thames barrier area, but we all know that climate change is making matters much more unpredictable. We all know that in large areas of housing, with large areas of tarmac and concrete where rainwater can run off quickly, the risk of flooding is much greater. We will want to study the Environment Agency flood maps with great care and in great detail to see where the houses are to be built. The Government are working hard with the insurance industry. I am glad to hear that, because the insurance industry will not want to insure houses that have any chance of flooding. Perhaps that will be our safeguard.

<p>
<a name="41115-29_para4">
<a name="stpa_300">I should like to speak about design and density. Density may not be the universal theme of the gateway. There may be different densities in different parts. I have seen the detailed gateway plan and the Olympic bid plan. What is envisaged in those plans is first class. I hope the Government are successful in their Olympic bid. There is no stronger champion of it than I. The plan is excellent. It regenerates the lower Lea area, it will provide 3,000 social houses that will be left in the Olympic village after the games, and the plan will provide new green areas and water features. I went down to the Thames gateway offices in East London university to see the model for the gateway plan, and that plan is excellent too.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41115-29_para5">
<a name="stpa_301">We must, however, concentrate carefully on design and density. There is nothing wrong with dense housing per se. After all, look at Kensington, where there are some 80 houses to the hectare. Nobody would say that Kensington was excessively dense, but in other areas&#151;for example, in my rural areas&#151;80 houses to the hectare would be far too many. There needs to be a harmonious mixture of medium-rise dense housing and less dense housing.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41115-29_para6">
<a name="stpa_302">We are becoming more and more knowledgeable about the design of housing&#151;for example, how we insulate houses properly so that they are heat efficient, and how we make them last longer. It is a monstrosity that pre-cast reinforced concrete houses that were built in the 1960s are being pulled down. We should be designing houses with a longer life than 40 years. It is perfectly possible to do it, and to design decent houses so that people on any level of income can live in comfort and in warmth. That should be our aim in building new houses.

<p><a name="st_210"><a name="41115-30_spnew0"><b> Clive Efford  (Eltham) (Lab):</b> 
 Let me say at the outset how much I welcome the regeneration of the Thames gateway area and the opportunities that it offers to my constituents. Those of us who value debate in the House as an opportunity to put our points across will inevitably focus on areas of concern or areas in which we seek change, and I appeal to Ministers to take our remarks in that context rather than thinking that we are being negative about the prospects that the development offers our communities.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41115-30_para0">
<a name="stpa_321">For too long, the east of London has been the poor relation in terms of economic development and opportunity. In the latter part of the last century we had 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>15 Nov 2004 : Column 1117</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>enormous decline in the region, with the docks running down and a loss of industry. In the north of my borough, around Woolwich, 250,000 jobs disappeared in a generation from the Royal Arsenal&#151;an incredible number of jobs to lose in one area. People who do not know the area may not realise that around Woolwich there are some of the most deprived communities to be found anywhere in the country. The regeneration of the Thames gateway will bring enormous change to their lives and to the vitality of the economy in east London, and it is well overdue.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41115-30_para1">
<a name="stpa_322">On the day on which we have formally submitted our bid to host the Olympics, let me mention in passing the enormous opportunities that that brings to the area. I wish it every success.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41115-30_para2">
<a name="stpa_323">When the regeneration is completed, it is intended to create about 180,000 jobs, as well as about 120,000 homes. Much of the land to be regenerated is in public ownership, and that offers us an opportunity to achieve a great deal more social housing than is currently contemplated. Every week, my surgery is full of families who have three generations living in the same house. Young people, now with children of their own, have grown up in houses built by Labour Governments and Labour local authorities, and they look to Labour now to provide the opportunities for them and their families that their parents had before them.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41115-30_para3">
<a name="stpa_324">The process that we currently go through to develop social housing is invariably that we sell the local authority property to the private developer and then seek to negotiate back a proportion for social housing under section 106. I know from my discussions with housing associations that they would like to take on the management role for the development of some sites, so that they manage the whole project from beginning to end. They will sell some of the housing, so that we get mixed tenure: we are not talking about building huge council estates as we did in the past. We want to create balanced communities, achieving more from the value of the land to allow us to build more social housing.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41115-30_para4">
<a name="stpa_325">We need partnership with social landlords to maximise social housing. I am not advocating social housing exclusively for local people. That has been a disaster in the past and would not help the regeneration of the Thames gateway and bring in the diversity of people that we need to participate in the local economy and industry and to provide public services. We need much more affordable housing than I fear we will get if we are to accommodate existing residents who want to rent property that they can afford, and those who will make the gateway regeneration a success if they move into the area.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41115-30_para5">
<a name="stpa_326">Several Members have mentioned the obvious public services, such as health services and schools. Even the fire service was mentioned. A number of other public services do not spring to mind in the context of planning gain, however. I am thinking of supported housing units for people with learning disabilities, and further-education colleges. FE colleges need a great deal of capital. There will be an enormous demand for training in the area, and I think the negotiations should take that into account. My hon. Friend the Minister will probably say that all those issues have been taken on board, but I fear that they are lost in talk of health centres, schools and the like. They slipped off the shopping list when we are telling private developers what we want.

<p>
<a name="41115-30_para6">
<a name="stpa_327">Much has been said about transport, but I want to say more about it. There is a plan to bring the docklands light railway to Woolwich in the north of my borough. As I have told my hon. Friend the Minister on several occasions, a swathe of south-east London is not served by the underground. We rely heavily on trains, as buses are still not considered an option for long-distance travel to and from central London. Bringing the DLR to Woolwich will enhance a major hub in south-east London. It benefits from several bus services and from rail services, but&#151;in the medium term, at least&#151;it will have the DLR as well.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41115-30_para7">
<a name="stpa_328">According to the current plans to take Crossrail south of the river, it will bypass Woolwich. That will deprive people south of Greenwich and beyond of an essential link. The ability to use other forms of transport to reach a hub in the north of the borough could transform the way in which people reach their jobs each day, and could play a major part in relieving pressure on roads that are already much too congested. The lack of a Crossrail station will make it virtually impossible for large chunks of the population of south-east London to benefit from easy access to services.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41115-30_para8">
<a name="stpa_329">An enormous amount of money is being invested in the Thames gateway bridge. My hon. Friend the Minister will say that the problems cannot be solved simply by diverting funds from the bridge&#151;a road link&#151;to Crossrail, but it is important to emphasise the importance of public-transport links.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41115-30_para9">
<a name="stpa_330">For more than two decades Greenwich council undertook some surveys into poverty in south-east London, particularly in Greenwich. The results of the surveys highlighted that those who were socially excluded did not have access to a car. The argument that the regeneration of the Thames gateway and the opportunities for people who do not have a car are predicated on the development of a road does not stack up given the evidence that we have found in the past.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41115-30_para10">
<a name="stpa_331">The argument was turned on its head when the congestion charge was introduced. It was said that people who did not have access to a car could not be disfranchised by the congestion charge. It is not possible to have it both ways. Either these people are in need of public transport links or they are not. We are planning to put an enormous amount of investment into the road. We are talking of the largest bridge to span the Thames in the London area. It will have two lanes for traffic and one lane for buses. Those of us who are more cynical than others could point to the fact that with bus lanes it is necessary only to change the colour of the tarmac to produce a three-lane motorway in each direction.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41115-30_para11">
<a name="stpa_332">We shall see an increase in the amount of traffic on already congested roads on the south side of the river. In my opinion, the community in this part of south-east London will be divided in the long term. The people concerned will experience what everyone else experiences when they live near a bridge. When the bridges in west London were closed for repair, people argued that they should remain closed. They and their communities cherished the relief that the closures brought to them as a result of reduced traffic congestion. That will result in people saying, &quot;We want relief from the traffic&quot;, and I believe that that will lead to them saying that they want a relief road. That will lead to the 

<br>&nbsp;<br>

<br>&nbsp;<br>resurrection of the east London river crossing route, which has been the subject of so much controversy in south-east London.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41115-30_para12">
<a name="stpa_333">The issue should be taken before a public inquiry. There is no evidence to support the economic contribution that it is claimed that the Thames gateway bridge will bring about through the creation of jobs. In his submission on the bridge, Professor Whitelegg said that there was little evidence about the types of jobs that would be created by the bridge. The assertion that it would create 48,000 jobs has now been omitted from the Mayor of London&#039;s transport strategy. The figures of Halcrow, the consultants, show little evidence of the role that the Thames gateway bridge will play in the creation of jobs. The economic case is thin.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41115-30_para13">
<a name="stpa_334">There are environmental issues that need to be addressed and that can only be done by means of a public inquiry. That is essential if the bridge project is to go ahead. In terms of transport infrastructure development, it is so important that we place an emphasis on public transport. That is what will bring about access to jobs and opportunities for local people.

<p><a name="st_211"><a name="41115-30_spnew1"><b> Mr. Nigel Beard  (Bexleyheath and Crayford) (Lab):</b> 
 The House has heard a great deal this evening with which I agree. The potential of the area for housing, for business and for the development of new jobs is there to be seen. The conditions in the area at present are not right to attract these new developments.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41115-30_para14">
<a name="stpa_335">There has been a sequence of four or five studies going back 25 years, all of which have shown that the economic and social development of east London is inhibited and limited by the division of the area by the Thames. That is illustrated by the very few opportunities that exist to cross the Thames along the 15 miles to the east of Tower bridge compared with the vast number of opportunities that there are to do so in the 15 miles to the west, with the huge difference in the economic opportunities that exist there.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41115-30_para15">
<a name="stpa_336">That, Mr. Deputy Speaker, is the true significance of the Thames gateway bridge. It will bridge the problem and it will mean that my constituents in Bexleyheath and Crayford, for example, will be able to look right through London for job opportunities, whereas their ambit is curtailed at present to 180o. The same applies to businesses coming into the area. Presently, businesses are trapped in an area that is badly served by road transport, albeit alleviated to an extent by the Thames road improvement in my area. Generally, it is a difficult area to get out of, which inhibits the ability to exploit the full market of the whole of Greater London. That is the true significance of the Thames bridge.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41115-30_para16">
<a name="stpa_337">It also has a local role for London and for east London, in particular. Public transport provision will help to alleviate some of the potential traffic. As my hon. Friend the Member for Eltham (Clive Efford) suggested, there is some local anxiety about the project being essentially the old east London river crossing in a new guise, but it is not really that at all. The old east London river crossing was meant as a strategic route right through London, taking traffic from the rest of Britain and bringing it down to the Channel ports. This bridge is already designed as a local means of crossing the river.


<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>15 Nov 2004 : Column 1120</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>

<p>
<a name="41115-30_para17">
<a name="stpa_338">Some anxiety remains in my constituency, particularly in the Brampton road area, about the possibility that the extra traffic generated will mean more traffic on the roads jeopardising the environment. I plead with Ministers to ensure that no penny pinching will take place in respect of minimising any environmental consequences of the bridge, which will play such a vital role for the development of east London. The minority who may suffer from increased traffic should not be caused to suffer when the benefits to the vast majority of the population are so large. We can afford generosity and sensitivity in dealing with their problems.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41115-30_para18">
<a name="stpa_339">The other major project that will open up the potential of the area is, as my hon. Friend the Member for Ilford, North (Linda Perham) mentioned several times, Crossrail. It is particularly important to my constituents that it goes along the present alignment into south-east London from Canary Wharf, through the royal group of docks, on to Abbey Wood and then to Ebbsfleet. That alignment will take it through some of the largest areas for potential development anywhere in London: on the south bank of the Thames in north Greenwich and north Bexley. It will provide a link from the presently fairly isolated area of south London to Heathrow on the one side and to Ebbsfleet and the channel tunnel rail link on the other. The result will not be enhanced employment alone; it will enhance the whole quality of employment available in that area of London and make a very major contribution to regeneration.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41115-30_para19">
<a name="stpa_340">I believe that there is some anxiety in the City and Canary Wharf, which now draws many employees from west London, that that will not continue to happen, as the growth of the financial services industry in the area continues. They will increasingly need to pull people in from east London generally, south-east and north-east London. That need will be catered for by Crossrail on the planned two alignments. As well as underpinning development in south-east London, Crossrail could also underpin the potential growth of the biggest financial services centre in the whole of the European Union. As it grows, it could become the dominant force in the EU.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41115-30_para20">
<a name="stpa_341">If we are to achieve the potential for housing and businesses, the Thames bridge project and Crossrail must have definite timetables with enough finance behind them to give the private investor confidence that things will happen. If we have that, the private investment can come either before or alongside those developments. If, however, as has happened too often in the past, these become &quot;this year, next year, some time, never&quot; projects, the private sector will not have the confidence to bring investment in soon enough for us to gain real advantage. My plea is that Ministers ensure to the maximum extent possible that we have timetables for both the Thames bridge and Crossrail that are believable and that mean that private and public development go hand in hand.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41115-30_para21">
<a name="stpa_342">Finally, the provision for Crossrail will come before the House in a Bill to prepare the ground. Can we ensure that the branch to Ebbsfleet from Canary Wharf is included in that as an integral part of the Crossrail project?

<p><a name="st_212"><a name="41115-31_spnew0"><b> Jon Cruddas  (Dagenham) (Lab):</b> 
 There has been a lot of cross-party agreement tonight, so I hope that I will not add a note of disagreement at the end of the debate. I want to raise a few issues about local buy-in to the whole regeneration process across the Thames gateway, and I hope that that will be taken in the spirit intended. Before that, I should say that I welcome the debate, which has allowed us to take stock of where the Thames gateway discussions have got to. It has been a good debate.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41115-31_para0">
<a name="stpa_343">My points relate specifically to my constituency and the sheer rate of change in the debate over the past few years. I entered into this discussion before I was elected to Parliament, when I worked in Downing street, because of economic transformations in the UK car industry. After BMW pulled the plug out of Rover in the west midlands, the next one on the runway would have been the Ford Dagenham plant. We got involved to manage the process of economic transformation and change, and that quickly got me involved in a series of economic and social relationships above and beyond the Ford Dagenham estate, to do with the work of the Thames Gateway London partnership and what was happening in terms of the single regeneration budget project at the heart of the Thames gateway.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41115-31_para1">
<a name="stpa_344">What we decided during those difficult transformations in 1999&#150;2000 is beginning to come on stream now. For example, in collaboration with the Mayor&#039;s office, the London Development Agency and the Department of Trade and Industry, we agreed to set up the Centre for Engineering and Manufacturing Excellence, which was opened last year by the Prime Minister on the Ford estate in my constituency. That is altering the life chances of local people in enabling them to take qualifications up to the most advanced postgraduate level in engineering and manufacturing, and that is much to be welcomed.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41115-31_para2">
<a name="stpa_345">At the same time, we agreed a package to build a new Ford engine plant on the Dagenham estate, which the Prime Minister also opened last year. We are in discussions to increase capacity at the plant over the coming period to ensure that we have an enduring legacy of diesel technology and engine manufacture in Dagenham.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41115-31_para3">
<a name="stpa_346">What was the SRB project around the heart of the Thames gateway has been transferred or consolidated into the London Riverside regeneration company. I should declare an interest as an LDA nominee on the board of that company and as an LDA nominee as a director on the CEME project.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41115-31_para4">
<a name="stpa_347">All that is to be welcomed, and those are secure building blocks, which were developed during 1999&#150;2000. Since then, there has been a massive intensification of the debate and policy developments around it. We have to ask why that has occurred. Obviously, we have had the Mayor of London&#039;s spatial economic development plan as well as strategies by which he can manage economic change and population movements in London by pushing the centre of gravity of policy making eastwards. That has come alongside the strategies of local boroughs, which have been in development for a number of years, to try to confront local issues of poverty and deprivation. At the same time, we have had the Government&#039;s national prioritisation of the Thames gateway, arising partly 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>15 Nov 2004 : Column 1122</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>because the housing crisis in the south-east acts as a brake on broader patterns of economic change across other regions of the British economy. We have to put the brakes on interest rates because of that, meaning that growth is constrained elsewhere in the economy, irrespective of economic context in different regions. Secondly, as we saw in the review of our prospective entry into the euro, the housing market in the south-east constrains entry because of the possible effect that a reduced pan-European interest level would have in reigniting growth in the south-east. That would in turn have an effect on other regions in the UK.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41115-31_para5">
<a name="stpa_348">Therefore, we have come a long way since I first got involved in 1999&#150;2000 and the Government should be commended for the rigour with which they have approached the issue, the thinking behind some of the policy prescriptions and for turning it into a national priority, with its own Cabinet sub-committee. However, the various objectives of different levels of government with regard to the Thames gateway throw up different priorities and create tensions in the debate. The first concern is the structures and institutions involved. The number of institutions working in parallel on aspects of regeneration has already been pointed out&#151;for example, the LDA, the boroughs, local regeneration partnerships, English Partnerships and the new London Thames Gateway Development Corporation. That all shows the commitment to regeneration, but we need a clear delineation of responsibilities, otherwise, we could create confusion, hesitation and fragmentation.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41115-31_para6">
<a name="stpa_349">We should not concentrate all developments and priorities within certain sectors of the Thames gateway. That concern is felt in the London riverside area, in terms of the Olympic bid and the possible reprioritisation of projects towards the eastern area, at the expense of developments to the west within the urban development corporation boundaries. Transport infrastructure is also critical. I flag up the issue of the Thames gateway bridge, but I welcome the commitments that the Government have made, which my hon. Friend the Member for Bexleyheath and Crayford (Mr. Beard) mentioned.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41115-31_para7">
<a name="stpa_350">All these aspects of the issue are welcome, but there is a brittleness about some of the decision making. My real concern is local community buy-in to the overall gateway strategy. As I said earlier, Dagenham sits at the geographical centre of the Thames gateway. It covers much of the London riverside part of the gateway and has a massive amount of brownfield land. Across the London riverside area, excluding Barking town centre, we anticipate some 20,000 new homes over the next 10 to 15 years. It is also one of the smallest boroughs in London and has a great strategic location.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41115-31_para8">
<a name="stpa_351">Notwithstanding the future developments, change is already occurring at an astonishing rate. It is estimated that the population has increased by some 20,000 since 2001. That is partly because we have the lowest-cost housing market in Greater London. As house prices have risen, aspiring members of the property-owning democracy have gravitated towards the area, so that we have increased demand for housing in the borough. At the same time, the effect of the right-to-buy policy has meant a greater supply of private housing stock than previously. People are also ahead of the curve in terms of the Government&#039;s strategy for east London and are 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>15 Nov 2004 : Column 1123</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>gravitating towards the Thames gateway because they foresee the future economic developments in the area.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41115-31_para9">
<a name="stpa_352">Cumulatively, those elements are transforming the local community day by day. However, that is occurring even before we trigger the changes anticipated under the gateway proposals. That transformation is colliding with the long-term legacy of poverty, deprivation and underinvestment in public services in the locality. That is the crux of the issue of regeneration in Dagenham. A fundamental tension exists between our historic economic and social legacy, current changes that are transforming our community and the radical changes that are envisaged in the future. On top of all that, we have the toxic politics of race, operating within the context of limited resources, great need and rapid change, both now and in the future.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41115-31_para10">
<a name="stpa_353">Consider, for example, some of the basic characteristics of the community. It is the lowest-wage economy in Greater London. Adult numeracy is the lowest in the country and adult literacy the fourth lowest, and the number of people with higher education qualifications is the lowest in the country. Heart and lung disease, infant mortality and life expectancy are among the worst in the capital.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41115-31_para11">
<a name="stpa_354">Yes, we are seeing incremental change: some of the schools are the fastest improving not only in the capital but in the country, and new integrated health centres are being built across the borough. The new hospital at Oldchurch will, I hope, open in the next 18 months. That is all incrementally positive change&#151;but it operates in the context of population expansion that places even greater tension and pressure on local public services.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41115-31_para12">
<a name="stpa_355">Take, for example, health funding. We have an acknowledged serious under-capitation. Despite a recent generous settlement, we will be 10.7 per cent. under capitation in three years&#039; time&#151;one of only four primary care trusts nationally to be in that situation. That amounts to a year-on-year shortfall of &#163;24 million a year in PCT funding, with no defined commitment to sorting it out.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41115-31_para13">
<a name="stpa_356">That is before we even begin to consider the additional pressures arising from our own current population growth, let alone future population growth. Even on the basis of out-of-date population statistics, the discretionary Thames gateway funding for health is small beer in the context of that structural health funding problem. For example, this year we received some &#163;700,000 to deal with the population changes, which is not a lot, given the &#163;24 million annual shortfall.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41115-31_para14">
<a name="stpa_357">My point is simple: we do not have enough resources to deal with our historic problems, let alone current and future changes. How does that manifest itself? Change is always difficult for people, and it is more difficult when resources are severely limited. For people to feel comfortable, they have to have confidence in change, and feel that it will benefit them and their families. At the moment there are not enough secure footings on the ground in terms of public service delivery for people to feel confident in the broader patterns of economic transformation.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41115-31_para15">
<a name="stpa_358">Housing is another example. There are about 6,000 people on our waiting list in the borough. Historically, here more than almost anywhere else in the country, the 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>15 Nov 2004 : Column 1124</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>local community has relied on the principle of council housing to deliver socialised housing provision. Yet last year, because of changes in the make-up of local authority social housing grant, the authority lost about &#163;12 million on a couple of key sites, and had to establish its own partnerships with a developer so that it could maintain control of nominations to the social housing dwellings.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41115-31_para16">
<a name="stpa_359">That has engendered real concerns about the ability to provide local homes for local people in the context of both current changes in the community and future housing developments with limited nominations for local people. Again, the lack of a base camp of confidence to deal with current problems undermines the confidence in future changes. The local population therefore feel threatened and concerned, and that rich brew of legacy versus current changes within the community, let alone future changes, manifests itself today in far-right activity. Two months ago, the British National party secured its first council seat for 11 years in the capital, in the constituency next to mine, and in the same borough. That development did not fall out of the sky; it is a manifestation of the tensions over resources in the context of changing communities and long-term historic need.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41115-31_para17">
<a name="stpa_360">I have raised those points to illustrate some of the possible tensions surrounding future regeneration in the Thames gateway. In our community, the stakes are high. The jury is out on local buy-in to the whole gateway agenda. We must do more to build confidence in the community, and that must be translated into resources. Regeneration must be built on fairness that takes local people with the process of change. If it is not, the phrase &quot;sustainable communities&quot; will seem as a complete and utter misnomer.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41115-31_para18">
<a name="stpa_361">I am confident about the agenda for change, but I do not underestimate some of the difficulties attached to it. For my community, the whole question of the Thames gateway can go in one of two ways. It could continue the previously repeated process by which people feel threatened and hostile because something is being done to them rather than with them, with the corresponding angry resentment that can be articulated in extreme forms. Alternatively, it could be a rewarding and liberating process of material, economic and social change that takes people with it and genuinely builds new sustainable communities. I am extremely confident that the Thames gateway agenda will take the latter route rather than the former, but I do not underestimate the difficulties attached to the process of change.

<p>
<a name="41115-32_para1">
<a name="stpa_363">The Thames gateway, though, is different, qualitatively and quantitatively, from the rest of the sustainable communities plan. It is different because the development is largely on brownfield land and thus implicitly regenerative; different, too, because of its location. Our fundamental doubts about the Government&#039;s strategy and our doubts about the sustainability of their communities plan are not all reflected in our views about the Thames gateway project.

<p>
<a name="41115-32_para2">
<a name="stpa_364">I remind the House that we are not alone in doubting the suitability and viability of the Government&#039;s programme for housing development. My hon. Friend the Member for Castle Point (Bob Spink) highlighted the severe concerns of his constituents about housing numbers, but it is not only them&#151;important though they are. The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister Select Committee described the impact of the Government&#039;s housing programme on the environment as potentially &quot;unsustainable&quot;. The Committee said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_17">&quot;The impact of developing so many homes in the South East, one of the most densely populated regions in Europe, has not been fully assessed&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The additional homes could place excessive demands on the environment, leading to the loss of green-field sites and excessive pressure on the water supply and other natural resources&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The Government&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. has yet to estimate the costs of providing the transport links, health care, education and all the other facilities which new neighbourhoods require.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="41115-32_para3">
<a name="stpa_365">The Committee has delivered its verdict on the Government; it is not a happy one for the Minister who will reply to the debate.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41115-32_para4">
<a name="stpa_366">In a series of speeches, we have heard real questions about several aspects of the development. We have heard questions about environmental issues, infrastructure issues and project management. I shall deal with them in turn, beginning with the environmental concerns.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41115-32_para5">
<a name="stpa_367">There are issues about water resources that have yet to be properly answered. We know that water resources in the south of England&#151;in the capital, in Kent and Essex&#151;are already under pressure and the Minister must give us firm answers to the relevant questions. There are issues about developments on the flood plain. I take the view of the Minister for Housing and Planning that flood risk needs to be assessed in terms of flood record. As I represent the fens in Lincolnshire, I understand that one cannot say that simply because an area is at risk, irrespective of its record of flooding and its existing defences, one should not build there. If that were the case, my constituency would not exist and that would be a monstrous thing, as the whole House will agree. The Minister is right: record and risk need to be balanced but, nevertheless, the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton (Mr. Davey) put some important questions about that matter and we need more than the dismissive answer he was given.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41115-32_para6">
<a name="stpa_368">There are also issues about the effect of the development on air quality. I should like to hear answers on that subject in the Minister&#039;s summing up, as well as on the issues raised by the hon. Member for Thurrock (Andrew Mackinlay) about biodiversity, wildlife and 

<br>&nbsp;<br>

<br>&nbsp;<br>green spaces. My hon. Friend the Member for Castle Point also talked about the impact of the development on the quality of life. Those issues, too, deserve an answer and I know that the Minister is well equipped to deal with them all in considerable detail in the time available.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41115-32_para7">
<a name="stpa_369">Perhaps even more fundamental than those environmental concerns are the concerns about infrastructure that have been debated at some length during our deliberations. The hon. Member for Ilford, North (Linda Perham), in a telling phrase, said that the lack of infrastructural investment inhibits opportunity. She said that was especially damaging to the interests of her poorer constituents. She is right.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41115-32_para8">
<a name="stpa_370">The hon. Member for Dartford (Dr. Stoate) said&#151; I use his words&#151;that pressing on without dealing with the infrastructural challenges would be the greatest mistake. Other hon. Members have questioned the issues associated with a balance between jobs and transport. I particularly highlight the contribution made by my hon. Friend the Member for Cotswold (Mr. Clifton-Brown), who always speaks with great authority on these matters. He gave us the figures, and they were stark: 240,000 extra people and 55,000 extra jobs; that involves a large number of people travelling, and they need high quality transport infrastructure to do so efficiently, at their comfort and with appropriate ease. Yet there are still enormous gaps in the information that the Government have made available to us.
</p>








<p><a name="st_214"><a name="41115-32_spnew1"><b> Mr. Clifton-Brown: </b> 
 My hon. Friend has touched on the most important thing in the debate: it is not just a question of all those people travelling, but where they travel to. The Government have not identified what are the industries and businesses of the future&#151;the next 10 to 20 years&#151;to which those people will travel, but we hope that we can create those businesses on their doorsteps and make them environmentally sustainable.
</p>








<p><a name="st_215"><a name="41115-32_spnew2"><b> Mr. Hayes: </b> 
 We hope that we can do so, but until the Government come up with persuasive answers to the important questions that have been asked by hon. Members on both sides of the House tonight, we cannot be certain. It would not be appropriate to proceed, as the hon. Member for Dartford said, unless we are reasonably certain about these fundamental matters.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41115-32_para9">
<a name="stpa_371">The Government have been repeatedly asked to articulate how the infrastructure provision for the communities plan projects, particularly the Thames gateway, will be funded. The ODPM has stated that the finances for the Thames gateway development corporation have not been fully determined and that part of the funding will come from the &#163;446 million allocated for regeneration from the last Government spending review. Not only is that explanation inadequate, but so is the funding.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41115-32_para10">
<a name="stpa_372">The Library pack prepared for the debate includes extracts from the Thames gateway regional spending plan, but I do not know whether any hon. Member noticed that there are no figures in that spending plan. The conclusion says:

<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_18">&quot;The Thames gateway London partnership will be in a position to comment more fully on its proposed framework for area-based schemes once Transport for London issues further clarification on the timing and content of revised Guidance.&quot;</p>

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>15 Nov 2004 : Column 1127</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>

<p>
<a name="41115-32_para11">
<a name="stpa_373">The project faces massive funding problems, and there are massive doubts about the effectiveness of the infrastructure. We have heard from a variety of Members about the need for Crossrail, but the Government have yet to provide clear answers on that either.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41115-32_para12">
<a name="stpa_374">There are conflicting views about the bridge. I heard what the hon. Member for Bexleyheath and Crayford (Mr. Beard) said about the paucity of provision on the east side of London. I was born in south-east London, at Woolwich, as generations of my family have been, so I can speak with some authority about the Thames, and I was pleased to grow up in Eltham. I was delighted that the hon. Member for Eltham (Clive Efford) contributed to the debate. He is right to say that such things are difficult and create limited opportunities for people travelling to work and leisure and for all kinds of other purposes, but I have doubts about the bridge because independent analysis, which he mentioned, has questioned whether the project is appropriate and whether it will deliver what it was once said that it might. Again, that requires Government clarification and comment. We cannot be left in the dark any longer about those matters.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41115-32_para13">
<a name="stpa_375">The issue of project management has been raised. It is often said that too many cooks spoil the broth, and plenty of cooks are involved in this project, are they not? The number of organisations, the lack of accountability and the range of conflicting agendas have been mentioned by many hon. Members.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41115-32_para14">
<a name="stpa_376">People are not mere units and homes are not just buildings. This project must be about building real communities, not soulless sprawling estates of houses that have little to offer beyond ubiquity. We must look beyond utility to grace and beauty; each home should be in keeping with its neighbour, and each settlement should be in tune with the prevailing landscape&#151;ergonomically, ecologically and environmentally sustainable. Real communities are mixed communities: jobs and leisure, shops and open spaces, churches, schools, clubs and pubs&#151;all the little platoons with their individual intricacies, courtesies and civilities that together make up civilised life.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41115-32_para15">
<a name="stpa_377">A number of key questions remain. Will the Minister in summing up clarify the infrastructural shortfalls? Will he consider ways to address them by using public funds to trigger private investment? It has been estimated that we need 55 primary schools, 10 secondary schools, nine leisure centres and six playing fields, as has been mentioned by my hon. Friend the Member for Cotswold and by inference by the hon. Members for Chatham and Aylesford (Jonathan Shaw) and for Thurrock. Will the Minister also deal with the fundamental issue of transport?
</p>

<p>
<a name="41115-32_para16">
<a name="stpa_378">Will the Minister commit to determining the extent of this development by using environmental, ecological and infrastructural criteria? That means air, water, biodiversity, flooding, but also &quot;liveability&quot; to use a term that the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs has used. Will it be a good place to live?
</p>

<p>
<a name="41115-32_para17">
<a name="stpa_379">Will the Minister look again at the shortfall in the skills necessary to deliver the project that was identified by the chairman of the Commission for Architecture 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>15 Nov 2004 : Column 1128</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>and the Built Environment? He said that the project could not be sustained on the basis of inadequate skills and pointed out:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_19">&quot;There are simply not enough people with the right skills to do the job. This is the biggest single barrier to the achievement of the Communities Plan.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="41115-32_para18">
<a name="stpa_380">Will the Minister rethink what sustainability really means? That means reviewing RPG9A and redesignating sufficient land that is currently earmarked for employment for residential purposes. It means understanding that living communities are mixed and diverse communities. They make demands on active citizens and pay them back in the currency of the joy of shared identity and pride.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41115-32_para19">
<a name="stpa_381">Will the Minister raise the bar in respect of design? All that we build should add to what is there. Appropriate standards in design, density, access to amenities, layout and green spaces will engender a sense of place, distinctiveness and deliver an aesthetic feel-good factor.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41115-32_para20">
<a name="stpa_382">We plant trees for those born later, and we build houses for them too. This is an opportunity to be grasped or an enormous mistake to be made.

In my year as a Minister responsible for housing regeneration in the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister and subsequently as a Transport Minister, I have taken the firm view that we have a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to get this right. It is a massive undertaking and one of the problems in the debate is that we have confused two to three-year horizons with 15, 20 or 30-year horizons. If the task is undertaken properly, it will take a generation and more to see it through to completion.

I shall come to the serious concerns about flooding later, but I am grateful to the House that the debate has not taken place in the stunted playground context in which serious debates about planning regeneration often take place.

Members said about health, education and other forms of social infrastructure being equally as important as transport, which is my specific responsibility. I also accept that biodiversity, the green dimension, liveability and quality of life are equally important. The charge that such issues are being ignored is not well made.

<a name="stpa_388">It is not appropriate to cite Eastern Quarry as a problem. I have said publicly while sitting next to a leading representative of the company that it is inappropriate for a land security developer to spend more than a year faffing with its traffic assumptions without sharing them with other public bodies that have the right to know how a specific development would fit with the rest of the transport infrastructure. We are not making mistakes in that regard. The situation is still one of drip-feeding, so we need to go beyond that.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41115-33_para6">
<a name="stpa_389">I tell the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton (Mr. Davey) and others who raised the matter that I am sad in that I still read &quot;Regeneration and Renewal&quot; and avidly wait for my copy each week. I thought that the specific article about myriad organisations was simplistic to the point of being fatuous and that it let down the publication. We are trying slowly in some cases, although faster in others, to get all assorted organisations and public bodies&#151;elected and otherwise&#151;in each and every area together so that we can start to sing with a united voice. That is difficult, but standing on the outside and talking at length about the complexity and difficulty of the task of bringing many bodies together is fatuous and adds nothing to the debate.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41115-33_para7">
<a name="stpa_390">It is appropriate for the Highways Agency to deal with the major strategic roads in this country, but it is equally appropriate for it to sit down and talk to Dartford, Medway, and other delivery bodies. It is appropriate for Basildon to lead Basildon&#039;s renaissance and contribution to regeneration in the gateway, but it is also appropriate for Essex county council, English Partnerships, the train operators and others to have a voice. The trick is drawing all bodies together to focus on what is needed in a specific area and to determine how that fits with the wider strategic concerns of south Essex, north Kent or the whole gateway. It is easy to sit on the sidelines saying, &quot;Oh look, there&#039;s 14 organisations.&quot; The hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton read a good number of them out, but although that is a clever little fourth-form debating point, it adds nothing to the substance of the debate. If complexities and overlaying contributions still exist, they must be busted through. That is exactly what is happening in Thurrock and Basildon, and with Renaissance Southend and others. We have started from the premise that it is usually more appropriate, especially in south

<a name="stpa_391">The hon. Member for Croydon, South (Richard Ottaway), who is not in the Chamber, seemed to suggest that the easy answer was to apply a fully-blown London Docklands development corporation from Southend and the north Kent coast all the way back to the Isle of Dogs. He said that the LDDC was such a wonderful example of how to move forward on these issues that we should simply recreate it. As the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton suggested, the LDDC was a complete disaster in its early days. It did not recognise the concept of community buy-in to which my hon. Friend the Member for Dagenham (Jon Cruddas) referred or the notion that communities existed. We think that urban development corporations are appropriate for east London, despite some concerns that were raised, and for Thurrock, when they are contiguous with borough boundaries. Other delivery mechanisms are appropriate elsewhere, but there should not be a LDDC incarnate in any shape or form.

<p>
<a name="41115-33_para9">
<a name="stpa_392">The concerns expressed about flood plains and flooding are genuine. New planning policy guidance note 25 goes far further than anything in the past. At each and every step, there will be, as we said, a flood risk assessment of the plans submitted by every delivery body and of the plans and applications from the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister. There has been engagement with the Environment Agency from day one on the series of issues relating to flooding. The problem is not new, but, as my right hon. Friend the Minister suggested, the area is well protected in terms of flood alleviation and much better protected than most of the country. However, that does not mean that we are complacent because we have to keep on the case.

</p>

<p>
<a name="41115-34_para1">
<a name="stpa_400">Health funding in Barnsley has been a problem for several years, mainly because the area has one of the greatest needs for health services in the country, but it is among the lowest funded. Over the years, our area, which used to be part of the former Trent health authority, has been funded well below the 100 per cent. target. It is now said that we are funded below our fair share, which is a more descriptive and apt phrase. We have a high level of health need in Barnsley, but our funding simply does not reflect that.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41115-34_para2">
<a name="stpa_401">I shall go into further details later, but first I shall give some background and highlight a few issues affecting Barnsley&#039;s health services. To some extent, they are good news stories. First, Barnsley district general hospital is currently being considered for the award of foundation status, and we are optimistic that a positive decision will be made. I wish to place on record my congratulations to all the hospital staff, who worked hard to achieve the three-star ratings over two years that enabled the application to proceed. We await the decision with interest. Secondly, Barnsley has opened the first three facilities under the LIFT&#151;local improvement finance trust&#151;programme nationwide. It has provided three needy communities within the Barnsley area with excellent new health facilities, and we are proud that we were the first area to open such facilities. That 10 million investment is probably the biggest investment in primary and community health facilities that Barnsley has ever had. At this point I should flag up a caveat. The primary care trust signed contracts for a number of LIFT facilities before funding under the LIFT programme was restricted because of high demand. That could lead to contractual problems and funding concerns in the near future.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41115-34_para3">
<a name="stpa_402">Another success story is the e-booking system, or choose and book, as it is called in the Barnsley area. Barnsley is proud that a local general practitioner was the first to implement the service, under the pathfinder or early implementer pilot scheme. Despite an article on the subject that appeared in <i>The Sunday Times</i> yesterday, which reported that the programme had been frozen, I am reliably informed today that the programme is continuing in the Barnsley area and is working well. It provides patients with a choice of hospital date to see their consultant.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41115-34_para4">
<a name="stpa_403">Intermediate treatment centres are another innovation for which the local PCT is signed up, but we need to encourage more take-up by the local populace. We are contracted for a five-year period and unless people attend the centres, there will be financial consequences. It is worth noting that our waiting lists are comparatively low and we do not have problems of bed blocking in our area. We are fully behind the 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>15 Nov 2004 : Column 1134</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>Government&#039;s programmes and initiatives relating to health. We are delighted to have had those two firsts under the LIFT programme and the choose and book programme, but we have a continuing problem with regard to funding.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41115-34_para5">
<a name="stpa_404">To provide some background to the situation in Barnsley, I refer my hon. Friend the Minister to the 2002&#150;03 annual audit letter from the Audit Commission in respect of Barnsley PCT. Under the heading &quot;Key messages&quot; the Audit Commission commented:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_25">&quot;We have found that the Trust has made good progress since its inception in April 2002. There is evidence of progressive initiatives that indicate an energy and desire to develop appropriate and quality healthcare services for the residents of Barnsley in partnership with other local agencies.</p>
</ul>
<p>




</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_26">This is praiseworthy, particularly as the funding locally falls well below that indicated by the funding formula developed by the Department of Health. The shortfall not only restricts the PCT&#039;s ability to develop services required to meet the NHS Plan targets, but also constrains management capacity to implement further change initiatives.</p>
</ul>
<p>




</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_27">This creates a very difficult climate in which to develop services as quickly as the PCT might wish.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="41115-34_para6">
<a name="stpa_405">Later in the same audit letter, under the heading &quot;Financial standing&quot;, the Audit Commission made further comments in relation to Barnsley&#039;s funding situation:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_28">&quot;The Trust met its financial targets in 2002/2003. In the current year, significant pressures exist. Although the Trust is projecting a break-even position, this is only achievable by using non-recurrent measures to meet a recurrent revenue deficit estimated at &#163;5 million. This clearly is not sustainable. Ultimately, either services will have to be downgraded, or, under the present financial regime, financial balance may not be achieved.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="41115-34_para7">
<a name="stpa_406">I am speaking of 2002&#150;03&#151;I will come to the present situation in a moment&#151;to highlight the background to the continuing shortfall in our finances. The Audit Commission went on to deal with our financial standing in 2003&#150;04 and reported:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_29">&quot;While the Trust is forecasting a break-even position for 2003/2004, there is a significant recurrent revenue deficit. This is being met by non-recurrent means. Overall therefore the financial position is unbalanced and requires fundamental adjustment, preferably by a significant uplift in funding.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="41115-34_para8">
<a name="stpa_407">The Audit Commission continued:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_30">&quot;The Barnsley health community has, based on DoH target funding, been under-funded for several years. For example the difference between target funding and actual funding for 2003/2004 is a shortfall of &#163;13.6 million. As a consequence, there has always been a need to exercise stringent control to maintain financial balance. However, this is aggravated in an environment where the same targets apply nationally, and local performance is judged against those targets, without recognition of the reduced funding available to meet them.</p>
</ul>
<p>




</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_31">Financial pressures this year are markedly higher than in 2002/2003. Although the PCT is projecting a break even position for the year end, there is a significant recurrent deficit estimated to be some &#163;5m.</p>
</ul>
<p>




</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_32">The original plans were for this deficit to be met by means of:</p>
</ul>
<p>




</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_33">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#163;2m brokerage from South Yorkshire Strategic HA</p>
</ul>
<p>




</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_34">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#163;1m capital to revenue transfer</p>

<p>




</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_35">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#163;2m from future funding allocations that could be applied to the deficit.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>

<p>
<a name="41115-34_para9">
<a name="stpa_408">Even with those savings, the PCT was still required to find a further &#163;2 million of savings.


<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>15 Nov 2004 : Column 1135</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>

<p>
<a name="41115-34_para10">
<a name="stpa_409">The Audit Commission summed up the position:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_36">&quot;The general situation is unsatisfactory, and cannot be sustained indefinitely. Developments to meet NHS plan targets are at risk of failure because of inadequate funding. It is difficult to maintain incentives to find efficiency savings when all savings found must be used to meet the underlying deficit.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="41115-34_para11">
<a name="stpa_410">Having discussed 2002&#150;03, the letter examined 2003&#150;04, for which the story was exactly the same. The letter stated the position at the end of the financial year 2003&#150;04 and pointed out the problems for 2004&#150;05:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_37">&quot;The PCT achieved financial balance in 2003/04, although overspending on prescribing was funded from slippage on new developments&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The PCT has a good record for robust financial control but faces very significant challenges over the medium term.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="41115-34_para12">
<a name="stpa_411">This is the important passage:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_38">&quot;For 2004/05 the PCT recognised a deficit of some &#163;15.6m in the LDP process, which prompted a request for planned brokerage from the SHA of &#163;9.7m. This combined with a non-recurrent recovery plan to be developed by the PCT would achieve financial balance in 2004/05. The PCT has developed a recovery plan to release &#163;6.6m savings during 2004/05; however we understand that the SHA is not yet in a position to formally guarantee the delivery of the planned brokerage. As a consequence financial balance remains at risk.</p>
</ul>
<p>




</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_39">In subsequent years, the roll out of payment by results will start to impact on funding and payment issues.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="41115-34_para13">
<a name="stpa_412">For how long can Barnsley PCT be required to broker huge sums of money to meet those funding shortfalls? In the previous financial year, it provided &#163;2 million of brokerage, and it is required to broker &#163;9 million to achieve financial balance at the end of this financial year. Basically, it must make &#163;6 million of cuts in the current financial year to meet that break-even position. How long can it continue to borrow such sums while making cuts at the same time?
</p>

<p>
<a name="41115-34_para14">
<a name="stpa_413">In 2005&#150;06, Barnsley will receive &#163;15.5 million less than its fair share of resources, and the allocation of resources&#151;it is known as &quot;the pace of change&quot;&#151;means that we are unlikely to reach our 100 per cent. target before 2015. We are in danger of replacing what we used to call the postcode lottery on health care with a postcode funding lottery.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41115-34_para15">
<a name="stpa_414">What are the effects of the shortfall in funding? The 18-week target for &quot;see and treat&quot; will provide a major improvement to patient care. However, the shortfall will have an impact on acute capacity. For Barnsley, that capacity is likely to cost &#163;20 million from now until 2008. Barnsley PCT simply does not have the resources to deliver that 18-week target. I make a plea to the Minister. Future funding allocations must recognise that. We must either reduce the target in relation to our PCT or improve the resources available to it.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41115-34_para16">
<a name="stpa_415">I have already mentioned the LIFT programme. Improving primary care is a national and local priority. We need to improve access, and the range and quality of services. To do that in Barnsley, we need between eight and 10 primary care centres. I have mentioned that we have three already. Those are funded from the general medical services contract and from the NHS bank, but the funding is now over-committed and, as a consequence, is being rationed. Therefore further developments have to be funded from baseline allocation. Barnsley PCT simply cannot allocate any 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>15 Nov 2004 : Column 1136</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>more funds to the LIFT programme, so our development is likely to be curtailed, although we may achieve one more LIFT initiative.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41115-34_para17">
<a name="stpa_416">There is a fear that the local private-public partnership LIFT company, which was established to deliver that programme, could face insolvency very soon. Obviously, because of the unavailability of further GMS revenue funding, any further GP-led primary care developments are likely to be curtailed. So having been led to believe that we were to get up to 10 new premises, we will be lucky to achieve four. That is simply unfair.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41115-34_para18">
<a name="stpa_417">I have outlined clearly my concerns regarding the funding of Barnsley PCT. As I have mentioned, we have high levels of need, mortality and morbidity&#151;some of the highest in the country. To give two quick examples, a boy born today in the most disadvantaged part of Barnsley can expect to live 12 years less than a boy born today in an affluent part of England, and Barnsley&#039;s death rate is 15 per cent. higher than the England and Wales average. As I have pointed out, ours is one of the lowest funded health authorities in the area and it constantly struggles to balance the books. It is high time that struggle was ended and our financial situation once and for all improved.

<p><a name="st_224"><a name="41115-35_spmin0"><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Health  (Dr. Stephen Ladyman): </b> 
 I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Barnsley, Central (Mr. Illsley) on securing the debate and on his continuing interest in the health service in his constituency. He and my hon. Friend the Member for Barnsley, East and Mexborough (Jeff Ennis), who I see in his place, have raised before in the House their concerns about health service funding in Barnsley and have also discussed the matter with the Secretary of State for Health, so tonight is by no means an exceptional demonstration of their commitment to the NHS in Barnsley.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41115-35_para0">
<a name="stpa_418">I am also aware that a meeting tomorrow evening has been organised by the coalfield communities campaign, which, I believe, is based in Barnsley, to discuss the specific issue of health service funding in coalfield areas. I do not know whether my hon. Friends will be at the meeting, but I hope that it goes well. As Thanet and Dover, the two councils that represent my own constituency, are members of the campaign, I have a personal interest in their success.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41115-35_para1">
<a name="stpa_419">I do not disagree with what my hon. Friend the Member for Barnsley, Central said. He set out the case fairly and accurately but perhaps not quite in its full context. I start by putting it in context. The national health service in England is benefiting from record investment. Over the years 2003&#150;04 to 2007&#150;08, expenditure on the NHS in England is increasing on average by 7.2 per cent. a year over and above inflation, a total increase over the period of 42 per cent. in real terms. That will take the total spent on the NHS in England from &#163;69 billion in 2004&#150;05 to &#163;92 billion in 2007&#150;08.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41115-35_para2">
<a name="stpa_420">Along with other areas, Barnsley is benefiting from this record level of investment and, I am pleased to say&#151;my hon. Friend put this fairly in his contribution &#151;has been making effective use of the resources it has received. Barnsley primary care trust is receiving &#163;247.7 million in the current financial year, increasing to 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>15 Nov 2004 : Column 1137</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>&#163;270.7 million in 2005&#150;06. In total, over the period 2003&#150;04 to 2005&#150;06, the increase in funding available to Barnsley PCT is more than &#163;64 million, or 31 per cent.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41115-35_para3">
<a name="stpa_421">That is a real and significant level of investment in health services in Barnsley, and it has produced real benefits for local people. For example, all the residents of Barnsley are able to make an appointment to see a GP within two working days and no one in the Barnsley area now waits more than 13 weeks for a first out-patient appointment or more than nine months for in-patient treatment. Barnsley district general hospital provides excellent services for local people: 98 per cent. of people with suspected cancer see a specialist within 48 hours, and 97 per cent. of patients are in and out of accident and emergency within four hours.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41115-35_para4">
<a name="stpa_422">New building and facilities are also coming on line. Later this month, three new primary care centres developed as part of the first wave of the local improvement finance trust will open in Goldthorpe, Thurnscoe and Worsborough, while at the district general hospital new imaging and breast cancer services are being developed. None of these major improvements would have happened if we had not elected a Labour Government in 1997, as my hon. Friend would be the first to acknowledge, and none of them would have been made without the dedication and hard work of people on the ground, and I join him in commending the staff working in the local NHS for their dedication in bringing about real improvements to health services in Barnsley.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41115-35_para5">
<a name="stpa_423">A few moments ago, I mentioned the allocation of money to my hon. Friend&#039;s PCT, so let me explain how the Department of Health decides what funds primary care trusts should receive. Clearly, different parts of the country have different health needs. The national resource allocation formula, which is used to inform revenue allocations for PCTs, recognises that fact. The formula is based on the age distribution of the population, additional need over and above that accounted for by age, and the unavoidable geographical variations in the cost of providing services.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41115-35_para6">
<a name="stpa_424">The formula was criticised in the past for failing to get health services to the areas of greatest health need. Getting resources to people with greatest need and ensuring equity of treatment are fundamental principles of faith for this Government, so we carried out a wide-ranging review of the formula, under the auspices of the Advisory Committee on Resource Allocations, aimed at producing a fairer means of allocating resources.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41115-35_para7">
<a name="stpa_425">The review was completed in autumn 2002, in advance of the current allocations to PCTs. The allocations were announced in December 2002 and were based on the new formula. The allocations, of &#163;148 billion&#151;a cash increase of more than 30 per cent.&#151;were then made directly to local PCTs. In 2001, we proudly proclaimed in the NHS plan:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_40">&quot;by 2003, following the review of the existing weighted capitation formula used to distribute NHS funding, reducing inequalities will be a key criterion for allocating resources to different parts of the country.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="41115-35_para8">
<a name="stpa_426">I am equally proud to say we have delivered on that promise.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41115-35_para9">
<a name="stpa_427">The pattern of use of health services, and the relationship with socio-demographic factors, have changed in the past 10 years, so the element of the 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>15 Nov 2004 : Column 1138</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>formula that reflects need has been updated to include better measures of deprivation. For the first time, the formula takes account of &quot;unmet need&quot; in relation to certain groups within the population&#151;for example ethnic minorities and socio-economically deprived groups.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41115-35_para10">
<a name="stpa_428">The new formula also deals with the variation in labour market pressures across the country. We need to able to get funds into areas where recruitment and retention difficulties are greatest&#151;and I am aware that there is a shortage of GPs in Barnsley.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41115-35_para11">
<a name="stpa_429">The new formula provides a better measure of health need in all areas. In order to get resources in the right place, we need to get the balance right between areas of high health need and those with high labour costs. For all these reasons, I am confident that the allocations to PCTs announced in 2002 set us on the right path.

<p><a name="st_225"><a name="41115-35_spnew0"><b> Jeff Ennis  (Barnsley, East and Mexborough) (Lab):</b> 
 I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Barnsley, Central (Mr. Illsley) on his excellent speech, and associate myself with most, if not all, of what he said. I accept that the Minister sincerely wants to redress the current imbalance in Barnsley. However, in 2001&#151;before South Yorkshire secured objective 1 funding &#151;my constituency had a lower gross domestic product per capita than any other United Kingdom constituency. It still has one of the lowest levels of GDP per capita, and it also still has the highest level of disability: one in three households contains at least one disabled person. That is obviously a legacy of the former mining industry.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41115-35_para12">
<a name="stpa_430">My constituency is divided between Barnsley and Doncaster health authorities. Two thirds of my constituents live in Barnsley; the other third live in Doncaster. Doncaster enjoys funding up to the national average, while Barnsley&#039;s funding is 3 per cent. less than the national average. I am finding it increasingly difficult to explain to my constituents in Barnsley that my constituents in Doncaster enjoy much more generous health funding under the present Government. My hon. Friend says that the gap will not be closed until 2015. Will the Minister try to give me a better explanation, which I can convey to my Barnsley constituents, of the current funding inadequacies?
</p>








<p><a name="st_226"><a name="41115-35_spnew1"><b> Dr. Ladyman: </b> 
 Certainly. If my hon. Friend will bear with me, he will find that my later remarks explain the position.

<a name="stpa_431">The new formula provides a better measure of health need in all areas. It is right to move from the old formula and distribute health funding to a new one, which will benefit Barnsley considerably in the long term. I hope that my hon. Friend agrees, however, that it would not be sensible to swing violently from one formula to another overnight, with all the negative consequences that that would bring for some areas. This is very relevant to the point raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Barnsley, East and Mexborough. We clearly need to phase in the change to allow PCTs to manage the consequences sensibly.

<br>&nbsp;<br>from round to round to take account of a number of factors, including the overall level of resources available and the priorities for their use. By next year&#151;2005&#150;06&#151;no PCT will be more than 6 per cent under target, and PCTs will be constrained to a maximum reduction in distance from target each year of 2 per cent for any one year.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41115-35_para15">
<a name="stpa_433">The progress made to date in Barnsley is considerable, but has taken place in the context of a tight financial position. I do not dispute any of the points that my hon. Friends have made about the financial allocation to Barnsley PCT, but they should also be clear about the impact of our funding policy on Barnsley. The new formula&#039;s emphasis on directing funding towards areas with higher rates of deprivation, and our policy of moving all PCTs, mean that Barnsley PCT has received a greater increase in funding over the current three-year period than would otherwise have been the case. It amounts to a total increase of &#163;64 million, equivalent to 31 per cent.
