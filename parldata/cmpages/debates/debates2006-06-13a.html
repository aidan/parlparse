made an estimate, because at the moment quarry traffic runs to within
two miles of Grassington, which, as you know Mr. Speaker, is the
capital of lower Wharfedale&#151;deep in the Yorkshire dales. At a
time when we are trying to get people out of their cars to enjoy the
countryside, surely it makes economic sense, political sense and good
social sense to reinstate that railway and get people to the beauties
of the dales without their having to rely on their own
transport.</p><p><a name="06061332000041"><b><a name="06061332000323">Derek
Twigg:</b> I agree that it is beautiful part of the world. My
hon. Friend is a great champion of the need to improve the local
railway and I know that he has raised many issues about it. However,
the study did not show a positive cost-benefit ratio and therefore the
business case has not been made. As he knows, we are investing a record
amount in the railway. I am only sorry that I cannot be helpful to him

Twigg:</b> Rural railways and local railways are important,
which is why we have developed the community rail partnership and why
we are seeing investment in community rail. At the same time, there
have to be enough passengers to justify the service. If there is a case
for extending rail links in the future, that will have to be made by
the local authority, working with Network Rail. We are keen on
developing community rail, which is why the partnership has developed
well.</p><h3 align="center"><a name="06061332000024">Transport Innovation

Up to &#163;200 million a year of the transport innovation fund has

have already given the greater Bristol area &#163;1.5 million of
so-called pump-priming money to support the development of a potential
bid for the transport innovation fund. The four unitary authorities in
the area are working together to investigate the potential for using
demand management and road pricing to address the problems of local
congestion. I would expect to receive the first scheme proposals next

Alexander:</b> Those issues are covered in the guidance notes.
We have made no secret of the fact that we think that there is
considerable potential to learn useful lessons from the pilots, but
that is one element of the opportunities that are available to local
authorities, given that there have to be local solutions that work in
local areas.</p><br><notus-date day="13" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>13 Jun 2006 : Column 617</b><br><p><a name="06061332000050"><b><a name="06061332000332">Richard

benefiting from the pump-priming money, as I described it. The broader
relationship between transport and economic growth will be addressed by
the Eddington study, which was commissioned jointly by the Chancellor

Secretary of State to the Dispatch Box for the first time in his new
job and congratulate him on his promotion to the Cabinet. I also
congratulate the Under-Secretary of State for Transport, the hon.
Member for Lincoln (Gillian Merron) on her promotion. It is a shame
that they come to the Dispatch Box on a day when the Government have
cut back the time that is available for Transport questions, which
demonstrates what a low priority transport is for this Government. In
the Secretary of State&#146;s first speech, he confirmed plans for a
national road pricing scheme. He has made reference again today to the
concept of pilots by 2010 in areas such as the west midlands and
Bristol. Does he yet have an idea of what form the pilot will take? In
particular, will it involve only vehicles registered in the area
covered by the pilot, will it be fiscally neutral for those involved
and what technology will it use?</p><p><a name="06061332000053"><b><a name="06061332000335">Mr.
Alexander:</b> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for his
kind remarks, both in relation to me and my ministerial colleague. I
said in the speech that I wanted to make a personal priority of taking
forward the debate on a national road pricing scheme. We need such a
debate, partly because there are genuine questions in the minds of
motorists and other members of the public that need to be addressed. We
would aim for a national consensus, and I hope that we can secure it
over the months ahead, or at least begin to unbundle some of the
questions that have been directed at me today. I make no secret of the
fact that genuine technological questions need to be addressed. I hope
that the local pilots will help us to answer other questions, which is
why I think that it is sensible to have a graduated response that shows
the benefits of road pricing in areas in which that can be seen to be
an effective solution to
congestion.</p><p><a name="06061332000054"><b><a name="06061332000336">Chris
Grayling:</b> I was interested to note that the Secretary of

will they get some information about what they should
expect?</p><p><a name="06061332000055"><b><a name="06061332000337">Mr.
Alexander:</b> Business cases are being worked up and it is
important that those responsible for the areas themselves work out a
solution that works for them. I have examined the matter quite
carefully in recent weeks. The hon. Gentleman puts his points to me,
but I have no idea whatsoever about his position on the questions that
have been asked. We will bring forward detailed proposals from the
seven areas, and that will be the basis on which we can examine the
range of alternatives that, in turn, will inform the thinking that we
develop on national road
pricing.</p><p><a name="06061332000056"><b><a name="06061332000338">Graham
Stringer (Manchester, Blackley) (Lab):</b> My right hon.
Friend&#146;s predecessor assured the House on many occasions that
road charging would not be a condition for future funding of the tram
system in Manchester, yet we appear to be entering into a competition
for transport innovation funds between Manchester and Birmingham that
will almost certainly require road charging. Does my right hon. Friend
agree that rather than getting into such a destructive competition, it
would be much more sensible to use the TIF money to lever in private
sector funds, or as a basis for prudential borrowing, so that
Birmingham, Manchester, Leeds, Bristol&#151;all the cities&#151;can
have the tram systems that they
require?</p><p><a name="06061332000057"><b><a name="06061332000339">Mr.
Alexander:</b> I pay tribute to the leadership role that my
hon. Friend has played in Manchester over a number of years, both in
local government and now here in the Commons. Within days of my
appointment as Secretary of State, I travelled to Manchester and
reiterated the commitment that my predecessor had given on the funds
available for the Manchester Metrolink. Discussions continue with the
Manchester authorities and I hope that we can bring them to a
conclusion relatively quickly. I understand that in addition to those
discussions, consideration is being given in Manchester to the
applicability of TIF funding in the future. However, in the weeks
ahead, I will not in any way resile from the commitment given by my
predecessor to Manchester.</p><h3 align="center"><a name="06061332000025">Rural/Community Railway

improved 
<br><notus-date day="13" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>13 Jun 2006 : Column 619</b><br>connections between the rural lines, which survive the forthcoming cuts,
and the national network, which would bring increased revenue to offset
public subsidy? Would that not be a simple example of an integrated
transport policy, which was much heralded nine years ago by the Deputy
Prime Minister, although it subsequently appears to have sunk without
trace?</p><p><a name="06061332000061"><b><a name="06061332000343">Derek
Twigg:</b> I do not accept that. We launched three franchises
only last week: new cross country, west midlands and east midlands.
They will lead to a 3 to5 per cent. increase in services. The
east and west midlands franchises will be asked to work with and
develop community rail. We are thus seeing an improvement to services
and an increase in their number as a result of what the Government are
doing. Part of the west midlands franchise will be a new hourly service
between Birmingham and Manchester that will serve Congleton, which is
in the hon. Lady&#146;s

Taylor (North-West Leicestershire) (Lab/Co-op):</b> Will the
Minister give an indication of the Government&#146;s thinking on the
National Forest line, a passenger service that would be restored to the
Leicester to Burton section of the rail network? It seems to tick all
the boxes that are necessary, but in his answer to my hon. Friend the
Member for Pendle(Mr. Prentice), he talked about a business
case. This line has one that is strong environmentally, economically,
socially and, dare I say, running through four marginal Labour seats,
politically?</p><p><a name="06061332000063"><b><a name="06061332000345">Derek
Twigg:</b> My hon. Friend makes an interesting point,
especially his last comment. On business cases, there is a great demand
for services and improvements to stations and lines. Although a record
amount of money is going to the railway and significant improvements
have been made, we have to consider such cases. In the first instance,
it is up to the local authority, as the promoter, working with Network
Rail to produce a business case. However, my hon. Friend will be aware,
as I just mentioned, that last week we published the east midlands and
cross-country franchise consultation documents, which set out the
minimum service required. We want views from a range of stakeholders,
and I am sure that we will hear from him, about what people want. We
will consider responses carefully before we make final decisions about
the franchise.</p><p><a name="06061332000064"><b><a name="06061332000346">Mr.
Boris Johnson (Henley) (Con):</b> Will the Minister repeat the
assurances of earlier occupants of his post that neither the
Henley-Twyford line nor any other such line will be converted to a
community railway without the express support of the community
concerned, even though the line runs through solid Conservative
territory?</p><p><a name="06061332000065"><b><a name="06061332000347">Derek
Twigg:</b> Community rail development obviously has to have
the support of the community; otherwise, it does not stack up and make
sense. If there is no community support for a line to be designated as
a community line, it will not happen. The important point to make is
that the more involvement there is, whether it is through the more
formal process of 
<br><notus-date day="13" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>13 Jun 2006 : Column 620</b><br>community development or from the local community, local business and
people generally within particular areas covered by a railway station
and service, the better it is. If the line is supported and more people
use it, its viability is increased and it makes good business sense.
There are, however lots of opportunities without necessarily going down
the community rail development route. That said, it is an excellent
scheme, but if it is not supported, it will not
happen.</p><p><a name="06061332000066"><b><a name="06061332000348">Stephen
Hammond (Wimbledon) (Con):</b> In the Minister&#146;s
answers to my hon. Friends, he reiterated the Government&#146;s
rhetoric that rural, community and light rail are important to them.
However, if they really believed their own rhetoric, they would not be
closing rural railway lines, but increasing their usage, and they would
have spent more than 0.3 per cent. of the Department for
Transport&#146;s budget on light rail. The consultation that is now
happening is leading to the closure rural, smaller and community rail
links. It is surely on the way to ditching another policy. That means
another policy will be ditched, another policy will be U-turned, and
there will be more problems for the travelling
public.</p><p><a name="06061332000067"><b><a name="06061332000349">Derek

line we have plans to close. Can the hon. Gentleman let us
know?</p><p><a name="06061332000068">We have 2,500
stations, and I have opened two or three new ones in the past 12
months; for example, Liverpool Parkway is opening and the east midlands

let me tell him that all Thames valley MPs of all parties are concerned
about the punctuality and efficiency of the commuter service that leads
into the Thames valley. The service between Slough and Paddington has
become less frequent, and because of the reduction in frequency, it
might appear more punctual and more effective. Unless we have an
effective rail commuter service into the Thames valley, which is the

it is necessary at times to introduce changes to the schedules that
make sense in the context of the differing demands in different parts
of the country. However, the improvements that we have seen over recent

of the better integration of working relationships between the train

the view that it would like to see the level come down to 50 mg at some
point. However, there is no point in discussing harmonisation with the
level in Europe, because, although most states in Europe specify lower
levels of alcohol in their law, they do not enforce at those levels. In
this country, we are, at least, enforcing hard at 80 mg. I have pointed
out to ACPO that the police need to put resources into making sure that
nobody breaks the 80 mg limit. When we are confident that we are

Birmingham, Yardley to have an electorate of fewer than 51,000, when in
the same old county of Warwickshire, Rugby and Kenilworth has an
electorate of more than 83,000? The Boundary Commission for England
recommends an average of 70,000 electors per constituency and is
trundling through its changes. However, the Boundary Commission for

equalisation of voters, so that each elector&#146;s vote has the same

equality between numbers of residents, and that means getting the
percentage of residents who register to vote up to nearer 100 per cent.
If we do not achieve that, young people, people in rented accommodation

we shall doubtless debate later today when we consider the Electoral
Administration Bill, which deals with registration. I take his point
seriously. The number of people who live in inner cities but are not
registered and therefore not counted bythe boundary
commissions makes a considerable difference. He makes a good point
about ensuring that everyone is counted and registered, so that we
properly reflect the communities that we are supposed to

that the criteria given to the Boundary Commission by the House need to
change? The reason why constituencies are so hopelessly out of kilter
in numbers of electors is that the commission is always working on
out-of-date statistics. It is to allowed to look backwards but not
forwards, and this causes huge anomalies that could easily be avoided.

considered with at least one other part of the south of England; it
would be very difficult to make it into two or more constituencies.
Nevertheless, I hear what the hon. Gentleman has said, and in my
discussions with the Boundary Commission, I shall look at all aspects
of ensuring that every constituency represents the people who live in
it as well as possible.</p><p><a name="06061332000135"><b><a name="06061332000414">Mr.
Oliver Heald (North-East Hertfordshire) (Con):</b> But does
the Minister not accept that there is a bit of party politics going on
here? She will know that, after last month&#146;s local elections,
Sir Michael Lyons&#151;a former Labour councillor and an adviser to
the Government&#151;said that council boundaries should now be
politically redrawn to make council elections more &#147;closely
competitive&#148;. Of course, we know what happened in those local
elections. Is the Minister intending to follow this principle for
parliamentary elections? Is it not the case that if Labour cannot win
elections, its first instinct is to gerrymander the boundaries
involved?</p><p><a name="06061332000136"><b><a name="06061332000415">Bridget

their acceptance in principle of the recommendations in 2002, subject
to further consideration of some aspects of the Law Commission&#146;s

Kevin Young, was repeatedly sexually abused by a prison officer while
he was in a youth offender institution 29 years ago. He wants the terms
of the Limitation Act 1980 changed to make it easier for people like
him to claim compensation. In a letter to me in March, Baroness Ashton
said that it might be possible to use the Legislative and Regulatory
Reform Bill, if it is passed by Parliament, to change the law more
quickly by statutory instrument. Will the Government will look into
that?</p><p><a name="06061332000143"><b><a name="06061332000421">Vera

fast-track provision in that Bill to introduce non-contentious
recommendations by the Law Commission by statutory instrument, and that
could be used to fast-track these proposals. I am very sympathetic to
my hon. Friend and his constituent. People who suffered sex abuse when
they were children and did not appreciate its impact until much later
often find themselves outside the limitation period, and therefore
suffer injustice. We will certainly look at using that Bill to bring
such a proposal forward; otherwise we will seek an early legislative
opportunity.</p><p><a name="06061332000144"><b><a name="06061332000422">Peter

went far wider than the concern raised by my hon. Friend the Member for
City of York (Hugh Bayley), as they also related to matters such as
time limits on squatters&#146; rights, corruption, insolvency
applications and compulsory purchase orders. A great deal of work has
had to be done across a number of Departments, which explains the

last month that, following the Lord Chancellor&#146;s overestimate of

this financial year? Is that not good news for fine defaulters and

Friend had an opportunity to see the evidence of Sir Mark Potter, the
president of the family division, to the Constitutional Affairs
Committee? He says that any changes in the budget will dramatically
affect his ability to bring down the current casework delay in the
family division. I know that my right hon. and learned Friend is very
keen on modernising the Courts Service and that she has great ambitions
to do so, but a cut in the budget that is not agreed with the judiciary
will have serious implications for the delays that are still inherent
in our family justice system.</p><p><a name="06061332000151"><b><a name="06061332000429">Ms
Harman:</b> We are all concerned that there should be no
unnecessary delay in court processes, especially where children are
involved. I have discussed the delays with the president of the family
division and his fellow judges. One of our aims is to ensure that as
many cases as possible do not come to court at all, but can be agreed
outside it, as well as ensuring that cases that are brought to court
are dealt with more swiftly.</p><p><a name="06061332000152"><b><a name="06061332000430">Mr.
Jonathan Djanogly (Huntingdon) (Con):</b> We understand that
the &#163;80 million cut in the court budget this year could lead to
a reduction of services and the loss of up to 1,300 jobs. Last week,
the Minister of State revealed to me that the courts failed to collect
some &#163;282 million worth of fines. Does not that debacle prove
once again the Government&#146;s inability to run public services,
and the inability of Constitutional Affairs Ministers to run their own
Department?</p><p><a name="06061332000153"><b><a name="06061332000431">Ms
Harman:</b> No, it does not. The hon. Gentleman is well aware
that, having inherited a position in which nearly half the fines
imposed by the courts were not collected, a great deal of work has been
done between the police and the courts across the country and the
collection rate has been increased to more than 80 per cent. That money
goes to the Treasury, which I am sure 
<br><notus-date day="13" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>13 Jun 2006 : Column 633</b><br>is extremely pleased to receive it. The finances of the Courts Service
are not what the hon. Gentleman said that they were. In fact, the
courts did not spend the full amount that they thought that they would
in the previous year. Perhaps, to help hon. Members to understand the
exact position, I will place in the Library a copy of the permanent
secretary&#146;s letter to all court staff. That would enable hon.
Members to see the financial situation, which is challenging, but not
of the dimensions that the hon. Gentleman
implied.</p><p><a name="06061332000154"><b><a name="06061332000432">Ms

order&#151;without having a public
hearing?</p><p><a name="06061332000155"><b><a name="06061332000433">Ms
Harman:</b> My hon. Friend raises an extremely important
point, which she has put to me in a written question, so I know what
the answer is. Last year something like 200 people were sent to prison
by the family courts, which happens in complete privacy and secrecy.
The idea that people are sent to prison without any reports of the
proceedings makes even more important the work that we are undertaking
with the family courts, and with the important intervention of the
Constitutional Affairs Committee, to open them up so that they act in
the public interest while maintaining personal privacy.</p><h3 align="center"><a name="06061332000035">Colchester

adjourned the inquest as directed by the Lord Chancellor pending Lord

need to protect their rights if they are embarking on
cohabitation?</p><p><a name="06061332000169"><b><a name="06061332000447">Vera
Baird:</b> The Law Commission produced its paper at the
request of the Lord Chancellor because of concern about the fact that
there are now 2 million cohabiting couples in England and Wales and
about 1.25 million children dependent on them. We must think about
reducing the potential financial hardship suffered by cohabitants when
there is a break-up.</p><p><a name="06061332000170">Apparently, 56 per cent. of
people who responded to a survey thought that there was such a thing as
common-law marriage, and that cohabitants&#146; rights to property
and finance were very similar to those of married people. That is not
correct. We have engaged two charitable not-for-profit groups to try to
make people aware of the limitations on the legal status of people who
cohabit, but the important point is that the Law Commission, at our
request, is considering responsibly&#151;as is essential when so many
individuals,

Lady&#151;whom I welcome to her responsibilities&#151;to recognise
the powerful case for a change in the law? Overwhelmingly, this is not
about the distribution of largesse or about providing a rival to
marriage, but about fairness, and, in many cases, about rescuing people
from the destitution to which they would otherwise be
consigned.</p><p><a name="06061332000172"><b><a name="06061332000449">Vera

a partisan point, and say that it is women, usually, who are left high
and dry after cohabitation, perhaps having dreamt that they did have
some property rights, and they may indeed be thrown into destitution.
It is important for us to examine the whole subject with a great deal
of care. It involves sensitivities on numerous fronts, which is why it
was appropriate for us to ask the Law Commission to consider it. We
look forward to the results of the commission&#146;s consultation,

Review</h3><h5 align="left"><a name="06061332000316">3.32
pm</h5><p><a name="06061332000173"><b><a name="06061332000450">The
Minister of State, Ministry of Defence(Mr. Adam
Ingram):</b> On 29 March I announcedto the House the
publication of the Government-commissioned Deepcut review, undertaken
independently by Nicholas Blake QC. It looked into the circumstances
surrounding the deaths of four young soldiers who were training at
Princess Royal barracks, Deepcut, between 1995 and 2002. I gave the
House an assurance that I was determined to deal with the issues raised
by Mr. Blake, and undertook to ensure that everything possible would be
done to prevent similar tragedies occurring in the future. I said that
we would look at every one of Mr. Blake&#146;s 34 recommendations to
see how they should best be implemented to address the weaknesses that
had been identified as quickly and effectively as
possible.</p><p><a name="06061332000174">Today I am publishing the
Government&#146;s response to the Deepcut review. Copies will be
placed in the Libraries of both Houses. I understand that the
publication of our response will inevitably evoke sad memories for the
families of the soldiers who died at Deepcut. I hope that they will
find some comfort in our response to Mr. Blake&#146;s
recommendations.</p><p><a name="06061332000175">Having completed the detailed
analysis of the report, I reiterate that it is an exhaustive,
illuminating and thorough review, and I repeat my tribute and gratitude
to Mr. Blake for such a comprehensive piece of work. I am confident
that its enduring legacy will be a better and more caring framework for
young trainees and service personnel more generally. The Government
have acknowledged that mistakes were made in the past, and that there
were failures in the way in which young and sometimes vulnerable
recruits were cared for. I believe that the report will constitute a
watershed in the treatment of our servicemen and women.</p><p><a name="06061332000176">The services had, of course,
already made significant changes and improvements before the Deepcut
review, as Mr. Blake readily acknowledges in his report. For example,
much greater attention is being paid to risk of self-harm and
preventive measures; there are stricter controls over access to
firearms; supervision of recruits and trainees has improved;
appreciable new investment in facilities and accommodation has occurred
and is ongoing; and a new harassment complaints procedure has been
implemented.</p><p><a name="06061332000177">However,
the Deepcut review has highlighted that there is more that we can do,
particularly in some key areas. I can confirm to the House that we
accept the great majority of the review&#146;s recommendations,
although in some cases with necessary and justifiable modification or
qualification, as explained in our response. However, in those cases,
we are still confident that we can give meaning to the intent behind
the recommendation. There are very few recommendations that we cannot
meet either wholly or in substantial part, and I now turn to
these.</p><p><a name="06061332000178">Recommendation
30 concerns the availability of an inquest wherever the death occurs,
in this country or overseas. We are very much in sympathy with this
thinking, but of course, it bears upon the draft Coroners Bill that has
been published for consultation. Consequently, we are in discussion
with the 
<br><notus-date day="13" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>13 Jun 2006 : Column 638</b><br>Department for Constitutional Affairs as to how that recommendation
might be given effect.</p><p><a name="06061332000179">Recommendation 31 also concerns
inquests, in this case ensuring that the family of a deceased soldier
has access to legal advice and representation. It is our intention to
support families as much as we can throughout what are sad and
distressing events, but there is a general presumption that interested
persons at an inquest do not normally need to be legally represented.
However, there is provision, in exceptional cases, for application for
funding to be made to the Legal Services Commission. I believe that to
bethe appropriate mechanism and process to satisfy the
recommendation.</p><p><a name="06061332000180">Finally, recommendation 33
recommends to the Surrey police that the families of Sean Benton,
Cheryl James and Geoff Gray be provided with copies of the respective
Surrey police reports, solely for the purpose of considering whether an
application should be made to the High Court to set aside the previous
inquest into their child&#146;s death. That is of course entirely a
matter for the Surrey police, but I have written to the chief constable
stating that, in the Ministry of Defence&#146;s view, that is a
helpful suggestion from Mr. Blake, and that, for our part, we would be
happy to co-operate fully in such a
process.</p><p><a name="06061332000181">As I said
earlier, we have accepted the great majority of the Deepcut
review&#146;s recommendations, and, as the response that I have
published today shows, some are already in the process of being
implemented. Work has already begun to address the rest. However, I
know that a number of the issues raised in the review are of particular
interest to Members, and it is to those that I now
turn.</p><p><a name="06061332000182">First, let me
emphasise that we fully accept and agree with the review&#146;s
concern that the needs of service personnel under the age of
18&#151;and their vulnerabilities&#151; should be recognised. That
is now reflected in new guidance to commanding officers. A &#147;care
of trainees&#148; module was introduced to the training programme for
instructors and other supervisory staff in 2004. That has now been
incorporated in the &#147;train the trainer&#148; course for
instructors, which has been introduced across the armed
forces.</p><p><a name="06061332000183">A new
supervisory care policy in phase 1 and 2 training establishments was
introduced in March this year, and each unit is required to compile an
assessment of the risk to trainees that takes account of the particular
circumstances of that establishment and its population. There are
specific policies aimed at the well-being of under-18s in terms of how
they are accommodated, their recreational and social facilities, and
their duties, including access to
firearms.</p><p><a name="06061332000184">One of the
most significant areas of the review is the provision of independent
assurance of our processes, and in particular the military justice
system and the military complaints systems. We intend to introduce or
enhance independent oversight of both those areas. The Police and
Justice Bill will provide for the creation of a new combined
inspectorate for the criminal justice system. Following discussion with
the Attorney-General, the Lord Chancellor and Home Secretary, we intend
to use that opportunity to extend and deepen inspection arrangements
across the military justice system. Those working within that system
strive to 
<br><notus-date day="13" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>13 Jun 2006 : Column 639</b><br>perform with professionalism and to standards comparable to those in the
civilian criminal justice system. External assurance will serve further
to demonstrate
that.</p><p><a name="06061332000185">Turning to the
military redress of complaints system, as the House is aware, we have
already made proposals under the Armed Forces Bill to improve that
process and to introduce an independent element to it. We intend that
the service complaint panels dealing with complaints such as those
relating to harassment and bullying will include an independent member,
and that the complaints process will be reviewed annually and publicly
by an independent external reviewer. But in the light of the
recommendations of the Deepcut review, and of representations made by
Members during the consideration of the Bill by the Armed Forces Bill
Select Committee, we propose to go further. We propose that the role of
the external reviewer should be extended, providing him or her with the
ability to accept complaints directly from a serviceperson or a family
member, or another third party on their behalf; to have the power to
refer such complaints to the chain of command for appropriate action;
and to be informed of the outcome of that
complaint.</p><p><a name="06061332000186">That wider
role would justify the title of service complaints commissioner.
Critically, the commissioner would have direct access to Ministers.
Furthermore, to ensure effective oversight the commissioner would
report annually to Parliament. The House will note that in some
practical respects this model for a commissioner is different from that
proposed in the Deepcut review. Let me stress that there is, however,
no difference between the Government and Mr. Blake over the fundamental
intent, which is to promote the effective operation of existing
military proceedings and provide independent assurance that the
procedures are working effectively, with systemic issues appropriately
addressed.</p><p><a name="06061332000187">Turning to
the proposal that a commissioner might have the right to be consulted
in disciplinary matters, or have the ability to intervene to institute
legal proceedings against prosecution decisions, we believe that that
would potentially undermine the role and independence of the
prosecuting authorities. I know of no precedent for such a role in the
civilian criminal justice
system.</p><p><a name="06061332000188">We have
listened carefully to evidence given to various Select Committees and
by Members of both Houses. We maintain&#151;and I hope that right
hon. and hon. Members would share this view&#151;that the chain of
command&#146;s primary responsibility for welfare should not be
undermined. However, in providing for a service complaints
commissioner, we accept the need for external, independent assurance,
especially for a vulnerable young trainee&#151;or his family or
friends&#151;who may feel uncomfortable about approaching a
commanding officer directly. Subject to views expressed in this House
and in the other place, the Government would propose to bring forward
amendments to the Armed Forces Bill to provide for a service complaints
commissioner.</p><p><a name="06061332000189">Our
armed forces are deeply valued by the Government and by the whole
House. Their well-being is very much at the heart of this response to
the Deepcut review. We are committed to improving the 
<br><notus-date day="13" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>13 Jun 2006 : Column 640</b><br>way in which all our recruits are trained, developed and looked after.
We are resolute in our aim to deliver real, measurable and tangible
improvements to the benefit of all our personnel who serve our country
so well. As I stated earlier, this will be a watershed in how our
servicemen and women are treated. I am determined to deliver on the
commitments, and the external scrutiny that will be put in place will
hold us to account now and in the
future.</p><p><a name="06061332000190"><b><a name="06061332000451">Dr.
Liam Fox (Woodspring) (Con):</b> I am sure that I speak for
both sides of the House when I say that we wish profoundly that the
tragic deaths of four young people had not made this report necessary,
but I am grateful to the Minister for his response and his courtesy in
making the statement available to us in advance.</p><p><a name="06061332000191">As I said the last time that we
discussed this subject, the social trends in our country today mean
that an increasing number of recruits come from broken family
backgrounds, have poor academic achievements and are often deficit in
basic skills. The fact that the Army can transform them into world
class soldiers is something of which we should all be justly proud. We
also need to remember that the cases that we are discussing today are
very much the exceptions, and I am sure that the Minister would want to
underline that.</p><p><a name="06061332000192">Let us
remind ourselves of some of the basic facts of this tragedy. Of the
four young victims, two had previous, clearly recorded episodes of
self-harm in their medical notes prior to recruitment. One of the
others had clearly documented episodes of self-harm while in the Army.
Another was about to be forced to leave the Army against his will.
These vulnerable individuals were not only given loaded guns, but put
on solitary guard duty in remote locations. They were given both means
and opportunity and, as the Minister said, the Government accept that
that represented a failure in duty of
care.</p><p><a name="06061332000193">The Blake report
found that there was bullying, but that it was by no means endemic nor
clearly linked to any of the four deaths. However, it also said that
there were too few non-commissioned officers to supervise training
properly&#151;a fact that the Army had pointed out already. What can
we learn from the Government&#146;s response to the report, and how
can we ensure that the tragedies cannot be
repeated?</p><p><a name="06061332000194">To begin
with, we must make sure that there is a comprehensive system for
assessing a recruit&#146;s medical history. That means more than
merely having sight of medical notes: there must be a proper
investigation into the medical history of all recruits. Will the
Minister confirm that that has been happening in all
casessince
2004?</p><p><a name="06061332000195">What about the
ratio of NCOs to recruits? The 2002 report by the Deputy
Adjutant-General found that the level of
supervision</p><a name="06061332000306"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;was wholly
inadequate and greatly magnified the level of
risk.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06061332000196">What has been done
to improve that
ratio?</p><p><a name="06061332000197">The Minister
spoke about phase 2 training, but the problem went beyond supervision.
The indeterminate length of that training was a factor that exacerbated
the unhappiness of many recruits, so what has been done to ameliorate
that?</p><br><notus-date day="13" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>13 Jun 2006 : Column 641</b><br><p><a name="06061332000198">The Minister was right to talk
about the inquests system, but merely amending the forthcoming Bill is
not good enough. At present, 59 inquests into the deaths of servicemen
killed in Iraq remain outstanding. There needs to be a change in how
the system is operated or funded. I know that the Secretary of State is
looking at that, and I hope that the Minister will say where the
Government have got to in respect of dealing with the backlog and with
the current failures in the inquests
system.</p><p><a name="06061332000199">I am pleased
that the Government have not caved in to the arguments for introducing
a full-blown ombudsman, and that the Minister said that the chain of
command&#146;s primary responsibility for welfare should not be
undermined. The Opposition completely agree, but how will the
relationship between commissioner and commander work in practice? What
will the interface be? Who will select the commissioner, and according
to what criteria? What sort of background will the commissioner have?
We would much prefer it if he had a military background, and therefore
an understanding of the pressures in the chain of command.</p><p><a name="06061332000200">I am grateful to the Government
for their response. We shall look constructively and in detail at what
they propose. We need a training system that is nurturing and without
harassment or bullying, yet robust enough to prepare youngsters for the
sort of tasks that they face in the brutal realities of Iraq or
Afghanistan.</p><p><a name="06061332000201">We want
the Government to ensure that there is a duty of care, but all hon.
Members are fully aware that, in the end, we are training
soldiers.</p><p><a name="06061332000202"><b><a name="06061332000452">Mr.
Ingram:</b> I do not intend to comment about the four
individual deaths to which the hon. Member for Woodspring (Dr. Fox)
referred. Enough grief has washed over the families involved already,
and this has been another bad and difficult day for them. The report
looks at those deaths, but goes much wider. I agree with the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s assessment of the achievements of our training
environment, and I shall not elaborate on what has been said time and
again about the quality produced at Deepcut and
elsewhere.</p><p><a name="06061332000203">The hon.
Member for Woodspring asked a range of questions, some of which have
been answered on previous occasions. Additional resources for
instructors have been made available, and we are constantly looking at
the balance in this matter. I do not want to go into the history too
much, but part of the problem in the past was that the training
environment was stripped out to meet front-line demand. The Government
inherited that problem and have been trying to address it, but
strengthening the training environment means that senior and capable
personnel are taken away from the front line at an exceptionally busy
time. The Government must strike the right balance, and we are making
significant
progress.</p><p><a name="06061332000204">The hon.
Gentleman asked about the way in which we assess the background of
recruits. New procedures have been put in place to do that, so that we
have the best assessment of the nature and characteristics of the young
people in question. Not all of them come from 
<br><notus-date day="13" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>13 Jun 2006 : Column 642</b><br>vulnerable backgrounds or are damaged individuals, and I would not like
it to be thought that that is the quality of the young recruits to Her
Majesty&#146;s armed forces. It is not. There are some with those
characteristics, but many come from stable family homes and military
families. None the less, we have to understand the breadth of the range
of individuals with whom we are dealing.</p><p><a name="06061332000205">The hon. Gentleman raised the
unquestionably important matter of phase 1 and phase 2 training. Our
aim is to make sure that we do not have recruits, in effect, sitting
around doing nothing while they wait for their next posting, and that
has been tackled substantially. The average number of soldiers awaiting
trade training for more than 14 days has decreased from more than 1,100
in 2003-04 to 456 in 2005-06, and we shall work to improve that. For
Deepcut alone, the comparable figures are a decrease from 136 to 75.
Sometimes it happens for a good reason, but we recognise that it is an
issue none the less.</p><p><a name="06061332000206">The hon. Gentleman asked about
coroner&#146;s inquests and the backlog in what is done for those
whose bodies are repatriated from Iraq, Afghanistan and elsewhere. We
have announced new measures, in consultation with the Department for
Constitutional Affairs. Three additional assistant deputy coroners, one
of whom is a retired High Court judge, will be appointed to assist the
Oxfordshire coroner in dealing with the backlog of Iraq-related
inquests. As of last week, 59 inquests were outstanding on service
personnel whose bodies were repatriated to RAF Brize Norton. We have at
all times recognised that that is a problem, and we are now beginning
to tackle it. Throughout, the interests of the grieving families must
remain paramount.</p><p><a name="06061332000207">The
hon. Gentleman asked specific questions about the role of the
commissioner and he expressed a strong&#151;indeed,
prescriptive&#151;view. I would say, let us examine the merits of the
role of the commissioner. In the Armed Forces Bill, we will define in
broad terms what the commissioner will do&#151;we will have to table
amendments, which will be subject to debate in the other place, where
the Bill now is, and perhaps in this place when the Bill returns to the
Commons. It is worth having the arguments; I simply ask the hon.
Gentleman and his colleagues to have an open mind and not to be too
prescriptive. Let us see what the best method and the most acceptable
solution are. I believe that the framework that we have set out has
great merit. An important aspect of that is that it does not undermine
the chain of command, which is paramount in all that we seek to
do.</p><p><a name="06061332000208"><b><a name="06061332000453">Nick
Harvey (North Devon) (LD):</b> I thank the Minister for the
statement and for advance notice of it. I welcome the
Government&#146;s positive response to some of the Blake
recommendations.</p><p><a name="06061332000209">On
the matter of Surrey police sharing with the families evidence to which
they have been struggling to gain access for more than three years, I
applaud the fact that the right hon. Gentleman has entered into
correspondence with the chief constable. If the problem is that the
police believe that people gave evidence on an anonymous basis, will he
explore with the chief constable the possibility of disclosing the
evidence at least initially on an anonymous basis, with names
obscured?</p><br><notus-date day="13" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>13 Jun 2006 : Column 643</b><br><p><a name="06061332000210">Turning to the crux of the
matter, the Minister has just responded to the shadow Secretary of
State on the proposed service complaints commissioner. I welcome the
Government talking about the importance of independence and bringing
independent assurance to the process, but I am sorry that the Minister
turned down the opportunity to tell us more about the remit of the
commissioner. Who will appoint the commissioner? What will his powers
be and what resources will he have? To what extent will the
commissioner have the power to instruct a remedy, or will he simply
have an advisory role that goes back up the line of command? Will there
be independent people on all service complaints panels? What ability
will the commissioner have either to intervene in complaints or to
initiate inquiries on the basis of evidence that he sees, or of a
pattern or picture that he sees emerging? We need to hear a lot more
about this matter before we can judge whether, as the Minister says,
the title of service complaints commissioner is justified.</p><p><a name="06061332000211">On accommodation for young
recruits and recommendations 2 and 8, will the Minister explain why the
recommendation to train under-17s in establishments exclusive to that
age group has been rejected? Will he reflect on the findings of the
Armed Forces Pay Review Body and the comments of the previous Secretary
of State that accommodation is in a &#147;worse position&#148; than
anything else. What does he intend to do about the accommodation
issue?</p><p><a name="06061332000212"><b><a name="06061332000454">Mr.
Ingram:</b> I thank the hon. Gentleman for some of his
comments, but perhaps not all of them. On the question of Surrey
police, we are talking about something that is a matter for the police.
The fact that I have written to the chief constable to indicate what I
think would be of benefit reflects a view that I have taken from the
early stages&#151;as my knowledge grew&#151;that the reopening of
the inquests would be desirable. It is not in my power to so direct.
The Surrey police information may provide sufficient grounds to allow
that to happen, but I do not know, because I have not seen it in
detail. I cannot intrude in that matter other than to indicate my
strong preference as to what should happen. I cannot direct on that
matter.</p><p><a name="06061332000213">On the
commissioner&#146;s role, the hon. Gentleman had an early view of my
statement and I have set out what the remit of the commissioner would
be. I have been careful in the response&#151;I do not want to say
that this tops and bottoms it or ends it. We are fortunate that we have
the Armed Forces Bill where this matter will be ventilated and can be
discussed and examined. I would not want to close down on any
reasonable suggestion. However, I do not want to put in place or
encourage anything that seeks to undermine the important role of the
chain of command. That is why we have said that the independent
commissioner would have the right of reporting to the commanding
officer, the right of follow up in terms of finding out what happened
as a result of all that, and, importantly, the right of access to
Ministers and to report annually to Parliament. If there was a pattern
developing, or even a significant case, it would be down to that
individual to draw the Minister&#146;s attention to it if he felt
that there was reluctance, unwillingness or blocking on the part of the
commanding officer or the system itself. So, we have an insight into
what is going on. That has not been there 
<br><notus-date day="13" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>13 Jun 2006 : Column 644</b><br>before. However, I will resist any attempt to undermine the independence
of the commanding officer or their right to ensure that proper
discipline is maintained in their unit. We have made a substantial move
and, hopefully, it is to be welcomed and subject to further
examination.</p><p><a name="06061332000214">Accommodation is a big issue;
there is no question about that. That is why we have re-profiled a lot
of our spending approaches to try to make sure that we can lift the
quality of accommodation. We have a massive backlog to attend to. The
moneys would not simply be available to anyone. We are not talking
about a wish list, but about practicalities, given the hundreds of
millions&#151;if not billions&#151;of pounds that would be required
to improve that accommodation. We have a progressive programme to deal
with all that. Although we can see the objectives of the
recommendations, the delivery will take some time to achieve. That is
what we have now set out to seek to achieve.</p><p><a name="06061332000215">I suggest that the hon.
Gentleman takes the time to read our response to the
recommendations&#151;I accept that he has not had that opportunity.
We set out the rationale. It is fairly long and I do not want to read
it out in detail, other than to say this: we recognise that there is an
issue and we are seeking to address it. We have best practice and very
good training environments at Harrogate and Bassingbourn. We can see
the quality that comes out of that type of training establishment,
where there is a separation of the single young people, and the type of
training that we can give them. Whether that can be matched across the
whole of the training environment has to be judged in terms of what we
are trying to train. We are talking about a soldier going into the
front line. We have got to judge the quality and robustness of that
training.</p><p><a name="06061332000216">I
make a final point to the hon. Gentleman.Mr. Blake&#146;s
report referred to the unsolicited comment of a young trainee in which
he said that he felt that he was being mollycoddled. Soldiers react to
being mollycoddled because they might be in the front line tomorrow, so
that is why a balance has to be
struck.</p><p><a name="06061332000217"><b><a name="06061332000455">Mrs.
Joan Humble (Blackpool, North and Fleetwood) (Lab):</b> I
welcome the considered and detailed response that the Minister has
given to Nicholas Blake&#146;s review. May I question him further on
the independent commissioner&#151;the service complaints
commissioner? As he is aware, I would have preferred a commissioner
with the powers that Nicholas Blake outlined; nevertheless, I welcome
the establishment of a service complaints commissioner. As we will be
having further discussions on the matter, will the Minister consider
the independence and powers of the commissioner, because families will
be asking questions about that? For example, he outlined that one of
the commissioner&#146;s powers will be to refer complaints to the
chain of command for appropriate action, but what will happen if the
chain of command has already considered those complaints? In such
circumstances, the individual concerned and his or her family will want
reassurances about the powers of the commissioner and the way in which
the commissioner can investigate. Will the Minister consider those
powers and give assurances about independence so that the families, in
turn, can be reassured?</p><br><notus-date day="13" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>13 Jun 2006 : Column 645</b><br><p><a name="06061332000218"><b><a name="06061332000456">Mr.
Ingram:</b> I fully respect and understand the position that
my hon. Friend takes, but I ask her to take account of all the other
things that we have done. The adult learning inspectorate can carry out
notified and unnotified visits to training establishments. It can then
examine all the things that we have put in place regarding duty of care
to determine whether that is being effectively delivered. The overall
delivery is thus subject to independent
scrutiny.</p><p><a name="06061332000219">The
commissioner will bring to the process a recognition of the fact that
many young people feel that they do not have confidence in the system.
The same may be the case for their parents, although the young people
might not be fortunate enough to have parents who care for them
directly. Indeed, a friend of the young person or someone serving
alongside them could trigger the process. The people or their families
could tell the commissioner that something that had happened had been
brushed over. A one-off incident would be bad enough, but if an
incident indicated that there was a pattern of events, the commissioner
would be on to that very quickly. If there was any indication that the
system&#151;be that an individual commanding officer, or a more
institutional process&#151;was blocking what the commissioner was
trying to do, the commissioner would have access to the Minister and
could report
accordingly.</p><p><a name="06061332000220">There is
now enough raised awareness in the Ministry of Defence for us to
realise that we cannot allow the problems of the past to recur.
However, we can never guarantee that sad incidents will not happen. We
cannot be perfect, and we will never be able&#151;in any part of
civil or military life, or any aspect of society&#151;to avoid
self-harm or difficult circumstances arising owing to bullying and
harassment. However, we are trying to put in place an environment that
will ensure that those who have direct responsibility through the
zero-tolerance approach will fully understand what they have to do. If
they are not delivering, the commissioner will be able to take the
matter up with the commanding officer and report to the Minister. There
is also the independent overview from the adult learning inspectorate.
I do not think that there is any other aspect of what the public
service delivers that has such public scrutiny. We have not yet reached
a conclusion on the final role of the commissioner, because that will
be determined as part of the proceedings on the Armed Forces
Bill.</p><p><a name="06061332000221"><b><a name="06061332000457">Michael

wrote to the then Secretary of State for Defence two months ago to
explain to him that Defence Estates had slated the entire Deepcut
barracks for sell-off and future development. Understandably, there is
concern in my constituency that the Ministry of Defence wants to wash

the high-quality trainees and front-line soldiers that we so need,
never ceases to amaze me, as I saw on my last visit. There is no
question about that. The last inspection by the adult learning
inspectorate said that Deepcut had become an exemplar. Perhaps that is
a feature of the focus that has been on it, but I think that it would
have happened anyway because of the intense effort that has gone in to
lift the quality of what we do in the training environment. The
&#147;train the trainers&#148; process will train instructors. We
are opening a school at Pirbright in 2007 to do just that, and it will
be designed to give quality training to those who become trainers. That
has not been done before and was a deficiency. I pay tribute to those
who deliver training at

tell him the future of Deepcut, any more than I can tell him the future
of any part of the training environment. It is a comprehensive
undertaking and a major examination of how best we can deliver training
outputs. There will be change. I cannot say how it will affect Deepcut.
I do not think that people want to wash their hands of it, which is why
I pay tribute to those who deliver the service there. Let us remember

young people died? The only way to do so is to compel witnesses to come
forward and cross-examine them in a public
inquiry.</p><p><a name="06061332000230"><b><a name="06061332000462">Mr.
Ingram:</b> No, I do not, because that would not achieve the
end result sought by the hon. Gentleman. The Blake review was
exhaustive, and it examined all of that territory. I do not think that
anything was held back or that Mr. Blake was hoodwinked&#151;I am not
saying that the hon. Gentleman made such a suggestion. Mr. Blake put a
great deal of effort into the review and, while he was critical of some
aspects of what was going on, he revealed information of which we were
not previously aware, allowing us to take action accordingly.</p><p><a name="06061332000231">The presumption behind the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s question is that the process of a public inquiry
would lead to the &#147;how&#148; and &#147;why&#148;, but we
cannot be certain that it would do so. There have been five police
reports, and we have conducted our own internal investigations. He said
that Blake&#146;s was a good report in part, but I think that it is a
good report in total. If Mr. Blake had concluded that a public inquiry
was necessary, I would have been in a dilemma, given my view that that
was not the case. I would have had to weigh his opinion against my own.
It is with a sense of relief that I find that I do not have to do so,
as he advances an extremely solid argument to support the conclusion
that a public inquiry is not necessary. I hope that we all use our best
judgment to find on the same basis. It is easy to continue running a
campaign, but for what purpose, if it does not produce the result that
is sought?</p><p><a name="06061332000232"><b><a name="06061332000463">Mr.
Kevan Jones (North Durham) (Lab):</b> I often think that
dealing with the Ministry of Defence is like pushing water uphill. We
are slowly getting there, given the announcement of a commissioner, who
will provide the independent oversight that is needed. Like the hon.
Member for North Devon (Nick Harvey) and my hon. Friend the Member for
Blackpool, North and Fleetwood (Mrs. Humble), I am concerned that we
have not been provided with details of the commissioner&#146;s role
and remit. My right hon. Friend the Minister said that we needed more
discussion, but following a report by the Select Committee on Defence 
<br><notus-date day="13" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>13 Jun 2006 : Column 648</b><br>and discussion of the Armed Forces Bill, is it not time to determine the
detail of the commissioner&#146;s role? Unless we do so, we will be
reluctant to support the proposal when we debate the Armed Forces Bill
in the House. Unlike the hon. Member for Woodspring(Dr. Fox),
I believe that it is vital that the commissioner should be independent.
The expectation that he should be associated with the armed forces is
quite wrong, so I urge the Minister not to appoint anyone who is
connected in any way with the military chain of
command.</p><p><a name="06061332000233"><b><a name="06061332000464">Mr.
Ingram:</b> I am sorry that my hon. Friend thinks that he is
pushing water uphill. I do not know whether he is Jack and I am Jill,
or whether it is the other way round, but this is a very good complex
issue. Having served on a Select Committee, I know that it is easy for
Select Committees to offer headline
solutions.</p><p><a name="06061332000234"><b><a name="06061332000465">Mr.

Rubbish!</p><p><a name="06061332000235"><b><a name="06061332000466">Mr.
Ingram:</b> The hon. Gentleman is critical, but I should be
grateful if he allowed me to express my view. It is easy to provide
headlines and expect someone else to deliver, which is exactly what the
Select Committee recommended. It was a helpful recommendation, and I do
not wish to diminish it. The first piece of legislation that I steered
through the House as a Northern Ireland Minister dealt with the reform
of the Royal Ulster Constabulary, and one of the main issues that it
addressed was the need to put in place an ombudsman to deal with police
complaints. It took us a long time to achieve agreement, as my hon.
Friend will accept, but it was not a case of pushing water uphill. It
was a case of getting the best definition because it had to stand the
test of time.</p><p><a name="06061332000236">We are
fortunate that we have the Armed ForcesBill, which allows
proper scrutiny through the parliamentary process, rather than a
prescriptive definition, top and bottom, by a Minister, albeit a
Minister such as I, who has a great deal of detailed knowledge of the
subject. I am prepared to set out the very broad but very specific
parameters of what we are seeking to do with the new position, and I
want to hear what is said and whether we have gone far enough once we
define it in the
Bill.</p><p><a name="06061332000237">I can think of
no better way of arriving at the best conclusion than having that whole
debate in the open, rather than by ministerial edict. As regards being
prescriptive, my hon. Friend said what should not happen. I am not
responding to that, because I want to hear the arguments for and
against. We have time to do it. We can do it through a form of
legislation. We have the vehicle for that, fortuitously. I know that my
hon. Friend will continue to participate in that
debate.</p><p><a name="06061332000238"><b><a name="06061332000467">Mike
Penning (Hemel Hempstead) (Con):</b> I am sure the Minister
will agree that we need fair, robust and disciplined training for our
armed forces. When I went through basic training as a 16-year-old
soldier, one thing that we had then which we do not have now to address
the myriad problems that young people have was trained soldiers in the
barrack rooms with us throughout our basic training. When I recently
visited the training regiment at Pirbright, several times while I 
<br><notus-date day="13" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>13 Jun 2006 : Column 649</b><br>was there the question was, &#147;Would you like to have training
soldiers in the rooms with you?&#148; and the answer was,
&#147;Yes, we would&#148;, because it addresses the camaraderie and
the training that they needed. Will the Minister consider that? He
mentioned that we would debate the Armed Forces Bill when it returns
from the other place. Can he confirm that we will have an opportunity
to debate it in the
House?</p><p><a name="06061332000239"><b><a name="06061332000468">Mr.

when or whether the Bill would come back to the

not the master of that. The fact that the Bill is to be amended means
that it will have to come back. I will not go into parliamentary
procedure, but I am sure the hon. Gentleman will find an opportunity to
say what he wants to say about the
detail.</p><p><a name="06061332000242">On the subject
of trained soldiers alongside recruits, is that desirable? Does it
raise accommodation issues? I prefer to hear what those who are expert
in the matter say, rather than expressing the ministerial position. It
could be a sensible proposition. The hon. Gentleman said it helped him,
but maybe he needed a lot of
help.</p><p><a name="06061332000243"><b><a name="06061332000471">Mike

required. Is there a benefit? Possibly. How many would need to be
available to deliver it? The instructors are trained soldiers, as we

question of a Minister, he must get a reply, just as in the Army, when
the sergeant starts speaking, he has to
listen.</p><p><a name="06061332000247"><b><a name="06061332000475">Mr.

aims that we seek to achieve with thenew accommodation blocks
is a better spirit of camaraderie. One of the failings of single living
accommodation was that it allowed individuals, trained or untrained, to
live in an isolated room of their own. We have therefore reconstructed
our approach so that there is now a common area and more integration.
We need trained personnel close to all of that, but&#151;at the risk
of contradicting my earlier comment that it would be wrong of a
Minister to try and impose a solution&#151;it would have to be with a
light touch, not a heavy touch. It must be carefully managed so that
people grow and are not dragged up. People should grow naturally with
best example, not forced example.</p><br><notus-date day="13" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>13 Jun 2006 : Column 650</b><br><p><a name="06061332000249"><b><a name="06061332000476">Meg

the record that I have not received a response to my letter to Surrey
police in two and a half months and that none of the families&#151;I
represent the Gray family&#151;has received anything. Can anything be
done to pursue that matter? On recommendation 31, I fully endorse the
comments by my right hon. Friend the Minister and wonder what
conversations he has had with the Department for Constitutional
Affairs. On recommendation 26, has he had any contact with the Canadian
forces about their experiment with an ombudsman, which has been highly
successful and did not involve anyone with a military background? I
welcome the steps in response to recommendation 26, but I wonder what
further progress will be

relevant Minister. It is a matter of regret that the families have not
received a response, and I will see what more I can do in that
particular area. On the experience of others, whether it involves
Canadians, Australians or the Dutch, we have examined how we can best
deliver our objectives. I have not had a discussion with the Canadian
forces, but I have examined what is possible in terms of structure and
therefore output.</p><p><a name="06061332000255">The
window has been left slightly open because of the Armed Forces Bill. We
have defined the broad parameters of what we are seeking to do, and our

If, however, other examples are brought into play during the process of
consideration, then we must consider them and respond according to the
normal democratic processes. There is no doubt in my mind that the
debate in the other place on that issue will be
intense.</p><p><a name="06061332000256"><b><a name="06061332000482">Lembit
&#214;pik (Montgomeryshire) (LD):</b> Nicholas Blake clearly
stated that if the Government refuse to establish an independent
commissioner of military complaints, then he would call for a full,
independent public inquiry into the Deepcut deaths. Is it not obvious
that the Government have refused that specific recommendation and that
years of co-operation and patience on the part of the parents have been
paid back with secrecy and defensiveness by the authorities and a 
<br><notus-date day="13" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>13 Jun 2006 : Column 651</b><br>process that actually refers complaints back into the chain of command
for action? Does the Minister recognise that he has left us no option
but to force a full independent public inquiry, presumably with
Nicholas Blake&#146;s support, without which the parents will receive
few answers, little disclosure, no commissioner and no
justice?</p><p><a name="06061332000257"><b><a name="06061332000483">Mr.

this matter, but a big gap has appeared, which I regret. Nicholas Blake
did not make that point in his report and did not make it a condition,
and only he can comment on whether he is satisfied or otherwise with
our recommendations. Rather than jumping to the conclusion that Mr.
Blake is not satisfied, the hon. Gentleman should wait to hear what, if
anything,Mr. Blake says. I do not accept that there has been
secrecy and defensiveness. I do not know how many statements I have
made to the House or how much more transparency is required. Our
actions have been extensive, and I think that we have gone a
considerable way to meeting what the hon. Gentleman wants. The point
underlying the hon. Gentleman&#146;s argument is that the chain of
command should be stripped of
responsibility.</p><p><a name="06061332000258"><b><a name="06061332000484">Lembit

Ingram:</b> I am trying to interpret what the hon. Gentleman
has said in the same way in which he interpreted what Mr. Blake has
said. If he is saying that putting the complaint back to the chain of
command somehow undermines the quality of the decision-making process,
I disagree fundamentally, and I will tell him why. The chain of command
has to ensure proper discipline and structure in the organisation for
which it is responsible. We cannot allow that to be transferred to
someone else, even someone with a military background. We have rejected
Mr. Blake&#146;s recommendation that someone with a civilian
background should try to determine the right to go to legal process,
because there is nowhere in our civil processes where that would
apply.</p><p><a name="06061332000260">This matter
has been given very careful consideration. I uphold the primacy of the
chain of command. I recognise that it has made mistakes in the past and
will do so in the future. It is not perfect, but that is not for the
want of professionalism, commitment and a determination to deliver what
is best. The hon. Gentleman&#146;s judgment should be based on how
many recruits go through that training environment year upon year. It
is not a broken regime. If anything, it is an exemplar for the rest of
the public service, and it passes muster with anything
internationally.</p><p><a name="06061332000261"><b><a name="06061332000486">Mr.
Crispin Blunt (Reigate) (Con):</b> Following Deepcut and,
perhaps more importantly, the growing separation between the military
and the rest of society and the enormous operational commitment now
undertaken by the armed forces, the challenge faced by the training
establishment in producing the world-class soldiers referred to by my
hon. Friend the Member for Woodspring (Dr. Fox) grows all the time.
Does the Minister accept not only that the Army must put its best
officers and NCOs into the training establishment, 
<br><notus-date day="13" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>13 Jun 2006 : Column 652</b><br>but that the Government must support investment in the training
establishment&#151;preferably with money from the Treasury, but if
that is not available, from the balance of resources that he presides
over? The training establishment will have to get more resources,
perhaps at the expense of the equipment programme or other areas,
because people who are making the change from ordinary members of
society into world-class soldiers must have the necessary investment
now and a growing scale of investment in
future.</p><p><a name="06061332000262"><b><a name="06061332000487">Mr.
Ingram:</b> If I did not know that before, I certainly know it
now, not only because of what the hon. Gentleman has said but because
of the learning process that I have had to go through over the past
five years in dealing with this issue. That is why more resources have
been put into the training environment and why we corrected the
decision made in past years. I am not making an adverse comment, but
merely saying that a decision was taken that had to be reversed because
it had not produced the right results, and we therefore had to find a
new way of doing it.</p><p><a name="06061332000263">We are
instituting the &#147;train the trainer&#148; environment and
opening up a new school for all instructors because, as the hon.
Gentleman will know, the best soldier is not necessarily the best
instructor and the best officer isnot necessarily the best
person to run a training establishment. It is a question of finding the
right people for the right roles. If someone needs to make up a
deficiency in their knowledge base, that is what their training process
will entail. It will lift their skills and knowledge and the subtleties
that they have to apply in dealing with young people, and sometimes
not-so-young people, as they put them through that training
environment. I would argue that we have very high-quality training,
although I know that the hon. Gentleman is not saying anything
different. I agree, however, that we have to make it even better
because of the demands that are now placed upon our service
personnel.</p><p><a name="06061332000264"><b><a name="06061332000488">Mark
Pritchard (The Wrekin) (Con):</b> The
introduction of the service complaints commissioner provides a new
process by which people can make complaints, but it isa formal
process which some recruits might find intimidating. Does the Minister
agree that the Army chaplaincy plays a valuable role as regards
complaints within the armed services? Is he aware that currently the
Territorial Army is 26 undermanned as far as chaplains are concerned
and that the regular Army is looking for 16 extra chaplains? What will
he do to address that important issue?</p><p><a name="06061332000265"><b><a name="06061332000489">Mr.
Ingram:</b> I agree with what the hon. Gentleman says. Others
should listen to the way in which the argument was presented. If the
process that we are considering has to be triggered, that almost
constitutes a failure because it means that all the other duty of care
mechanisms that we have put in place will somehow not have picked up
the problem. That is why we are investing so heavily not only in the
chaplaincy but in all the other informal and formal structures so that
people know that anonymous health lines are available, that they can go
to Samaritans, the Womens Royal Voluntary Service and a range of
contact points.</p><br><notus-date day="13" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>13 Jun 2006 : Column 653</b><br><p><a name="06061332000266">The other important
aspect is that all our instructors will be better trained to pick up
the noises off. If there is a problem, they should tackle it quickly.
If anything goes to the commissioner, that is, in a sense, a failure,
assuming that the case is proven. It may not be&#151;a case could be
anecdotal or not add up to anything. However, we need the protective
mechanism so that, if people feel that nobody has been listening to
them&#151;that has been part of the complaint in the past&#151;that
final recourse is available. It could end up on a Minister&#146;s
desk. The process is therefore well rounded but it has to succeed at
the bottom, not at the top. If it does not succeed at the bottom, we
have a problem. I do not believe that we have a problem; we have issues
to which we must attend, and we are doing that.</p><p><a name="06061332000267">I cannot provide a
specific answer on the chaplaincy&#151;we do not have the power to
dragoon members of the churches or of other faiths into uniform.
However, I appreciate that it is an important part of what we do and I
hope that the churches and other faith groups are examining how best
they can help
us.</p><h4 align="center" style="text-transform:uppercase"><a name="06061332000009">bill

Bercow (Buckingham) (Con):</b> I beg to

given to bring in a Bill to require that statements by local
authorities relating to special educational needs are issued
independently of decisions about the funding of facilities and services
arising from such
needs.</p></ul><p><a name="06061332000270">In that
context, I declare an interest as the father of a
two-and-a-half-year-old boy who will almost certainly have special
educational needs.</p><p><a name="06061332000271">Interest in special educational
needs in the House since the general election has been reflected in no
fewer than 93 written and oral parliamentary questions. In addition,
although there has been no debate on the subject in Government time,
three debates have been held on the issue, notably those initiated by
my right hon. Friend the Member for Witney (Mr. Cameron) on 22 June
last year in Opposition time, my hon. Friend the Member for
Mid-Bedfordshire (Mrs. Dorries) on 29 November and the hon. Member for
Warrington, North (Helen Jones) on 7 March, whose debate covered
Asperger&#146;s syndrome in her
constituency.</p><p><a name="06061332000272">What are
the central facts about special educational needs? There are currently
1,230,800 children with special educational needs, but without a
statement, in this country. In addition, 242,600 children have special
educational needs and a statement. Of course, the needs vary greatly.
They can result from learning difficulties, sensory impairments or
physical disabilities. It is important to understand that they can be
moderate and one dimensional. However, they can also be severe, complex
and multifaceted. We can be fairly sure of one fact in that
labyrinthine field: there is no evidence to suggest that any reduction
in the number of children with special educational needs is likely
soon. Indeed, the evidence points overwhelmingly in the opposite
direction. A continuing increase in the number of children with special
educational needs is expected.</p><p><a name="06061332000273">It is therefore noteworthy and
a source of concern that, as a result of direct Government
encouragement, the number of new statements of special educational
needs is in marked decline. In 1998, 35,650 new statements were issued;
by 2004, the figure had fallen to 26,000. It is important for all right
hon. and hon. Members to reflect and to come to a view on the
statementing process.</p><p><a name="06061332000274">I want to make a number of
observations that seem to be fair-minded and relevant. First, a great
many parents regard a statement as a lever that they can pull, a source
of comfort or a guarantee of assistance. I do not sniff at that; it is
extremely important. However, large numbers of them are simultaneously
gravely concerned by the weaknesses in the existing statementing
process. To put it simply, the process is too bureaucratic, too
adversarial, too time consuming, too expensive and, all too often, too
vague. As a consequence of those failings in the system, too many
children wait too long, are promised too little and receive even
less.</p><p><a name="06061332000275">We can observe
the evidence recently produced in a serious study by the National
Autistic Society. It conducted a survey that showed that 31 per cent.
of children, according to their parents, are not getting the 
<br><notus-date day="13" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>13 Jun 2006 : Column 655</b><br>help that has been promised in their statement, and that only 55 per
cent. of children are receiving the speech and language therapy that
their statement stipulates that they should receive. In the light of
those statistics, it is perhaps unsurprising that 79 per cent. of the
parents who appeal, in protest against that lamentable state of
affairs, to the special educational needs and disability
tribunal&#151;SENDIST&#151;are successful in their
appeals.</p><p><a name="06061332000276">This is a
serious situation. People have to wait a long time and are often
promised less than they think is their due. They then find that they
are not even to be given what they have belatedly and inadequately been
promised. It is incredibly difficult even to enforce the entitlement
that they have, in a very delayed fashion, been given. These are
serious concerns.</p><p><a name="06061332000277">The
second concern involves SENDIST itself. Thousands of parents appeal
every year. They do so because they have been denied a statutory
assessment of their child, or because they have been denied the issue
of a statement for their child. They appeal because there is an
insufficiency of specific support in their child&#146;s statement, or
because they have been denied their preference of a school for their
child.</p><p><a name="06061332000278">Significantly,
increasingly and ominously, however, there is evidence of difference in
success at the tribunals, depending on socio-economic status. To put it
bluntly, someone who is educated, articulate and relatively
deep-pocketed will do well at a tribunal because they make their
appeal, they hire the solicitors, they secure the specialist reports
and they fight the system. Those people are successful. However, people
who are uneducated, inarticulate and have no money are less likely to
go to a tribunal. If they do, they are less likely to succeed, because
they are less likely to be able to afford or secure the specialist
services that are often a prerequisite of success. They will fail. They
will lose.</p><p><a name="06061332000279">The time
has come to change the system, and I would like to make a number of
specific suggestions in the context of adopting a new approach. First,
we should dispense with statements and replace them with special needs
profiles. The responsibility for crafting such profiles would fall to
accredited assessors from the educational psychology profession. They
would decide on the level of support that should be provided to the
child, choosing from a number of tiers.</p><p><a name="06061332000280">Secondly, we need to establish
a national funding agency separate from and independent of the
arrangements outlined in my first proposal. The 
<br><notus-date day="13" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>13 Jun 2006 : Column 656</b><br>necessary payment would come from that funding agency, and it would go
with the parent, on behalf of the pupil, travelling with him or her to
the institution that he or she attends.</p><p><a name="06061332000281">My third proposal is that we
establish a special educational needs standing commission. Its role
would be to accredit the assessors, to hear appeals and to offer
advice&#151;in the light of emerging practice and policy&#151;to
the national funding agency about requirements and needs and the
increase in public expenditure necessary to meet them.</p><p><a name="06061332000282">My central thesis is that that
would be a real advantage over the present system, which is weak
because local education authorities assess and decide, pay and provide.
For the most part, they are in control of the whole process, and we
need to make it a great deal more independent. We need to make it
quicker and fairer&#151;independent of the Government, independent of
local authorities and independent of the sources of supply. That,
surely, makes sense.</p><p><a name="06061332000283">I do not decry the very real
efforts made in the field of special educational needs. It is a complex
area, in which there is always a danger of generalisation. There is
good practice, bad practice and indifferent practice. Every child is
unique; each case is different; but there are serious weaknesses. I
politely suggest to the Government that a real problem is now emerging:
the desire to cut costs and the elevation of the useful tool of
inclusion into some sort of dogmatic edict in every particular, which
is grossly damaging and needs to be changed. We are talking not about
guinea pigs in some giant experiment of starry-eyed social engineering,
but about children who need help, more help and better help, and who
need it now. My Bill will help to provide it, so I commend it with
enthusiasm to the House.</p><p><a name="06061332000284"><i> Question put and agreed

amendment was tabled by the Government to correct a minor drafting

well as not achieving the policy intention of including mothers as well

sense, as the definition of employer cannot include employees. It is
clear that that was a minor drafting error made during the construction

8.</p><p><a name="06061345000013">Lords amendment No.
7 was tabled by Lord Elder and built upon by the Government. Taken
together, the series of Lords amendments are designed to enhance the
security of postal voting by establishing a scheme that provides for
the use of identifiers by postal voters at elections. The amendments
had support from all sides in the other place. They provide for the
collection of personal identifiers from persons applying to vote by
post or proxy. Postal and proxy vote applicants will be required to
provide their date of birth and signature on application forms. The
amendments provide for the retention of identifiers by electoral
registration officers and set out the purposes for which they may be
used.</p><p><a name="06061345000014">At elections,
postal voters will be required to provide their signature and date of
birth on the postal voting statement that they must complete and return
with their postal vote ballot paper. All postal voters, including proxy
postal voters, will be subject to that requirement. A postal ballot
paper will not be deemed valid if the postal voting statement does not
include both a signature and a date of birth. Furthermore, returning
officers will be required to take steps to verify the signature and
date of birth on that statement, which will involve checking that the
identifiers 
<br><notus-date day="13" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>13 Jun 2006 : Column 661</b><br>provided on the postal voting statement correspond with those previously
provided on the postal vote application. If they do not correspond, the
ballot paper will be rejected. The detailed arrangements for checking
postal voting statements will be set out in regulations. Under the
amendments, there will be no change to the current voter registration
arrangements. The amendments therefore remove from the Bill the
provisions that would have allowed personal identifiers to be piloted
and rolled out as part of the voter registration system.</p><p><a name="06061345000015">On Lords amendment No. 8, we
have said previously that we accept the principle behind individual
registration. We have also accepted the practical value that the use of
personal identifiers might have in combating fraud. However, it is also
an important principle that everyone who is entitled to register to
vote is registered. Under-registration disfranchises individuals and
skews the map of political representation. Northern Ireland is often
cited on both sides of the debate. The main Opposition party has
frequently called for us to introduce into Great Britain the tried and
tested system of individual registration. Individual registration in
Northern Ireland has had some benefits, especially for the perceived
security of the process, but it is not true that the experience in
Northern Ireland is an argument for that system to be extended to the
rest of the United Kingdom.</p><p><a name="06061345000016">When individual registration
was first introduced in Northern Ireland, 120,000 entries dropped off
the register&#151;a decrease of some 10 per cent. in those on the
register. The 1,192,136 entries in August 2002 had decreased to
1,072,425 by December of that year. At the next canvass, the total
number of entries fell slightly further to 1,069,160. The Government
have taken steps to address that decline, first by reintroducing a
period of one year&#146;s grace before entries are removed from the
register, and secondly by introducing new primary
legislation.</p><p><a name="06061345000017"><b><a name="06061345000718">Mr.
Oliver Heald (North-East Hertfordshire) (Con):</b> If the hon.
Lady went to Northern Ireland and talked the matter through with its
electoral registration officer, she would find that, as she says, there
was a dip. However, as a result of active canvassing, within a matter
of months, 92 per cent. of those on the census were registered to vote
in Northern Ireland, which was described by the Northern Ireland Office
at the time as an outstanding success. How can she try to wriggle out
of what is the obvious solution?</p><p><a name="06061345000018"><b><a name="06061345000719">Bridget
Prentice:</b> The rigorous canvassing did increase
registration, which had suffered an extreme dip, but has not increased
it to anything near the original figure of 1,190,000. As I said, new
primary legislation has been required to try to rectify some of those
issues. Therefore, we believe that individual registration is not yet
ready to be extended to the rest of the United
Kingdom.</p><p><a name="06061345000019"><b><a name="06061345000720">Chris

canvassing of new people who should be on the register, registration
could be as high as 110 per cent.</p><p><a name="06061345000024"><b><a name="06061345000725">Bridget
Prentice:</b> As I think the hon. Gentleman knows, although
that is an amusing suggestion, we shall not be implementing it. We have
included a variety of processes for the canvass. Electoral registration
officers can take a number of strong measures to ensure that the
register is accurate, ensuring that those who should not be on the
register are not on it and that those who should be on it
are.</p><p><a name="06061345000025"><b><a name="06061345000726">Philip

the Northern Ireland example. Weare also concerned about the
drafting of Lords amendment No. 8. It makes several references to the
role to be played by the Chief Electoral Officer. Outside Northern
Ireland, there is no such officer; the role is played by local
electoral registration officers. That would create a serious flaw in
the operation of the proposed scheme.</p><br><notus-date day="13" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>13 Jun 2006 : Column 663</b><br><p><a name="06061345000028">Individual registration has
potential benefits forthe security of postal voting,
particularly through the collection of personal identifiers such as
signature and date of birth. That is why we included it in the Bill. We
wanted to test the use of personal identifiers. Because the provisions
have not yet gained the confidenceof Parliament, we have
adopted the alternative compromise proposed by my noble Friend Lord
Elder. As I have explained, the proposal targets the use of personal
identifiers primarily at postal voting. It meets the security concerns
about postal ballots, and deals with concerns about the impact of
personal registration on the number of people registered to
vote.</p><p><a name="06061345000029"><b><a name="06061345000728">David
Taylor (North-West Leicestershire) (Lab/Co-op):</b> In the
interests of absolute clarity, is the Government&#146;s reason for
resisting the Lords amendment based solely on the perceived likely
reduction in the level of registration? If it can be demonstrated that
individual registration is far and away the best means of protecting
against fraud, will the Government reconsider whether there are
alternatives for tackling the slightly lower levels of registration
that might
result?</p><h5 align="left"><a name="06061345000707">5

Prentice:</b> I said at the outset that, in principle, we
accept individual registration; we do not have a principled objection
to it. However, it is clear that there are two issues that should be
considered, the first of which is that the term of punishment for any
offence relating to false registration will be increased from six
months to 51 weeks. Some 3 million people are not on the register who
should be on it, and if there were a 10 per cent. drop in registration
in Great Britain, that would add another 4 million people to that
figure. A register that has up to 7.5 per cent. of its eligible
electors missing does not make a good register.

number of important changes to the way in which registration and
elections will be run and the Government are confident that they will
meet our objectives. However, we will keep the impact of this

Heald:</b> We in this House must do everything that we can to
tackle electoral fraud. Faith in our democratic process has been
undermined by recent allegations. A judge has said that our system is
wide open to fraud and similar to that of a &#147;banana
republic&#148;. Only last week, election results in Coventry were
questioned when it was found that people who were in Pakistan on the
day of the vote somehow managed to vote in person at the polling
station. I understand that there are currently no fewer than eight
petitions in the High Court alleging electoral fraud in the recent
local elections.</p><br><notus-date day="13" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>13 Jun 2006 : Column 664</b><br><p><a name="06061345000034">Parliament cannot ignore this
problem, especially as we have always taken great pride in our
democracy. We used to lecture the world about parliamentary democracy;
now, we are in the dock, accused of complacency. Our system is
criticised not only by the Electoral Commission&#151;that is an
important fact&#151;and by judges; it was also criticised by
international election observers at the last general election,
including those from Ukraine and Serbia. A few years ago, we would not
have expected to have to take lectures from such countries about our
system. That says a lot about how our stock has
fallen.</p><p><a name="06061345000035"><b><a name="06061345000731">Bob
Spink (Castle Point) (Con):</b> My hon. Friend mentioned that
there are eight outstanding electoral petitions. Does he accept that,
if the hurdle to tabling electoral petitions was not set so high in
financial terms and in other ways, there would be many more of them? A
number of petitions that barristers said would certainly have succeeded
have not gone forward because of those financial and other barriers.
The House should act to remove
them.</p><p><a name="06061345000036"><b><a name="06061345000732">Mr.
Heald:</b> It is an expensive, time-consuming and difficult
process, and that there are as many as eight petitions says something,
because that is a substantial number.</p><p><a name="06061345000037">Every authority that has
examined this question has called for individual voter registration and
personal identifiers. I strongly support Lords amendment No. 8, and I
pay tribute to my noble Friend Baroness Hanham. The amendment simply
requires a signature and a date of birth for everyone going on to the
voting register. I am disappointed that the Government continue to drag
their feet on this issue. I have always said that I prefer the system
used in Northern Ireland, where national insurance numbers are used to
verify registration. That is an excellent example to follow and the
Government have crowed about that system asan outstanding
success story. A consensus must be reached, and it could be reached
around Lords amendment No.
8.</p><p><a name="06061345000038">The Government have
already accepted that voters who apply for postal votes should have to
give their date of birth and signature. That was a welcome concession,
made in Lords amendment No. 7. However, if that is all right for postal
votes, why cannot it be done more generally? Given that it is already
accepted that two forms of identification are required for a postal
ballot, why is not that an acceptable approach that could be used for
identifying voters more widely? The amendment would require a signature
and date of birth to be included in all voters&#146; registration and
not only in that of postal voters. I would still like to see national
insurance numbers added as a personal identifier for voter
registration&#151;indeed, I have argued myself into the ground about
it&#151;but in the interests of trying to achieve a consensus, I am
prepared to leave it until another opportunity arises to get it on the
statute book. I hope that that will not be as a result of another
scandal of the sort that we have seen in recent months. We have to
secure personal identifiers for voter registration
generally.</p><p><a name="06061345000039">Hon.
Members will be aware of the Electoral Commission&#146;s campaign for
individual voter registration and personal identifiers. From the
outset 
<br><notus-date day="13" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>13 Jun 2006 : Column 665</b><br>of proceedings on the Bill, it has called for personal identifiers. The
Government have gone some way toward that, and we all welcome Lords
amendment No. 7. However, in the commission&#146;s briefing for this
debate it
says:</p><a name="06061345000703"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;The
Commission is delighted that the House of Lords has voted to accept an
amendment tabled by Baroness Hanham requiring applicants to provide
signatures and dates of birth when registering to
vote.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06061345000040">The amendment
introducing personal identifiers for postal voting was introduced by
the Lord Elder, a Labour peer, and it had the support of my noble
Friend Baroness Hanham and Lord Rennard, so we managed to reach
agreement across the parties, which all&#151;apart from
Labour&#151;wanted to make further progress. The recent alleged fraud
in Coventry was the background to the debate in the other place and
spurred them on. They did not want to see such things happening again.
The Coventry example is just one in a long line of cases where identity
has allegedly been impersonated at the polling station. The use of
personal identifiers would go a long way towards protecting individuals
from that kind of
fraud.</p><p><a name="06061345000041">The Minister in
the other place spoke in support of the principle time and time again.
In Committee, she
stated:</p><a name="06061345000704"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;collecting
personal identifiers has the potential to improve security and
integrity in the electoral process&#148;.&#151;[<i> Official Report,
House of Lords,</i> 16 March 2006; Vol. 679, c.
GC593.]</p></ul><p><a name="06061345000042">At that stage she also
expressed her strong views about making sure that forms requesting
information from people should be simple and
straightforward.</p><p><a name="06061345000043">Schedule
1 requires voters to sign for their ballot paper at the polling
station. The amendment would therefore introduce a useful check against
fraud. Those registering to vote would provide a signature that would
go on the register, which would then provide a check of whether the
person signing for the vote was the same person who had registered. In
circumstances such as those that allegedly occurred in Coventry, that
would be extremely useful. I do not see how the provision of a
signature at the polling station will be much use if there is no
register of the original signature in the first place. What is more,
our amendment would save voters the worry of finding a legitimate
counterfoil to prove their signature in any fraud
investigation.</p><p><a name="06061345000044">There
can be few legal forms that entitle one to do something, but do not
involve a signature and the provision of simple details, such as date
of birth. It is suggested by some that it would be so difficult that it
would put people off registering to vote. However, those of us who take
a close interest in these matters know that people fill in forms for
almost every activity in life and that they almost always have to sign
their name and give their date of birth. How difficult is it for people
to sign their names? That question shows how pathetic it is that this
important change is not being made by all-party agreement.</p><p><a name="06061345000045">During the Bill&#146;s
passage through the House, the Government accepted that a
person&#146;s signature and date of birth should be used for postal
voting, so how can it be said that the same requirement is too hard to
be used elsewhere? My voter registration form from the London borough
of Lambeth says that any change of 
<br><notus-date day="13" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>13 Jun 2006 : Column 666</b><br>details must be backed up by a signature and a date of birth. Lord
Rennard made the same point in the other place, but Lambeth is an
example of a Labour council already doing something that I am calling
for.</p><p><a name="06061345000046"><b><a name="06061345000733">Chris
Ruane:</b> Under the current system, people do not have to
give their signature. Last September&#146;s Electoral Commission
report on under-registration found that between 4 million and 4.5
million people were not registered to vote. Any requirement to supply a
signature and therefore make filling in the form more difficult would
cause the under-registration figure to increase to 5 million
people.</p><p><a name="06061345000047"><b><a name="06061345000734">Mr.
Heald:</b> I do not see why the hon. Gentleman should think
that that would happen. For how many things in life are people required
to sign their names? The answer is that they have to do so for almost
anything. People have learned how to sign their names, even under the
Labour education system. Even under Labour, they know when they were
born. It is not too much to ask for such simple
information.</p><p><a name="06061345000048">Personally,
I do not think that there is much harm in asking for a national
insurance number, but I have given way on that because I want to
achieve consensus. What the hon. Member for Vale of Clwyd (Chris Ruane)
said is old-fashioned. Not only does he clearly believe in the
patrician system, with the head of the household filling in the form
for everyone else, but he fails to realise what the real problem is.
What happens when a registration form goes out to a flat or a house in
multiple occupation? The person whose name appears on the form may well
throw it in the bin. What happens if it goes to a father who thinks
that the women in the house should not vote? The form may not even have
those women listed.</p><p><a name="06061345000049">The range of possibilities is
wide because the current process works against the grain of modern
society. People see themselves as individuals with rights. It is true
that our society is consumerist in its thinking, but people do not
believe that the head of a household should organise how that
household&#146;s members should vote. This is the 21st century, when
we believe in one person, one
vote.</p><p><a name="06061345000050">It is about time
that the hon. Member for Vale of Clwyd came up to date. Individual
voter registration is proposed by the Electoral Commission, the body of
independent experts set up by his Labour Government to advise on this
very matter. Yet the Government have such utter contempt for its
recommendations that they say that they are going to pick and choose
between them. What a
disgrace.</p><p><a name="06061345000051"><b><a name="06061345000735">Chris
Ruane:</b> At present, between 4 million and4.5
million people are not registered to vote. Last September&#146;s
report from the Electoral Commission found that, in the main, they were
unemployed, on low pay and living in council or social housing. They
also included a lot of young people and people from the black and
ethnic minorities. Is the hon. Gentleman so unconcerned about
under-registration simply because people from those groups do not vote
Conservative?If they lived in Acacia gardens as opposed to
Corporation close, would he pay more attention to
under-registration?</p><br><notus-date day="13" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>13 Jun 2006 : Column 667</b><br><p><a name="06061345000052"><b><a name="06061345000736">Mr.
Heald:</b> I am worried that the hon. Gentleman is letting his
blind political prejudices get in the way of the obvious facts. People
are not obliged to vote in our society if they do not want to, but
getting them to register to vote requires a lot of hard work. People
need to go out and canvass those homes, door to door. We used to do
that in the old days, but we have made cutbacks and stopped doing that.
That is what is needed&#151;active campaigning to get people to
register to vote.</p><p><a name="06061345000053">We
need to bear it in mind that people live in households as individuals
and not necessarily with a<i> &#151;[</i><i> Interruption.</i><i> ]</i>
The hon. Member for Vale of Clwyd is harking back to a patrician world
where the head of the household&#151;the father of the
family&#151;filled the form in for everyone. The world is not like
that any more. He needs to get up to
date.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="06061345000708">5.15

Clive Betts (Sheffield, Attercliffe) (Lab):</b> The hon.
Gentleman talks about campaigning to get people to register, but his
political party did not deliver a single leaflet in my constituency
during the local elections. Does he accept that a large percentage of
the 4 million to 4.5 million people who are not registered are young
people? It is an interesting fact that, among young people, the rate of
registration decreases as they enter their 20s, primarily because when
they live at home the head of the household registers them, whereas
when they move out they tend not to register. There is a real problem
and until we sort it out, the effect of his amendment&#151;although I
have some sympathy with it in principle&#151;will be to increase
under-registration among young people.</p><p><a name="06061345000055"><b><a name="06061345000738">Mr.
Heald:</b> The hon. Gentleman misunderstandsmy point.
I was not talking about political parties canvassing, although I think
that that is vital to our system. I was talking about council
officers&#151;the electoral registration officer and his
team&#151;canvassing door to door to encourage registration. He might
not have come across that, but it used to happen: large numbers of
people were employed to go out and canvass for registration. I did it
myself before becoming politically
active.</p><p><a name="06061345000056">As for the
hon. Gentleman&#146;s other point, part of the reason why people
living in student accommodation and others in that age group do not
register is that we&#151;or the Government&#151;stubbornly, or
perhaps blindly, insist that the head of the household should be
responsible for registration, so the authorities send the form only to
the first person of whom they are aware living at that address. It may
well be that, when the form arrives, it is simply tossed and four of
the five people who are sharing the flat never hear anything about it.
That is a problem that active canvassing&#151;really going after
those people and encouraging registration&#151;could help to solve.
That is why I welcome later amendments in which we insist that
electoral registration officers make a real
effort.</p><p><a name="06061345000057"><b><a name="06061345000739">Mr.

not positively reward people for going on the electoral register? We
could adjust the tax code of people in work, adjust the state pension
of retired 
<br><notus-date day="13" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>13 Jun 2006 : Column 668</b><br>people, or tweak the benefits of people who receive them. We could give
people a lottery ticket for registering. Why can we not do that to
encourage people to
register?</p><p><a name="06061345000058"><b><a name="06061345000740">Mr.
Heald:</b> Perhaps the hon. Gentleman should work out the
details of that suggestion and propose a scheme. We should consider all
reasonable options to encourage people to register to vote. I am not
sure how the lottery ticket idea would work, but incentivising people
to register might be possible.</p><p><a name="06061345000059">We should make a serious effort
to get those who are not currently registered on to the register, but
we should always bear it in mind that it is wrong to deal with matters
such as the size of constituencies based on some back-of-the-envelope
calculation of how many people may be entitled to vote in a certain
area. The registration system must be what we rely on and I would like
it to be much better in our country than it is now. The Government have
accepted a requirement for a signature and date of birth for postal
voting and it seems to me illogical that they will not go the whole
way, especially given that the Bill requires people to sign for their
vote at the polling station.</p><p><a name="06061345000060">Door-to-door canvassing is an
important part of electoral registration practice, and we need to
improve what we do in that respect. I believe that a reason for the
decline in the quality of our electoral registration system over the
past 20 years is that local authorities have cut back in that respect.
Certainly, they have felt squeezed and obliged to deal with other
matters. Local authorities need to be able actively to canvass to
achieve the best possible result. There is a great deal of disquiet
about the potential for electoral fraud. It has grown significantly
over the last few years. The Electoral Commission was set up to give
independent advice on that issue. The House of Lords&#151;the other
place; not the democratic Chamber&#151;has said that this measure is
necessary in the interests of democracy. The Government should not
contemptuously ignore the
Lords.</p><p><a name="06061345000061"><b><a name="06061345000741">Mr.
Gordon Prentice:</b> I agree with an awful lot of that. There
are dozens of MPs in the Commons who have majorities in three figures.
I wonder about the integrity of the ballot and I have done for years. I
think that there is a huge amount of fiddling and cheating going on. I
am disappointed that the Government are resisting Lords amendment No.
8. The Minister drew our attention to some flaws in the amendment:
there is no chief electoral officer in Great Britain, although there is
in Northern Ireland. It is unfortunate that the Lords did not pick up
on that point. I am heartened that she accepts the principle behind
individual voter registration. It is clearly just the practicalities
that the Government are concerned about, not the principle, which she
has conceded. We have an Electoral Commission and its job is to police
the electoral system. If it thinks that there is fraud and malpractice,
it should blow the whistle and the rest of us should stand to attention
when we hear it.</p>

Commission takes a view on the electoral system. As I said a few
moments ago, if it believes that the system needs improving in some
way, it will make recommendations. It made specific recommendations in
the case of individual voter registration. The Government have moved
towards that in part, but not entirely. I was left reflecting on what
the response of the Electoral Commission should be. The Electoral
Commission has been turned over by the Government before, when its
recommendations have been put to one side. My view is that if the
Electoral Commission thinks that this matter is important enough, its
members ought to resign&#151;or Sam Younger ought to resign. That
would make us all pay attention. If members of the Electoral Commission
were to resign en masse, there would not be a dozen or two dozen people
in the Chamber; it would be packed to the gunnels to discuss the
issue.</p><p><a name="06061345000067">The
Government&#146;s position turns on the whole business of increasing
voter turnout. I believe, as I said a few moments ago, that we need to
think laterally about that. I would reward people. There is an
alternative, put forward by our colleague, Lord Kinnock: compulsory
voting. I am not in favour of compulsory voting, but that is one way
forward. I prefer to reward people for going on the electoral register
and to recognise that they are participating in a civic process, which
should be rewarded in some way by the state. That has never been done
here, and a lot of people probably think that the idea is zany and a
bit eccentric. However, we must consider such solutions if we are to
address the point that my friend the Member for Vale of Clwyd (Chris
Ruane) constantly makes about the number of young people and people
from ethnic minorities and other groups who are not represented on the

experiences on this matter, as I do on many other issues. At the time
of the last general election, my Liberal Democrat opponent, Shazad
Anwar, had two sisters and a brother registered at his home in Pendle,
although the election literature referred to only Shazad Anwar and his
wife, Shaista. We checked the electoral registers for Pendle and
next-door Burnley, where Shazad Anwar&#146;s father lived. The same
two sisters and the brother were also registered in Burnley. Exactly
the same thing had happened the year before: two sisters and a brother
were registered at Kibble grove in Brierfield and the same two sisters
and a brother were registered in
Burnley.</p><p><a name="06061345000072">When the

heads of household. It is absolutely absurd in this day and age that we
expect one person who is designated as the head of household to certify
that other people in the house should be on the electoral register. I

exercises the hon. Gentleman, as it exercised the Minister of State and
as it exercises me. There is still something rotten&#151;not
functioning&#151;in the state of electoral registration in Britain
and in the state of our democracy. One option is compulsory
registration. The hon. Member for Pendle (Mr. Prentice) alluded to it,
and it is an argument that people have made. I have resisted it. I do
not agree with it, and nor do my colleagues. However, even that would
not be perfect because we could have compulsory registration in theory,
but not everyone who was meant to register would do so. Let us not
delude ourselves. It would not mean that every person who was entitled
to a vote voted, let alone was registered. In theory, however, we would
get a bigger turnout.</p><p><a name="06061345000084">Part of the reason why
compulsory registration is not a good system is that it conceals the
positive or negative response to the electoral process. Turnout goes up
in close or important elections, and we can see that. If politicians
are not responding to the electorate well, turnout goes down. In the
local elections in our borough of Southwark last month, the turnout
varied from something in the order of 25 per cent. in one ward to more
than 50 per cent. in another. It depends on local
circumstances.</p><p><a name="06061345000085"><b><a name="06061345000753">Chris
Ruane:</b> The hon. Gentleman mentions the local elections
last month. He has an enlightened view on maximising electoral
registration. What would he say to the leading Liberal Democrat on
Islington council who, when asked for his group&#146;s support for an

<br><notus-date day="13" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>13 Jun 2006 : Column 672</b><br>electoral registration drive before those elections, said that it would
not support it and that is how it wins
elections?</p><p><a name="06061345000086"><b><a name="06061345000754">Simon
Hughes:</b> I do not know the quote and would want to check
it, out of loyalty to my friend. If that is what he said, it is not my
view. I am on the record as saying to the Minister of State, across the
Floor of the House, that we need much more effective ways of getting
people on to the list. I will suggest
two.</p><p><a name="06061345000087">I share the view
of the hon. Member for Pendle. There is serious merit in considering
the idea that we might give somebody a discount on their council tax
for being on the electoral register. I take the view, as hon. Members
would expect me to, that we have moved on from the patrician days when
somebody registerson behalf of the household. We need
individual responsibility, with people registering at the age of 18.
However, we need to do many other things to get people on the list.
First, as people cross the threshold into voting age&#151;my party
takes the view that that should be 16, not 18&#151;they should be
automatically registered from the beginning by the institution, college
or school that they attend.</p><p><a name="06061345000088">Secondly, from the moment that
they are on the register, there could be an incentive of a discount on
council tax. It would be small, but worth having, like the vouchers for
computers for schools. Vouchers for small amounts are worth having and
we redeem them. I got some in the paper the other day to give me free
editions of World cup posters, supplements and so on. It is 40p off and
worth having.</p><p><a name="06061345000089">Thirdly, and most importantly,
as I have told Ministers before, the only way in which we can achieve a
significant increase in annual registration is to conduct an annual
campaign. In February, which is usually 28 days long, but is 29 days
long every fourth year, we should count down through newspaper, radio
and television adverts to &#147;democracy day&#148; on 1 March.
During that period, campaigners sign up voters at bus stops, and
outside railway stations, supermarkets, pubs and football grounds in a
huge effort to increase registration. Such a campaign should happen
regularly because, with the best will in the world, canvassers are
never entirely successful in their efforts at registration. When I was
in the Minister&#146;s constituency on the day of the marathon,
canvassers were struggling to find addresses in Blackheath. I remember
canvassing in the Northfield by-election and trying hard to find
addresses&#151;it took me 20 minutes to go round the back of a block
of flats, up a ladder and over a roof before I found Nos. 63 to 92
Bristol road south. It is sometimes difficult to find addresses but,
when one does so, lots of people are not in, as more and more
individuals do not keep conventional hours.</p><p><a name="06061345000090"><b><a name="06061345000755">Chris

encourage people to register is a serious issue. In my constituency,
there is a serious problem of 
<br><notus-date day="13" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>13 Jun 2006 : Column 673</b><br>under-registration. The hon. Member for Vale of Clwyd is right, as is
the Minister of State, that the poor and less well-educated, the young
and people from black and minority ethnic communities are usually
significantly under-represented.</p><p><a name="06061345000093"><b><a name="06061345000757">Mr.

many other seaside towns and inner-city areas. How will a proposal for

obvious example, as are many student towns and cities. Hon. Members may
not be aware of the fact, but every year in my constituency, which is a
couple of miles from the House, a quarter of the electorate move house.
They do not all move out of the
constituency&#151;</p><p><a name="06061345000095"><b><a name="06061345000759">Chris

are not doing so&#151;usually, they want to stay and upgrade. About
25 per cent. of people in my constituency move because they want a
bigger place or choose to live somewhere else. We must therefore make
it easier for them to re-register, and we should not rely on a canvass
officer bumping into them on their doorstep, as that does not usually
happen. The chance of their being in when the officer comes round so
that they can fill in the form is very small
indeed.</p><p><a name="06061345000097"><b><a name="06061345000761">Mr.
Andrew Love (Edmonton) (Lab/Co-op):</b> The hon. Gentleman
appears to be speaking against the proposition that he supports. People
are required to return their electoral registration form, but we do not
implement that requirement, so compulsion is not the answer. However,
to take up the point that he has just made, people who canvass my
constituency, where more than 9,000 people are missing from the
register, say that, for various reasons, it is increasingly difficult
to contact electors. My electoral registration officer says that if
individual voter registration is introduced, it will decimate the
register. Is the hon. Gentleman prepared to accept the fact that the
9,000 people missing from my register will increase to 18,000? I
suspect that the increase will be even higher in his
constituency.</p><p><a name="06061345000098"><b><a name="06061345000762">Simon
Hughes:</b> I am sure the numbers are significant, but by
definition one does not know what they are. Of course I do not want the
number of registered voters reduced. I share the concern about what we
should do, and I have suggested various ways of increasing
registration.</p><p><a name="06061345000099">The
other side of the argument is how we avoid fraud and the abuse of the
system. Every year when I look at my electoral register, I know for a
fact that names are repeated and that the names of people who 
<br><notus-date day="13" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>13 Jun 2006 : Column 674</b><br>have moved or who have died still appear. It is not an up-to-date list
that records the position at the beginning of the electoral year.
Again, that is more often the case in urban than in rural
areas.</p><p><a name="06061345000100">On balance,
the argument should be that people must take, and know that they have
to take, personal responsibility. The starting point should be that
they register either once or annually, and that they register in their
own name. The question is whether the proposal that the Lords have
passed into law and which is included in the Bill will have a
significant downward effect on voting. The fact that the form goes in
with the person&#146;s signature and date of birth substantially
reduces the likelihood of that. If there were no other circumstances,
my judgment is that voting would not be affected much, if at all, for
the reason given bythe hon. Member for North-East
Hertfordshire(Mr. Heald) and
others.</p><p><a name="06061345000101">On any
official form people generally expect to sign their name and, although
I am not in favour of data being collected unnecessarily, often give
their date of birth. For people who have come from the developing world
and may not know their date of birth, it is traditional that they give
as their date of birth 1 January of the year in which they were born.
That convention is generally accepted. There is no problem with people
who do not know their specific date of birth, or who have come as
refugees and do not have their birth
certificates.</p><p><a name="06061345000102">We need
to watch closely what happens. The Northern Ireland experience is
relevant, but not entirely parallel. We are trying to overcome all the
shortcomings and defects with a single piece of legislation. We want a
better campaign to recruit people on to the list. We want to give them
incentives to go on the list. We want to make it easy for young voters
to go on for the first time. We may want to do one other thing, which
is where the difficulty has
arisen.</p><p><a name="06061345000103">At present,
electoral registration officers have the choice whether to keep
somebody on the list at the end of the year or take them off if they
cannot check their eligibility. We need a better system to ensure that
people can confirm that they are where they used to be, without
necessarily having to go through the rigmarole of filling in the form,
signing it and providing their date of birth. Suppose someone is away
when the form arrives. A business man in my constituency, for example,
went to India the other day. He may want to vote, always votes, but was
not at home at the time. He needs an easy way of checking whether he is
on the list. There is a package of things that we need to do, but we
must avoid what most brings the system into disrepute&#151;fraud and
abuse of the
system.</p><p><a name="06061345000104"><b><a name="06061345000763">David
Taylor: </b>The hon. Gentleman said that he supports the
suggestion of my hon. Friend the Member for Pendle (Mr. Prentice) of
worthwhile incentives for people to register, but he will not want to
ignore the significant cost that would be associated with that. Even
the worthwhile sum of, say, &#163;10 per registration would mean
&#163;750,000 in a typical constituency, and&#163;2
million in a London borough containing two and a half constituencies.
Ought that not to be funded centrally, because it is in the national
interest that we have the highest level of registration
possible?</p><br><notus-date day="13" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>13 Jun 2006 : Column 675</b><br><p><a name="06061345000105"><b><a name="06061345000764">Simon

most.</p><p><a name="06061345000106"><b><a name="06061345000765">Mr.

Has he not exposed the problem with individual registration in his
remarks about electoral registration officers and how they deal with
voters who cannot be contacted? He is right to say that some keep them
on and some keep them off. We are entirely dependent on the degree of
registration and participation, and on the commitment of individual
electoral registration officers to the process. Unless the House is
prepared to set minimum standards, that situation will be made even
worse by individual
registration.</p><p><a name="06061345000107"><b><a name="06061345000766">Simon
Hughes:</b> My hon. Friend the Member for Somerton and Frome
has watched the Bill closely from the beginning, and he says that it
will help with that matter. Nobody is pretending that we will get a
perfect system after the Bill is enacted, but a lot of the proposals,
which come from the Electoral Commission, the Speaker&#146;s
Committee on the Electoral Commission and other places, concern that
process.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="06061345000710">5.45
pm</h5><p><a name="06061345000108">We should do
much better in modern Britain, to which the hon. Member for North-East
Hertfordshire has referred. For example, why do we not have lots of
people out on the streets in towns such as Blackpool in February, which
I have been told is the last month in which it is manageable to conduct
such activities in time for a May election? We may not get people to
fill in forms at midnight on a Friday, but it is possible to catch them
at the bus stop on their way to work. We must try very hard by, for
example, visiting FE colleges, guesthouses and businesses. We should
also use technology by asking people for their e-mail addresses in
order to check annually whether we have got their residential addresses
right, which might be more convenient for them.</p><p><a name="06061345000109">We also need to keep the system
under review. After next year&#146;s local elections in England and
the elections in Scotland and Wales, the local elections and London
elections in the following year and the European elections across the
United Kingdom in the year after that&#151;there will probably be a
general election in that period, too&#151;we should be able to see
whether the proposals have had the effect that we all want or whether
we are still failing. If we are still failing, we may need to do other
things, but we should start from the basis that people should have to
start the ball rolling themselves by signing and submitting a
form.</p><p><a name="06061345000110">We need to
agree a convenient system for keeping people on the register. The
process should be led by the customer&#151;the voter&#151;rather
than by bureaucracy.</p><p><a name="06061345000111"><b><a name="06061345000767">Mr.

which the register is more accurate such as Australia and, indeed,
Northern Ireland, it has not proved necessary to re-examine the

register 
<br><notus-date day="13" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>13 Jun 2006 : Column 676</b><br>by using the methods that he has discussed? Data matching is another way
to use technology. A lot of councils have got plenty of information
about the people who are not registered, and data matching across the
council&#146;s information is a useful way to ensure that as many
people as possible are
registered.</p><p><a name="06061345000112"><b><a name="06061345000768">Simon
Hughes:</b> There are some dangers down that road. I am always
nervous about the Big Brother state collecting information for one
purpose before passing it on for another, which is a point that applies
to both central Government and local
government.</p><p><a name="06061345000113"><b><a name="06061345000769">Bob
Spink: </b>The important point concerns avoiding fraud in
order to maintain and rebuild public confidence in our precious
electoral system and democracy. The hon. Gentleman speaks for the
Liberal party, but there is cross-party support for the concept that
all fraud, particularly where it involves a candidate or agent, should
always be investigated by the police and referred to the courts by the
Director of Public Prosecutions. That is the only way in which we can
rebuild confidence in our electoral system in this country, which is
sadly lacking at the
moment.</p><p><a name="06061345000114"><b><a name="06061345000770">Simon
Hughes:</b> That is one area in which zero tolerance is
appropriate. People should know that if they abuse the system by which
we run our democracy, they are at risk of prosecution, conviction and,
potentially, serious and exemplary punishment. If the person involved
is locally elected or holds office inthe community, one would
expect an exemplary punishment to be
imposed.</p><p><a name="06061345000115">There are
currently eight petitions on that point, but that may be the tip of the
iceberg, because it is difficult to launch an electoral petition. I am
sure that there are many other places in which the electoral register
and those who voted did not accurately reflect who turned out on
election
day.</p><p><a name="06061345000116"><b><a name="06061345000771">Mr.
Love:</b> There is as much concern about fraud among Labour
Members as among any other Members, but certain balancing factors must
be taken into account. I want to issue a health warning in relation to
the siren voices that use Australia as a comparison, as it has
compulsory voting. The situation in Northern Ireland is apposite,
because it has a settled population, whereas London does not. If an
equivalent decline in the number of people registered in Northern
Ireland occurred in a non-settled population such as that of London,
that would be
catastrophic.</p><p><a name="06061345000117"><b><a name="06061345000772">Simon
Hughes:</b> As the hon. Gentleman and all of us in urban
constituencies well know, we must be realistic about who is sent out to
do any of these jobs. I am sure he, like me, knows pretty well at what
times the automatic door entry systems open and close, and where to
find every address barring those that have just come on to the
register. If a couple of people are recruited for a month to carry out
the electoral canvass, there is only a small probability of their
knowing where all the entrances are and what is the best time to find
people in, even with the best advice in the world. We need people who
are part of the community and really 
<br><notus-date day="13" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>13 Jun 2006 : Column 677</b><br>know what is going on, even though they may have other jobs at other
times of the year.</p><p><a name="06061345000118">Another group of people who
come into the community with entitlements to vote comprises those who
become citizens. We now have citizenship ceremonies. People who are
Irish, Commonwealth or European Union citizens with the right to vote
here, depending on which kind of election it is, should be given the
forms at that moment. If they are not already on the electoral
register, they should not leave the town hall until they have been
asked to sign up to become part of the electorate. We have to consider
every possible proactive way of ensuring that every adult from all our
communities who is entitled to vote is on the list.</p><p><a name="06061345000119">The Lords amendment is logical.
It has some risks, but those can be compensated for by taking all the
other necessary steps. We have a huge shared duty to ensure that we do
much better than we have in the recent
past.</p><p><a name="06061345000120"><b><a name="06061345000773">Chris
Ruane:</b> I fully agree with my hon. Friend the Member for
Edmonton (Mr. Love) that Labour Members are as concerned as any others
about electoral fraud but we need to get things in perspective. When I
tabled parliamentary questions on the number of cases of electoral
fraud at local and parliamentary level, I was told that there were one
or two a year out of an adult population of 45 million. That is one or
two too many. On the other side of the balance, 4.5 million are
currently not registered to vote. That is without having put in place
any barriers whatsoever&#151;no date of birth, no signature and no
national insurance number. Every additional barrier that one puts in
front of the registration process will result in additional people not
being registered.</p><p><a name="06061345000121"><b><a name="06061345000774">Simon

in Northern Ireland that when barriers were put in place electoral
registration dipped, and then it rose to 92 per

Heald:</b> As the hon. Gentleman knows, the Electoral
Commission looked at this and found that he is completely wrong. In
previous debates, Members from Northern Ireland have explained that the
system was subject to fraud in Northern Ireland and that the effect of
the changes was to clean up the registers. How can he go on, time after
time, saying something that is
incorrect?</p><p><a name="06061345000124"><b><a name="06061345000777">Chris

dipped to a percentage in the low 80s, and after a registration drive
it went up to 92 per cent.</p><p><a name="06061345000125">In the UK, with 4.5 million
people missing from the register, the figure is 92 per cent., so we are
starting from the base that Northern Ireland is currently at. Any
additional barriers put in place will reduce that percentage. In
Northern Ireland, 92 per cent. is an average. In many of the Belfast
seats, which probably include the poorest communities in the whole of
the 
<br><notus-date day="13" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>13 Jun 2006 : Column 678</b><br>UK, registration is at 70 per cent. In my constituency, the poorest
registration area is central Denbigh, at76 per cent. Some
wards in Aberystwyth have 50 per cent. registration. That is completely
unacceptable. We need to get those people on to the register. If we
start to introduce barriers such as signatures, dates of birth and
national insurance numbers, we will keep on adding to the number of
people who are unregistered. We might go from 4.5 million to 7.5
million unregistered people, who will be concentrated in the poorest
communities in the UK. We do not have a fully functioning democracy if
7.5 million of the most dispossessed people are off the
register.</p><p><a name="06061345000126"><b><a name="06061345000778">Mr.
David Heath (Somerton and Frome) (LD):</b> We have already
established that we all want maximum registration, but I am deeply
worried by what Labour Back Benchers are saying. Yesterday, we were
told by a Labour Back Bencher that people on council estates had a
higher propensity to commit crime; now, thehon. Gentleman is
making the deeply patronising assumption that because someone lives in
a deprived area, they cannot sign their name in order to get a vote. I
do not accept for one moment that that is a barrier, and if he insists
that it is, he is basing his entire premise on a
fiction.</p><p><a name="06061345000127"><b><a name="06061345000779">Chris
Ruane:</b> They are not my opinions but those of the Electoral
Commission, which is put on a pedestal by the hon. Gentleman. When it
carried out detailed research on unregistered people&#151;its
findings were reported last September&#151;it found that most
unregistered people are unemployed, low paid, in council housing, black
or ethnic, or young. That matches my experience. When I ask for a
breakdown of the electoral registration percentages in my wards, I find
that the poorest wards are those most affected, and that the poorest
streets in those wards have the greatest under-registration. We need to
get those people back on to the register. It might suit the political
advantage of the Conservatives, or indeed the Liberal Democrats, to
keep 7.5 million people off the electoral
register&#151;</p><p><a name="06061345000128"><b><a name="06061345000780">Mr.

support it&#151;that&#146;s how we win

provides proof. Undoubtedly, people in the most deprived areas are
least liable to register, for a variety of reasons. For instance, they
often move more frequently because they are more likely to live in
houses in multiple occupation. That is a reason to target those areas
for increased registration drives, but to say that such people would be
inhibited by having to provide a signature is deeply patronising and
frankly
incorrect.</p>

century. The Bill is in the great tradition of emancipating people and
getting them on the register. It should be perceived in that way.
</p><p><a name="06061345000134">Some political
parties will not want 4.5 million poorer people on the register because
it is not in their political interest. That is probably why a leading
Liberal Democrat councillor in Islington said what he did. The leader
of such a council is on &#163;50,000 a year and cabinet members are
on &#163;17,000 to &#163;20,000 a year. Is it in their interests to
have 10,000 extra poor people on the register who may not vote Liberal
Democrat or
Conservative&#151;</p><p><a name="06061345000135"><b><a name="06061345000786">David

happens in constituencies, has brought an air of practical,
down-to-earth reality to the implications of the Lords proposal. Does
he agree that, in the areas that he describes as deficient in voter
registration, there has often not been a great push by local electoral
registration officers and that, until we have the minimum standards
that have been mentioned, it would be dangerous to follow a
suck-it-and-see route only to find, too late, that 5 per cent. or 10
per cent. of an already small electorate had been
lost?</p><p><a name="06061345000138"><b><a name="06061345000789">Chris
Ruane:</b> I agree. Local authorities&#146; allocation of
resources needs to be examined carefully. I tabled a parliamentary
question which asked for the amounts of money spent by each local
authority in England on electoral registration to be specified. The
answer stated that the figures are not collected centrally. I asked my
Labour Assembly colleague in Wales to table the same question. The
information is collected centrally in Wales and, of the 22 authorities,
lo and behold, those that spent the most per capita on registration had
the best registration rates and those that spent least had the worst
rates.</p><p><a name="06061345000139">The Bill
allocates an extra &#163;17 million of resources to electoral
registration. I ask the Under-Secretary to consider the matter
carefully, because that extra money has not been ring-fenced but will
be given as part 
<br><notus-date day="13" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>13 Jun 2006 : Column 680</b><br>of a local government settlement. I believe that, if&#163;17
million of a budget of, for example, &#163;120 billion is not
ring-fenced, local authorities, perhaps of a different political
persuasion, that have no interest in electoral registration, could
cream it off. I therefore ask the Under-Secretary to look into that
because registration is not only for local government elections but for
European and parliamentary elections. The money should be
ring-fenced.</p><p><a name="06061345000140">Some
members of political parties throughout the country will try to
preserve their positions&#151;as council leaders, cabinet members and
so on&#151;in a local authority and will not want more poorer people
on the register who may threaten their incomes and livelihoods. We need
to deal with local authorities that are dogmatic about the matter. When
we say, &#147;These are our new standards&#148;, but they say,
&#147;We won&#146;t obey them&#148;, and when we say,
&#147;Here is the money&#148;, but they say, &#147;We
won&#146;t spend it&#148;, we need a last resort. We need to tell
truculent, politically motivated authorities, &#147;We&#146;ve
given you the resources. Here are the new guidelines. If you
don&#146;t use them, we&#146;ll give you one of three options.
Because electoral registration is so poor, we&#146;ll take the
responsibility from you and give it either to a neighbouring authority
or the Electoral Commission, or we&#146;ll privatise it.&#148; We
need to be as blunt as that with local authorities that refuse to

amendment No. 8. The Bill is long overdue and will result in getting a
good proportion of those 4.5 million citizens back on the electoral
register and participating fully in democratic life in this
country.</p><p><a name="06061345000146"><b><a name="06061345000794">Mr.
Robert Syms (Poole) (Con):</b> We have got on to a bit of a
rollercoaster with postal voting. Like many hon. Members, when I first
became involved in politics, we made a fetish of making it almost
impossible for people to get a postal vote for an election because, by
the time one had got around to trying to register someone, the date had
passed.</p><p><a name="06061345000147">I have
therefore welcomed the general trend of making it easier for people to
obtain postal votes. However, the Government clearly went too fast, in
the teeth of opposition by the Electoral Commission. There have been
several incidents of fraud, and public confidence has been knocked to
the point where one or two people whom I know have been put off voting
by post because they feel that the system is not as robust and trusted
as it once was. I therefore welcome amendment No. 7 and the
Government&#146;s acceptance of it, because it is sensible to move to
a system whereby people have to give their date of birth and
signature.</p><p><a name="06061345000148">I wish to
raise some technical points. Under our system, we always involve
political parties. As we all know, at the count, several ballots are
questionable, and at the end, the returning officer calls the agents or
candidates over and they go through the 20, 30, 50 or 100 that are not
entirely clear. Although the final decision rests with the returning
officer, whether something is counted or not depends on nods and assent
from the political parties. The Under-Secretary said in her opening
remarks that returning officers would check the ballots against their
records and that rejection of ballots would be up to them. I presume
that the political parties will still be included in the
process.</p><p><a name="06061345000149">At the end
of the process of verifying postal votes, the handwriting on some will
raise questions,&#151;we all receive things through the post that are
not entirely clear, and they are put in a pile. If the returning
officer intends to reject something, the political parties are included
at that point. Of 8,000 postal votes, there may be a genuine concern
about the accuracy of a signature on 200 of them. In such cases, I
personally would like the agents or the candidates to be involved in
the process so that they can see how the returning officer is making
decisions. So if there were widespread fraud or concerns about a number
of the ballots, the political parties could be very much part of the
process of dealing with that, and would not then be surprised if
someone jumped up at the end of it to say, &#147;I&#146;ve rejected
1,000 ballots&#148;. They would have been able to see the process
taking place, which is important.</p><p><a name="06061345000150">It is a pity that the
Government will not accept Lords amendment No. 8, because individual
registration is the way to go. We have talked in the debate about
benefit, and there are benefits involved in being registered. Anyone
who goes into Dixon&#146;s or Curry&#146;s and tries to get credit
will know that one of the ways of judging whether they are worthy of
getting credit to buy a hi-fi system or a TV is whether their 
<br><notus-date day="13" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>13 Jun 2006 : Column 682</b><br>name and address pop up in a search of the electoral register. However,
I accept the argument that if we make the registration process more
complicated, we might put people off. That is why, if we accepted Lords
amendment No. 8, we should also have to have a package of measures to
encourage people to register under the new system.</p><p><a name="06061345000151">We have all had experience of
electoral registration departments. They are usually underfunded and
overworked. They have some very good quality people working in them,
but this issue is hardly the highest priority of most local
authorities, which are struggling to deal with money and personnel and
consequently have other priorities. One of the most productive things
that we, as politicians across the House, could do would be to ensure
that registration offices were better funded. Sometimes, when I look at
the glossy brochures produced by the Electoral Commission, I think that
some of that money would be better spent on registering voters at the
sharp end.</p><p><a name="06061345000152">I am
attracted to the idea put forward by the hon. Member for Pendle (Mr.
Prentice). Why not give people some benefit for registering, beyond the
one that I have just mentioned in regard to obtaining credit? It could
be a lottery ticket, premium bonds or whatever. That could form part of
a successful national campaign. It is in the national interest to get
people to register.</p><p><a name="06061345000153"><b><a name="06061345000795">Mr.
Gordon Prentice:</b> I have raised this issue with Sam Younger
at the Electoral Commission&#151;some colleagues present tonight were

idea.</p><p><a name="06061345000154"><b><a name="06061345000796">Mr.
Syms:</b> That would be a useful way of proceeding.</p><p><a name="06061345000155">The suggestions in the Lords
amendments on postal votes are sensible, as are their suggestions on
ordinary registration for voting. If those proposals were combined with
a package of measures to provide people with an incentive to register,
and if investment went into electoral registration, we could all
support that.</p><p><a name="06061345000156">Houses
in multiple occupation were mentioned earlier, and we know that when
polling cards are delivered to a building containing 40 or 50 flats and
end up in the postal area in the basement, there are occasions on which
they disappear. People then turn up at the polling station to discover
that someone else has voted in their place.</p><p><a name="06061345000157">I agree with the hon. Member
for North Southwark and Bermondsey (Simon Hughes) that these proposals
are not a panacea, but they represent a small step forward. They will
make those who want to commit fraud think again, because they will
slightly increase the prospect of their getting caught and prosecuted.
In particular, a system of registration for ordinary voters that
involved the checking of a person&#146;s date of birth in the polling
station would provide a much better chance of catching people who are
voting when they should not be. That would add integrity to the
process. It would be a step forward, and it is a pity that the
Government are not going to accept Lords amendment No. 8. That
proposal, combined with the package of 
<br><notus-date day="13" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>13 Jun 2006 : Column 683</b><br>measures that Members on both sides accept would be necessary to

Heath:</b> The hon. Gentleman made the point that electoral
registration officers need the necessary resources to do their job
effectively, and that they must not be prey to the whims of their
political masters in county or city halls. The Bill will achieve that
objective by placing clear duties on electoral registration officers
and providing a clear requirement for them to have the necessary
funding to perform their duties. There are also reserve powers in the
Bill to ensure that that requirement is consistently applied across the
country. So we can be assured that the situation will improve if the
Bill is passed into law.</p><p><a name="06061345000159"><b><a name="06061345000798">Mr.

There will be some votes this evening, as we do not agree on
everything, but in electoral terms, we are going in the right
direction. Lords amendment No. 7 would certainly help people to feel
better about the integrity of the postal voting system. It is a pity
that Lords amendment No. 8 will not be accepted, but I suspect that

the fundamental problem. There are 4.5 million people who ought to be

improve that situation are at the heart of the Bill, we must think very
carefully about any proposals that would make it worse, and probably
draw back from them at this stage.</p><p><a name="06061345000162"><b><a name="06061345000800">Dr.

<br><notus-date day="13" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>13 Jun 2006 : Column 684</b><br>that the present system allows for a massive amount of
under-registration of real people, and that even more people might not
register if we pursue the issueof personal identifiers and
personal individual registration in the present circumstances. I want
to see the most secure voting system possible, and I am in favour in
principle of individual registration. I want us to get there in due
course, but I want that to happen at a time when the level of
registration is much higher, when more of the real people who are
currently missing from the register are on it.</p><p><a name="06061345000164">We can all go out and see,
sometimes in local authorities of our own political persuasion, that
the effort put into electoral registration amounts only to sending out
two forms to households. In many cases, the forms do not get returned,
but the system then gives up on those individuals. There are local
authorities across the country that does not think that this is a
priority. They do not put money into it, and most councillors are not
awfully interested. All right, they have other things to do&#151;they
have education and social services systems to run and the environment
to look after. Those are very big issues. The councillors concerned get
lots of letters from their constituents about them, and they quite
rightly respond to them.</p><p><a name="06061345000165">Electoral registration often
comes quite far down the list and, provided that there is no specific
requirement for it to be put on the agenda and for electoral
registration officers to carry out specific duties that can be
monitored and scrutinised by the local council and the Electoral
Commission, we shall continue to have the system that we have today. I
accept that the Bill takes us forward in regard to trying to get the
levels of registration up.</p><a name="06061345000694"><p>I hope that the Minister
will give us reassurance on a point raised by my hon. Friend the Member
for Vale of Clwyd. If we are putting extra money into the system, how
can we be sure that it will be spent on the system? Some local
authorities will take the grant and use itfor other purposes.
How can we be sure that the&#163;70 million&#151;and there
will be questions as to whether that is enough&#151;is spent on
improving the system?</p><p><a name="06061345000166">Hon. Members on both sides of
the House have expressed their concern whether, even if we improve the
level of canvassing, it will really catch the people that we are
worried about, who do not fill in or send back the forms. It is that
much harder when we are dealing with people living in houses in
multiple
occupation.</p><p><a name="06061345000167"><b><a name="06061345000802">Chris
Ruane:</b> On targeting people who are the most difficult to
get to register, will my hon. Friend reflect on a suggestion from
Wales? Public or voluntary bodies that target socially excluded people
on council estates, such as black and ethnic minorities or people on
low pay, could ask, &#147;And how about registration?&#148;, while
carrying out their other work. Different bodies that are already active
and have gained the trust of people in the community could also help
with registration.</p><p><a name="06061345000168"><b><a name="06061345000803">Mr.
Betts:</b> My hon. Friend makes a valid point. Electoral
registration officers should be imaginative in how they go about
encouraging registration. Let us increase the canvass as well, although
that will not do anything like 100 per cent. of the job. We have to
deal with trying to get data and information from other 
<br><notus-date day="13" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>13 Jun 2006 : Column 685</b><br>sources, and that is in the Bill. When the data protection people gave
evidence to the Select Committee hearings, they were not worried about
cross-matching data provided that it was clear from the initial
collection what purpose it would be used for&#151;that is the
issue.</p><p><a name="06061345000169">There is a
genuine concern not only that electoral registration officers are not
currently cross-matching data to which they have access within the
local authority, but that they may need to access data outside the
authority. In some cases, local authorities wanting to obtain data on
young people becoming 18 can go to their own schools. In my
constituency, most young people becoming 18 are based in the college,
which is outside the local authority, rather than a school within it.
How can we stop the problem of bias in the system, which means that
data can be captured in some authorities but not in others?</p><p><a name="06061345000170">Stock transfers of houses are
another problem. Local authorities can access data on their own council
tenants before such a transfer, but I am not sure whether they can
afterwards. I do not know, but the question has to be answered. Housing
associations are sometimes set up to take over stock transfer
properties and they take over documentation and data about tenants with
them. Those are the sort of problems that have to be dealt with. How
can we ensure that access to data and cross-matching goes wider than
the local authority, into the rest of the public sector and probably
outside it into organisations such as the utilities and the Post
Office?</p><p><a name="06061345000171">I now come to
the crucial point. I believe that the Bill is a halfway house in a
number of senses. Eventually, we want to get to individual
registration, but we want to do so with a much fuller registration
system in which we can be certain of getting into the higher 90s per
cent. of registration figures, just like the Australians who reach 98
per cent. They do not rely on canvassing as the primary means of
drawing up the register; rather, they rely on data from a range of
sources. They rely on the utilities, postal services, local authorities
and other bodies to give information to electoral registration
officers&#151;in Australia, there is an electoral commission for each
state. All the information from those bodies is used to establish when
people have moved in or out of properties, when people have become 18
or died and so forth. They check whether the information is correct and
draw up the data on that basis.</p><p><a name="06061345000172">The Australians ask why, in
this country, we bother with annual registration when we get forms
back, by and large, from people who have lived in a property for 20
years, rather than capturing data from people who change their property
regularly, sometimes annually, particularly in the private rented
sector. The Australians concentrate on households where the information
has changed from one year to the next. They follow that up closely and
ensure that it benefits the registration process. Better use is made of
registration officers&#146; time because their efforts are spread
throughout the year rather than for three or four months with little
concentration of effort for the rest of the year.</p><p><a name="06061345000173">We have a lopsided system that,
to use the currently in-vogue jargon, is not fit for purpose. The Bill
is a 
<br><notus-date day="13" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>13 Jun 2006 : Column 686</b><br>great step forward in giving more powers and responsibilities to
electoral registration officers, but it takes us only part of the way
there. I would like us to think about consulting on a new Bill, perhaps
in three or four years&#146; time, which deals with how best to move
towards the Australian system, while tightening up the security of the
voting system by taking individual registration into
account.</p><p><a name="06061345000174"><b><a name="06061345000804">Simon
Hughes:</b> The hon. Gentleman has outlined some very good
ideas, but I hope that he accepts that there are good things that
electoral officers and their teams could do now. Forms could be placed
with estate agents or solicitors who do the conveyancing or sent out
with Inland Revenue or social security material, or sent with all the
other items delivered through our letterboxes. It just requires some
lateral thinking about how to reach people as they move, arrive or
connect in various ways with the
authorities.</p><p><a name="06061345000175"><b><a name="06061345000805">Mr.

the best fundamental system for registration
purposes.</p><p><a name="06061345000176"><b><a name="06061345000806">Jim

registrar of the university of Newcastle refused, on data protection
grounds, to register 3,000 students in their own accommodation. The
electoral registration officers, seeing 3,000 voters disappearing off
the register, prevailed on him to block register the students again. At
no stage in the process was a single student consulted about whether he

requirement for people to register, so I am not sure whether consulting
people on whether they want to register is the legal position. I am in
favour of universities co-operating in the business of registration. In
some cities, one university co-operates and another does not. That
creates an imbalance in the figures. I am in favour of electoral
registration officers being ableto gain access to information
from universities. Co-operating in a process that involves a legal
requirement to register is something that should be encouraged.
Electoral registration officers should have access to that information,
and universities and others ought to have a responsibility to provide
it.</p><p><a name="06061345000178">I am sure that my
final point will not receive any agreement from Opposition Members. We

ideal position. When we come to the further Bill, which I hope will
come about in three or four years&#146; time, we will be developing a
form of registration that will be ideal for the purpose&#151;it goes
with the creation of the identity card scheme. That will eventually

saying that many people are not on the electoral register.</p><p><a name="06061345000180">I understand where Labour
Members are coming from, but do they not recognise that, in effect, we
politicians are bound, to some extent, to be biased on this issue one
way or another. My hon. Friends and I are perhaps more concerned about
fraud; Labour Members are perhaps more concerned about
under-representation. However, the fact is that the Government
contracted out such things to the Electoral Commission, which is an
independent body, and it came up with a view of how we should look at
our electoral system. It made suggestions and
recommendations&#151;for example, on individual registration and
using personal identifiers on a larger scale&#151;and the Government
were willing to accept them.</p><p><a name="06061345000181">The Government found a way out
of such problems by using an independently established body, which can
take an objective view. That body has existed for five or six years.
The problem with the proposals from the hon. Member for Sheffield,
Attercliffe) is that, once again, they kick things further and further
into the future. Do we want to go on for ever trying to improve or
change what we have got? Are we no longer prepared to listen to a
perfectly respectable independent body, which the Government set up? It
seems a great pity that the Government are not prepared to accept its
advice and suggestions.</p><p><a name="06061345000182"><b><a name="06061345000809">Bridget
Prentice:</b> This has been an excellent debate, which, as
expected, has reflected the strong views held on both sides of the
House.</p><p><a name="06061345000183">On the
question of fraud, the hon. Member for North-East Hertfordshire (Mr.
Heald) mentioned yet again the judge who referred to our system as
being like that of a banana republic. I remind him that that
unfortunate and terrible phrase was used about the situation before
2004, and a number of measures have been put in place since then. On
the whole, therefore, the elections this year reflect that we have
tightened up on the abuses that took place in
Birmingham.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="06061345000713">6.30
pm</h5><p><a name="06061345000184">I hope that
every Member of the House believes in zero tolerance in response to
anyone who abuses the system through fraudulent registration or voting.
That is why the Bill increases the penalties for such behaviour.
Several Members referred earlier to the registration form being sent to
the head of household. 
<br><notus-date day="13" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>13 Jun 2006 : Column 688</b><br>In fact, it is not sent to the head of household&#151;we do not use
such Victorian terms&#151;but to the occupier.</p><p><a name="06061345000185">On the issue of fraud versus
the register, which seemed to be a theme throughout the debate, my hon.
Friend the Member for Vale of Clwyd (Chris Ruane) referred to
petitions. At present, eight petitions are before the courts, four of
which are about election fraud, while the other four are about other
election issues. The Coventry petition relates to about 10 electors,
which, as my hon. Friend the Member for Vale of Clwyd rightly pointed
out, should be compared with the 3.5million to 4 million people who are
not on the register. Therefore, while we all agree that fraud is bad
and dangerous, we should look at it from the perspective of the number
of elections that took place this year, the number of people involved
in those elections, and the fact that a huge number of people are not
yet on the register. That is why we have approached the issue as we
have done. We have tried to be proportionate and to strike a balance,
which is why we have accepted the Lords amendments on identifiers for
postal votes.</p><p><a name="06061345000186">I
agreed with virtually everything that the hon. Member for North
Southwark and Bermondsey (Simon Hughes) said, apart from his comments
about personal identifiers. As he and I represent inner-London seats,
we know exactly the problems that people face in getting on the
register. It is not a case, as his hon. Friend the Member for Somerton
and Frome (Mr. Heath) said, of being patronising about those living on
council estates or in houses in multiple occupation, the unemployed,
young people and black and ethnic minorities. Their disfranchisement,
as we know, relates not just to the register but to a variety of
issues, and their disfranchisement from the register arises in a sense
from all of those. It is therefore important that we try to get those
people on to the register, as well as doing all the other things on the
Government&#146;s social exclusion
agenda.</p>

<p><a name="06061345000187"><b><a name="06061345000810">Mr.
Heath:</b> To correct the record, I made it absolutely plain
that it was not remotely patronising to point out that such groups are
under-registered and that there is a real need to address that
under-registration. I said that it was patronising to suggest that
asking those particular people for a signature would significantly
deter them from voting, whereas it would not deter the rest of the
population. I hold to that view.</p><p><a name="06061345000188"><b><a name="06061345000811">Bridget
Prentice:</b> The hon. Gentleman is, of course, entitled to
his view, and I think that he is wrong.</p><p><a name="06061345000189">The hon. Member for North
Southwark and Bermondsey made several positive points about the variety
of ways in which we can and should encourage people to vote. I agree
with the idea of a democracy day. I hope that after the Bill is passed
by the House and the other place, we can engage in some cross-party
lateral thinking about the creative methods that can be used to get
people to register and to participate actively in
citizenship.</p><p><a name="06061345000190">On data
sharing, my hon. Friend the Member for Sheffield, Attercliffe (Mr.
Betts) is right that returning officers already have at their disposal
a huge variety of ways of using that. Sadly, a number of them do not 
<br><notus-date day="13" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>13 Jun 2006 : Column 689</b><br>take advantage of those. Perhaps obstacles are put in their way by other
organisations that could be more positive. The hon. Member for North
Southwark and Bermondsey alluded to a possible role for estate agents,
solicitors&#146; offices and so on. Of course, when people move into
an area and register for council tax, there is no reason whatever why
the local authority should not send out a registration form with its
council tax bill.</p><p><a name="06061345000191">On
the issue of the canvass, the Bill includes measures on physical
canvassing. I suspect that I am no different from many Members in that
when the canvasser comes around, I am not in&#151;I might be out
canvassing myself. In the 15 years that I have lived in my current
house, I have only been in once when a canvasser has knocked on the
door, on a Sunday afternoon. My local authority allows me to register
by telephone, which is another way in which people can ensure that they
are on the register.</p><p><a name="06061345000192">On funding, I had a lot of
sympathy with what several colleagues said. We have been relatively
generous in relation to funding&#151;around &#163;21 million will
be provided to cover the costs of the Bill. All the returning officers
and electoral administrators with whom I have had conversations feel
that that money, if it reaches them, would cover their costs. The
funding is not ring-fenced, however, and they are aware, like a number
of my colleagues, that local authorities sometimes use the money for
other items. As has been pointed out, the Bill also introduces
performance standards that will be overseen by the Electoral
Commission. We will also ask for accounts showing the amount of money
spent on the election process. I hope that those measures will help to
counter any temptation by local authorities to spend the money on
something other than electoral registration and so on.</p><p><a name="06061345000193">The hon. Member for Castle
Point (Bob Spink) was concerned about errant returning officers. The
Representation of the People Acts include provisions to prosecute
returning officers if they breach their duty. As I said, the Bill also
includes performance standards, which will be set by the Electoral
Commission. That will help to improve the standard of electoral
administration.</p><a name="06061345000695"><p>The hon. Member for Poole
(Mr. Syms), who made a thoughtful speech, asked about the verification
of postal votes. I assure him that candidates can be present at the
checking of disputed postal votes. Details of that will be included in
the regulations. He also welcomed the fact that the Government are
moving in the right direction, as did a number of other colleagues.
That is true&#151;the Bill moves us forward both by tightening up the
system to counter any possibility of fraud and by tackling
under-representation in this country. I hope that Members will support
the Bill in that respect.</p><p><a name="06061345000194"><b><a name="06061345000812">Simon
Hughes:</b> I realise that the Minister is approaching the end
of her speech, but may I ask her to consult on another matter? People
become very frustrated when, having turned up at a polling station,
they discover that they are not on the register. At that moment, they
ought to be given a form and asked to fill it in and leave it there, or
at least given a form to take away. If we could make people&#146;s
bad experiences at 
<br><notus-date day="13" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>13 Jun 2006 : Column 690</b><br>poling stations far less frequent, gradually over the years there would
be a more positive response from those who currently feel that they are
not
wanted.</p><p><a name="06061345000195"><b><a name="06061345000813">Bridget
Prentice:</b> Again, the hon. Gentleman has made an important
point. I hope that, in further discussions with the Electoral
Commission and in cross-party discussions, we shall be able to consider
the practicality of some of his proposals. I believe that we should
make it as easy as possible for people who should be on the register to
be on it. That means&#151;in the words of my hon. Friend the Member
for Pendle (Mr. Prentice)&#151;thinking laterally. Perhaps there
should be incentives; who
knows?</p><p><a name="06061345000196">I reiterate
that the Government do not feel ready, at this stage, to accept
personal identifiers across the board. We do think that they are
appropriate for postal votes, and I therefore commend the Lords
amendments on postal vote identifiers, which received cross-party
consensus. I hope that we can make progress on the rest of the Bill in
a consensual way, but I ask Members to reject Lords amendment No 8 when
it is put to the
House.</p><p><a name="06061345000197"><i> Lords

129.</p><p><a name="06061358000009"><b><a name="06061358000136">Bridget
Prentice:</b> Amendments Nos. 61 to 63 were introduced
following pressure from both Houses for an increase in the number of
descriptions that a party can register with the Electoral Commission.
The original number was five, which was the number recommended by the
Electoral Commission. That would allow, for example, one description
for each of England, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales, and one for
the United Kingdom as a whole. The Liberal Democrats introduced the
amendments in another place. They sought to increase the number of
descriptions to 12 because that equals the number of nations and
regions in the United Kingdom, and so that parties could register
descriptions such as &#147;London Liberal Democrats&#148;,
&#147;East Anglian Conservatives&#148;, or &#147;Yorkshire and
Humberside Labour&#148;. I therefore recommend that the House accept
those
amendments.</p><p><a name="06061358000010">Amendments
Nos. 64 to 72 fulfil the commitment made by my hon. Friend the Member
for Inverclyde (David Cairns) on Third Reading in this House. Members
may recall that amendments moved then became clause 59, and that they
removed the need for duplication in reporting of donations, but for MPs
only.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="06061358000129">7
pm</h5><p><a name="06061358000011">By way of
brief background, schedule 7 of the Political Parties, Elections and
Referendums Act 2000 sets out, among other things, the requirement that
&#147;holders of elective office&#148; should report the donations
that they have received to the Electoral Commission, which then
publishes them. That has the effect that MPs, MEPs, Members of devolved
Administrations and local councillors throughout the UK have to report
donations to both the Electoral Commission and to the relevant register
of members&#146; interests of the body of which they are a member.
The Select Committee on Standards and Privileges, chaired by the right
hon. Member for North-West Hampshire(Sir George
Young)&#151;to whom I express my gratitude for his help in this
matter&#151;expressed concern about the duplication, referring to it
in a report published on 20 July
2005.</p><p><a name="06061358000012">Lords amendments
Nos. 64 to 72 remove the requirement of dual reporting for holders of
relevant elective office. That means that holders of the relevant
elected office would not have to report any donations received to the
Electoral Commission, whether the 
<br><notus-date day="13" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>13 Jun 2006 : Column 695</b><br>donations were received in their role as the relevant elected officer or
in their role as a member of a registered political party. Of course,
as with the provisions already included in clause 58, the Electoral
Commission will retain the obligation to record any details it receives
from the relevant registers of members&#146; interests. The
commission will continue to supervise compliance with the regulatory
system as set out in the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums
Act 2000.</p><p><a name="06061358000013">The House
should note that this provision can be commenced only once the
Electoral Commission is content that the relevant authorities have
arrangements in place to ensure that the commission is still able to
maintain an accurate register. I hope that hon. Members will see that
as an appropriate balance between requiring transparency and removing
bureaucratic duplication. The amendments are supported by the Electoral
Commission, as well as relevant bodies, including the Scottish
Executive and the Standards Board for
England.</p><p><a name="06061358000014">Lords
amendments Nos. 73 to 75, 103, 110 to 122 and 126 to 129, on the
reporting regime for loans, fulfil the commitment that I made to the
House on 20 March that the Government would table amendments to the
Bill to make it compulsory for political parties to disclose any loans
that they receive. There are issues relating to the funding of
political parties that go beyond the disclosure of loans and the review
bySir Hayden Phillips will deal with those. We have tabled
these amendments now because there is broad agreement between the
political parties and the Electoral Commission as to what should be
done. This Bill presented us with an opportunity to act immediately in
seeking to deliver the same openness for loans as currently exists for
donations. I was heartened by the consensus on the principles of
seeking to achieve greater openness and transparency in relation to
significant loans afforded to political parties, individual members,
members&#146; associations and holders of relevant elective
office.</p><p><a name="06061358000015">The amendments
take the form of a new part 4A of, and schedule 6A to, the Political
Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000, or
PPERA.</p><p><a name="06061358000016"><b><a name="06061358000137">Mr.
David Winnick (Walsall, North) (Lab):</b> The position on
loans was a glaring loophole for which we are all responsible, not only
the Government. It should have been recognised at the time, but all
Labour Members are very pleased that it will at last be
closed.</p><p><a name="06061358000017"><b><a name="06061358000138">Bridget
Prentice:</b> My hon. Friend is right. All hon. Members need
to take some responsibility for this and the right hon. Member for
North-West Hampshire recognised that on behalf of the Standards and
Privileges Committee. That is one reason why we have had such openness
and consensus on the
issue.</p><p><a name="06061358000018">Part 4 of and
schedule 6 to PPERA provide a system for the regulation of donations to
political parties. That regime requires all donations over
&#163;5,000 to a political party to be reported to the Electoral
Commission, and ensures that donations can be made only by individuals
or organisations with a sufficient connection to the United Kingdom. It
has been accepted that those requirements have brought 
<br><notus-date day="13" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>13 Jun 2006 : Column 696</b><br>transparency and openness to the making of donations, which is why we
have chosen the same regime for loans. Indeed the new provisions
deviate from the requirements for donations only where necessary to
reflect the difference between a loan and a donation. I am sure that
hon. Members will agree that it makes sense to build on the success of
the existing regime to try to achieve the same level of openness
regarding
loans.</p><p><a name="06061358000019">Before coming
to the more detailed aspects of the regime as set out in the new
sections and schedule, it might be useful to remind the House of the
four main features. First, the reporting requirement is triggered when
a loan exceeds the initial reporting thresholdof &#163;5,000
or the subsequent reporting threshold of &#163;1,000. Such loans,
whether made on commercial or less than commercial terms, will have to
be reported to the Electoral Commission. That will be at quarterly
intervals, and at weekly intervals during a general election period.
Secondly, all loans extant on the day that the provisions come into
force would have to be disclosed, and any taken out thereafter.
Thirdly, a party would be permitted to take out a loan only from the
same sources from which it is permitted to receive donations, although
existing loans will not be subject to that permissibility requirement.
Fourthly, the regime would cover not only loans, but all credit
facilities and the provision by third parties of guarantees and
securities.</p><p><a name="06061358000020">On 20
March, the Lord Chancellor wrote to all the parties represented at
Westminster and he has since held meetings with many of them. Each has
shared our concern that we should act quickly and recognised that a
scheme similar to that now well established for donations would be a
proportionate response to the need for transparency. We have also taken
the views of Sam Younger, chairman of the Electoral Commission, who has
welcomed the proposals, and consulted the British Banking
Association.</p><p><a name="06061358000021"><b><a name="06061358000139">Mr.
Andrew Turner:</b> I appreciate, as I am sure do hon. Members
on both sides of the House, the efforts that have been made to secure
consensus on this point. Is there anything to prohibit foreign
nationals or others making large donations to campaigning organisations
that are not registered as political parties, such as the Countryside
Alliance or the League Against Cruel
Sports?</p><p><a name="06061358000022"><b><a name="06061358000140">Bridget
Prentice:</b> I will come to that issue shortly. We need to
address concerns about third
parties&#151;</p><p><a name="06061358000023"><b><a name="06061358000141">Mr.
Peter Bone (Wellingborough) (Con):</b> Am I to understand from
what the Minister has said that, if an organisation had a temporary
overdraft in excess of &#163;5,000, it would have to be
reported?</p><p><a name="06061358000024"><b><a name="06061358000142">Bridget
Prentice:</b> If a loan already exists and is ongoing, it will
not have to be reported, but any loan made subsequently will be
reported. I will cover issues such as capitalisation later. It is a
complex and technical part of the Bill, but I hope that I will answer
the hon. Gentleman&#146;s question as I
continue.</p><p><a name="06061358000025">The scope of
the regime is not merely restricted to straightforward loans. The
regime also includes credit 
<br><notus-date day="13" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>13 Jun 2006 : Column 697</b><br>facilities, such as overdrafts, and arrangements where a third party
offers a guarantee or security in respect of the liabilities of a
political party. If security agreements were not included in the new
regime, a wealthy backer could offer guarantees to all of a
party&#146;s commercial suppliers, and enable the party to obtain
anything that it might need at any given time, even though the
party&#146;s own credit rating would mean that it could not otherwise
do so.</p><p><a name="06061358000027">One of the key
issues in deciding whether a regulated transaction has to be disclosed
will be its value. Disclosure will not be required for loans of
&#163;5,000 or under, unless the combined lending from the same
authorised participant exceeds &#163;5,000 during the course of a
reporting year, and the regime does not apply at all to loans of
&#163;200 or
under.</p><p><a name="06061358000028">New section 71G
specifies that the value of a loan is the total amount to be
lent&#151;&#151;that is, the &#147;interest charged&#148; is
not included. For a credit facility, the valuation is the maximum
amount that may be borrowed under the arrangement. For an arrangement
involving any form of security, it will be the contingent liability
assumed by the person who gives the
security.</p><p><a name="06061358000029">A question
arose in the other place about loans that contain capitalisation
provisions&#151;that is, a facility for outstanding interest to be
rolled up into the total sum of the loan. These amendments provide
that, where a regulated transaction provides for capitalisation at the
outset, the potential for capitalisation is not considered in the
valuation of a loan. That would be a matter of particular importance in
the case of loans whose face value is just below the reporting
threshold and which contain capitalisation provisions that might cause
the initial value of the loan to exceed the reporting
threshold.</p><p><a name="06061358000030">We have
intentionally steered away from imposing on political parties the
rather inexact science of having to ascertain whether capitalisation
provisions might cause a loan to cross the reporting threshold.
However, where the face value of the loan crosses the reporting
requirement, the existence of capitalisation provisions would have to
be recorded in the report to the Electoral Commission. We believe that
that approach strikes the right balance between practicability and
transparency.</p><p><a name="06061358000031">Proposed
new section 71H deals with the important question of permissibility. We
believe that, as happens with donations, a lender should be either an
individual whose name is on the electoral roll or an organisation with
a sufficient connection to the UK. Proposed new section 71H prevents a
party from entering into a regulated transaction with anyone other than
authorised participants, the latter being defined by reference to the
existing list of permissible donors in section 54(2) of PPERA. The
restriction will not apply to regulated transactions entered into
before the new provision
commences.</p><p><a name="06061358000032">The
permissibility requirement is enforced by a range of criminal offences.
For example, when a party takes out loans with unauthorised
participants, the party and its treasurer may commit criminal
offences.</p><p><a name="06061358000033"><b><a name="06061358000143">Mr.
Angus MacNeil (Na h-Eileanan an Iar) (SNP):</b> The UK link is
one thing, but should not the Bill 
<br><notus-date day="13" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>13 Jun 2006 : Column 698</b><br>ensure that there are no links between political parties and seats in
the upper House of
Parliament?</p><p><a name="06061358000034"><b><a name="06061358000144">Bridget
Prentice:</b> The hon. Gentleman&#146;s
colleague, the hon. Member for Banff and Buchan (Mr. Salmond), was
invited to meet the Lord Chancellor and put his views on that matter,
which he did robustly. I understand that the hon. Gentleman is
concerned about not having representation in the other place, but I am
not the person with whom he needs to raise that matter. However, I can
reassure him that his hon. Friend put his case to the Lord Chancellor
very forcefully.</p><p><a name="06061358000035"><b><a name="06061358000145">Mr.
MacNeil:</b> My point is not about my party having
representation in the House of Lords. It is about installing a
mechanism to ensure that Parliament is beyond reproach with loans and
donations to political parties, and that the people who make that money
available do not find themselves in the House of Lords soon
afterwards.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="06061358000130">7.15
pm</h5><p><a name="06061358000036"><b><a name="06061358000146">Bridget
Prentice:</b> I hope that the amendments from the other place
will reassure the hon. Gentleman. As far as possible, we have tried to
duplicate the donations regime and apply it to loans, although I have
set out the technical reasons for any differences. The amendments
should reassure hon. Members and the public that the process will be
transparent, and that a robust reporting regime will
apply.</p><p><a name="06061358000037">As I said,
those who do not follow the rules set out in the Bill could be found
guilty of criminal offences. We have also made provision to ensure
that, where a party has entered into a regulated transaction with an
unauthorised participant, it should be required to repay the moneys or
benefits that it derives from the transaction as soon as they come to
light.</p><p><a name="06061358000038">If the party
refuses to repay the loan, a broad power is conferred on the courts,
exercisable on application by the Electoral Commission, to restore the
parties to the position that they were in before the transaction was
entered into, if that is possible. That mirrors a similar provision of
PPERA that allows the Electoral Commission to apply to the court for
the forfeiture of impermissible donations. The same principles will
apply in the case of a guarantee or security given by an unauthorised
participant, again with some necessary
adjustments.</p><p><a name="06061358000039">I turn
now to the reporting requirements, which follow the same structure as
those for donations. Proposed new section 71M requires regulated
transactions to be reported on a quarterly basis to the Electoral
Commission. The requirement to report a regulated transaction is
triggered when the value of that transaction exceeds
&#163;5,000&#151;either in its own right, or taken together with
the value of other transactions with the same authorised participant.
Thereafter, transactions exceeding &#163;1,000 with the same
participant must be
reported.</p><p><a name="06061358000040">What happens
where a person makes a loan of &#163;5,000 and a donation of
&#163;5,000? The principle that we have adopted is that any
combination of loans and donations that exceed the reporting
requirements of &#163;5,000 and &#163;1,000 should be disclosed.
The approach that we have taken is that it should not matter whether 
<br><notus-date day="13" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>13 Jun 2006 : Column 699</b><br>a donation, a regulated transaction, or a combination of donations and
regulated transactions, is made. If the aggregate value of any
combination of relevant benefits exceeds the initial reporting
threshold of &#163;5,000 or the subsequent reporting threshold of
&#163;1,000, then the requirement to report is
triggered.</p><p><a name="06061358000041">Weekly
reports are required in the period immediately before general
elections, just as happens with donations. The Electoral Commission
will maintain a register of regulated transactions so reported, and it
will be made available to the
public.</p><p><a name="06061358000042"><b><a name="06061358000147">Mr.
MacNeil:</b> Is there anything in the amendments that would
have prevented the recent scandals and the subsequent involvement of
the Metropolitan police, or are we back where we were a few months
ago?</p><p><a name="06061358000043"><b><a name="06061358000148">Bridget
Prentice:</b> As I have said, the events of afew
months ago showed that we needed transparency. My hon. Friend the
Member for Walsall, North(Mr. Winnick) pointed out that there
was a loophole that no one in this House recognised. Our discussions
with the various parties represented here have led us to come up with
what we think are sensible, coherent and transparent proposals. I shall
not comment on any Metropolitan police investigation that may be under
way, but I believe that the amendments will reassure the House and the
general public about how political parties will be
funded.</p>

<p><a name="06061358000044"><b><a name="06061358000149">Mr.
Andrew Turner:</b> The Minister said that no one in this House
recognised the loophole that existed. Does that mean that the then
chairman of the Labour party and the Prime Minister&#151;as well as
Lord Levy, who I accept is not a Member of this House&#151;did not
recognise the
loophole?</p><p><a name="06061358000045"><b><a name="06061358000150">Bridget
Prentice:</b> As I said in my statement of20
March&#151;and I have said it again at least twice this
evening&#151;no one was aware that the donations regime did not apply
in the same way to loans. The result was that loans were not as
transparent as donations. We are rectifying that now. Everyone in this
House recognises that the new regime should apply to every party in
this House and that we all have to take some responsibility for making
the position as transparent as possible.</p><p><a name="06061358000046">The particulars that need to be
reported about regulated transactions will be different. We think that
transparency requires that the principal features of the transaction
should be required to be reported and disclosed to the public. New
schedule 6A requires the identity of the participants to be reported,
as well as the nature and value of the transaction, details of the rate
of interest, if any, to be paid on any sums lent, the length of the
loan, and other particulars. Provision is made for the particulars to
be varied should it become apparent that transparency requires
different or additional matters to be reported about regulated
transactions.</p><p><a name="06061358000047"><b><a name="06061358000151">Mr.

someone to give a substantial amount of money to a political party and

Parliament?</p><p><a name="06061358000050"><b><a name="06061358000154">Bridget
Prentice:</b> Let me make it absolutely clear that no one who
gives money to a political party is given some sort of favour, either
in this House or in the other place. I hope that the hon. Gentleman
accepts that. I am disappointed that he does not understand that no one

Prentice:</b> If I can make a little progress, I shall deal
with the question of third party
loans.</p><p><a name="06061358000055">The other major
difference that requires a different approach is the continuing nature
of a regulated transaction. Because regulated transactions involve an
ongoing relationship, it is necessary to require the reporting of
variations in the terms of the transaction. We have done that in new
section 71N. Whenever one of the particulars that are required
initially to be reported about a regulated transaction is varied, the
party is obliged to record the change in the next transaction report.
We believe that that will ensure proper transparency. Otherwise,
regulated transactions could, for example, be varied to permit the
making of further advances or be put on a zero-interest basis in a way
that would not be apparent. We have also imposed a requirement to
report when a regulated transaction finally comes to an
end.</p><p><a name="06061358000056">As for third
party loans, third parties are already covered during a general
election and we have an order-making power in the Bill to deal with
third party loans and donations outside that period. I hope that that
the hon. Member for Wellingborough (Mr. Bone) is satisfied that such
matters are covered by the
amendments.</p><p><a name="06061358000057"><b><a name="06061358000159">Mr.

going to the other place. That, too, would be wrong.</p><p><a name="06061358000058">We want transparency. Does the
hon. Lady agree that, if we are not careful, soft money or issue money
could be lent or given, which would have the same effect, but would not
have to be declared?</p><br><notus-date day="13" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>13 Jun 2006 : Column 701</b><br><p><a name="06061358000059"><b><a name="06061358000160">Bridget

that someone who donates to a political party should not as a result be
barred from being in the other House. That would clearly be nonsense.
People have the right to express their political views in their own way
and there is no bar on appointing a donor to the other place. People
are appointed to the other place on merit. I hope that hon. Members in
this place accept that. <i> [</i><i> Interruption.</i><i> ]</i> Noises off
from the Liberal Democrats ought to be kept a lot quieter, given their
own situation. They have no right to pretend to be any better than any
other party in the House in dealing with these matters.</p><p><a name="06061358000060">The hon. Gentleman mentioned
his concern about soft money, which is something that we have to look
at. Later, I shall speak about issues relating to candidates&#146;
expenses, where such money sometimes appears. We have views on how we
might make progress in that respect.</p><p><a name="06061358000061">The new regime will apply not
only to the political parties, but to individual members of political
parties, their associations and holders of relevant elective office.
The amendments also make provision for an order-making power to extend
the loans regime to third parties during national election campaigns,
permitted participants at referendums and election candidates in
parliamentary, local government and London assembly elections. An
order-making power to extend the loans regime to Gibraltar during
European elections has also been provided for, mirroring once again the
approach taken in respect of donations.</p><p><a name="06061358000062">We have also considered in the
amendments the most appropriate means of extending the provisions to
Northern Ireland. The House will know that the donations regime has
been disapplied in Northern Ireland since 2000 by orders made under
PPERA. However, the Northern Ireland (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill
that has recently been debated in this place and is now before the
House of Lords contains provisions that mean that the disapplication of
the regime will expire on 31 October 2007. Thereafter, the donations
regime will apply in Northern Ireland, with both temporary and
permanent modifications. An order-making power will allow the loans
regime to be modified as it applies in Northern Ireland in a way that
allows it to mirror the approach to be adopted in relation to donations
as provided for in the Northern Ireland (Miscellaneous Provisions)
Bill.</p><p><a name="06061358000063">The measures
also bring about a number of consequential amendments to PPERA to
reflect the introduction of the new regime for regulated transactions
and to tie the two regimes together. The changes include an amendment
to section 3 of PPERA so that those people who have made loans to
political parties are excluded from being eligible to be electoral
commissioners, reflecting the regime that currently applies to
donations. Similarly, the amendments establish that an electoral
commissioner shall cease to hold office if he is named as a participant
in the register of recordable transactions&#151;that is, if he gives
a loan or other donation to a political party.</p><p><a name="06061358000064">In accordance with the
commitment that I gavethe House 20 March, the amendments
represent a comprehensive package of measures to make it compulsory for
political parties to disclose any loans that they receive. Our
intention has been to achieve as 
<br><notus-date day="13" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>13 Jun 2006 : Column 702</b><br>great a transparency for loans made to political parties as applies to
donations. We believe that the measures now provide a robust and
workable framework to ensure greater transparency in respect of
significant financial benefits afforded to political parties, members
of political parties and holders of relevant elective office. I commend
them to the
House.</p><p><a name="06061358000065"><b><a name="06061358000161">Mr.
Heald:</b> Openness and transparency are important. If someone
makes what amounts to a gift to a political party, or even improves its
financial position, that should be known. If it is not known that a
person has given a large amount of money or other substantial financial
benefit to a political party and that person then becomes a peer, there
will be grounds for suspicion about why that has happened. I shall say
nothing about the circumstances that brought the subject to light
recently, but it is a fair principle that when people give money or
other financial benefits to political parties, that should be known
when the sums involved are
substantial.</p><p><a name="06061358000066"><b><a name="06061358000162">Mr.
Winnick: </b>The hon. Gentleman was in no way responsible so
my question is not personal, but why was there no disclosure prior to
1997? When the Committee on Standards in Public Life&#151;originally
known as the Nolan Committee&#151;was set up, John Major made it
perfectly clear that political donations and contributions would be
excluded from its
remit.</p><p><a name="06061358000067"><b><a name="06061358000163">Mr.
Heald:</b> As I think that the hon. Gentleman would agree, it
was a different era. We all accept things now that we may not have
accepted years ago. I am sure that that is true for him as much as it
is for me.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="06061358000131">7.30

way?</p><p><a name="06061358000069"><b><a name="06061358000165">Mr.
Heald:</b> Let me just make a bit of
progress.</p><p><a name="06061358000070">The point
that I was going to make is that, from the moment that this issue
became important&#151;in recent months&#151;we have co-operated
fully with the Government and we agree with the proposals that the
Government outlined in the other place and again this evening. We are
also contributing to the Phillips review, which we welcome. My hon.
Friend the Member for Chichester (Mr. Tyrie) has put forward what we
call a green paper, which sets out a whole range of protections that
would take matters forward.</p><p><a name="06061358000071">It is true that when the
legislation was going through the House in 1999 and 2000, following the
recommendations of the Committee on Standards in Public Life, it was
thought that an element of giving or providing a financial advantage to
a political party should be the trigger for reporting. It was thought
that it was reasonable to exempt loans on commercial terms because they
were commercial transactions, where a profit was to be made by the
company. There was not that element of a gift or donation. However, as
we know, that has turned out to be something of a grey area and so we
accept that the law should be changed. We welcome the various proposals
that the Minister has outlined and we will support them
today.</p><br><notus-date day="13" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>13 Jun 2006 : Column 703</b><br><p><a name="06061358000072"><b><a name="06061358000166">Mr.
Heath:</b> I broadly welcome the amendments in this group. I
am a little disappointed that the Leader of the House is not here,
because this area is specifically one of his responsibilities. That is
one of the reasons why I retain responsibility from the Liberal
Democrat Benches for the issue. However, he is not here. No doubt we
will have an opportunity to discuss the matter with him in the
future.</p><p><a name="06061358000073">May I deal
first with amendments Nos. 61 to 63, which were moved in another place
by Lord Goodhart? This is a perfectly sensible compromise&#151;or a
proportionate response to what had become an issue. The figure 12 was
not simply plucked out of the air. It accords to the nations and
regions of the United Kingdom and enables the political parties to
describe themselves as they wish and as they feel is appropriate. The
previous figure of five was arbitrary and was perhaps over-restrictive.
I am grateful to the Government for recognising that there was some
strength in that argument and for accepting the fact that what was
proposed was a sensible move.</p><p><a name="06061358000074">I also entirely welcome
amendments Nos. 64 to 72, which build on the point that I originally
made on Second Reading about the dual reporting procedure that applied
to Members of this House. That gave rise to inconsistencies and
additional bureaucracy to no end in terms of better transparency or
regularity. The Government accepted the principle and I share the
Minister&#146;s view that a critical part of that process involved
the deliberations of the Standards and Privileges Committee, of which I
used to be a member, and the contribution to the debate of its
Chairman,the right hon. Member for North-West
Hampshire(Sir George Young). The fact that the Government have
been able to go to the Scottish Parliament, the European Parliament and
the Welsh Assembly and come up with positions that are consonant with
what is being proposed for Members of this House seems entirely
rational and right. I welcome those
amendments.</p><p><a name="06061358000075">We are
dealing with the issue of the funding of political parties. We should
not forget the genesis of these proposals. They were born out of a
certain degree of panic at the very adverse comments in the press when
it came to light that various parties were indulging in the practice of
taking loans. The clear link in the public mind&#151;I make no
comment at this stage about whether it is a real position or a
perception&#151;between the provision of loans and the acquisition of
preferment and particularly entrance to our legislature in the upper
House, is something that we simply cannot afford to allow to continue.
It is right that, as far as we can, we should reach a consensus between
the political parties to ensure that that perception is no longer
allowed to prevail.</p><p><a name="06061358000076"><b><a name="06061358000167">Mr.
MacNeil:</b> Transparency International has said that
Parliament must be beyond reproach and be seen to be beyond reproach.
Unfortunately, it has not given Westminster a clean bill of health.
Does the hon. Gentleman agree that, as yet, nothing has appeared,
especially in the Bill, that will put this Parliament beyond reproach
and give it a clean bill of
health?</p><p><a name="06061358000077"><b><a name="06061358000168">Mr.

still incumbent on us to break that 
<br><notus-date day="13" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>13 Jun 2006 : Column 704</b><br>connection. I have a simple way of breaking the connection: having
Members of the upper House up for election in a democratic process.
However, given that there is a
view&#151;</p><p><a name="06061358000078"><b><a name="06061358000169">Mr.

them.</p><p><a name="06061358000079"><b><a name="06061358000170">Mr.
Heath:</b> There is a perfectly respectable unicameralist
view; it is not one that I share, but it has its own logic, although
this House would have to do a much better job of scrutinising
legislation and holding the Government to account if we were to move to
a single Chamber. What is surely unacceptable is to have a wholly
appointed House when it is so clearly prey to the whims of individuals
in high office and the perception that there is a connection between
providing funds for political parties and entering the legislature. We
simply must not accept that in the British Parliament and we must be
absolutely clear that we will not accept it.</p><p><a name="06061358000080">The matter of loans is a small
sideshow in the process that we must now undertake to cleanse the
Augean stables of party political funding, but it is necessary and I
welcome it. The Minister said in her opening remarks that none of us
perceived the loophole when the Political Parties, Elections and
Referendums Act 2000 was going through. That is absolutely right. None
of us did. But somebody certainly did subsequently. It was clearly
subsequently noticed that this was a way in which political parties
could acquire funds without that being properly reported. There is
anecdotal evidence that people were pressed to change their intended
gift into a loan. We can only guess at what the motive for such a
change might be.</p><p><a name="06061358000081"><b><a name="06061358000171">David
Taylor:</b> Is it not the case that the ingenious and the
unprincipled will always try to evade frameworks, even though they may
be a sideshow? Should not the real focus be on things such as the
period during which donations and loans can be registered&#151;not
just restricting it to the election period? For instance, in the final
few months prior to the last general election, in four
constituencies&#151;Lancaster and Wyre, Welwyn Hatfield, The Wrekin,
and Northampton, South&#151;substantial amounts of money were spent
following donations from rich individuals and organisations, which duly
secured sizeable swings in those constituencies, which went from Labour
to Conservative. Is it not there that we ought to have tighter controls
that will give a fair impression to the electorate at
large?</p><p><a name="06061358000082"><b><a name="06061358000172">Mr.
Heath:</b> I entirely agree with the hon. Gentleman. Having
been subject to some of that increased spending, perhaps on a slightly
smaller scale, from donors outside my immediate
constituency&#151;certainly a large amount of money was spent by
central parties and one particular party in trying to wrest the seat
from me&#151;I recognise that that is a real difficulty. I said so on
Second Reading, in Committee and on Report in this House. He may recall
that I tabled amendments to try to regularise the position. To some
extent, the Bill moves to deal with that issue, but my suspicion is
that it does not go far enough and that we need to do more to 
<br><notus-date day="13" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>13 Jun 2006 : Column 705</b><br>prevent what is clearly an abuse in terms of large amounts of money
being spent in particular constituencies that are identified as
marginal. That is out of all proportion to the limits on election
spending that are properly applied to those constituencies. However, I
would be digressing too far from the Lords amendments if I were to
explore that to any great
extent.</p><p><a name="06061358000083"><b><a name="06061358000173">Mr.
Love:</b> Does the hon. Gentleman accept that the only thing
worse than having political parties that are dependent on a few rich
individuals is having political parties that are dependent on one rich
individual&#151;I am not speaking about his party when I say that?
Does he also accept that the Government have set up the review that is
being undertaken by Sir Hayden Phillips? Many of the concerns that he
and others have raised should be dealt with by that review, as should
many of the points that party members from the nations and regions
continue to press upon us. There should be all-party agreement on the
matter, and, hopefully, we can clean up the
act.</p><p><a name="06061358000084"><b><a name="06061358000174">Mr.
Heath:</b> I sincerely hope so, although Sir Hayden Phillips
will find it enormously difficult to bring together the different
strands.</p><p><a name="06061358000085">The problem
is that when political parties, at a senior level, accept donations
from individuals, the efforts of hon. Members are tarnished. I suspect
that not a single Member in the Chamber has anything to do with large
donations that are received by our respective parties. Volunteer
workers in our parties get tarred with the same brush. The whole
political process will be tarnished until we get the system right,
which is why we need as much transparency and reporting as possible
and, frankly, clear limits on both the donations and expenditure that
are appropriate. Donations and expenditure are not divorced from each
other. One cannot have limits on donation, yet unlimited expenditure,
or vice versa. Clear limits are needed to restore the faith of the
British people in our political
system.</p><p><a name="06061358000086"><b><a name="06061358000175">Mr.
Andrew Tyrie (Chichester) (Con):</b> The hon. Gentleman says
that we need clear limits and, of course, I agree with his sentiments.
Will he tell us when the Liberal party intends to come forward with its
package of comprehensive proposals for the reform of party
funding?</p><p><a name="06061358000087"><b><a name="06061358000176">Mr.
Heath:</b> I am not sure that it is entirely right to say that
we have not done so already. I accept that we have not put our
proposals together in the way in which the hon. Gentleman has done, for
which I commend him. However, I hope that he acknowledges that his
proposal on a &#163;50,000 cap has been our policy for some time. We
have been clear about the need for both that and transparent reporting.
I have made speeches in which I have made our broad attitude clear. We
will be giving evidence and working with others in the context of Sir
Hayden Phillips&#146;s review, and I hope that we will be able to
reach a consensus. However, I foresee that there will be difficulties
due to the differing perspectives and sources of income of the parties 
<br><notus-date day="13" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>13 Jun 2006 : Column 706</b><br>represented in the House. Some difficulties may be reconcilable, but
perhaps some will be irreconcilable. We should strive seriously to try
to find a consensus because if we do not, the whole of our political
and democratic process will be cheapened by our lack of ability to find
a common view.</p><p><a name="06061358000088">There
is merit in the proposals on the reporting and admissibility of loans.
I wish that such provisions had been in place some time ago. It would
have been better if we had realised the possibility of adopting them at
the time at which the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act
2000 was passed, but it is easy to be wise after the event and not to
realise the ingenuity of those who wish to circumvent any system that
is putin
place.</p><p><a name="06061358000089">I am especially
grateful to the Minister for acknowledging the strength of an argument
put forward by Lord Goodhart in another place. He made the point that
cumulative payments could be part loan and part donation, and that
several separate loans, or a mixture of loans and payments, could reach
the threshold. The Government tabled appropriate amendments to take
account of that. I am also grateful to the Minister for explaining
capitalisation in relatively simple terms and outlining her proposals
in that respect. I know that her colleague in the other place struggled
to make sense of the proposals, but I think that we understand what is
being
suggested.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="06061358000132">7.45
pm</h5><p><a name="06061358000090">The Minister
will know that we disagree with the Government on one aspect of the
proposals, although we have not tabled amendments to reflect that at
this stage because reaching consensus is more important than getting
absolutely everything. However, there is a strange anomaly that if a
loan is made before the commencement of the relevant part of the Bill
by a donor who proves to be non-permissible, it will be allowed to be
maintained as a loan, despite the fact that if it had been made after
the commencement, it would be unlawful. In such circumstances, it would
be appropriate not to criminalise the loan and retrospectively make
unlawful something that was quite lawful, but to require the loan to be
repaid after an appropriate period of time so that the situation could
be regularised. Such an approach would be logical and consistent with
what the Minister said would happen if a loan was taken in good faith
after the commencement of the legislation, but it was proved, after
further reflection, that the donor was non-permissible. In such
circumstances, the loan would have to be returned&#151;there is no
suggestion that that should not be the case&#151;so, to put it
mildly, there is a certain lack of logic behind the Government&#146;s
proposals.</p><p><a name="06061358000091">As far as
we are aware, from the evidence that we have been given, there would
not be a significant quantity of outstanding loans. Of course, a party
would be able to make a full repayment before the commencement of the
provisions, so even reporting would not be necessary because the matter
would become a closed book. Some parties will wish to take advantage of
that ability in respect of donations that come from overseas sources,
while others will not have such loans to report. Others might take the
view that they would have to make the identity of the donor public
under the requirements of the legislation if the 
<br><notus-date day="13" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>13 Jun 2006 : Column 707</b><br>loan was still outstanding, at which point they could maintain the loan,
and that would be an equally satisfactory outcome in terms of
transparency. However, a difficulty would arise if the identity of a
donor became known and it was quite clear that that person should not
have made a donation under the terms of the
Bill.</p><p><a name="06061358000092">I do not
understand the Government&#146;s position on the matter. They should
have thought again, but I acknowledge that when we made such points in
another place, two parties did not agree with our position. They might
have had their reasons for doing so, although I do not think that those
reasons were based on logic, but I accept that as we were unlikely to
secure a majority in the other place, we were certainly not going to
secure a majority here, which is I why I have not tabled amendments on
the matter
today.</p><p><a name="06061358000093"><b><a name="06061358000177">Mr.
MacNeil:</b> Am I correct in understanding the hon. Gentleman
as saying that the problem would be not the time at which the loan had
been made, but the fact that it was still alive and
outstanding?</p><p><a name="06061358000095"><b><a name="06061358000178">Mr.
Heath:</b> That is precisely so. We are talking about a loan
made before the relevant time&#151;the commencement of this part of
the Bill&#151;which is still outstanding when the Bill becomes law
and is from a non-permissible donor who would not have been able to
make it after the event. The right and sensible way to deal with that
is to require the political party in question to repay the loan not on
day one&#151;let us live in the real world&#151;but over a sensible
period. In that way, the matter is cleared up and settled, and no one
will have benefited from what would subsequently be an unlawful
donation in kind.</p><p><a name="06061358000096">I do
not need to prolong our debate. The proposals are welcome. I do not
think anyone is suggesting that they go far enough to deal with the
problems of party funding, but they are a welcome first step. What is
particularly welcome is that we have managed to achieve a degree of
consensus in a relatively short time. I hope that that consensus will
be
maintained.</p><p><a name="06061358000097"><b><a name="06061358000179">Bridget
Prentice:</b> I echo the hon. Gentleman&#146;s words. I,
too, hope that the consensus continues. I am grateful to him for saying
that we have achieved a great deal in a relatively short period. I
apologise to the House on behalf of my right hon. Friend the Leader of
the House, who cannot be here for this part of the debate because of a
previous engagement.</p><p><a name="06061358000098">I understand the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s position on pre-existing loans. We did not think
that it would be appropriate to invalidate arrangements that were
lawful when they were made. That is not the purpose of the amendments.
We did not intend to wreak havoc on the finances of different political
parties. However, he alluded to the fact that any loan that is
outstanding when the Bill becomes law will need to be reported, and
people will be able to see whether loans were given by those who become
non-permissible. People can make their own judgments as a result. The
Labour party has made clear where all its existing loans have come
from. I recommend that position to all
parties.</p><p><a name="06061358000099">The House
will have noted my emphasis throughout on explaining what the new
provisions will achieve to 
<br><notus-date day="13" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>13 Jun 2006 : Column 708</b><br>bring greater openness to the activities of political parties in
relation to loans and similar transactions. They set out a
comprehensive regime, benefiting as it does from the precedent of the
donations regime. I hope that as a result we will be able to have a
fuller debate at a later stage on some of the issues arising from that.
As I said, Sir Hayden Phillips will look at other aspects of party
political funding. No doubt we will return to the subject in another
form at a later stage.</p><p><a name="06061358000100"><i> Lords amendment agreed

Prentice:</b> The amendments relate to the registration
system. Amendments Nos. 1 to 4 relate to the co-ordinated online record
of electors. Amendment No. 5 relates to the new duty on registration
officers to maximise levels of registration. Given the earlier debate,
I do not wish to pursue the arguments on registration further at this
stage. The House has reached another consensus on the importance of
increasing registration. The amendments will ensure that registration
officers do their bit in making sure that the registers are as
comprehensive as possible.</p><p><a name="06061358000106">Amendment No. 1 was made in
response to concerns that the regulations governing the publication and
supply of information kept on CORE to bodies such as political parties
might differ greatly from those which apply to electoral returning
officers at a local level. As Ministers made clear in another place,
CORE will not change the information that is held on electoral
registers, or the records that EROs are required by law to keep, or the
persons and organisations to whom information may be supplied. It
simply acts as a central point of access.</p><p><a name="06061358000107">Some flexibility is needed,
however. For example, the CORE keeper will not be required to keep a
copy of the full register available for public inspection. There is
also flexibility because the amendment more clearly sets in law the
principle that the regulations governing access to information held in
CORE will be the same as those that apply to
EROs.</p><p><a name="06061358000108">Amendments Nos.
2 to 4 were also made in response to the concern in another place that,
as originally drafted, some of the security measures included in the
CORE provisions might call legitimate acts into question, rather than
focusing on fraudulent activity. An example of that is the potential
for large households with a number of postal voters, such as student
halls, to be flagged up as potentially 
<br><notus-date day="13" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>13 Jun 2006 : Column 709</b><br>fraudulent. Amendments Nos. 2 and 4 tighten up the Bill&#146;s
drafting so that CORE will instead focus on instances where large
numbers of postal votes have been redirected to an alternative address,
as that is a circumstance in which fraud may be
involved.</p><p><a name="06061358000109">There was
also a concern that the Bill&#146;s existing provisions would flag up
legitimate instances of a person voting as another elector&#146;s
proxy&#151;in a sense, the reverse of the earlier concern. Amendment
No. 3 responds to that by focusing again on fraudulent acts of double
voting.</p><p><a name="06061358000110">The new duty
on EROs is set out in amendmentNo. 5. The new duty is to
ensure that the electoral register is complete and comprehensive.
Clause 9 sets that out as a new duty and includes certain minimum steps

Love:</b> On amendment No. 5, the experience of my electoral
staff is that because of a shortage of people to knock on doors, they
are knocking only once. They then send a letter directly to the

not the Bill recognise the need for more than one call to be made if
the officers fail to find anyone

Prentice:</b> Amendment No. 5 addresses my hon.
Friend&#146;s concerns. He is right that one call is often not
enough. Giving EROs the duty to ensure that they have a comprehensive
register, and taking on board earlier points about the variety of ways
in which it is possible to gather that canvass, he is right to say that
it may be necessary in some cases for the canvasser to call more than
once at a particular household.</p><p><a name="06061358000114">Lords amendment No. 6 deals
with service registration, which was raised on Second Reading and in
subsequent discussions, and we have responded, I hope, to the points
that were made in the House and elsewhere. The amendment includes two
key provisions. First, it creates an order-making power to allow the
Government to extend the duration of registrations made via a service
declaration to up to five years. Current rules require declarations to
be reconfirmed annually, so the extension would make the registration
process more convenient for service personnel, particularly personnel
serving overseas. To provide a proper opportunity for parliamentary
scrutiny, any order made under the amendment would be subject to the
affirmative resolution procedure. If the power were used, it would
affect only service personnel and their spouses or civil partners. It
would not affect other persons eligible to register through a service
qualification, such as Crown servants based overseas. Traditionally, it
is much easier for Crown servants to register than it is for service
personnel to do so, so we want to address the problem experienced by
service 
<br><notus-date day="13" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>13 Jun 2006 : Column 710</b><br>personnel. In addition, the amendment does not require members of the
armed forces to register solely through a service declaration.
Servicemen and women can still register as ordinary electors if they
choose to do so.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="06061358000133">8

Roger Gale (North Thanet) (Con):</b> Everyone in the House

House.</p><p><a name="06061358000117">Secondly, the
amendment places a duty on the Ministry of Defence to keep a record of
the electoral registration details of service personnel that can be
used both as a prompt to the individual to update registration details
with the local electoral registration officer, particularly the address
to which postal votes should be sent, and as a focus for efforts to
encourage service personnel to register. The record will provide
statistical information that will allow continuous monitoring, and it
will facilitate communication between unit registration officers and
the local electoral registration officer about the numbers registered
to assist in future registration campaigns.</p><p><a name="06061358000118"><b><a name="06061358000187">Dr.
Julian Lewis:</b> Will the Minister explain the objection in
principle to reverting to the system that was used before the
Representation of the People Act 2000? The procedure that she has
outlined is extremely complicated, but our forces are far more involved
in front-line action now than they were then, so it is strange that
they cannot be registered once and for all by their units, as used to
be the case.</p><p><a name="06061358000119"><b><a name="06061358000188">Bridget
Prentice:</b> I do not accept the premise that this is a
complicated measure&#151;it is a practical and straightforward method
of ensuring that service personnel have the opportunity to register.
The previous regime was changed because it did not work effectively.
The all-party group that looked at the system concluded that it was
characterised by low registration. There are concerns in the House
about relatively low registration among service personnel, so I am
pleased that the Under-Secretary of State for Defence, my hon. Friend
the Member for West Bromwich, East (Mr. Watson), is in the Chamber, as
he has worked closely to find a way forward. The all-party group
pointed out that it was difficult for EROs to identify and communicate
with service personnel. The amendment makes that process much easier
and clearer, so I hope that the hon. Gentleman welcomes it.

explanation of the amendment, they may be reassured that it is a much
more progressive and positive way forward. It is part of a package of
measures to aid the registration of service personnel that includes
closer co-operation between the officer in each unit responsible for
electoral registration and the ERO. The MOD will issue every new
entrant to the armed forces with an electoral registration form, and it
will run campaigns during the annual canvass for service personnel
whose service declaration is about to expire. Members of the armed
forces will receive reminders in their payslips about the need to
register to vote and information such as website addresses and so on.
Access to service accommodation will be granted to electoral
registration officers. Pilot schemes for on-site polling stations at
two separate military establishments took place in this year&#146;s
local elections in Rushmoor and Westminster. Future campaigns will
include a service &#147;Registration Day&#148;, which will act as a
focal point. Unit registration officers will be pro-actively using all
appropriate measures to remind and inform service personnel and their
families both of the requirement to register to vote and of the way in
which they can do so.</p><p><a name="06061358000124"><b><a name="06061358000193">Mr.

</i>She will not receive any solace from the Under-Secretary of State
for Defence, because he does not know. The situation of the soldier on
operations is miles away from what she has discussed. The MOD and the
Electoral Commission, which does not know any better, must introduce a
system with a mechanism to enable personnel in all three services
training at home bases in the United Kingdom and on operations to
register. Inevitably, it will be at the back of the queue for personnel
who are on operations, but a great deal more work needs to be done so
that it works for our gravely diminished armed forces, many of whom are
on operations overseas. Unless we do so, the proposal will not make any

Defence will keep a record of which personnel have registered and which
have not done so, so we can see where the gaps are. Of course, he is
right that registration is more difficult for service personnel serving
overseas, but we have put in place measures that will help to achieve
his aim. My hon. Friend the Under-Secretary wrote to me saying that he
wanted to work with my Department and the Electoral

Tyrie:</b> A moment ago, the Minister said that the old system
of registration was inadequate. Of course that is true. It was
inadequate in the sense that people were left on the register after
they had left the Army. That was the primary problem&#151;not, as she
implied, that service personnel who should have been registered were
not registered. As far as I am aware, and I would be grateful if she
could confirm this, registration among service personnel under the old
scheme was comparable to that among the civilian population. Has she
made any estimate of the level of registration that would result from
the scheme that she has proposed
tonight?</p><p><a name="06061370000005"><b><a name="06061370000603">Bridget
Prentice:</b> I do not believe that substantially more
service personnel were registered under the old scheme. There were
similar problems of under-registration to those that we recognise now
among the young men and women in our armed forces. The record that the
Ministry of Defence will keep will enable us to target registration
gaps.</p><p><a name="06061370000006"><b><a name="06061370000604">Mr.
Tyrie:</b> I am amazed by the Minister&#146;s comments. When
I looked into the matter in 2004, prior to the last election, I
discovered that in the year before the introduction of the new scheme,
registration was over 87 per cent. in a ward in my constituency where
there were almost exclusively service personnel, and that after the
introduction of the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act
2000 registration had fallen to42 or 43 per cent. I would be
very surprised if that or a similar situation were not replicated right
across the United Kingdom, in view of the Government&#146;s own
survey, which shows a drop and an appallingly low level of service
personnel participation in the
election.</p><p><a name="06061370000007"><b><a name="06061370000605">Bridget
Prentice:</b> I want to try to reassure the hon. Gentleman,
because I know how concerned he is. He has raised the issue on a number
of occasions. Under the old scheme, as he rightly points out, the
declaration remained valid for five years. That sometimes had the
effect of people being registered at an address that was no longer
theirs, which distorted the register. There has historically been
under-registration. I am grateful to my friends at the MOD for
undertaking to be proactive in registering people wherever it is
appropriate for them to be registered. There are service personnel who
will continue to register to vote as ordinary electors, if they so
wish. We would not wish to prevent them from doing
so.</p><p><a name="06061370000008"><b><a name="06061370000606">Simon

able to tell whether those serving in Afghanistan, Iraq, Cyprus and
elsewhere are also registering in sufficiently high numbers? Unless we
have that information, we will not be able to ensure that those who are

to achieve and I have some sympathy with that. I am not sure that any
system would allow us to do that. People move from one posting to
another. We might get a snapshot of the situation, but I cannot
guarantee that we could get a comprehensive result from studying
overseas postings. In the discussions with colleagues in the MOD, we
will consider how comprehensive the information is that we can give, in

examples, such as the Marines, who have a base in my patch. If asked,
the Marines might agree to do a check. We know how many Marines there
are, though of course they move around the world. We could see whether
the registration figure was 50 per cent., 80 per cent. or whatever, and
that would give us some idea. It is those who are most mobile who
should concern us

Julian Lewis:</b> The Minister has been extremely generous in
giving way. I am puzzled by the fact that she does not seem to be aware
of the survey that was published only last week by the
Government&#146;s own Defence Analytical Services Agency, which went
to the heart of the point raised by my hon. Friend the Member for
Mid-Sussex (Mr. Soames), that when we are speaking about servicemen
based at home it is an entirely different kettle of fish from
servicemen based overseas, often on active service. The survey showed
that only 34 per cent. of UK personnel serving overseas were
registered, compared with 64 per cent. of those based in the UK. That
is a massive disparity, and no amount of tinkering with the new system
can bridge that
gap.</p><p><a name="06061370000013"><b><a name="06061370000611">Bridget

reasons that it was published last week was to inform this very debate.
The Ministry of Defence wanted hon. Members to understand the present
situation. In its co-operation with me and with my Department on the
Bill, the MOD has given a very positive steer on the work that should
be done. The figure of 34 per cent., which none of us would say is high
enough, does not take account of the fact that some service personnel
are registered at home. When we bandy about statistics, we must make
sure that we cover all the options. I am not satisfied with the number
of service personnel who are registered, and neither are my colleagues
in the MOD, which is why we

a magnificent job of a sow&#146;s ear. Does she accept that what is

of the points that she makes. Prior to the last election, my hon.
Friends the Members for Chichester (Mr. Tyrie) and for New Forest, East
(Dr. Lewis) and I, when I was shadow Secretary of State for Defence,
and many others pointed out repeatedly that registration was not being
properly carried out. We heard that from everywhere. It is galling that
it was so dismally badly done. In order to remedy the problem, the hon.
Lady will have to deal more specifically with the point that my hon.
Friend the Member for New Forest, East made about servicemen serving
overseas. It is more important that they know of their right and their
chance to vote than it is for people sitting comfortably at
home.</p><p><a name="06061370000018"><b><a name="06061370000615">Bridget

to my colleagues in the MOD for the positive and supportive way in
which they have responded to the issue. We will do everything that we

to represent our country abroad in very dangerous situations without
giving them every opportunity to vote in any of our
elections.</p><p><a name="06061370000021">Amendments
Nos. 78, 87, 94, 105, 107 to 109 and 124 were introduced in the House
of Lords by Lord Rix and Lord Carter with support from the Government.
They deal with the abolition of common law incapacity and relate to
assistance for people with disabilities. The other amendments in the
group are consequential, and they change the terms &#147;physical
cause&#148;, &#147;physical incapacity&#148; and
&#147;incapacity&#148; to &#147;disability&#148;.</p><p><a name="06061370000022">Amendment No. 78 abolishes any
common law rule that links a person&#146;s capacity to vote to their
mental state. That is what currently ties the language of
&#147;idiots&#148; and &#147;lunatics&#148; to electoral
legislation, and it has led to disabled people being denied the right
to 
<br><notus-date day="13" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>13 Jun 2006 : Column 715</b><br>vote. That link is derived from outmoded concepts and terminology found
in 14th-century statute law and 18th-century cases. It has led to
election officials making unjustified assumptions about the mental
capacity of disabled people, and it has no place in modern law and our
modern democracy. Amendment No. 78, which has been developed in
conjunction with organisations such as Scope and Sense, will allow
disabled people to be subject to exactly the same eligibility criteria
as everyone
else.</p><p><a name="06061370000023">Other amendments
in the group clarify the language used about disabled people in
election law, replacing the word &#147;incapacity&#148; with the
word &#147;disability&#148;, which is a much more appropriate term
for the purposes of election law, because it encompasses all forms of
disability and does not simply imply mental incapacity. I am proud that
the Government have eradicated that language and the behaviour that it
encourages from electoral
law.</p><p><a name="06061370000024">Amendments Nos.
82 and 83 relate to anonymous registration and the names of electors
allocated to polling stations. As it stands, the returning officer
would have no obligation to provide the parts of the register that
contain entries relating to those who are anonymously registered. The
amendments correct that by substituting &#147;names of&#148; in
rule 29(3)(c) for &#147;entries relating to&#148;, and similar
consequential changes are already included at other points within the
Bill.</p><p><a name="06061370000025">Amendment No. 83
makes a small change to the provisions relating to anonymously
registered electors. Paragraph 15(7) of schedule 1 allows the electoral
number of an anonymous entry to be included in the edited version of
the register, which is available for general sale. Although an
anonymously registered person&#146;s name and address will not appear
on the edited register, we believe that the inclusion of even the
elector&#146;s number creates a small potential risk, particularly in
registers that cover a small area where undue attention could be drawn
to an anonymous entry. The risk is small, but it could be avoided
altogether if the edited register were not to include anonymous
entries.</p><p><a name="06061370000026">Conservative
amendments (a) and (b) would create a system in which the relevant
Department would have to register service personnel and Crown servants,
unless those people chose to opt out, and they would have significant
resource implications. Apart from setting up the system, the Department
would be obliged to check with the relevant electoral registration
officer that the relevant person was actually registered to vote, which
would be extremely time-consuming and costly. In addition, the
amendments cover all Departments, which seems unnecessary because, with
the exception of service personnel, about whom I have already spoken at
length, we have no evidence to suggest that there is a problem with
electoral registration among employees of other Departments. I
therefore askthe hon. Member for North-East
Hertfordshire(Mr. Heald) to withdraw the
amendment.</p><p><a name="06061370000027"><b><a name="06061370000618">Mr.
Heald:</b> My hon. Friend the Member for Chichester (Mr.
Tyrie) and other Conservative Members have pressed the Government hard
to tackle the problems that have arisen for service voters since the
2000 Act. Although the 2000 Act gave service voters various ways to
register, the fact that only 
<br><notus-date day="13" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>13 Jun 2006 : Column 716</b><br>46 per cent. of servicemen and women, and just 28 per cent. of those
based overseas, voted in the last general election indicates the
serious nature of the problem. Those concerns prompted the MOD to
conduct the survey, which showed that only 60 per cent. of service
personnel were registered to vote at the last general election. The
Army had a significantly lower registration rate than either the Navy
or the RAF. Furthermore, only 34 per cent. of those serving overseas
were registered compared with 64 per cent. of those based in the UK,
which is the point that my hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Sussex (Mr.
Soames) made a moment
ago.</p><p><a name="06061370000028">Those findings
are disappointing and show that urgent action is needed to address the
problem. However, the actual registration figures are probably worse
than the MOD figures suggest. The overall response rate to the survey
was only 45 per cent, but in the key category of other ranks in the
Army based overseas only 26 per cent. bothered to return the survey, of
whom only one third were registered. The report accepts that personnel
who did not respond may well have different voting and registration
experiences from those who did. It makes sense that those who returned
the survey were a self-selected group and were therefore much more
likely to include those who were registered to vote. In my view, those
who failed to return the survey will almost certainly be people who
tend to fail to return electoral registration forms, andI
think that that means that significantly less than34 per cent.
of servicemen and women serving overseas are
registered.</p><p><a name="06061370000029">The
current situation is very concerning. Of those who responded to the
survey, 61 per cent. were unaware that they had to re-register every
year, and that percentage increased to 71 per cent. among those
overseas. The Constitutional Affairs Committee has called on the MOD to
look into that issue. Amendment No. 6 does not go very far, because it
simply encourages the MOD to register its personnel rather than making
it a requirement or duty. One therefore has to ask whether working for
the MOD, serving as a soldier in dangerous circumstances, is just like
any other job, or whether it imposes some greater duty on the employer
compared with the position of a student or other person on civvy
street. The Army pamphlet, &#147;Basically fair: equality and
diversity in the British Army&#148;,
says:</p><a name="06061370000591"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;As a
soldier you are expected to put the needs of the Service first and to
forgo some of the rights enjoyed in civilian life. In return you can at
all times expect to be treated fairly, and to be valued and respected
as an individual.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06061370000030">In
other words, a soldier does not have the full rights of civilian life
and is expected to put the needs of the service first. In many cases,
as we know, soldiers give much more than others&#151;indeed, they
give their lives. In those circumstances, surely the MOD can do as well
as a university.</p><p><a name="06061370000031"><b><a name="06061370000619">The

on the MOD to register a person to vote</p><a name="06061370000592"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;unless under the provision of
subsection (3AA) they decline to do
so&#148;.</p></ul><p><a name="06061370000033">Of course it is a
matter of personal choice for the person who is serving as to whether
they want to be registered. If the Minister had been here earlier, he
would have heard our debate about registration generally, with Members
giving examples of universities registering their students and
households where the father registers the rest of the family.
Servicemen are not in that position. They are in places such as
Helmand, where the situation is extremely difficult and this will not
be the first thing on their minds. Many of my hon. Friends and other
Members think it important that our servicemen should always have the
right to vote. If that means a little extra trouble for the MOD, so be
it.</p><p><a name="06061370000034"><b><a name="06061370000621">Mr.
Ronnie Campbell:</b> My son is in the Royal Marines and has
been for many years. He always managed to get a proxy vote and left it
to his mother&#151;now to his wife, of course&#151;to vote on his
behalf. Is that a better way
forward?</p><p><a name="06061370000035"><b><a name="06061370000622">Mr.

ensure that the MOD has a duty placed on it to do something about this.
I do not know so much about the Army&#151;we will hear from Members
who do&#151;but I would guess that if it is a requirement and a duty,
the Army will do it, but if it is a matter of guidance or discretion,
it is very much up in the air. The figures suggest that it is not
happening at the
moment.</p><p><a name="06061370000036"><b><a name="06061370000623">Philip
Davies:</b> Does my hon. Friend think it bizarre that the
Government earlier rejected a sensible proposal to introduce the use of
national insurance numbers to prevent fraud because it would lead to a
drop in registration, yet they will not take this step, which would
guarantee increased registration among servicemen? Why do the
Government seem not to care about the registration levels specifically
of people in our armed
forces?</p><p><a name="06061370000037"><b><a name="06061370000624">Mr.
Heald:</b> That is a good question. It is sad that the MOD is
not prepared to do this for our servicemen. The special circumstances
of the armed forces mean that we should err on the side of preserving
their right to vote, and any inertia should operate in favour of
democracy.</p><p><a name="06061370000038"><b><a name="06061370000625">Bridget

Defence in that respect. I should have thought that he would at least
recognise that and be slightly more consensual about the way
forward.</p><p><a name="06061370000040"><b><a name="06061370000626">Mr.
Heald:</b> As the Under-Secretary knows, I believe that
amendment No. 6 is better than nothing and I congratulate all those,
including my noble Friend Baroness Hanham, who managed to wring it out
of the Ministry of Defence. However, if she reads further, she will
realise that the Ministry of Defence is required to
secure</p><a name="06061370000594"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;(so far as
circumstances permit) an effective opportunity of exercising from time
to time as occasion may require the
rights&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06061370000041">to register and
to vote. That is not the same as requiring the Ministry of Defence to
effect the registration of servicemen. I want that to happen. There is
a difference between us and I hope that I have made the point clearly.
We do not agree and I would therefore like to press amendment (a) to a
Division, because our servicemen deserve
it.</p><p><a name="06061370000042"><b><a name="06061370000627">Simon
Hughes:</b> Before I come on to the substantive debate about
service personnel, I emphasise that we support all the other amendments
and I am grateful to the Government for accepting them. Some of them
were tabled by Opposition Members, including colleagues of mine. Lord
Greaves and others pressed some and I am grateful that they have been
accepted.</p><p><a name="06061370000043">The main
debate is about Lords amendment No. 6 and amendment (a), which the hon.
Member for North-East Hertfordshire (Mr. Heald) tabled. I hope that we
are all united in our view that we must deal with a severe problem. The
hon. Gentleman read out the figures, which my noble Friend Lord Garden
cited in the debate in the Lords. They show that there has been a
considerable drop in the number of registered service personnel and the
number of service personnel who vote, and a worse drop in the number of
service personnel overseas who vote. That is evident from the facts. We
are grateful for the figures but even they may hide the
reality.</p><p><a name="06061370000044">What should
be done? I hope that I do not inappropriately betray confidences when I
say that I know that the Department for Constitutional Affairs has been
keen for some time to press the Ministry of Defence to make a set of
commitments. It has also been keen for the proposal that has now come
from the Lords to be agreed. I believe that it is generally known that
the Ministry of Defence did not sign up to that until the recent
reshuffle. The Secretary of State and the Under-Secretary of State for
Defence, who is present, made it clear that they shared the view of the
Department for Constitutional Affairs. I pay tribute to them for making
their views clear and for the fact that, at last, there was an end to
the differences between the two
Departments.</p><p><a name="06061370000045">Lord
Garden, who was a Chief of the Defence Staff in a previous life, knows
about such matters. He sensed that there was resistance in the Ministry
of Defence and said so. He made it clear that the resistance was
unacceptable. The Government have now accepted the amendment that my
noble Friend originally tabled and that was supported by the Opposition
parties and others. It is now before us, with Government support. 
<br><notus-date day="13" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>13 Jun 2006 : Column 719</b><br>There is a remaining difference, which is not big, between the
Government position, for which we voted in the House of Lords, and
amendment (a). My colleagues and I are sympathetic to its objective
but, given that Lords amendment No. 6 is the proposal&#151;indeed,
the exact words&#151;that we tabled, it would be unfair to say to the
Government, &#147;Thank you very much. You&#146;ve tabled what we
were tabling, but we&#146;re going to vote against it.&#148; In all
logic and honesty, we must be consistent about
that.</p><p><a name="06061370000046"><b><a name="06061370000628">Mr.
Heald:</b> It is true that that might appear odd but, although
Lords amendment No. 6 takes the matter further, it does not contain
everything that we wanted. Could not the hon. Gentleman be tempted into
the Lobby with
us?</p><p><a name="06061370000047"><b><a name="06061370000629">Simon
Hughes:</b> I am always willing to be tempted but I shall have
to show some discipline to the troops who will emerge at the
appropriate moment. <i> [Interruption.] </i>They keep coming to ask me
when they will be required and I have told them that it will not be
before half-time in the Brazil <i> v. </i>Croatia game.</p><p><a name="06061370000048">Let me get back to the serious
matter before us. I hope that a combination of the proposal before us,
as agreed by the other place, and all the undertakings that the
Ministry of Defence has given, will be put in place. Speaking bluntly,
it will be a disgrace if they are not. We have had an undertaking that
there will be registration campaigns and visits to barracks and service
quarters, and that people will be given an opportunity to register when
they sign up and regularly thereafter. We have also been assured that
they will be able to stay on the register for three, four or five years
rather than just one. In that way, they will not have to worry about
registering each year if they are deployed away from home, which is
clearly an improvement. The MOD will have to ensure that it provides
the facilities and regular opportunities for service personnel at home
and for those going around the world to be on the list, so that they
can exercise their right to vote, whether in person, by post or by
proxy.</p>

<p><a name="06061370000049">It is
reasonable to stop at that point now, however, because it would change
the nature of the relationship if we made the Ministry of Defence
unique in being the only employer to have to do this for its personnel.
I can see the argument for doing that and I am sympathetic to where the
hon. Member for North-East Hertfordshire (Mr. Heald) and his
Conservative colleagues are coming from on this matter, but it would be
slightly inconsistent to do so. There are diplomatic personnel, civil
servants and people in the private sector, as well as other people in
public services who are sent out round the world. It would be slightly
illogical to place a unique duty on the MOD to do this for its own
people if a similar obligation did not exist for, say, a university
sending some of its staff abroad, or for the House sending some of our
Clerks to a conference of the Inter-Parliamentary Union or the
Commonwealth Parliamentary Association.</p><p><a name="06061370000050">We will judge the results of
these measures by what we see. If numbers are not restored to their
former levels or better, we shall have to go further&#151;either in
practice or in legislation. But I hope that the message has been sent
out loud and clear by the Ministers to the Chief of the Defence Staff,
and I hope that it will be 
<br><notus-date day="13" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>13 Jun 2006 : Column 720</b><br>clear as soon as the provision becomes law that people will be expected
to comply with it. I hope that it willbe reviewed regularly,
not only by the Electoral Commission and the Government, but by all
colleagues in all parties in the House.</p><p><a name="06061370000051">I end by echoing what has been
said by the hon. Member for Mid-Sussex (Mr. Soames) and others. Like
them, I have many constituents who have served abroad. One of my staff
has just come back from serving with the Marines in Iraq, and
colleagues of mine have family members who have served all over the
world. The reality is that, of all people who have an entitlement to
vote and who should have the opportunity to do so, those who put their
lives onthe line for their country deserve that opportunity
the most. It should be made as easy for them as possible to achieve
that, and this provision represents a good step forward. If it is
insufficient, we will go further. Given that we argued for this and
that the Government have delivered, we will support them in the Lobby
tonight. However, I hope that they and the MOD understand that, this
time, they have to deliver. There must be no fudging; otherwise, they
will certainly be hearing a lot more from
us.</p><p><a name="06061370000052"><b><a name="06061370000630">Mr.
Soames:</b> Few of us in the House can resistthe
blandishments of the Under-Secretary of Statefor
Constitutional Affairs, the hon. Member for Lewisham, East (Bridget
Prentice), except perhaps on fox hunting. She is regarded on this side
of the House as being eminently sound. There is no one here tonight who
would not applaud what the MOD is trying to do. I accept that, but I
rise to support the amendment tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for
North-East Hertfordshire (Mr. Heald) and by the new shadow Secretary of
State, my hon. Friend the Member for Woodspring (Dr. Fox).</p><p><a name="06061370000053">There are servicemen and women
who do not want to vote. My hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Norfolk (Mr.
Simpson), who was an instructor at Sandhurst, will be well aware that
many officers, in particular, who wear the Queen&#146;s uniform feel
that it is improper to vote and do not want to do so. Indeed, that was
often the case in my own regiment. However, they amount to a minuscule
number.</p><p><a name="06061370000054">The reason
that the figures were so bad at the last election was that so many of
our troops were away on operations. The shaming thing is that the Army
is worse than anyone else at arranging for its staff to vote, and that
is why the amendment is so important. The Navy has been going away
regularly for ever and ever, and the naval family service is much the
best of the three services&#146; family organisations, so the Navy
will have in place some form of proxy voting, as the hon. Member for
North Southwark and Bermondsey (Simon Hughes) suggested. It will be
custom-made, and the Navy takes the trouble to make sure that its
people can vote. The Royal Air Force is a particularly fluffy
service&#151;and rightly&#151;in respect of its personnel and it
has always taken more trouble over its people, but historically, the
Army has never taken enough trouble. The majority of service personnel
working overseas are, of course, soldiers. That is why the figures were
particularly bad, which makes it even more important for the Ministry
of Defence to get it right.</p><br><notus-date day="13" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>13 Jun 2006 : Column 721</b><br><h5 align="left"><a name="06061370000598">8.45
pm</h5><p><a name="06061370000055">I welcome the
steps that are being taken. I also welcome the Under-Secretary to his
new position and wish him the best of luck serving what is without
doubt the most fascinating and challenging Department in Whitehall. I
particularly want him to understand that getting the Ministry of
Defence to do anything is like plucking teeth out of a chicken. It is
extremely difficult. It means playing to a number of audiences that
have all got to do the same thing.</p><p><a name="06061370000056">In order to get these
provisions to work in respect of operations overseas, we need to look
not to the civilian staff, but to the chain of command and the
hierarchy. When it comes to dealing with a divisional or brigade
headquarters, we could think of Brigadier Butler of the 16th Air
Assault Brigade being given a rocket about voting problems in the
middle of trying to sort out Helmand province&#151;a ridiculous
thought. There has to be a joined-up, coherent, sensible, grown-up,
practical and common-sense system in place to enable soldiers to be
told exactly what their rights are before they deploy. They must know
that they have the right to vote and that if they wish to exercise it,
arrangements will be made for them to do so.</p><p><a name="06061370000057">It is very important for the
Under-Secretary of State for Constitutional Affairs to understand that,
if she is going to make it work by ensuring that the services make it
work, it will require an effort of will from the chain of command in
all the services, but particularly in the Army, to get those
arrangements made. Not to do so would be inexcusable. The Ministry of
Defence did very badly at the last election. We called it to account
for what was happening several times in parliamentary questions and the
then Minister of State for the Armed Forces was either very badly
informed or given less than frank answers by officials. The position in
respect of service voting was deplorable and even though it is, as I
say, difficult to organise, it should have been done a great deal
better than it was. I pay tribute to the work of my hon. Friend the
Member for Chichester (Mr. Tyrie), who hung on like a terrier
throughout.</p><p><a name="06061370000058">I welcome
the amendment and commend the Minister for his approach. I applaud the
fact that the Ministry of Defence is going to implement this, but it
will require an effort of will by the Minister to see it through to
fruition.</p><p><a name="06061370000059"><b><a name="06061370000631">Mr.
Gale:</b> I rise to support amendments (a) and (b) and in so
doing, I seek to honour a pledge to a group of men and women from whose
company I have recently returned. Under the auspices of the armed
forces parliamentary scheme, it was my privilege earlier this month to
spend a few days on HMS Bulwark in the Gulf. That ship, with its men
and women of the Royal Navy, its Royal Marine commandos and naval
aviators, will have been on deployment for seven months by the time she
returns to home waters. During that time, the most recent
elections&#151;the local government elections, gently to correct my
hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Sussex (Mr. Soames)&#151;took
place.</p><p><a name="06061370000060">Ordinarily,
when MPs visit military establishments, whether they be floating or
shore-based, they expect to hear complaints about pay and conditions
and all sorts of things. However, for the first time ever on my visits 
<br><notus-date day="13" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>13 Jun 2006 : Column 722</b><br>to military establishments&#151;I remind the House that I have been
Parliamentary Private Secretary to two Ministers of State, so I have
visited many&#151;I heard military men and women complain about the
right to vote, or, more exactly, being denied it.</p><p><a name="06061370000061">Those people discovered during
the local government elections that they were effectively disfranchised
and it mattered to them because they also felt that they should not
have to pay council tax when they are away for such a long time. That
is adding insult to injury, when they not only have to pay the council
tax, but are unable to vote in council elections, and it was a cause of
considerable irritation to them.</p><p><a name="06061370000062">When people are deployed away
from home and their families for as long as those men and women have
been away, these issues matter. When they are in the teeth of
danger&#151;as they were in the Gulf, as they are now in the Red sea
and as they will be until they return home safely, we hope, in two or
three months&#146; time&#151;they feel very strongly that we, their
elected representatives, are letting them
down.</p><p><a name="06061370000063">To come
specifically to amendments (a) and (b), I wish to support them because
I believe that they will strengthen the measures contained in Lords
amendment No. 6. The Minister said that one of the reasons for
resisting those amendments was that there were&#151;I quote
exactly&#151;&#147;resource implications&#148;. I suggest to the
hon. Lady that there are very considerable resource implications for
the men and women who are prepared to put their lives on the line for
this country. Frankly, if we cannot provide those boys and
girls&#151;that is what they are in many cases&#151;with the
resources to enable them to take part in the democratic process, we
bring shame upon ourselves and do no justice to
them.</p><p><a name="06061370000064">I hope and
believe that the Minister will think again, look at those two modest
amendments and recognise that what my hon. Friend the Member for
North-East Hertfordshire (Mr. Heald) and their other signatories have
sought to do is not to undermine the Government&#146;s position, but
to strengthen that of our armed forces and to send out a very clear
message to those men and women who serve in extremely difficult and
dangerous places overseas: &#147;We respect you. We admire you. We
understand your needs. We recognise your democratic rights.&#148; And
in the House of Commons, we are prepared to vote for them
tonight.</p><p><a name="06061370000065"><b><a name="06061370000632">Mr.
Tyrie: </b>We heard the best possible justification
inadvertently made by the Liberal spokesman for a scheme designed
uniquely for servicemen, when the hon. Member for North Southwark and
Bermondsey (Simon Hughes) tried to draw a comparison between sending
Commons&#146; Clerks on an Inter-Parliamentary Union conference and
sending servicemen to Helmand province. That seems to be a different
order of responsibility and risk. It is clear from that example that
there is a case for devising a scheme specifically for servicemen in
their unique
circumstances.</p><p><a name="06061370000066">I am
very grateful to hon. Members for referring to the campaign that I ran
before the last general election&#151;in fact, it started in
2004&#151;to try to draw attention to the issue. This is one of the
great scandals&#151;the other is postal voting&#151;that came out
of the 2005 general election, and neither of them have yet 
<br><notus-date day="13" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>13 Jun 2006 : Column 723</b><br>been adequately addressed. However, we have made some progress on this
issue at least, and I pay tribute to the Minister of State, Department
for Constitutional Affairs, the right hon. and learned Member for
Camberwell and Peckham (Ms Harman), who certainly had her heart in the
right place on the issue, and I strongly suspect that the Minister does
too.</p><p><a name="06061370000067">We have made
progress in several ways. First, I had to press the Government for a
survey, but we managed to get one in the end. Although it is faulty, as
my hon. Friend the Member for North-East Hertfordshire (Mr. Heald)
pointed out a moment ago, it tells us none the less some of the
information that we need to know. It tells us that much more work is
still to be done and that a lot of servicemen are not
registered.</p><p><a name="06061370000068">We have
also made progress because we have a Government proposal. It is the
product of extensive horse-trading and tension between the two
Departments represented on the Front Bench now. The Under-Secretary of
State for Constitutional Affairs, the hon. Member for Lewisham, East
(Bridget Prentice) and the Under-Secretary of State for Defence, the
hon. Member for West Bromwich, East (Mr. Watson) look as though they
are getting on fine at the moment&#151;I am sure that, as Ministers,
they are&#151;but I have been briefed by members of their Departments
about the to-ing and fro-ing that has been going on behind the scenes,
and it has been substantial at
times.</p><p><a name="06061370000069">The
Government&#146;s proposal is to extend registration for up to five
years&#151;that is a step forward&#151;but the second part, which
is more problematic, is to place a duty on the Ministry of Defence to
keep a record of the registration of service personnel. The Minister
rather gave the game away when she said that the record would be used
to act as a prompt to encourage registration. That is well short of the
requirement that we need. The Minister said that she had been
encouraged by assurances about the way in which the MOD would run the
scheme, and that those assurances would enable the problem to be
resolved. We cannot, however, keep relying on assurances from the MOD.
The MOD understandably has different priorities. It does not want to
act as a registration officer; it never did. It would rather not have
such an administrative responsibility, and it was happy to see the back
of the old scheme with the introduction of the Political Parties,
Elections and Referendums Act 2000. That is why I worry that underlying
the Government&#146;s proposals will be a dependence on a level of
will of the MOD to make them work. That may not always be sufficient.
That is why I want the provisions bolstered.</p><p><a name="06061370000070">I am sorry that the Liberal
Democrats will not join us in the Lobby tonight, as they tabled an
inadequate amendment in the House of Lords and do not want to vote
against their own proposals. We should support the amendment tabled by
my hon. Friend the Member for North-East Hertfordshire, which will
place a duty on the MOD to make sure that all reasonable steps are
taken to get service personnel back on the register. On many occasions,
I have outlined in the House why that is essential. It is not too much
to ask of the MOD, and it is particularly important at this time, when
we have service personnel, putting their lives at risk to bring
democracy to other countries, who have themselves recently been left
disfranchised, and who may yet, even 
<br><notus-date day="13" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>13 Jun 2006 : Column 724</b><br>as a result of this measure, find themselves still disfranchised. That
will not do.</p><p><a name="06061370000071"><b><a name="06061370000633">Dr.
Julian Lewis:</b> I promised my party&#146;s business
managers that were I fortunate enough to catch your eye, Madam Deputy
Speaker, I would make an exceedingly brief speech. Fulfilling that
promise has been made much easier by the outstanding contributions of
my four hon. Friends who have spoken before me, and by the outstanding
generosity of the Minister in allowing me to make many of my points in
interventions.</p><p><a name="06061370000072">Earlier this afternoon, I
listened avidly to that section of the proceedings dealing with the
argument about whether simply being required to give a specimen
signature, as well as one or two other minor matters, might be a
deterrent to people to register. The hon. Member for Vale of Clwyd
(Chris Ruane) described how such simple, little hurdles had been enough
to reduce registration in those parts of the country where they had
been incorporated into electoral law. The hon. Member for Sheffield,
Attercliffe (Mr. Betts), after I intervened on him to point out that
the reason for those reductions might be that the names on the list
were those of non-existent people rather than of genuine people who
felt that they could no longer be troubled to register, replied that
even if that might be true in some cases, it was more important to get
the genuine people on to the list, even if the price to be paid was
that some bogus names were kept on the list.
</p><p><a name="06061370000073">If having to give a
national insurance number or signature, or having to register
individually in some way, has such a depressing effect on the numbers
of people who register to vote, might not roadside bombs,
rocket-propelled grenades, snipers and all the other threats to life
and limb that our servicemen and women face every day on active service
conceivably have an effect on their willingness, year after
year&#151;no matter how strongly urged by conscientious,
democracy-loving MOD civil servants&#151;to sit down and fill in
their forms dutifully? We have seen from the survey the massive
differential between the numbers who register to vote when overseas and
the numbers, even of servicemen and women, who do so when based at
home. We have only heard one real argument against the amendment tabled
by my hon. Friend the Member for North-East Hertfordshire (Mr. Heald):
that advanced by the hon. Member for North Southwark and Bermondsey
(Simon Hughes). I must tell the hon. Gentleman that the idea that civil
servants, diplomats and, heaven help us, Members of Parliament will
feel aggrieved because when they go abroad they will not be registered
automatically, unlike front-line soldiers, sailors and airmen, is
something that I would have expected to hear from him on April
fool&#146;s day rather than during a serious debate.</p><p><a name="06061370000074">I see no intellectual argument
against what my hon. Friend proposes, and I see every moral argument in
favour of it. It will be a shame indeed if and when the amendment is
defeated by the Government and the Liberal Democrats
tonight.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="06061370000599">9

responsible for the registration of her military personnel.</p><p><a name="06061370000076">Unlike the hon. Member for
North Southwark and Bermondsey (Simon Hughes), I support amendments (a)
and (b). Many reasons could be given for claiming that members of the
emergency services frequently risk their lives and do things that are
beyond the norm, but I think that most Members would agree that the
armed forces are different, in that they have unlimited liability. They
do not work shifts; they can be mobilised literally within an hour, be
at Brize Norton and, increasingly, be sent off on overseas
operations.</p><p><a name="06061370000077">Fifteen
years ago, before the collapse of the Warsaw pact, the armed forces
were largely stationary. They were based either in this country or in
Germany, and the Ministry of Defence had a paternalistic attitude
towards them. As my hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Sussex (Mr. Soames)
suggested, many of them may not have wanted to vote in one way or
another. However, I believe that circumstances have changed. I think
that our military personnel should be treated differently, first
because of the nature and tempo of operations, secondly because many
Members in all parties have received complaints not just from military
personnel but from their families&#151;there was considerable
foot-dragging on the Government&#146;s part before the general
election&#151;and thirdly because the tempo of elections has speeded
up. We are seeing more frequent elections at local, national and
European level.</p><p><a name="06061370000078">I
also feel strongly that the MOD and its personnel should be given an
opportunity to have the right to vote. I suggest, particularly to the
Minister responsible for the armed forces, that denying them that
opportunity will increase the likelihood of an inclination towards some
form of military federation. Sadly, as we know, many members of the
armed forces have begun to view the chain of command with considerable
suspicion. I suggest to the MOD that one way in which Ministers can
show that they are in touch with the armed forces is to go the whole
hog and support amendments (a) and
(b).</p><p><a name="06061370000079"><b><a name="06061370000635">Bridget
Prentice:</b> We have had a very good debate. I noted and
understood the passion with which Members made their case. I hope that
Members in all parts of the House will recognise that Ministers in both
the Department for Constitutional Affairs and the Ministry of Defence
have tried to deal with the concerns raised here&#151;particularly by
the hon. Member for Chichester (Mr. Tyrie)&#151;and in the other
place. I hope that Opposition Members will read the Lords amendment in
detail. It may not go as far as they would like, but it gives the
Secretary of State for Defence an obligation to encourage registration.
I also hope that they do not continue to make a mistake that has been
made in some contributions to the debate, which is to mix up
registration with deciding to vote; there is a difference between being
on the register and then making the conscious decision to go out and
vote. </p><p><a name="06061370000080">I remind
Members that there are other amendments in this group&#151;affecting
people with disabilities, and so on&#151;that I hope they can
support. Nevertheless, while I

Prentice:</b> Amendment No. 16 is a technical amendment that
relates to the dividing of electoral wards in Scotland into polling
districts. As originally drafted, clause 20 defines an electoral ward
in Scotland by reference to section 5 of the Local Government etc.
(Scotland) Act 1994, but the definition in section 5 is to 
<br><notus-date day="13" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>13 Jun 2006 : Column 730</b><br>be repealed and replaced by a definition set out in section 1 of the
Local Governance (Scotland) Act 2004, which will come into force in
November this year. The amendment therefore ensures that the Bill
refers to the correct
statute.</p><p><a name="06061370000560"><b><a name="06061370001103">Dr.
Gavin Strang (Edinburgh, East) (Lab):</b> On the face of it,
it seems that we are simply replacing the reference to the UK statute
with a reference to the Scottish Parliament statute. My hon. Friend
will know that this Parliament determines the electoral laws for
elections to the Scottish Parliament, but the Scottish Parliament
determines the electoral laws for elections to local councils in
Scotland. There has been a lot of concern about the management of the
elections that are to take place in May 2007. Many would argue that the
arrangements are a dog&#146;s breakfast&#151;indeed, it has been
suggested that some places will need two polling stations and people
will have to go to both to cast their votes in the two elections. I
understand that that might not be necessary, but can my hon. Friend
assure us that the amendment will not facilitate its happening in
future?</p>

<p><a name="06061370000561"><b><a name="06061370001104">Bridget
Prentice:</b> I can give my right hon. Friend that assurance.
We are simplifying the procedure to make sure that the Bill reflects
the definition in the most recent Act of the Scottish
Parliament.</p><p><a name="06061370000562"><b><a name="06061370001105">Mr.
Heald:</b> But concern remains about people having to go to
two polling stations if more than one election is taking place. Is the
Minister able to give us solace on that point by stating that people
will have to go to only one polling
station?</p><p><a name="06061370000563"><b><a name="06061370001106">Bridget
Prentice:</b> I can most certainly give the hon. Gentleman
that solace. There will be only one polling station.</p><p><a name="06061370000564">Amendments Nos. 17 and 18
relate to false statements at nomination. They are consequential on the
removal of what was clause 23 of the Bill. An independent candidate in
his consent to nomination would have been required
to</p><a name="06061370000595"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;state that he has not
been selected or authorised to stand in the name or on behalf of any
registered party, organisation or other
person.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06061370000565">Clause 27(3)
makes it an offence to make a false statement to that effect. However,
as that statement is no longer required to be made, there is no need to
create another offence. I know that Liberal Democrat Members will be
particularly pleased that we are not creating any further
offences.</p><p><a name="06061370000566">Amendments
Nos. 19 to 26 and Amendment No. 88 relate to the provision for
candidates&#146; expenses. Hon. Members might recall that we had a
vigorous debate on that issue&#151;led by the Under-Secretary of
State for Scotland, my hon. Friend the Member for Inverclyde (David
Cairns)&#151;on Report in the Commons.
<i> [</i><i> Interruption.</i><i> ]</i> Indeed, it was led very ably.
Several issues were raised and the Government took on board the views
of hon. Members and resolved to work through them in another place. The
key concern that we were trying to address by introducing the
four-month period for candidates&#146; election expenses was that of
unregulated spending taking place in advance 
<br><notus-date day="13" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>13 Jun 2006 : Column 731</b><br>of the elections expenses period beginning. We touched on that in an
earlier debate this evening. The amendments that we are considering
today will return us to the present situation in respect of the length
of a candidate&#146;s elections expenses period. A candidate&#146;s
election expenses will count against his or her statutory expenditure
limit from the point at which they become a candidate. In the case of a
candidate at a general election, that will be the period between the
dissolution of Parliament and polling day. In local elections, it is
the period from the last date of publication of the notice of election
up until polling day.</p><p><a name="06061370000567">For the record, I should point
out that these amendments will not affect the very useful provisions in
clauses 29 and 31, which clarify the scope of activity by unauthorised
third parties under section 75 of the Representation of the People Act
1983 and what counts as election expenses for candidates. I recognise
that the Bill will not now address the problem of unregulated amounts
of money being spent by candidates in the months or weeks leading up to
the point at which the general election is called. As I am sure that we
are all aware, political campaigning techniques are becoming more
sophisticated and more time, effort, and money is being invested in
campaigning in marginal seats in particular. The issue is about money
being spent at a local level&#151;sometimes quite large
amounts&#151;and not counting as candidates&#146; election expenses
because it is spent before the dissolution of Parliament.</p><p><a name="06061370000568">Labour Members have already
expressed their concerns about the way in which that has affected
results, particularly in the last general election, and I am sorry that
we have been unable to come up with an early solution to the problem.
However, along with working towards a consensus on this issue with the
parties and peers in another place, we have talked toSir
Hayden Phillips and asked him whether he will extend his review to look
at the issue of expenses of parties and candidates during the election
period. This approach will make sense, because it means that all facets
of party funding and election spending will be examined across the
piece. I am sure that a comprehensive approach can then be achieved. I
know that Sir Hayden will welcome any input that hon. Members care to
make to that review on this and related
matters.</p><p><a name="06061370000569"><b><a name="06061370001107">Dr.

great pity&#151;my hon. Friend is reflecting on this&#151;that
something like it could not have been included in the Bill. That is
particularly the case given that the abuse&#151;that is what it

seems essential that early action be taken. When my hon. Friend replies

targeted at specific seats at an early stage, and some seats are being

amendments Nos. 27 to 46, 84 to 86, 97 and 99 deal with a system of
electoral observation in the United Kingdom. As a member of the
Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe, we have sent
teams tobe observers of elections. The organisation also has
responsibility for sending teams of international observers to
elections that take place here. However, the UK has never had an
official method by which international electoral observers may attend
election proceedings in the United Kingdom. The amendments thus give
effect to the recommendations of the Electoral Commission and other
electoral observation experts by facilitating such
observations.</p><p><a name="06061370000576">It was
intended that the UK should be broughtinto line with many
newer democracies by giving independent electoral observers the right
to observe proceedings and working practices, and that we should bring
greater transparency to the electoral system, in line with
international electoral practice. However, we received representations
that suggested the provisions of clause 33 did not go far enough to
ensure that UK elections could be observed freely and objectively. We
accepted those arguments and hence brought forward
amendments.</p><p><a name="06061370000577">The Lords
amendments will remove the requirement of accredited individual
observers to apply for the permission of a returning officer or
counting officer to attend proceedings at the issue or receipt of
postal ballot papers, proceedings at a poll and proceedings at 
<br><notus-date day="13" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>13 Jun 2006 : Column 733</b><br>a count. They also remove the ability of election officials to revoke
their permission at any time, with reasons. That means that any removal
of accreditation will have to be made by the Electoral Commission,
which will give reasons for that
revocation.</p><p><a name="06061370000578">As part of
the removal of those requirements, observers should not have to inform
electoral administrators of the places that they intend to observe, or,
indeed, the time at which they will arrive. However, observers will be
subject to any existing enactments that regulate attendance at election
proceedings. We have included two caveats in the provisions: the
Electoral Commission will be able to specify a maximum number of
delegates that may attend any single election proceeding, and may
revoke an organisation&#146;s observer accreditation, giving reasons.
It must be clear to the House that the power to specify a maximum
number of delegates will not limit the number of delegates that an
organisation can send to observe an election generally. The limit will
be on the number of delegates who can attend a particular proceeding.
For example, the commission may object to an organisation requesting to
send 50 delegates to the counting proceedings for a parliamentary
by-election. The amendments also remove the requirement for
representatives of the Electoral Commission to apply for the permission
of a returning officer to observe an election or other electoral
proceedings, or for the permission of a counting officer to observe
proceedings at a
referendum.</p><p><a name="06061370000579"><b><a name="06061370001112">Mr.
Heath:</b> May I express my gratitude to the hon. Lady for
listening to the points raised? As a sometime observer for the OSCE, it
was a huge embarrassment to learn that this country was unable to offer
the facilities that it expected other countries to provide to
observation missions. The original draft was hopeless in its
inadequacy. That has been corrected, and I am
grateful.</p><p><a name="06061370000580"><b><a name="06061370001113">Bridget
Prentice:</b> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for that. I
am glad that we have managed to reassure him.</p><p><a name="06061370000581">The safeguards do not affect
any other power an electoral officer may have to maintain order at any
election proceeding. The particular power in this group of amendments
is needed to enable electoral officers to protect the integrity and
proper conduct of the electoral process. Without such safeguards,
electoral proceedings could be open to abuse by an observer whose
motives for attending turn out not to be legitimate, objective scrutiny
of the elections.</p><p><a name="06061370000582">The purpose of
Lords amendments Nos. 50 to52 is to fulfil the commitment that
my right hon.and learned Friend the Minister of State made
on17 November to provide for the piloting at a local level of
photos on ballot papers. Should a subsequent evaluation prove positive,
the amendments also allow for roll-out at parliamentary and local
elections and by-elections. The Electoral Commission supports the
piloting of the
provision.</p><p><a name="06061370000583">Lords

the hospital, he or she should not be prevented from voting in person.
The amendments provide that detained patients may vote in person if
they are granted permission to be absent from the hospital and if
voting in person does not breach any condition attached to that
permission. The amendments continue to give detained patients the
option to vote by post or proxy if they so
wish.</p><p><a name="06061370000584">Lords amendments
Nos. 54 to 58 relate to the provision of guidance in alternative
formats and languages other than English and Welsh, as provided for in
clauses 36 and 37. That is aimed at improving access to the electoral
process for certain groups of electors who may previously have had
difficulties in obtaining documents in formats that are appropriate for
their needs. Clause 36 provides for the translation of election
documents apart from the nomination papers and ballot papers into
different languages and formats, at the electoral officer&#146;s
discretion. Clause 37 covers the provision of guidance to those voting
by post.</p><p><a name="06061370000585">As drafted,
the clauses provided that election officials &#147;may&#148;
provide documents in other formats as they think appropriate. The
amendments replace &#147;may&#148; with &#147;must&#148;,
changing the requirement on election officials to provide the documents
in alternative formats for those voting in person and by post where
necessary. The amendments also extend the type of guidance that can be
offered under clauses 36 and 37 by giving election officials a general
power to produce documents in formats besides Braille, other languages
and graphical representations, and by specifying that election
officials can provide documents in an audible form, such as a
tape.</p><p><a name="06061370000586">Lords
amendments Nos. 98, 100 to 102, 123 and 130 relate to access to the
count and nominations. Currently, access to the count is limited to the
candidate&#146;s spouse or civil partner. The amendments will provide
that a candidate can invite a person of their choosing. They respond to
points raised by Baroness Gale in the other place. The amendments will
also cover attendance at
nominations.</p><p><a name="06061370000587">The
amendments deal with one further issue in relation to access to the
count because they restore the discretion of the returning officer to
invite any person to the count who does not appear in the list of
specified persons who automatically have a right to attend under
electoral law. We had originally planned to remove that discretion, but
electoral administrators suggested that it could cause a
problem&#151;for example, it might prevent a local mayor who is not
the returning officer from attending a count in a constituency in his
area. I dare say it would also apply to Members of Parliament who wish
to attend local election
counts.</p><p><a name="06061370000588"><b><a name="06061370001114">Mr.
Bone:</b> Am I correct in thinking that Members of Parliament
do not have an automatic right to attend a local count, as I had to

Prentice:</b> Members of Parliament do not have an automatic
right to attend the count, which is why we reinstated the returning
officer&#146;s discretion to allow a Member of Parliament or the
mayor, as I said, to do so. If the returning officer uses his
discretion, Members of Parliament would not require nomination to
attend the count.</p><br><notus-date day="13" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>13 Jun 2006 : Column 735</b><br><p><a name="06061370000590">Finally, Lords amendments Nos.

Lords amendment No. 19 deals with the important issue of whether
pre-election expenses should be capped, which was raised by the
Electoral Commission. Some hon. Members believe that only one or two
parties in the House target certain constituencies, but I can assure
them that all parties target particular seats at particular times. We
should consider the proposal to prescribe a pre-election period with
capped expenses. The Government were right to include it in the
Phillips review, and we are interested in the outcome. It is difficult
to try to impose a retrospective cap, as it is hard to persuade agents
or candidates to take responsibility for a period whenthey
were not involved, so we may need to return tothe
issue.</p><p><a name="06061377000005"><b><a name="06061377000089">Dr.
Whitehead:</b> The issue is not whether parties target
seats&#151;clearly, they do&#151;but the large amounts of money
that are raised nationally. Those funds are diverted from a national
purpose and put in the hands of local parties to target local seats,
giving them an uncompetitive advantage against parties that do not do
so. It is difficult to resolve that central problem, but I hope that
the hon. Gentleman agrees that we mustdo
so.</p><p><a name="06061377000006"><b><a name="06061377000090">Mr.
Heald:</b> The hon. Gentleman will forgive me if I am wrong,
but all political parties target seats when they campaign. More funding
is probably available for candidates in a target seat than for other
candidates. That is not a new development&#151;it is part of politics
in every country&#151;but it is right to look into
it.</p><p><a name="06061377000007"><b><a name="06061377000091">Dr.
Strang:</b> The hon. Gentleman&#146;s approach is
constructive. We all target seats, but is not the fundamental issue the
question of whether capping is practical? That is not an easy solution,
as the experience in the United States demonstrates, but it deserves
careful consideration, as he said.</p><a name="06061377000081"><p><b><a name="06061377000092">Mr.

constructive approach. I agree that we should look at the proposal, but
we must consider whether a cap would be effective. Finally, we welcome
the fact that the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe
has been given an official right to observe elections, as that was
needed in the light of scandals in recent months and
years.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="06061377000085">9.45

delight, therefore, when I found that the Department, through the House
of Lords, had almost completely rewritten clause 33, all six and a half
pages of it. I could never understand how the Department dared draft
the clause in its original form. I thought that I had made
representations, and I assumed that my complaints and those of others
would have been taken into account by a rational Government responding
rationally.</p><p><a name="06061377000010">What
passed for allowing in observers would have besmirched the names of
Kazakhstan and Belarus&#151;not just democratic countries, but
countries that suffer from what might be called a significant
democratic deficit. Such countries may not pay any attention to the
election observers&#146; reports, but they allow election observers
in to wander round, to talk to people and to interfere politely in the
way in which the count is
conducted.</p><p><a name="06061377000011"><b><a name="06061377000094">Mr.
Heath:</b> I am sure the right hon. Gentleman will agree that
at a time when the principle of independent parliamentary monitoring of
elections is being undermined by some who would like to see the back of
Members of this Parliament and others giving an objective view in their
countries, for the United Kingdom not to allow for observers under
international rules is
insupportable.</p><p><a name="06061377000012"><b><a name="06061377000095">Mr.
George:</b> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman who, like me,
has observed elections. I have headed the short-term observation
missions to 18 elections, most of which have been pretty awful, but we
have never been denied access. We walk into a polling station and the
officials there either welcome us or look like animals facing the
headlights and cringe, but they do not say, &#147;You can&#146;t
come in
here.&#148;</p><p><a name="06061377000013">It was
hard to believe that clause 33 stated that before international or
domestic observers were allowed into a polling station, they had to get
the approval of the returning officer. If anyone had tried to stop me
going into a polling station in Ukraine, Georgia, the Balkans or
Russia, it would have been item No. 1 in the report that I read out the
following day. I would have asked, &#147;How on earth can we verify
that elections meet international standards if we were not allowed into
the polling station?&#148;</p><p><a name="06061377000014">That is what would have
happened as a result of clause 33. Not only would international and
domestic observers have been subject to the whim of the returning
officer, but even the Electoral Commission, which plays an enormous
role in elections, as I am sure the Department was aware, would have
had to bow its head, go down on its knees and say, &#147;Please allow
us in to observe this
election.&#148;</p><p><a name="06061377000015">Well,
the Department came up trumps. As a result, the six and a half pages
were almost completely rewritten, to my satisfaction and to the
satisfaction of the Office for Democratic Institutions and Human
Rights. So now we are on a par with Kazakhstan, something of which we
should be immensely proud, and even with Belarus, which conducts
appalling elections but still allows in observers. They may have to 
<br><notus-date day="13" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>13 Jun 2006 : Column 737</b><br>stand 10 ft away and not be able to see the counting, but at least they
are allowed in.</p><p><a name="06061377000016">The
changes are welcome. They mean that observers can gain access to all
stages of the election process. If there is to be a limit on numbers,
let us be clear that it will not in any way inhibit the right of
observers, international or domestic, to attend. People say that the
hall might get too full.</p><p><a name="06061377000017">In Ukraine, the first and
second elections two years ago were totally crooked. One of the methods
used to limit the opposition in those areas in which they were strong
was to hold the election in a constricted place, because people simply
leave if there is a crowd&#151;although that is better than the
situation in Iraq, where bombs were dropped on queues in order to deter
people. If a returning officer says, &#147;I am sorry, but we cannot
let in five or 10 observers&#148;, they have arranged for the
election to take place in a polling station that is not fit for
purpose.</p><p><a name="06061377000018">One of my
best amendments, which I was quite pleased with, was rejected. It
stated that the Electoral Commission should have regard to particular
documents&#151;I listed 10 of them&#151;in determining a code of
conduct. However, the Electoral Commission has said that that point
will be covered in subordinate legislation. Two weeks ago, I took part
in a conference on the UN declaration of principles for international
election observation, which will be in the subordinate
legislation.</p><p><a name="06061377000019">It is
amazing how many people were oblivious to the fact that domestic and
international observers were prohibited. In a bizarre exchange, the
then Foreign Secretary, who is now Leader of the House, roundly
castigated Zimbabwe for running fraudulent elections and criticised it,
quite correctly, for refusing to allow certain election observers to
observe that fraudulent election. I felt compelled to point out to him
the fact, of which he was oblivious, that while he rightly condemned
Zimbabwe, he should appreciate that it generally allows in
international observers, while we do not. Thankfully, that situation is
history, so when I criticise the Russians or anybody else on how they
conduct their elections, I will not have the point thrown into my face
that I have no right to criticise because we do not allow in
international
observers.</p><p><a name="06061377000020">In
conclusion, I am delighted that clause 33 has been almost completely
rewritten, and I am sure that the OSCE Office for Democratic
Institutions and Human Rights will be happy. When the time comes, I am
sure that one of the first countries to test our new procedures on
election observers will be that great democracy adjacent to Russia,
Belarus, which will see whether we allow in observers and press the
legislation to the full. However, I have seen the amendments, of which
I almost totally approve, which will allow us to tell them that we know
that they allow in international observers to their undemocratic
political system. One of the birthplaces of parliamentary democracy,
the United Kingdom, after 200 years of struggling to be more
democratic, now allows in international observers, which will allow the
whole process of transparency to come at long last to this
country.</p><p><a name="06061377000021">I am

Frome(Mr. Heath) for, at the very beginning of the debates
about this Bill, picking up the point that the right hon. Member for
Walsall, South has just addressed. It is very important that the OSCE
recognises us as having the same standards as others, because it has
always struck me that some of the countries that go around the world
selling democracy&#151;the United States is an obvious
example&#151;are not so good at it at home,and we need to be
open to the same scrutiny as everywhere else.</p><p><a name="06061377000023">We particularly welcome the
modernising amendments to do with mental patients, giving them, not

language.</p><p><a name="06061377000024">We welcome
the amusing and interesting idea that pilots will allow for photographs
on ballot papers. My hon. Friend the Member for Somerton and Frome
said&#151;I am not sure whether this is politically
correct&#151;that that may be a hidden way of trying to improve
gender balance in our Parliaments and councils. Indeed it may. He also
suggested that they should be subject to the Advertising Standards
Authority&#151;as in decent, honest and truthful. Having just looking
at &#147;Dod&#146;s&#148;&#151;I will not embarrass
anybody&#151;I noticed that some of the photographs were clearly not
recent. If we are to have photographs, they should at least be from the
past 12 months, not 25 years before, which we have all seen on election
leaflets.</p><p><a name="06061377000025">The most
important subject was raised by the hon. Member for Southampton, Test
(Dr. Whitehead) and others. I understand why the Minister said that, to
her regret and that of others, the Bill will not include any mechanism
for controlling national expenditure on campaigns that are clearly
targeted at individual seats. The logic is that that will be dealt with
by Sir Hayden Phillips&#146; review of party funding. I am not too
bothered about who is the worst offender, but it is clear that parties
with the biggest amounts of money nationally can now deploy that money
in increasing numbers of target seats. We are not talking about
&#163;10, &#163;100 or &#163;1,000, but potentially tens of
thousands of pounds. This applies to campaigns that would begin, in
effect, now&#151;a year after the previous general
election&#151;and take us right up to the calling of a general
election. The only way in which parties manage to get out of the
current rules is by being non-specific and seen to be nationally
funded. Instead of saying, &#147;Support Bridget Prentice as
candidate for Lewisham, East&#148;, or, &#147;Support Oliver Heald
as candidate for North-East Hertfordshire&#148;, they use the party
leader&#146;s name. My party and I are very clear that Sir Hayden

Henry Bellingham (North-West Norfolk) (Con):</b> I am pleased
that the Minister for Trade will reply to the debate and feel flattered
that a Minister of such seniority is staying up late to do
that.</p><p><a name="06061377000035">The debate is
important because it is about small shops, which are a vital part of
not only the small firms sector but the rural communities that they
serve, as well as suburban and urban communities. They are often the
focal point of the community, especially when a shop is combined with a
post office and probably a newsagent. Villages and urban wards that do
not have village shops or a shop at the centre of the community lack
something important, which goes to the core of community
spirit.</p><p><a name="06061377000036">There has
been a substantial decline in the number of community
stores&#151;indeed, 2,000 closed last year. As I go round my
constituency, I see shops that have closed and villages with no shop.
Not long ago, villages such as Pentney near King&#146;s Lynn had a
shop, a pub and, indeed, a garage. Now there is nothing left in that
village and the heart has been taken out of it. I am afraid that such
occurrences are all too regular. Let us consider the number of closures
of unaffiliated independent stores: there were 35,500 stores in 2000
whereas there were 25,893 a month ago&#151;a reduction of 10,000 in a
relatively short time.</p><p><a name="06061377000037">Many hon. Members from all
parties, but especially Conservative Members, have shown a great deal
of concern about post office closures. In my constituency, 10 closures
happened in the past five years. Four closures of urban post offices
happened under the urban post office renewal scheme. Those four
closures in King&#146;s Lynn had a significant and debilitating
effect on the local community.</p><p><a name="06061377000038">I want to consider the
different sorts of shops and some of the threats to them and perhaps
examine the more promising points for the future. Most proprietors of
small shops, newsagents and small pubs are innovative and proud people.
The role of the small shops sector within the small firms sector is
also important. Indeed, 90 per cent. of all businesses are classified
as small businesses, and 75 per cent. of the entire work force are
employed in small to medium-sized enterprises. That is important,
particularly at a time when dark clouds are beginning to gather over
our economy. I will not go into too much detail about that, but we know
that the trade figures for the last quarter were shocking&#151;the
worst on record. We also know that the United Kingdom has fallen in the
World Economic Forum&#146;s rankings from fourth to 13th, that
business investment is at an all-time low and that productivity is
falling.</p><p><a name="06061377000039">I do not
believe that the extra jobs being created in the public sector will be
sustainable in the short to medium term, so we shall have to look to
the small firms sector to provide the employment that is vital to this
country&#146;s economy. That is why it is important that Her
Majesty&#146;s Government do everything in their 
<br><notus-date day="13" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>13 Jun 2006 : Column 742</b><br>power to make life easier for small firms, and for small shops in
particular, but I submit that they are not doing that.</p><p><a name="06061377000040">Let us take small post offices
as an example. They have been hammered by the Government&#146;s
decision to introduce automated credit transfer. There was a time when
our constituents could go into post offices in villages, suburbs and
towns to draw out their benefits and perhaps spend that money in the
shop on sweets, groceries or newspapers. Now, they are forced to have
that money paid into their bank account. We warned the Government that
that would lead to post office closures but they took no notice
whatever. They set up the Post Office card account, but that is to be
abandoned in five years&#146; time. What a
shambles.</p><p><a name="06061377000041">We are not
asking the Government to give post offices large grants. We are simply
asking them to use their power as a provider of services to locate as
many of those services as possible in post offices. That is where the
Government can help the small firms sector and small shops. We know how
much pressure those shops are under from the competition from
superstores.</p><p><a name="06061377000042">That
brings me to the Competition Commission&#146;s inquiry into the
United Kingdom grocery market. There are many concerns involved here,
including the vast market power of the four largest retailers, their
ability to sell at way below cost, their tendency towards predatory
pricing, their buying power and their inordinate power over suppliers.
All of us who represent farming constituencies or constituencies near
to farming areas know the power of those retailers over suppliers and
growers and over the rural economy. It is an invidious power, and it is
very damaging.</p><p><a name="06061377000043">That
power is combined with the power of those retailers to get planning
permission and to build up large land banks. We all know that, when
they are turned down for a planning application, they apply again and
again until they get planning permission. They have the power and the
finance in their shareholders&#146; funds to drive the system into
despair and to get what they want.</p><p><a name="06061377000044"><b><a name="06061377000099">Mr.
Peter Bone (Wellingborough) (Con):</b> I congratulate my hon.
Friend on securing a debate on this important topic. Does he share my
concern that the supermarkets&#146; latest tactic is to buy the small
shops and turn them into local supermarkets? That is destroying another
part of our heritage.</p><p><a name="06061377000045"><b><a name="06061377000100">Mr.
Bellingham:</b> My hon. Friend is right. That is happening in
all our constituencies. When it first started to happen, we thought
that perhaps the Tesco community stores, or some of the other community
stores that were taken over by the large retailers, might be a good
idea. But now we have seen a number of traits such as predatory pricing
and below-cost selling, and that has a damaging effect on the
surrounding shops.</p><p><a name="06061377000046">It
is important that the Government widen the scope of the Competition
Commission&#146;s inquiry. As I understand it, its scope is to be
limited mainly to planning and land banks. That is far too narrow, and
I hope that the Minister will comment on
that.</p><br><notus-date day="13" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>13 Jun 2006 : Column 743</b><br><p><a name="06061377000047"><b><a name="06061377000101">Mr.
Stewart Jackson (Peterborough) (Con):</b> Does my hon. Friend
share my concern, with respect to the ongoing investigation, that the
Office of Fair Trading differentiates between a local community store
such as a Tesco Metro and a hypermarket, which might be only a mile
away? It considers them to be operating in different markets even
though they have the same economies of scale and supply chain issues.
What does my hon. Friend think of
that?</p><p><a name="06061377000048"><b><a name="06061377000102">Mr.
Bellingham:</b> That is an important point. I am grateful to
my hon. Friends for supporting me in the debate, because it shows how
strongly they feel about the issue. The Minister will have to take away
those points and I hope that he will be able to answer them in about 10
minutes&#146;
time.</p><p><a name="06061377000049">I should like to
make a quick point about the Sunday trading legislation. The Sunday
Trading Act 1994 may well have been good for the consumer, but it
certainly was not good news for small shops. It tipped the balance of
retailing power decisively in favour of the multiple stores and the
out-of-town sheds. HMG are in the process of reviewing the legislation
with a view to extending the trading hours of large retailers. I can
tell the Minister that there is overwhelming opposition in my
constituency to any change to the legislation. I have received hundreds
of cards and letters from people who work in shops and stalls and a
very large number of representations from organisation such as the
Association of Convenience Stores, the Federation of Small Businesses,
the Rural Shops Alliance and the National Federation of Retail
Newsagents. The overwhelming feeling among those in the small firms
sector is that there should be no extension of the legislation.
Furthermore, it would be daft even to consider legislation while the
Competition Commission inquiry is ongoing. I hope very much that the
Minister will consider
that.</p><p><a name="06061377000050">There are other
concerns as well. I should like to mention the impact of smuggling and
counterfeiting. One of the less savoury phenomena of recent years is
the rise of the rogue traders who sell counterfeit goods and smuggle
tobacco and alcohol. Indeed, I saw the other day that one fifth of all
cigarettes sold in the UK are illegal. That is having a damaging effect
on the small shops sector and I hope that the Government will take it
on board and address
it.</p><p><a name="06061377000051">Regulation gives
rise to huge concern&#151;we could debate it for many
hours&#151;and I want to make two very quick points about it. I am
concerned about the rise in regulation. The British Chambers of
Commerce&#146;s &#147;Burdens Barometer&#148;, which is an
ongoing measure of the accumulated combined total cost of regulations
on business, has now hit &#163;50 billion since the Government came
to power. That excludes the minimum wage, which Conservative Members
support. <i> [</i><i> Interruption.</i><i> ] </i>We do indeed support it;
we are on record as saying so. I was not a Member then, and I do not
think that any of my colleagues who are present were Members then. We
support the minimum wage, and when I was shadow Small Business and
Employment Minister, I made it very clear that we supported it. There
is no question of a flip-flop; we have a firm
policy.</p><p><a name="06061377000052">A change in
the Whitehall culture is needed, because the Government have presided
over larger and more 
<br><notus-date day="13" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>13 Jun 2006 : Column 744</b><br>intrusive government. The bigger the Government get, the more task
forces they spawn, the more agencies grow up around them and the more
they interfere. Why cannot they send a signal straight away? Rather
than having a Better Regulation Task Force, let us have a deregulation
taskforce. Let us include sunset clauses in much of the legislation
that is introduced. Let us put an end to gold-plating as soon as
possible. If we do that, we might just change the culture of Whitehall
in relation to the small firms sector and ensure that the Government
start to think about small business, rather than just emphasising their
credentials in the big business and larger business community, where,
quite frankly, there is a totally different
agenda.</p><p><a name="06061377000053">I
want to say a quick word about garages. Nothing is more depressing than
driving through a village and seeing a once-thriving local garage
standing empty, probably soon to be replaced by upmarket housing. There
are numerous examples in my constituency. Villages such as Grimston,
Brancaster and Magdalen had thriving village garages, with shops
attached. In some cases, a post office was attached as well. Many other
garages are hanging on by their fingertips. I went past a garage the
other day where fuel was being sold at &#163;1.06 a litre. Most of
those garages have stopped selling fuel, but HMG could consider the
whole planning regime relating to small garages and their change of
use. Could not HMG also examine closely the fuel supply arrangements
for smaller independent outlets that do not have the buying power of
the multiples?</p><p><a name="06061377000054">The
outlook for small shops is bleak. The Government have ignored that
crucial sector of the economy. One brighter light on the horizon,
however, is the farm shop movement. In my constituency, several small
farm shops have opened recently. There is one at Knight&#146;s Hill
in South Wootton run by the Melton family. There is another in Bircham
run by the local publican, William Poole, in conjunction with the
Carter family. The Sandringham estate at West Newton is also about to
open up a farm shop, which will incorporate a butcher&#146;s, village
shop and post office and which will sell meat from its red poll
herd.</p><p><a name="06061377000055">Public demand
is changing fast. The public are getting more and more fed up with
supermarkets refusing to label food properly, especially beef, pork and
bacon. They are getting fed up with the crazy lack of concern for the
environment shown by large retailers who source products from far-flung
destinations when there are home-grown alternatives. They are also fed
up with retailers having a cavalier attitude and a total disdain for
the organic movement. That is why many members of the public up and
down the country are beginning to speak with their pockets and demand
higher standards. They are not getting those standards in supermarkets
and large retailers, but they are getting them in farm shops. That is
why the increase in farm shops, particularly in rural areas, is very
healthy.</p><p><a name="06061377000056"><b><a name="06061377000103">Mr.
Philip Hollobone (Kettering) (Con):</b> I congratulate my hon.
Friend on a brilliant analysis of the threat to small shops in our
country. Did not Napoleon Bonaparte say that England was a nation of
shopkeepers? Is not it a shame that, 200 years on from 
<br><notus-date day="13" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>13 Jun 2006 : Column 745</b><br>when he uttered those words, we should have the need for such a debate
in the House of Commons?</p><p><a name="06061377000057"><b><a name="06061377000104">Mr.
Bellingham:</b> My hon. Friend&#146;s remark is perceptive.
Small shops and their proprietors are often the backbone of our
communities. They are the people who provide the social focus in
villages, towns and suburbs and who care about the community. The
service that they offer can also be social, as they provide a place
where people meet, converse and feel that they are part of a thriving
community. The Government do not properly understand that.</p><p><a name="06061377000058">With the exception of what is
happening in the farm shop movement, the outlook for small shops is
bleak. It will be even bleaker if the Government do not start to listen
to what is being said by organisations such as the Association of
Convenience Stores, the Federation of Small Businesses, the Forum of
Private Business and the Rural Shops Alliance. The Minister is new to
this job. He is back in a senior position in the Department of Trade
and Industry, and I welcome that. I am sorry that he is no longer in
the Cabinet, but perhaps he will have a chance to return to it before
too long. Perhaps if he really grips this issue, runs with it and
becomes a champion of small shops, he will build up his credentials as
someone who cares about the small firms sector. If he does that, and
the Government start to listen, there may be more grounds for optimism
than I have outlined
tonight.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="06061377000087">10.18
pm</h5><p><a name="06061377000059"><b><a name="06061377000105">The
Minister for Trade (Mr. Ian McCartney):</b> I congratulate the
hon. Member for North-West Norfolk (Mr. Bellingham) on securing this
debate. I am glad to have the opportunity to discuss the issues that he
raises. As a Conservative Member, however, he has some selective
amnesia. He said that he supports small businesses, but we should
remember that one small business went bust every minute of every day
under the Conservative party in government. He said that he supports
the national minimum wage, but the Conservatives said that the national
minimum wage would cost 2 million jobs. We created the minimum wage and
we also created 2 million jobs. As for support for rural post offices,
his party closed 3,500 rural post offices in its last period in
government. Let us have the debate and discussion, and I hope that I
will be able to demonstrate that the Government not only value small
shops but small businesses generally in the community and in
society.</p><p><a name="06061377000060">Retail is of
great importance to the prosperity of the United Kingdom economy.
Eleven per cent. of our enterprises are retailers: more than 102,500
stores. UK retail sales were worth approximately &#163;249 billion in
2005. Retail is also important in providing employment opportunities.
Just under 3 million people in the UK are employed in retail&#151;one
in 10 workers. Small retailers have a vital role to play in the success
of the retail sector and the provision of jobs. Of course large
businesses are important&#151;very important&#151;but small
retailers contribute to a vibrant and diverse sector.</p><br><notus-date day="13" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>13 Jun 2006 : Column 746</b><br><p><a name="06061377000061">The convenience-store sector is
thriving, notwithstanding what the hon. Gentleman said. The Institute
of Grocery Distribution, a key research organisation for the sector,
estimates that sales in convenience stores&#151;stores measuring less
than 280 sq m, about the size of a tennis court&#151;represent
about20 per cent. of total grocery retail sales in the United
Kingdom. The IGD forecasts that convenience stores&#146; share of the
total grocery retail market is likely to continue to rise, increasing
from 20 per cent. to nearly 24 per cent. by
2010.</p><p><a name="06061377000062">Enterprise is
vital to a growing and dynamic economy. To encourage and assist
enterprise, we need to create the right support mechanisms. The
Government provide a range of support measures for small businesses,
including small shops&#151;something that the hon. Gentleman
conveniently forgot to mention. Small businesses can obtain grants,
funds, loan guarantee schemes and advice through our network of
business links. In addition, we ensure that the valued experience and
knowledge contained in bodies representing smaller retailers is
captured through involvement with our key retail forums. I hope that I
am right in thinking that the hon. Gentleman indicated that the
Conservative party would support those forums and their
continuation.</p><p><a name="06061377000063">The
retail policy forum and the retail innovation group give small
businesses a voice at the heart of Government, and they use it in an
effective way. Together the Association of Convenience Stores, the
British Hardware Federation, the Horticultural Trades Association and
the British Retail Consortium are working with the Department of Trade
and Industry. About 70,000 small shops are involved. Recent informed
exchanges on the possibility of extending Sunday shopping hours
demonstrate the importance of the
relationship.</p><p><a name="06061377000064">Members
of the Virtual Retail policy forum are partners with the DTI&#146;s
retail unit. They include the National Federation of Retail Newsagents,
the Rural Shops Alliance, the Independent Retailers Confederation and
the Giftware Association. At every level, small business in each sector
is involved in a real business partnership with Government. The Small
Business Service, an agency of the DTI, is a specialist centre of
expertise in Government to champion the sector and help small
businesses to flourish. It is a shame that the Conservative party is
still committed to abolishing that service. The purpose of the SBS is
to help produce an enterprise society, to ensure that Britain remains
the best place in the world in which to start and grow a business, and
to promote enterprise and a climate in which small businesses can
flourish.</p><p><a name="06061377000065">The
Federation of Small Businesses supports the continuation of the SBS. A
recent National Audit Office report quoted it as saying that
it</p><a name="06061377000084"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;wholeheartedly would
like to see SBS succeed because it is the only real answer for small
businesses.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06061377000066">That was
said on 18 May this year. The Conservatives, however, still cling to
their policy of opposing the
SBS.</p><p><a name="06061377000067">Small shops have
been quick to take advantage of the support that the SBS has to offer.
The small firms loan guarantee scheme is a good example. It helps small
companies with good business ideas to obtain loans in circumstances in
which their lack of the 
<br><notus-date day="13" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>13 Jun 2006 : Column 747</b><br>collateral normally required as security by the lender would otherwise
make borrowing impossible. Since the SFLG began, about 100,000 loans
valued at more than &#163;4 billion have been guaranteed, and since
2003-04 nearly 20,000 loan guarantees have been agreed under the
scheme. I suspect that the Conservative party would not continue to
support such measures. Current monthly use amounts to about 650 loans,
with a total value of around &#163;40 million a month. The average
loan tends to be about &#163;70,000.</p><p><a name="06061377000068">Small retailers have benefited.
The scheme was strengthened considerably in April 2003, when changes
were made that brought retail and other local services such as garages
and hairdressers into the scope of the scheme. The number of small
firms loan guarantees offered to the retail sector since April 2003
stands at 2,925. Between 2002 and 2005, 218 loans valued at
&#163;13.6 million have been granted in the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
county of Norfolk. On his own doorstep, we are providing direct
resources and funds to support the creation of small businesses or
enable them to be sustained. Perhaps he would give some recognition to
that.</p><p><a name="06061377000069">Another key area
of business support is the Business Link service, which is a crucial
part of the Government&#146;s campaign to promote enterprise.
Business Link will fast-track customers to the expert help that they
need&#151;whatever the issue. Its service is delivered through
advisers in customers&#146; local area. Over the past four years, the
number of customers using Business Link has doubled. The customer
satisfaction level&#151;I emphasise that we are talking about small
businesses&#151;is at a record 91 per cent., and 96 per cent. of
customers are willing to recommend the service to others. Again, the
Conservative party has shown no desire to continue with this direct
support for small businesses.</p><p><a name="06061377000070">The hon. Gentleman raised the
issue of the Office of Fair Trading grocery market reference. He will
be aware that I cannot directly intervene in such matters, but it will
be useful and appropriate if I respond where I can. The UK competition
framework has established the OFT and the Competition Commission as
independent statutory bodies. The Government wished to remove politics
from competition decisions, allowing expert, independent competition
bodies to take decisions on mergers and markets. I am sure that Members
in all parts of the House will recognise the benefits of that revised
structure.</p><p><a name="06061377000071">On 9 May,
the OFT announced its decision to refer the grocery market to the
Competition Commission for a market investigation. The evidence
compiled by the OFT suggests that the planning regime acts as a costly
barrier to entry, making it difficult for new stores to open and to
compete with those already in the market. In addition, big supermarkets
have significant land holdings, which could aggravate barriers to entry
or otherwise harm consumers. In some instances, supermarkets have
attached restrictive covenants when selling sites. The OFT also found
that there is evidence to suggest that the big supermarkets&#146;
buying power has increased, and that some aspects of their pricing
behaviour, such as below-cost selling and price flexing, could distort
competition.</p><p><a name="06061377000072">Although
the OFT has been specific in respect of the issues that it feels could
present a problem within the 
<br><notus-date day="13" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>13 Jun 2006 : Column 748</b><br>market, the Competition Commission investigation is not limited to
considering only those issues identified in the reference document.
They could include competition in the food supply chain&#151;farmers
are an example&#151;and/or non-groceries sold by supermarkets. It is
for the Competition Commission to make that decision.</p><p><a name="06061377000073">The supermarket code of
practice, which regulates the relationship between the big four chains
and their direct suppliers, is not affected at this time, and remains
in place until the companies bound by it&#151;Tesco,
Sainsbury&#146;s, Asda and Morrisons&#151;are released from the
undertakings that form the basis of the code. It will be for the
Competition Commission to make recommendations in its report on whether
it believes that the code should be maintained, amended or
repealed.</p><p><a name="06061377000074">I turn now
to rural post offices. The Government recognise the important role
played by post offices in the delivery of services to rural
communities, and have taken steps to maintain their presence. In
November 2000, we directed Post Office Limited to prevent avoidable
closures of rural branches, and since 2003we have supported
the rural network to the tune of &#163;150 million per year. That
subsidy helps the company to maintain the network of rural branches.
That is in stark contrast to what we inherited from the Conservatives
in 1997. Between 1979 and 1997, the previous Government presided over
3,500 closures, and produced no policy on how to ensure that the
network could continue to remain relevant into the 21st century. In
addition, about two thirds&#151;900&#151;of directly managed Crown
branches were converted to franchise status with no clear
strategy.</p><p><a name="06061377000075">It did not
take long for this Government to recognise that, following decades of
decline and under-investment, drastic action was necessary to get the
business on track and to secure its long-term future. We set about
producing policies that would help achieve that&#151;something that
the previous Government had totally failed to do. We set about
reversing the decline. Some &#163;500 million was injected to help
fund the &#147;horizon&#148; IT infrastructure, and since 2003 the
Government have not only committed &#163;150 million a year up to
2008 to support the rural network; on top of that, we have put
&#163;210 million towards the urban reinvention programme, including
some &#163;30 million of investment grants to improve and modernise
remaining branches. Not a single penny went to the post office network
under the Conservative Government. Indeed, year in, year out, of the
profits made by the Post Office, almost 95p in every pound was taken by
the Conservative Chancellor to be reinvested in other parts of the
public sector. One example was paying large-scale unemployment benefit,
instead of re-inventing the Post Office to provide a modern service. I
will not yield to any Conservative on investment, and future
investment, in post office services. This Government have invested the
amazing sum of more than &#163;1.4 billion in the past few years in
modernisation and retooling of both the directly managed Crown network
service and the rural and urban network
services.</p><p><a name="06061377000076">The
