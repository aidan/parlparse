 I wish to make a statement to the House about the arrest and entry into the offices of the hon. Member for Ashford (Damian Green) last Thursday, 27 November, which raises a subject of grave concern to all Members of the House.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o2"><a name="81203-0001.htm_para2"><a name="08120351000015">In the past few days there has been much pressure on me to make public comment about these matters, but I felt that it was right and fitting that I should make no comment until Parliament reconvenes, because it is this House and this House alone that I serve, as well as being accountable for the actions of its Officers. I should emphasise from the start that it is not for me to comment on the allegations that have been made against the hon. Member or on the disposal of those allegations in the judicial process.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o3"><a name="81203-0001.htm_para3"><a name="08120351000016">I should also remind the House, as stated in chapter 7 of &#147;Erskine May,&#148; that parliamentary privilege has never prevented the operation of the criminal law. <i> [Interruption.]</i><i> </i>Order. The Joint Committee on Parliamentary Privilege in its authoritative report in 1999 said that the precincts of the House are not and should not be</p>
<a name="81203-0001.htm_brev0"><a name="08120351000471"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;a haven from the law&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o4"><a name="81203-0001.htm_para4"><a name="08120351000017">There is therefore no special restriction on the police searching the parliamentary precincts in the course of a criminal proceeding&#151;nor has there ever been.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o5"><a name="81203-0001.htm_para5"><a name="08120351000018">On Wednesday last, the Metropolitan police informed the Serjeant at Arms that an arrest was contemplated, but did not disclose the identity of the Member. I was told in the strictest confidence by her that a Member might be arrested and charged, but no further details were given to me. I was told that they might be forthcoming the next morning.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o6"><a name="81203-0001.htm_para6"><a name="08120351000019">At 7 am on Thursday, police called upon the Serjeant at Arms and explained the background to the case, and disclosed to the Serjeant the identity of the Member. The Serjeant at Arms called me, told me the Member&#146;s name and said that a search might take place of his offices in the House. I was not told that the police did not have a warrant. [Hon. Members: &#147;Ah!&#148;] Order. I have been told that the police did not explain, as they are required to do, that the Serjeant was not obliged to consent, or that a warrant could have been insisted upon. <i> [</i><i> Interruption.</i><i> ]</i> Order. Let me make the statement. I regret that a consent form was then signed by the Serjeant at Arms, without consulting the Clerk of the House.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o7"><a name="81203-0001.htm_para7"><a name="08120351000020">I must make it clear to the House&#151;<i> [</i><i> Interruption.</i><i> ]</i> Order. I must make it clear to the House that I was not asked the question of whether consent should be given, or whether a warrant should have been insisted on. I did not personally authorise the search. It was later that evening that I was told that the search had gone ahead only on the basis of a consent form. I further regret that I was formally told by the police only yesterday, by letter from Assistant Commissioner Robert Quick, that the hon. Member was arrested on 27 November on suspicion of conspiring to commit misconduct in public office and on suspicion of aiding and abetting misconduct in public office.</p>

Every case must be referred for my personal decision, as it is my responsibility. All this will be made clear in a protocol issued under my name to all hon. Members.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o9"><a name="81203-0001.htm_para9"><a name="08120351000022">Lastly, I have decided, myself, to refer the matter of the seizure by police of material belonging to the hon.

 On a point of order, Mr. Speaker. I thank you for your statement, thank you for the debate and welcome your decision to set up the Committee.

This attack was entirely without precedent, and is&#151;</p>

I am very reluctant to interrupt a right hon. and learned Member, especially a former Leader of Her Majesty&#146;s Opposition, but those things can come up in the debate on Monday. <i> [Interruption.]</i> May I help the right hon. and learned Gentleman? Obviously, when any hon. Member is in any difficulty, I feel that it is my duty to try to help as best I can. With regard to the computer equipment being removed, when I discovered that, I instructed the Serjeant at Arms to ensure that the police had that equipment back in the office on Monday to allow the hon. Member concerned to function properly as a Member of Parliament. Please remember that this is a point of order and not a debate.</p>

 Mr. Speaker, you were right to acknowledge that there is a serious issue at stake here, which is why I would like to ask whether you are in a position to be more specific about the remit and the powers of the Committee that you have proposed. Surely it will be right for that Committee to keep account of the fact that none of us is above the law, but that that principle applies to the police as much as to any of us. What you have said about the absence of a warrant raises a number of very significant questions for the Committee, and I am pleased to hear you say that you intend to produce, by your own hand, a suitable protocol. However, the law includes not just the criminal law but the rights, duties and privileges of all Members of this House, as evidenced by the constitution under which we serve. Will you give the House an assurance, so far as you can, that the membership of that Committee will be such that it will be entitled to have access to information from every source&#151;Government, Opposition if necessary, police, and indeed Officers of the House of Commons?</p>

 This is not an application, Mr. Speaker, but can you assure us that, during the considerations of that Committee, as well as during the debate that is to surround these issues, which are grave issues and raise concerns on both sides of the House, four principles, not one principle, will be discussed? The first, of course, is the rights and privileges of Members of Parliament, but the second is the principle that, outside those particular rights and privileges, we are all, as citizens of this country, subject to the law as well.</p>

support for me over the weekend. May I make it absolutely clear that I believe that Members of Parliament are not above the law? Those who have the real power in this country&#151;Ministers, senior civil servants and the police&#151;are not beyond the law or beyond scrutiny, either. An MP endangering national security would be a disgrace; an MP exposing embarrassing facts about Home Office policy that Ministers are hiding is doing a job in the public interest. The day when exposing facts that Ministers would prefer to keep hidden becomes a crime will be a bad day for democracy in this country.</p>

 Further to those points of order, Mr. Speaker. First, there is widespread concern across the House about everything that has happened. Secondly, thank you for saying from the Chair that from now on, a properly executed warrant must be presented to you, and it will be your decision whether the police come into the House of Commons for any reason&#151;we can debate the extent of parliamentary privilege later. Thirdly, as a former Minister, a systematic breach of confidence in a Minister&#146;s office destroys confidence in democratic government, especially when it involves collusion with one of the Opposition parties.

<p><a name="stpa_o46"><a name="81203-0002.htm_para31"><a name="08120351000099">When I was asked by the Chief Whip to move the Address, I was extremely proud and honoured, not least for my constituency of Coatbridge, Chryston and Bellshill, and to be seconded by my hon. Friend the Member for Erewash (Liz Blackman), who, among other issues, has an excellent reputation for bringing autism to the fore.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o47"><a name="81203-0002.htm_para32"><a name="08120351000100">Christened Thomas, I have throughout my life been instinctively suspicious of well-meaning gestures, even one such as this, so naturally I pondered, &#147;Why me?&#148; All was revealed when my hon. Friend the Member for Coventry, South (Mr. Cunningham), a man of great wisdom and knowledge, met me in the Lobby. The tone of our conversation reminded me of the fact that as boys we both attended St. Mary&#146;s school in Coatbridge. In his own inimitable style, he said, &#147;I hear you&#146;re moving the Address.&#148; &#147;That&#146;s right, Jim.&#148; &#147;Do you know why you were selected?&#148; &#147;No, Jim.&#148; &#147;Do you want to know?&#148; &#147;Yes, Jim.&#148; He said, &#147;According to Alex Salmond, you&#146;ve the safest seat in this House and you will be the only Scottish Labour MP to be re-elected.&#148; Responding, I replied, &#147;The right hon. Member for Banff and Buchan claimed Labour would lose the Glenrothes by-election, and we didn&#146;t, so we&#146;re all still here.&#148;</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o48"><a name="81203-0002.htm_para33"><a name="08120351000101">There are three distinctive areas within my constituency of Coatbridge, Chryston and Bellshill. Historically, the one common feature that connected all three was the contribution to heavy industry. Ironworks, steelmaking and coal mining were once the main sources of employment. I want to pay tribute to those who worked hard to look after their families, as many of them died far too prematurely because of associated illness and disease, often linked with those heavy industries. A special tribute is due to all the women, who, as a consequence, were widowed and left to raise a family single handed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o49"><a name="81203-0002.htm_para34"><a name="08120351000102">Today, the older heavy industries have almost disappeared, and newer light industries are taking their place. Coatbridge has a new &#163;10 million redevelopment project at the Summerlee heritage park, which graphically illustrates our history and, just as vitally, our potential.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o50"><a name="81203-0002.htm_para35"><a name="08120351000103">Chryston embraces communities such as Moodiesburn, Muirhead, Stepps, Auchinloch and Gartcosh. One of the darkest days that that community suffered was 18 September 1959 when an inferno raged deep below in the coal mine. It became known as the Auchengeich disaster, in which 47 men lost their lives. We are approaching the 50th anniversary, and many people still turn out to show their respect each year.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o51"><a name="81203-0002.htm_para36"><a name="08120351000104">With the utmost humility and poignancy, I wish to add my father to the endless list of men who died as victims of pneumoconiosis without a penny in compensation. My late mother, Mary Gordon, born in Armagh, was left to raise a large family with nothing like the benefits that are rightly paid to widows and families today. That is why I will be eternally grateful that, under this Labour Government, the largest ever financial compensation&#151;nearly &#163;7.5 billion&#151;was paid out to miners and their families who had been affected by diseases through working in such appalling mining conditions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o52"><a name="81203-0002.htm_para37"><a name="08120351000105">Among the many improvements in my constituency is a large site, formerly the Gartcosh steelworks, which is now well on its way to being redeveloped as part of a multi-million pound regeneration programme. Such investment has laid the foundations for Gartcosh to be completely transformed socially and economically, which is very welcome given the traditions of my industrial constituency.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o53"><a name="81203-0002.htm_para38"><a name="08120351000106">Bellshill boy Billy McNeill captained Celtic, the first British team to hold aloft the European cup, in Lisbon. Another proud son of the town was Sir Matt Busby, who became the manager of Manchester United&#151;for the record, the second team from Britain to win the European cup.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o54"><a name="81203-0002.htm_para39"><a name="08120351000107">My predecessor, the late and much loved Jimmy Dempsey MP, lived in Bellshill and his wife Jane still closely observes political events here at Westminster. Jimmy was renowned for his tireless work in helping to bring jobs to the county of Lanarkshire. He would marvel at the volume of employment opportunities in the Bellshill area. Between the business park and the food park, there are approximately 8,500 jobs.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o55"><a name="81203-0002.htm_para40"><a name="08120351000108">Bellshill also gave birth to one of the finest and most outstanding parliamentarians of our time, Robin Cook.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o56"><a name="81203-0002.htm_para41"><a name="08120351000109">I do not wish to claim that I am alone in working hard for my constituents. In my experience, hon. Members of all parties are genuinely committed to their work in Parliament and their communities. For example, it would be remiss of me not to pay tribute to hard-working hon. Members who supported victims of pleural plaques. Tragic sufferers of asbestos-related diseases need a compensation package similar to that paid out to the miners.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o57"><a name="81203-0002.htm_para42"><a name="08120351000110">During my time here I have served both as a Back Bencher and on the Front Bench. One particular highlight was the time that I spent working under the leadership of the late John Smith, my neighbouring MP, who was destined to become Prime Minister before his sudden and untimely death. When I was shadow Cabinet spokesperson for disability under Tony Blair, I worked closely with the right hon. Member for Richmond, Yorks (Mr. Hague).

considerable achievement. I hope that my praise for him does not damage his future prospects&#151;or, perhaps more importantly, mine.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o58"><a name="81203-0002.htm_para43"><a name="08120351000111">It would also be remiss of me not to pay a warm tribute to my hon. Friend the Member for Linlithgow and East Falkirk (Michael Connarty), who later served as my Parliamentary Private Secretary and who, in my view, would make an excellent Minister himself. The House also appreciates his hard work as Chairman of the European Scrutiny Committee.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o59"><a name="81203-0002.htm_para44"><a name="08120351000112">In my time here I have always tried to work closely with members of other parties, including the Liberal Democrats, such as the right hon. Member for Ross, Skye and Lochaber (Mr. Kennedy). Just last week I was speaking in a debate at Glasgow university, where he is the distinguished rector, and I can assure him that he is held in the highest esteem. Indeed, more recently, on a flight down here, I overheard that there might be some imminent vacancies on the Lib Dem Front Bench. If he finds himself back there, I wish him well.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o60"><a name="81203-0002.htm_para45"><a name="08120351000113">During debates here I often follow my namesake, the right hon. and learned Member for Rushcliffe (Mr. Clarke). Occasionally, we also receive each other&#146;s mail. Not long ago, I read a postcard from a woman who wrote:</p>
<a name="81203-0002.htm_brev3"><a name="08120351000475"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Dear Mr. Clarke,</p>

</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o61"><a name="81203-0002.htm_para46"><a name="08120351000114">I took that as a compliment and I urge the right hon. and learned Gentleman to do the same.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o62"><a name="81203-0002.htm_para47"><a name="08120351000115">Since becoming a Member of this House, I have set myself three priorities: first, and most importantly, to represent the interests of my constituents. Secondly, I feel as passionately about supporting disabled peoples&#146; rights today as I did when I helped to steer the Disabled Persons (Services, Consultation and Representation) Act 1986 on to the statute book, and that will never change.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o63"><a name="81203-0002.htm_para48"><a name="08120351000116">Thirdly, in the year of the Make Poverty History campaign, and with the unanimous support of the House, I succeeded with another private Member&#146;s Bill, which became the International Development (Reporting and Transparency) Act 2006&#151;incidentally, I acknowledge the role that the then Secretary of State for International Development, my right hon. Friend the Member for Leeds, Central (Hilary Benn), and his ministerial team played. That is why I welcome the Government&#146;s&#151;and especially the Prime Minister&#146;s&#151;determination to achieve the millennium development goals. The figure of 0.7 per cent. of gross national income is still our objective for 2013. I have every confidence that the Government will deliver, and I have noted the support of those on the Opposition Front Benches.</p>

disabilities and the people dying in the third world have to overcome many more hurdles than we face in this global downturn, and we should look to their example for inspiration. I passionately believe that, whatever their circumstances, British people have the character to be creative and confident. Working together, we will, we can and we must succeed.

 It is with great pride that I stand to second the Loyal Address. It is a huge honour for me and my constituents, and I am particularly pleased to follow my right hon. Friend the Member for Coatbridge, Chryston and Bellshill (Mr. Clarke). On every occasion that our paths have crossed, I have thought what a charming man he is, with his soft Scottish lilt, but people should not be fooled: whenever he sets his sights on a target, he goes after it with utter determination and deadliness. During his 26 years in the House, he has campaigned to improve the lives of disabled people, their families and their carers. He has done so with awesome determination and massive success, and I pay tribute to him.</p>

I am still in a state of shock because he has invited me to speak today. First, because I have been a Government Whip, I have not spoken in a debate for more than two years&#151;so no pressure there! Secondly, I do not exactly fit the profile of the young, up-and-coming Members who are usually called on to perform this honour. My hon. Friend the Member for Motherwell and Wishaw (Mr. Roy) put it another way when I confided in him, in the Tea Room. He said, &#147;That&#146;s great,&#148; and added, after a pause, &#147;No offence, hen, but they normally pick &#146;em younger.&#148; Whatever the reason that I have been chosen, I am incredibly honoured.</p>

Most of its people live in the market towns of Long Eaton, to the south, and Ilkeston to the north. Sandiacre sits between the two and has a sizeable population. There are also a number of villages stretching out towards Derby. I wonder how many Members were brought up watching &#147;Citizen Smith&#148; from the Tooting Popular Front.

There have been vast improvements in health and education, and there is a vibrant voluntary sector. There is a newly formed credit union to protect people from doorstep lenders, and more people are in work. One thing that we need, however, and which we do not have, is a station at Ilkeston. With that in mind, I am currently stalking my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Transport. I remind him about the need for the station every time our paths cross&#151;which, funnily enough, I find happening less and less often.</p>

In 2005, the perma-tanned leader of a political party called Veritas put himself up as a candidate for the constituency in the general election.

At that precise moment, the producer pressed the &#147;silent&#148; button, so the &#147;s&#148; never arrived, but the woman&#146;s sentiments certainly did.</p>

Have you met David Beckham?&#148; &#147;No.&#148; &#147;Oh.&#148; I dropped right down in his estimation after that, and never recovered.</p>

The great strength of an all-party group is that it does exactly what it says on the tin: it puts party politics to one side in the interests of progress.</p>

Friend the Member for Bolsover (Mr. Skinner) for enriching my vocabulary, and the wider membership for the innovative reasons that they gave for being unable to do statutory instrument Committees on a one-line Whip on Thursdays. Echoes of my teaching past flooded back at such times. &#147;The dog ate my homework, Mrs. Blackman.&#148; &#147;My mam says I can&#146;t stop &#146;cos I&#146;ve to be home early.&#148; Colleagues offered those traditional excuses in a modern setting.

looking to this Government and this House at this time for all the support that we can give them. It is a particular pleasure to second the Address as so much of it is relevant to what most concerns my constituents. They want to know that the financial system is as robust and responsive as we can make it and that their hard-earned savings are totally safe. The banking Bill will help here. Poorer people want more for their children and a safety blanket of knowing that there is a little put by, so the child poverty Bill and the savings Bill will respond to them. They want to be able to take advantage of opportunities wherever and whenever they arise. Measures in the children, schools and learning Bill will develop and improve their skills, and the welfare reform Bill will offer more support to those on benefit, those with mental health problems and those with disabilities. My constituents will also welcome the measures in the policing and crime Bill that clamp down on the pockets of mind-numbing, alcohol-fuelled yobbish behaviour that ruin their neighbourhoods. We live in tough times and I believe that all these measures will make a difference.</p>

 This is quite extraordinary. The approach that the hon. Gentleman is taking, and that some Labour Front-Bench Members seem to be taking, is that Members of Parliament should not release information that is in the public interest and that they should be pursued and arrested for doing so. If that approach had been taken when the Prime Minister was in opposition, he would have spent most of his life in prison. <i> [Interruption.] </i>Well, he laughs about it now, but he produced leak after leak after leak, all of which he claimed were in the public interest.</p>

He has told us endlessly about the independence of the police; what about the independence of this place and its Members? People want to know whether our democracy, and our right to challenge and to question and oppose, are safe under this Government and this Prime Minister, and I hope that when he speaks&#146; he will have the courage to get off the fence and tell us what he believes.</p>

 What the chairman of the police authority, the Mayor of London, did when the police told him about their plans was give them the trenchant view that that was a mistake, and I happen to agree with him; I think it was a mistake.

I hope he also agrees that we will not succeed in Afghanistan through military means alone. We need better co-ordination of aid, less corruption and better government.

We should be clear about what the terrorists are trying to do: they are trying to rob India of her rightful place in the global economy, to set one community against another, and to set east against west. We should also be clear that those terrorists will not stop trade and co-operation, and they will not break up the excellent relations that exist between Britain and India.

writing that manifesto; he has now introduced most of it. Welfare reforms and direct elections for police accountability were both in my conference speech last year. The Prime Minister likes to accuse us of having no substance, but without Conservative substance there would be almost nothing of any worth in the Queen&#146;s Speech.</p>

There is no recognition in the Government&#146;s programme of how the world has changed. We are moving into an age in which there is no Government money left, so we need public sector reform to get better value for money. We are moving into an age of massive debt, so we need to mend the broken society and reduce the demands on the state. But in the Queen&#146;s Speech there is no serious reform, just bureaucratic bungling and technocratic tinkering. It is all about the short-term prospects of the Prime Minister, not the long-term future of the country. It is last year&#146;s Queen&#146;s Speech from yesterday&#146;s Prime Minister.</p>

He promised zero-carbon homes, but there have been virtually zero of them. There are just 15 in the whole country. He promised 3 million new homes, but house building fell by a quarter last year. What about free nursery education for all two-year-olds? That has been abandoned. More maintenance grants for students were granted last year, collapsed in a complete shambles this year and face massive cuts next year. Then there is the Prime Minister&#146;s promise of a new constitutional settlement. We were promised more powers for Parliament to question the Executive. That one ended up down the nick.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o102"><a name="81203-0004.htm_para8"><a name="08120351000211">What about the statement of British values? Does anyone remember that? According to Government sources, that will never see the light of day. What about British day? Does anyone remember that one? The question is simple&#151;when will it be? How long does it take to set a date for a new bank holiday? Given that the Prime Minister is about to stand up and cancel happy hour, we need cheering up. When will it be?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o103"><a name="81203-0004.htm_para9"><a name="08120351000212">It would not matter if those ideas were all just gimmicks, but some of them really raised people&#146;s hopes.

It was meant to have helped 10,000 families, but it has helped just 235. With this Prime Minister, it is always about short-term politics and never about long-term change.</p>

Seven years ago, the Government set up the Learning and Skills Council. They then created 47 local learning and skills council branches. There were then four reorganisations. In 2006, the 47 branches were replaced by nine regional centres, but with 148 local partnership teams. What was the  <br>

result? The Learning and Skills Council&#146;s own report this year said that &#147;unnecessary duplication abounds&#148; and that one arm does not know what the other is doing.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o105"><a name="81203-0004.htm_para11"><a name="08120351000214">What is the Prime Minister doing in this Queen&#146;s Speech? He is scrapping the Learning and Skills Council altogether and he is passing responsibility for education and training for 16 to 18-year-olds back where it came from, to local authorities. What a waste of time, money and effort. The most ridiculous thing about it is that instead of just killing off the quango, the Government are introducing three new ones&#151;the SFA, or skills funding agency; the YPLA, or young people&#146;s learning agency; and the NAS, or national apprenticeship service. Millions are being spent on redundancies, reorganisation and rebudgeting, and administrative costs are going through the roof. In the middle of all that, the number of people being trained has gone down. That is what has happened.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o106"><a name="81203-0004.htm_para12"><a name="08120351000215">The Government have abandoned public sector reform, there is no social reform and the promised change never happened. Labour was on the verge of getting rid of the Prime Minister, but the party now clings to the one thing that it thinks that it has left&#151;the economy. So let us look at the state of the economy after the Prime Minister has been in charge of it for a decade. So far, we have focused on the claims that he has made over the past 10 years and on how hollow they sound today. One of his claims was prudence, when we entered the recession with the largest budget deficit in the industrialised world. Another was stability, when unemployment is rising more quickly than in any other major economy. Another ridiculous claim was that he abolished boom and bust. That was ridiculous because under him we had the most unsustainable debt-fuelled boom followed by one of the biggest busts in our history.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o107"><a name="81203-0004.htm_para13"><a name="08120351000216">So much for the claims of the past 10 years&#151;let us now take a look at the claims of the past 10 weeks. They are just as threadbare. He told us that Britain is better prepared for this recession&#151;he says that it is true&#151;but it is now forecast by sources that include his own Treasury that we will have the worst recession in the G7 next year. That is how well prepared we are. He told us that Britain&#146;s debt is more sustainable, but just yesterday Britain&#146;s credit-worthiness slipped behind that of Portugal, Belgium and even HSBC.</p>

 I am coming to exactly that point, but let me tell the hon. Gentleman what we will do. Let us freeze the council tax for two years for every family in the country. Let us give small businesses a &#163;10 billion VAT boost by letting them pay their bills late. Let us cut national insurance for the very small companies so that they do not have to fire people. Let us have a &#163;3 billion jobs plan to use the money that will be spent on unemployment benefit to get people off the dole. Above all&#151;and this is absolutely fundamental, although the Prime Minister does not understand it&#151;let us have a truly massive Government-backed insurance scheme to get the money out of the banks and into small businesses. Those are five good reasons&#151;perhaps the hon. Gentleman will listen to them and cross the Floor so that he does not have to lose his seat.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o111"><a name="81203-0004.htm_para17"><a name="08120351000222">Everything that the Prime Minister has told us, not just in the past 10 years but in the past 10 weeks, has completely fallen apart. His latest claim&#151;and I want to be fair to him by taking it apart&#151;is that the political division is between action and inaction. That is typical of his approach. He cannot handle a real argument with a real alternative, but can only ever set up a straw man. We see it week after week at Question Time: he takes a set of beliefs that nobody holds&#151;a set of propositions that no one agrees with and usually a set of things that nobody has said&#151;and then proceeds to attack them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o112"><a name="81203-0004.htm_para18"><a name="08120351000223">That is a sign of his weakness, not of his strength. This recession was brought about by runaway borrowing and a massive failure of financial regulation, yet the Prime Minister&#146;s answer is more discretionary borrowing and a complete refusal to admit any mistakes in the regulatory system that he created.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o113"><a name="81203-0004.htm_para19"><a name="08120351000224">The real solution, which we are putting forward, should lie in lower interest rates, massive Government-insured guarantees for bank lending, and support for families and businesses that does not permanently impair the public finances and the chances of recovery. That is the answer, and it is contained in the five points that I just outlined to the hon. Member for Wolverhampton, South-West (Rob Marris). Only some boneheaded Whips&#146; plant could argue that that is inaction; even the hon. Gentleman is nodding his head in agreement that what I have set out is not inaction&#151;it plainly is not. The real division is between the right and the wrong action, between our long-term action that will really make a difference and the Prime Minister&#146;s short-term action taken just to get through tomorrow&#146;s headlines.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o114"><a name="81203-0004.htm_para20"><a name="08120351000225">Let us take the situation with the banks. When will the Prime Minister accept what the whole country now knows&#151;that his bank recapitalisation is not working? It rescued the banks but not the small and medium-sized firms. They cannot get the loans or overdrafts that they need, and the charges being levied on them are frankly outrageous.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o115"><a name="81203-0004.htm_para21"><a name="08120351000226">The Government&#146;s response is to hold endless meetings with bankers that are conveniently briefed to tomorrow&#146;s newspapers to try to make the Prime Minister look good, but it is not making any difference. That is why we need, in this Queen&#146;s Speech, a Government insurance scheme to get the banks lending. That is long-term change, not short-term politics.</p>

already falling and then warning of tax rises that are coming down the road is not exactly stimulating. Instead, what we need in the Queen&#146;s Speech is a plan to reduce the future growth of public spending to show how we can keep taxes down in future&#151;again, that is long-term change and not short-term politics.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o117"><a name="81203-0004.htm_para23"><a name="08120351000228">What is the long-term consequence of the Prime Minister&#146;s failed Budget and short-term approach? It is a black hole in the public finances that everyone knows means taxes going up under Labour. The Government have already told us about the national insurance change, but that is not just a tax rise on anyone earning over &#163;19,000&#151;it is also a tax rise on every job in the country. Can anyone think of anything more stupid than putting a tax rise on jobs when the economy is going to be struggling to recover?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o118"><a name="81203-0004.htm_para24"><a name="08120351000229">We all know what the secret tax rise is&#151;VAT will first be raised to 18.5 per cent. and then to 20 per cent. <i> [</i><i> Interruption.</i><i> ]</i> It is no good Labour Members shaking their heads, as we have all seen the Government order. This was not some leak to the Tory Front Bench; this was the Financial Secretary to the Treasury signing a document and putting it on the Treasury website. Who is the Prime Minister going to arrest for that one?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o119"><a name="81203-0004.htm_para25"><a name="08120351000230">The Prime Minister&#146;s approach of making endless announcements to try to win short-term advantage depends on one crucial assumption, and it is one that I think he always gets wrong. He assumes that the British people are stupid and that they will not realise he will have to fill the black hole with higher taxes. He assumes that they do not notice when the Government present a tax-con rather than a tax-cut Budget, and that they will believe it when he tells them that all the problems come from America.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o120"><a name="81203-0004.htm_para26"><a name="08120351000231">The Prime Minister thinks that British people are stupid, or that they do not see through him when he wanders off to Iraq to visit the troops in the middle of a Tory conference. However, he has to realise that if he takes people for fools, they will never take him for their Prime Minister.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o121"><a name="81203-0004.htm_para27"><a name="08120351000232">A proper Queen&#146;s Speech would be honest about the state that the country is in. The truth is that the Prime Minister is borrowing so much because he has spent so much, and that he has spent so much because he has done so little to solve our social problems. Let us just look at those problems.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o122"><a name="81203-0004.htm_para28"><a name="08120351000233">Welfare dependency is worse: there is more youth unemployment in Britain today than there was when the Government took office in 1997. That is why we need the Conservative plan for radical welfare reform, by giving the voluntary sector the power to go into our most deprived communities. On family breakdown, we have one of the worst records in Europe. That is why we need the Conservative plan to strengthen families, to end the couple penalty and to back marriage in the tax system.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o123"><a name="81203-0004.htm_para29"><a name="08120351000234">What about health inequality? Surely a Labour Government would do something about that. Wrong. The gap in life expectancy between the richest and the poorest in our country is greater than at any time since the reign of Queen Victoria. That is why we need the Conservative plan to scrap the top-down targets and to stop doctors answering to Whitehall and get them answering to patients. All that needs to be underpinned by our plan to reconstruct a battered economy.</p>

His constituency was next door to mine, and he embodied the values and ethos of Fife. I met John only a day before he died. I thanked him for all his endeavours on behalf of the people of Fife.

The review takes into account the dangers that now exist on the Afghan-Pakistan border. It also takes in the need to complement military action with enhanced protection by helicopters and the new fund for asking other countries to provide helicopters, as well as proper burden sharing, with help to train the Afghan army and police, to strengthen their systems of governance and to develop their economy.

I thank all parties in Northern Ireland for coming together to make the final part of a devolution settlement possible and now something that can be delivered, with policing and justice devolved in the next few months.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o142"><a name="81203-0005.htm_para18"><a name="08120351000260">We are finding that the solutions to every crisis require not just action in our country but action internationally. In the challenges to our security and to our economy, and to our environment posed by climate change, the world is having to act together to resolve those problems. We know that climate change, terrorism and global poverty are the problems of a changing global society. The lesson of recent months is that the problems that we face can be met only by acting co-operatively on the basis of our interdependence, not by glorying in isolation. The financial problems that we have require action not just in Britain but in every country. After a year when oil prices have been volatile, the climate change and energy challenge can be met only through action that will lead, I believe, to a settlement at next year&#146;s crucial Copenhagen summit.</p>

I have to go on what they say&#151;it is they who are investigating. Of course the police are accountable, but we also have to recognise that they are operationally independent. Opposition Members cannot pick and choose whether they support operational independence on one occasion or another&#151;they have to support operational independence. I am now going to make progress with my speech.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o146"><a name="81203-0006.htm_para1"><a name="08120351000306">The Chancellor set out the most comprehensive programme of real help for businesses and families, and now we want to go further. In the past 10 years, 1 million more people have become home owners and there are more owner-occupiers than ever in the history of our country. People who have saved up for a house are proud of what they have achieved, and we are proud of what they have achieved. For many, their biggest fear is that they might face repossession in this world downturn. Today the Government can go further than we were able to go last week, with a new charter for mortgage holders. We want to do what no country has done before in providing new protections for home owners. We will do everything in our power to ensure that no hard-working family who demonstrate to their bank a willingness to pay can or should face the fear of repossession of their family home.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o147"><a name="81203-0006.htm_para2"><a name="08120351000307">We want to build three protections and put them in place for home owners&#151;three pillars for people worried about their homes. <i> [</i><i> Interruption.</i><i> ]</i> I know that Opposition Members think that it is funny when we talk about mortgages, home owners and repossession, but this is exactly what the country wants us to be able to do for them. First, having agreed with the lenders that no repossession should be initiated in the first three months after the borrower has moved into arrears, I can announce that Northern Rock and Bradford &amp; Bingley have joined the Royal Bank of Scotland in agreeing that it will not repossess homes for a full six months. I urge all responsible banks to follow their example. Secondly, our new pre-action protocol makes it clear that repossession should be a last resort. Judges now expect lenders to consider what steps and what flexibilities might help to keep hard-working families in their homes. We are backing that up with free debt advice in every court, and we will work to ensure that the protocol is minimising the number of repossessions ever brought to court.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o148"><a name="81203-0006.htm_para3"><a name="08120351000308">Today I want to offer to families worrying about their mortgages a third protection, which will be an additional guarantee of fairness for all home owners facing difficult economic times. Hard-working households that experience a redundancy or significant loss of income as a result of the downturn will be able to defer a proportion of their interest payments for up to two years while they get their family finances back on track. This measure is in addition to our protection for the unemployed, who, after 13 weeks, can claim help with their mortgage. It will extend protection for those in work as well as those out of work and will be available at a higher level of income. We will make this possible by guaranteeing lenders against the risk of loss from those deferred interest payments. I am pleased that I can announce today that the country&#146;s eight largest lenders have already agreed to sign up and work this new scheme, the detail of which will be published in the next few days. The lenders include HBOS, Nationwide, Abbey, Lloyds TSB, Northern Rock, Barclays and HSBC&#151;already 70 per cent. of the mortgages that are held in this country.   <br>

 Let me explain that we are doing exactly that. The special liquidity scheme that gives money to the banks is on condition that those that we own put the same amount of lending into small businesses as they did in 2007. At the same time, we have introduced a &#163;1 billion scheme for export credits for small businesses. We have also pushed another &#163;1 billion for the small business loan guarantee scheme. All that is on top of a deferment of the rate of small firms corporation tax, &#163;4 billion of loan capital for small and medium-sized enterprises and a pledge that every bill that the Government owe will be paid in 10 days. We have taken all those steps to help small businesses and we are now in discussions with the banks about how they can move them forward. We will meet representatives of the banks later this week, and I tell the hon. Gentleman that we are making available the necessary money, and he should support exactly what we are doing.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o153"><a name="81203-0006.htm_para8"><a name="08120351000319">Let me deal with jobs. The first step is to help keep people in jobs and that means more funding for training in work. We will invest more to allow small businesses and others to keep on employees to give them skills they need so that training can be done for the upturn, and vital employees can be kept on instead of losing their jobs. The second step is immediate access to advice and training. People who face redundancy will get immediate practical support. That is possible only because we have a new deal in which we are investing more than &#163;1 billion&#151;investment that the Opposition would always oppose. The third step is guaranteeing a start to securing new skills and help within a month for people who are unemployed. That is possible only because we have a properly financed Jobcentre Plus and a new deal that can do that job.</p>

It will include a requirement that those out of work undertake work-related activity so that we help them enhance their skills and increase their confidence, thus giving them the tools they need to invest in the future and make a contribution, instead of languishing on the dole. All that is in stark contrast to the Opposition&#146;s flagship policy on unemployment, launched in the morning and sunk in an afternoon, which the Federation of Small Businesses called a disincentive, not an incentive, to work.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o171"><a name="81203-0007.htm_para12"><a name="08120351000360">On Afghanistan, when the right hon. Gentleman conducts this review, will he accept that any lasting stability or peace can be established or maintained only if there is a regional dimension, so that the powers that encircle Afghanistan&#151;Pakistan, Russia, central Asia, China and Iran as well&#151;must indispensably be included in any lasting settlement? Secondly, the Prime Minister has highlighted the fact that we are effectively on our way out of Iraq. Does he not think that it is time to admit that we need a full public inquiry into the circumstances that led to that fatal decision to invade Iraq in the first place? Finally, on repossession, I welcome much of what the right hon. Gentleman has announced today&#151;but if only he had listened to us three or four months ago when we made precisely the same recommendations. Will he tell me how many households that are falling into arrears will be helped by these new measures? The previous measures covered roughly one in 10 of all households in arrears; how many does he think will be covered by the new measures?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o172"><a name="81203-0007.htm_para13"><a name="08120351000361">Today was a very important opportunity. This has been a terrible year for millions of British families who are struggling to make ends meet, struggling to pay this month&#146;s mortgage bill and this winter&#146;s heating bills, and who are worried about whether they can give their children the sort of Christmas they deserve. People are waiting, anticipating, asking and pleading, &#147;Please help us&#148;. The Prime Minister says that he is Winston Churchill and the Business Secretary, never known to be outdone in hyperbole, says that he is not Churchill, but Moses. People therefore have the right to expect something big from the Government&#151;perhaps a tablet of stone to fix their everyday problems&#151;yet all they get is this meagre  <br>

document, dressed up as a solution. We are facing an unprecedented economic crisis and people need a helping hand, yet most of this Queen&#146;s Speech is lifted directly from the Prime Minister&#146;s pre-Queen&#146;s Speech announcements in May. Has he not noticed that the world has changed&#151;and changed utterly? This non-stop drum beat from the Government is like a sort of legislative &#147;muzak&#148;, an irritating hum in the background, of no use or no help to anyone.</p>

They act where they should not act and they fail to act where they should. How on earth can the Government justify the 26th criminal justice Bill without a single mention in the Queen&#146;s Speech or in the subsequent debate on the Loyal Address of the environment or the climate change crisis, which remains the greatest crisis facing us for generations to come? How on earth could the Prime Minister have unveiled legislation that, if reports are to be believed, will give the police the power to check everyone&#146;s identity in this country, so smuggling in the ID card system by the back door, while saying absolutely nothing about reducing fuel bills for those people who cannot pay them at all?</p>

One lot want to do everything and the other lot want to do nothing: it is a terrible choice between a wrong direction or simply going backwards.

Listening to my right hon. Friend&#151;[Hon. Members: &#147;Oh!&#148;] I am just checking that he is paying attention. Listening to the right hon. Member for Witney (Mr. Cameron), I do not know what he would actually do. He seems to think that public spending should be cut in 2010 when we will still be in the teeth of a recession. He calls this &#147;being responsible&#148;; this from the party that has been responsible for most of the worst recessions that this country has seen in the post-war period, and is trying now to steal the cloak of so-called prudence.</p>

The pre-Budget report and the Queen&#146;s Speech should have delivered big, permanent and fair tax cuts to people on low and middle incomes who are struggling to make ends meet, paid for by closing the multi-billion pound loopholes that only benefit wealthy individuals and large businesses. The pre-Budget report and the Queen&#146;s Speech should finally have released local authorities from the restrictions that prevent them from borrowing money against their own assets to buy up unsold properties to provide more social housing to families who have no permanent roof over their heads.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o178"><a name="81203-0007.htm_para19"><a name="08120351000369">The pre-Budget report and the Queens Speech should finally have signalled that banks will be forced to lend to businesses and, if not, that the Government would start lending to businesses directly themselves. Instead of using &#163;12.5 billion to give a temporary VAT cut that no one has noticed, that is helping nobody and which everyone will have to pay for later, any borrowed money should have been used to invest in our common future; in greener energy, public transport and better and more social housing.</p>

At the moment, the first units of energy are billed at a higher price than any subsequent units of energy. It sounds technical, but what does it mean in human terms? It means that a pensioner on very modest means, scrimping and saving to heat one single room in her house, will be paying more for her energy than a millionaire heating five floors of their mansion from top to toe. That is wrong, it is a scandal, it should have ended and the Government could have done something about it now.</p>

This is dangerous; dangerous for this House and dangerous for anyone who believes in a parliamentary democracy. It breeds discontent, extremism, anger and frustration. People need solutions, yet they look around today and what have they got? Pantomime. This is a Government who received barely 22 per cent. of the eligible vote at the last election, who are stumbling through a crisis of their own making, ramming through laws, deaf to all criticism, and blind to all dissent. People will give up on politics if we are not very careful. It is no wonder that in the last two general elections&#151;those of 2001 and 2005&#151;more people did not vote; more people stayed at home than voted for this Government. If this Government were truly a reforming Government, the Queen&#146;s Speech would attempt to reform our politics as well as our economy: it would move to get big money out of party politics altogether; it would reform a clapped-out, unfair electoral system; and it would devolve power away from Westminster and Whitehall, where it is being hoarded.

 It is a pleasure and great honour to be called so early in the debate on the Queen&#146;s Speech, and it is also a pleasure to follow the right hon. Member for Sheffield, Hallam (Mr. Clegg). He described the Queen&#146;s Speech as a pantomime. I have now attended some 26 Queen&#146;s Speeches and have gone to the other place to follow proceedings, and I have always thought it more a pageant than a pantomime.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o184"><a name="81203-0008.htm_para3"><a name="08120351000382">It is clear from this debate and the Queen&#146;s Speech that there are difficulties in handling the recession. The Gracious Speech must be set against the background of world economic events; we cannot stop the world and get off. The Government&#146;s goal is to steer the country through a financial crisis that has converted itself into an economic crisis, and that may yet become a social crisis the like of which we have not seen since the 1930s and the time of the Jarrow marches. There are various corollaries to that: deflation, unemployment and recession leading to depression. That is why, as is clearly stated in the Gracious Speech, the Government place such emphasis on workers, families and small businesses in order to alleviate any effects of the recession and to prevent it from being deeper or longer lasting than it needs to be. That highlights the importance of a fiscal stimulus linked to a monetary policy, and that is where there is a clear difference between the views and positions of the Government and the Opposition.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o185"><a name="81203-0008.htm_para4"><a name="08120351000383">The Leader of the Opposition made a fine speech. I congratulate him on his humour and on the way he conducted himself; in the House of Commons we can congratulate other Members when they make good speeches, like Geoffrey Boycott would always congratulate the bowler who bowled him a good delivery. However, as is clear from today&#146;s debate, there is a clear difference between the views of the Leader of the Opposition and Opposition Members and the views of the Government. The Leader of the Opposition today prayed in aid the German Finance Minister and, in the past, he has prayed in aid the German Chancellor. Although Germany has fallen into a recession, along with the other 12 member states of the eurozone, and although it is committed to a fiscal stimulus as well as to monetary policy, the German response has been hesitant and modest&#151;some &#8364;12 billion of fresh spending over two years, or roughly 0.25 per cent. of gross domestic product, triggering &#8364;50 billion of investment. The German Finance Minister has set his face very clearly against a fiscal policy only; he gave his approval to the idea of a monetary stimulus and, as the Leader of the Opposition mentioned, he discussed events going back to the 1970s. This always reminds me of a line of poetry:</p>

He does believe in what I would call the single-club economic policy; he believes that tax cuts should be funded from elsewhere in the budget. He referred to that today, putting forward some of his own proposals: freezing council tax; cutting national insurance; creating 3 million jobs; and, again, he referred to his national loan scheme. That is a modest set of propositions when contrasted with the Chancellor&#146;s proposals for small and medium-sized enterprises&#151;&#163;1 billion-worth of tax cuts, &#163;2 billion in loan guarantees and &#163;4 billion from the European Investment Bank, all building on monetary policy. That is a positive and proactive approach to the present economic downturn and recession, which, again, places the emphasis on workers and businesses. The Government&#146;s approach differs from the Opposition&#146;s on that. The Government believe in a strong dose of intervention at this time to see us through the recession and lessen its impact, whereas the Opposition are content with what I would call a minimum approach&#151;lowering interest rates and letting them take the strain.</p>

In June, for example, the Prime Minister said that renewable energy could provide 160,000 new jobs. We did not hear too much about that today, but any review of eco-industry will show that that is where future investment should lie.

That idea is at the heart of the Queen&#146;s Speech, at the heart of what the Government are trying to say and at the heart how we deal with our economic problems, how we deal with the future and how we reorient our industries.</p>

The Government have to be a listening Government and an active Government. They must be proactive and they must deal with problems, as they come along, in the best way. They ought to do that within the following framework: they should ask whether when they intervene they should intervene within the free market or in a stronger regulatory form; and they should ask how they can protect jobs and small businesses.

Sir David Normington who called in the police, he really is the guilty party whose judgment is so flawed that he is not fit to retain his position. If it was the Cabinet Office driving the affair forward, the guilty person would be Sir Gus O&#146;Donnell, and he too should explain his actions and consider his position. I leave it to people in this House much more distinguished than I am to argue about how much the Home Secretary or other politicians knew, but the point is that David Normington and Gus O&#146;Donnell knew everything. They thought it right and proper to arrest a Member of Parliament who revealed the truth about the Home Office&#151;a Department described by a former Home Secretary as &#147;not fit for purpose&#148;.</p>

If that is what happened, they are the ones who are not fit for purpose and they should explain themselves rather than hiding behind the Home Secretary, the Prime Minister and other senior members of the Government. Ministers may have their own explaining to do in due course, but we are in danger of losing sight of who initiated this arrest.</p>

I liked it so much that I turned down promotion to something else so that I could stay on as Police Minister. I have always defended the police in this country because I regarded them as the finest in the world. I think that all of us have had our illusions about British policing shattered because of this despicable assault on parliamentary privilege by some officers or a section of the Met.</p>

One of the greatest frustrations in my campaign was getting the release of a report by Devon and Cornwall police into the actions of Surrey police in investigating those deaths. I now feel that there has been a conspiracy of concealment, involving a Government Department and those police forces, to cover up what may have been murder.

Half a dozen people in the other place may be qualified to rule on the constitutional propriety of parliamentary privilege; some in this House will be qualified to do that, but I am certain that the head of the transport police is not capable of conducting a proper independent inquiry into whether the Metropolitan police acted with due care and diligence and proportionality in arresting a Member of Parliament for leaks from the Home Office. It is a farce; it is ridiculous; and it does the Met even more damage.</p>

He says that they must be able to act without fear and favour&#151;he is absolutely right&#151;but Members of Parliament must be able to do our duty. Using police officers to interrogate a Member of Parliament for doing his duty is a gross abuse of police powers. I regret that I am saying these words because I have liked the Met for years. I had an old uncle who served in the Met many years ago. I greatly enjoyed being the Minister responsible for the Metropolitan Police in my four years at the Home Office. But until the Met police get their act together and sort themselves out, they are casting a shadow on the neutrality and integrity of the whole British police service that the rest of the police service does not deserve.</p>

Such attacks only feed those in the print media, some of whom sit in judgment above Mr. Speaker and have always held a grudge against him. Yes, we must make it clear that we will defend Parliament from all unwarranted assaults on our rights, but we do not defend Parliament by going along with some in the media who wish to bring down Mr. Speaker. It is interesting that some of those in the print media who now profess to want to defend the status of Parliament are among the first who want to rake in our dustbins to find every derogatory item that they can get.

 Precisely. I had concluded my remarks on that matter, but I respect the Minister and I gave way to him. I simply make the point, which has been made by others, perhaps from a sedentary position, that we do not know whether any of these allegations are true, so why repeat them in this place? I have not made general attacks on the civil service; I have strongly criticised two very senior civil servants. If I am wrong, I will happily withdraw my remarks and apologise in a public place to them, but I am commenting on facts that do seem to be in the public domain&#151;that Sir David Normington at the Home Office and the Cabinet Office have initiated this action. I am commenting on the fact that the Metropolitan police have done what they have done and I said that their judgment was flawed because it was a gross over-reaction which has left me deeply saddened by and disappointed in the Metropolitan police. I hope that this matter can be cleared up because I want my faith and trust in the Met restored. I always thought that they were a tremendous police force, acting under the most difficult conditions, doing an almost impossible job in the capital. I have defended them from many previous attacks. The fact that I in my position now find I am attacking a section of them gravely disappoints me more than perhaps it does the Minister.</p>

The House may not know that in a part of my constituency on the Solway firth we have large mudflats very similar to those in Morecambe bay, with the same sort of tides and highly dangerous access. When one is out on those mudflats, if the tide comes in one has only a few minutes to get to shore before one finds oneself in deep ravines; one can drown.</p>

They say that the Silloth on Solway lifeboat can do the job instead.

Credit card companies now charge an admin fee of about &#163;12 if one goes over one&#146;s credit limit, so the banks have recognised that charges of &#163;39, &#163;35 or &#163;25 are totally unfair in the case of someone who has technically gone over an overdraft limit.</p>

I hope that the Government will withdraw their pharmacy White Paper and plans to change the pharmacy system. There is no problem with pharmacies, as hon. Members will have found in their constituencies. The White Paper includes proposals that would be disastrous for some rural areas, because people would not be able to use the local dispensing chemist in the doctor&#146;s surgery and would be forced to go many miles to another chemist. I understand where the Government are coming from&#151;if a town contains two or three good little private pharmacies, it may be unfair for the doctors to have one too&#151;but the parameters set by the Government would mean GP dispensing being wiped out in many parts of the country, in which case there would be no other convenient dispensary for people to get their medicines.</p>

 Far be it for me to defend the Government on that issue&#151;I have made criticisms and written to them on many occasions&#151;but will the right hon. Gentleman accept the correction that, as I understand it, the White Paper proposes ending GP pharmacies only if there is a pharmacy within a mile of the GP practice&#146;s headquarters?</p>

 Yes, that is right. However, in some cases those private pharmacies will be open only nine-to-five and on Saturday afternoons; they will not be available during the out-of-hours times that a GP service could manage. If in my town of Kirkby Stephen, for example, somebody needed a prescription late on a Saturday afternoon and GPs were not allowed to prescribe, that person would not be able to get their medicine at that time.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o219"><a name="81203-0009.htm_para16"><a name="08120351000436">The White Paper lays down the option of doing nothing, and I ask the Government to take that option. Has anyone encountered a huge problem with GP prescribing at our pharmacies before? The Government are shaking the system up for no good reason, except one&#151;GP prescribing is more expensive. It seems that doctors tend to prescribe more expensive drugs, rather than the generic ones that they could prescribe, from their own pharmacies. However, the control method is in the Government&#146;s hands: they could inspect GP pharmacies and impose sanctions on doctors who over-prescribed expensive drugs.</p>

 I thank the right hon. Gentleman for giving way yet again. The Measham medical unit in North-West Leicestershire is an example of an excellent GP dispensing pharmacy. The right hon. Gentleman mentioned the Government&#146;s view that GP prescribing is more expensive. People at the unit would say that such prescriptions are more effective, and that effectiveness rather than cost is the measure by which we should assess how effective GP dispensing is.</p>

 I would certainly accept that as a criterion, but it is not one of the three reasons given in the White Paper about why the Government are disturbing the system. There is no mention of making the system more effective through GPs or private pharmacies issuing better quality, more effective medicines. One of the main reasons given is cost. GP prescriptions for GP pharmacies are more expensive than those for external pharmacies, so the Government are bearing down on that&#151;and if they cannot bear down on the cost in that way, they will ban the GPs from making such prescriptions. That is the wrong approach. If GPs and individual practices are prescribing over-expensive medicines, there is a system in government and the health service to spot that and clobber those responsible.</p>

I can see nothing in the Queen&#146;s Speech directly relevant to them, and I hope that there will be a chance for the Government to withdraw them.

regulation 98/83/EC. As has happened under all Governments, DEFRA is adding bells and whistles and gold-plating. The regulation covers even private water suppliers. If one has a well in one&#146;s back garden, its water has to come up to a basic standard of purity. The cost of inspection at the moment is about &#163;50 to &#163;70; under the DEFRA proposals, it will go up to between &#163;700 and &#163;800. The Department is suggesting that it will bring in the full risk assessment system and the full inspection that applies to larger private water users, which consume more than 3 cu m of water a day. That is a lot.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o221"><a name="81203-0009.htm_para18"><a name="08120351000442">Scotland, of course, is not going for that. It is going for the derogation and will not apply the measure to any private water user consuming less than 3 cu m of water. Ireland is not applying the measure. I understand that the Welsh Assembly is in discussions with DEFRA about the regulation at the moment, and I will be amazed if the Welsh implement it. However, DEFRA in England is going full steam ahead towards imposing those ludicrously high charges&#151;and on people who could not get a public water supply in any case. Those people are not making a lifestyle choice to live in the mountains, have a bore hole and put up two fingers to United Utilities. They cannot get water through the mains pipeline because they are so far away from it. In addition to their not being able to get mains water and sewerage, they could now face punitive charges for having their own water from their own well inspected by busybodies who think they know better than local householders.</p>

I end where I started: I am sorry that we may have to build in measures to put police controls into a Bill dealing with police accountability so that the police do not exceed and abuse their powers. Furthermore, we will step up our calls for a Bill to restore the civil service&#146;s impartiality and integrity, and the respect that it has had in every country of the world. Despite what I see as failings at too high a level at the Home Office and Cabinet Office, we still have the finest and best civil service in the world.</p>

 It is always a pleasure to follow the right hon. Member for Penrith and The Border (David Maclean). I pay tribute to him. Despite his disability, he contributes fully to the work of this House. He gave a typically passionate and very fair speech highlighting issues that naturally concern Parliament at the moment, and he did so in a way that we can all respect. He was right, in particular, to praise Mr. Speaker for the way in which he conducted himself. Mr. Speaker was absolutely right not to start giving press conferences because of the circumstances that have arisen since last Thursday. He was right to come to the House to address Members first and foremost about this issue. There are no leaks from the Speaker&#146;s Office, so nobody was aware of what he was going to say from the Chair, but I was as surprised as probably every other Member of this House to hear that a Member&#146;s offices were searched without a warrant and with the consent of a third party.</p>

Minister of State, Department of Energy and Climate Change, my hon. and learned Friend the Member for North Warwickshire (Mr. O&#146;Brien) and, to a lesser extent, by the right hon. Member for Penrith and The Border. That is the right time for everyone to have an opportunity to air their views on this very important issue. I look forward to the debate. I hope that we will be able to set up a Committee that reflects the House and is able to do what Members want it to do, which is carefully to consider all the circumstances of this case. After all, we are setting up an inquiry into an event that occurred not several months or years ago but last Thursday, so it should be very fresh in the minds of everyone involved.</p>

Member for Penrith and The Border is right&#151;I am sure that he is, judging from what has been said in the newspapers&#151;this concerns a lot of very senior members of the Metropolitan police and of the civil service. I have spoken to the Home Secretary, who is yet to make a statement on the matter; I gather that she will do so tomorrow after business questions, although it has not been confirmed by the Annunciator. That will be her opportunity to put on the record what she knew about the circumstances surrounding the arrest of the hon. Member for Ashford (Damian Green). In my conversations with her, she has been very clear that she knew nothing. However, let us hear it not from me or the media but from her when she makes her statement tomorrow and, if she participates, in the debate next week. Let us keep those discussions for that debate while registering, as did the right hon. Member for Penrith and The Border with the passion that he displayed, our grave concern as parliamentarians as to precisely what happened last week. I hope that we get an explanation from all those who were responsible.

If we decide to move forward on this issue, that will be a further opportunity to do as the right hon. Member for Penrith and The Border asked, which is to examine very carefully what the police have done. It affects not only Members of this House but every citizen of this country if they are allowed to go into the house or office of a third party without a warrant but with the consent of a third person. That will create a lot of problems. For example, what if someone is out on a particular day when the police want to search their property, and their landlord happens to be there? If they get his consent, is that enough in law?</p>

moment the decision was made and when the Mayor of London was rung. It was odd to ring the Mayor of London, but not tell the Home Secretary. Perhaps the Mayor of London is normally rung about such matters and he knows about every arrest that is to be made in the Metropolitan police area. Who knows?

members being elected rather than appointed by the various political groups and others, but when the matter is discussed in Committee, we will have an opportunity to scrutinise the proposals. My hon. Friend the Member for North-West Leicestershire (David Taylor) and I share a police committee, a chief constable and a police force. Sometimes we feel that there should be better accountability. We need to explore the best way of achieving that when the Bill is given a Second Reading.</p>

 My right hon. Friend and I do indeed share an excellent police authority that operates fairly well at the moment. Does he share my concern that in aiming to create popular policing, the measures, as we currently understand them, will risk creating populist policing, by having directly elected people on police authorities? The turnout for elections of that kind is not likely to be high, so are such bodies likely to have much legitimacy?</p>

<p><a name="st_o212"><a name="08120351000456"><a name="81203-0010.htm_spnew6"><a name="08120351000707"><b>Keith Vaz:</b>
 My hon. Friend is right; there are concerns. It has been put to me that holding such elections might mean that those on the far right will get on to the committees and therefore control police forces. However, in my view, the people will get what they vote for. There can be sufficient safeguards to ensure that such bodies represent the views of the public. Therefore, I support in principle what the Government propose. We need to deal with the issue by raising the profile of police committees. That will promote a better understanding of what such committees do, enabling people to call them to account in a way that was perhaps not possible previously. So, with the caveat about low turnouts that my hon. Friend mentioned, I think that people should know who runs our local police forces.</p>

The Select Committee on Home Affairs produced a major report, entitled &#147;Policing in the 21st Century&#148;, in which we made a number of recommendations about police time. We felt that too much police time was being spent on alcohol-related crime. One in every two crimes in this country is in some way alcohol related. We felt that the real culprits were the supermarkets, by offering two cans of beer or lager or two bottles of spirits for the price of one and by reducing prices so much. That meant that it was easy for people to get pre-loaded before going out on a Saturday night. They then went out in our towns and cities, bought beer in pubs and caused even more disorder.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o230"><a name="81203-0010.htm_para7"><a name="08120351000458">I am not making an attack on the alcohol industry, but it must be more responsible. If the industry is more responsible, a lot of the time that the police spend dealing with alcohol-related crime will be saved. If hon. Members go to any custody suite on a Saturday night, they will find it full of people who are drunk and who have committed violent offences or public order offences. That occupies a huge amount of the police&#146;s time. That is why it is so important not just to deal with what is happening in our supermarkets, but to send out a message to those running our clubs who offer happy hours, free drinks or two drinks for the price of one&#151;anything to get people totally smashed, so that they do not know what they are doing. What we have heard today is a good sign that the Government are prepared to listen.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o231"><a name="81203-0010.htm_para8"><a name="08120351000459">There is a commitment in the policing and crime reduction Bill to cut down even further on police paperwork. The Government&#146;s appointment of Jan Berry as the new paperwork tsar&#151;she has not taken up her appointment yet&#151;is a very good choice indeed, as she proved to be a very successful president of the Police Federation. As someone who has so recently served with the police at the level at which we as parliamentarians should deal with them&#151;we need to deal not just with chief constables, but with custody sergeants and officers on the beat&#151;Jan Berry will know where the red tape lies. When she makes her recommendations, which I hope will be in line with what Sir Ronnie Flanagan said in his report, I hope that the Government will slash that red tape, ensuring that what needs to be recorded can be recorded and that whatever is unnecessary is left to one side.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o232"><a name="81203-0010.htm_para9"><a name="08120351000460">That is why we on the Committee called firmly for every police officer in the country to be given a personal computer. If they each had a BlackBerry or personal computer, they would be able to record what was happening at the scene of the crime, rather than inviting people to come back later. I do not know whether the right hon. Member for Penrith and The Border considered such a proposal when he was the Minister with responsibility for policing&#151;I am not suggesting that computers had not been invented then&#151;but the technology has advanced much since, so let us use it.</p>

 When I was the Minister with responsibility for policing, I discovered that much of the information collected by the police was required by the Home Office because we in Parliament were asking questions about it. If we as parliamentarians are prepared to accept that we might not get to know the level of crime in a particular area on a particular Saturday night, the police will no longer need to collect that information. We would be slightly more in the dark, but police time would be greatly freed up.</p>

 The right hon. Gentleman is absolutely right and makes a point that will greatly assist the use of police time.

That is terribly important.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o233"><a name="81203-0010.htm_para10"><a name="08120351000463">Secondly, I welcome the equality Bill, for which we have been waiting for a long time. It is definitely the handiwork of the Leader of the House, the Minister for Women and Equality. The Bill will not introduce affirmative action, but it will deal with the remaining equality issues that we need to deal with, to ensure that our public bodies are accountable and transparent. It is good that we are going to put all the equality legislation of the past 20 to 30 years into one definitive equality Bill&#151;one statute that deals with all the issues.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o234"><a name="81203-0010.htm_para11"><a name="08120351000464">I hope that the Bill will also ensure that people feel that we remain a country of equal opportunity. Since 4 November, people have sometimes seemed to believe that equality has arrived only because President-elect Obama won the American presidential elections. However, ours is a country where people are treated equally, yet it is also important that our laws should reflect that. Changing the laws and then changing people&#146;s behaviour and attitude is how we get real and lasting change.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o235"><a name="81203-0010.htm_para12"><a name="08120351000465">I have two final points, the first of which is about the banking Bill. I am sure that none of the right hon. and hon. Members in the Chamber this evening was around last Thursday when I discussed the 17-year liquidation of the Bank of Credit and Commerce International, an issue in which I have been involved in for the whole of that time. The right hon. Member for Wokingham (Mr. Redwood) was at some stage the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry and I am sure that I had a meeting with him about the liquidation of BCCI in those 17 years. Hon. Members will remember that when BCCI closed and the Bingham report recommended better banking supervision, we were supposed to have very tight regulation, so that banks would never do the kinds of things that BCCI did.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o236"><a name="81203-0010.htm_para13"><a name="08120351000466">As the House knows, 84 per cent. of the money deposited by BCCI&#146;s customers has been paid back, even though when the bank closed on 5 July 1991, the then Prime Minister and Chancellor said that there was no money left in it. Because of the liquidation, almost all the money has been returned to the customers. I was simply making a plea that the liquidation should end quickly. I therefore welcome the proposals in the banking Bill that concern compensation to savers if a bank fails. That was not available to those who lost their money in BCCI. That is why they relied so heavily on the liquidation. I hope that we can implement the banking Bill in the light of what has happened in the past few months and ensure that our regulators really do regulate the banks.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o237"><a name="81203-0010.htm_para14"><a name="08120351000467">My final point is about immigration. We are promised another immigration Bill, but in the 21 years in which I have been in the House, we have probably had 21 immigration Bills. All were supposed to ensure that the immigration system was working adequately, which it clearly is not, as anyone who attended the Home Affairs Committee sitting just a couple of weeks ago, at which the Minister for Borders and Immigration spoke, will know. We still have a major problem with the immigration and nationality directorate. I do not think that introducing another Bill will make the system better. What we need is administrative action. We still have a huge backlog of cases, which, to be fair, we inherited from the previous Conservative Government when we took office in 1997. However, it is no excuse to say after 11 years that there is still a backlog. I have told successive Immigration Ministers that their place in history would be assured if they were the one to clear the backlog, but there is still a backlog.</p>

Perhaps I should begin with a rare word of praise for the Government: the good thing about this Queen&#146;s Speech is that there is not too much legislation in it. I make two pleas, however. First, may we please have the time to debate, at length and seriously, the proposed legislation in it, in order to do it justice? If one legislates in haste, one repents at leisure and has to legislate again and again, as we have seen.</p>

What Ministers do when they spend money and when they lead or mislead their civil service teams, or do not lead them at all, is crucial work. Their implementation of programmes and their day-to-day work of judging cases and hearing representations is also crucial work. As a parliamentarian who would like the opportunity to have more sittings here that we could attend, I feel that we could profitably spend our time probing and discussing more of those matters. Sensible Ministers would welcome that scrutiny. As a Minister, I often found it good to have to explain to the House what I was doing. It made one marshall one&#146;s case and realise where one needed to raise one&#146;s game. Colleagues on both sides of the House made helpful points, sometimes in anger or desperation and sometimes as friends, and one would have been a fool not to take such points on board and to understand what the House was doing.</p>

We see factory closure after factory closure and people going on to short-time working. Many people face having employment for only three or four days a week, some people are facing extended factory closures over Christmas and the new year and some people are facing redundancy.</p>

Living standards are also falling because although the oil price has come down a long way in dollar terms, it has not come down so far in sterling terms because of the weakness of the pound. It certainly has not come down when one faces the gas or electricity bill at home. Practically everyone in the country, save those who have managed to get an extra job on better pay, is experiencing a severe squeeze on living standards.</p>

Apparently, the Prime Minister has nothing better to do with his time than to consider the latest offerings on my website. I am greatly flattered by this, and perhaps that shows his true sense of priority, but would he and his acolytes please read it carefully, because what it said was that markets and Government policy are forcing living standards down? That is what I have just told the House, but I have done so at greater length on the website. That is not what I want or propose or think a good idea.

I loathe recessions; I have seen too many. Yes, they have occurred when different parties have been in office, but they have all been because major policy mistakes have been made. Every one of them has occurred in ways that could have been abated or ameliorated if different policy action had been taken. That is why I have spent the past two years trying to persuade the Government that they needed to take different action to avoid recession or, now that we are deep in it, to get out of it more quickly.</p>

budget and much less power. However, that is not the point of this debate. We are discussing the very big crisis that confronts a range of economies in the world.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o248"><a name="81203-0011.htm_para4"><a name="08120353000011">Britain happens to have one of the worst and most persistent examples of that crisis. We went into it quite early, with the collapse of Northern Rock, and we are now deep in it in a way that is not mirrored in China, Japan or Germany. Those countries are rather stronger when it comes to their balance of payments and financial position. Our position is closer to that of the United States of America, where similar policy errors were made to those that were made here.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o249"><a name="81203-0011.htm_para5"><a name="08120353000012">Let us be under no delusion. We did not inherit this problem from the United States of America; we do not have it because something went wrong there. Our policy makers and authorities, using their powers, made similar mistakes to the American mistakes. They should have known better, and they should listen to those of us who can give some explanation as to what went wrong. They should listen to those of us who care so much about our country that we offer them good advice to get out of the situation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o250"><a name="81203-0011.htm_para6"><a name="08120353000013">This is a big crisis, and it is not something to play party politics with. I agree with that proposition, which some have advanced from time to time. Everyone knows that I like a good party political scrap, and that I am not afraid of a good argument, but on this occasion, the magnitude of the crisis and the way in which action has been ineffective so far should be of grave concern to us all. We should listen a little more carefully and think together a little more about how to get out of the situation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o251"><a name="81203-0011.htm_para7"><a name="08120353000014">Let us consider some of the mistakes that have been made. In August 2007, it was obvious to me, as a commentator, and to many people in the City, that the money markets were drying out, that the Bank of England was not supplying enough cash and that there was going to be a banking catastrophe. We warned the Bank and told it to supply more cash, but it failed to do so. We had lectures from the Governor and the Chancellor that it served the banks right, but shortly after those lectures, the run on Northern Rock began. Shortly after that, I am pleased to say, they reversed their policy and agreed that they had to do something and to put money in. Had the Government put in the amount of money in August that they had put in by the end of the year, Northern Rock would not have gone down. It was a totally unnecessary casualty, as a result of obstinacy, foolishness and the inability of the authorities to understand the state of the markets.</p>

I said that if action had been taken to slash interest rates at that time&#151;I suggested halving them, and that has now just about been done, nine months too late&#151;some of the severity of the downturn could have been avoided. The Government decided, however, that they did not want to do that. They now have to answer to the House and tell us why they refused that well-intentioned advice, and why they could not see for themselves that interest rates were far too high and doing enormous damage, and that this was drying up credit in a way that was going to hit the  <br>

jobs of their constituents as well as ours, in a way that meant that a lot of businesses were going to run out of cash and in a way that was bound to bring things down.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o253"><a name="81203-0011.htm_para9"><a name="08120353000016">The Government have taken several famous lines on the recession. First, they have told us that they are on the side of everyone at this time. Well, I would hope that they are. We are all on the side of the people who are about to suffer; that is not something that creates a party political divide in this country. We are elected here to serve people, and I think that we all come here because we have a passion about the people we represent, and because we want them to have a better standard of life and better opportunities in life. That is not something that divides the parties, so it is quite wrong of the Government to go round suggesting that only they are on the side of the people.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o254"><a name="81203-0011.htm_para10"><a name="08120353000017">The Government, unlike us, are in a very privileged position. We can suggest, propose and argue about what we think should be done to show that we are on people&#146;s side, but the Government can actually do these things. When they threw the challenge across to my right hon. Friend the Member for Witney (Mr. Cameron)&#151;who was in extremely good voice today&#151;to name five things that he would do to help people during this very nasty recession, he reeled off five extremely sensible proposals that he and others on our Front Bench have been arguing for. He obviously took the wind out of the sails of that foolish attack.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o255"><a name="81203-0011.htm_para11"><a name="08120353000018">The Government should stop playing trivial politics with this issue, and see that the loyal Opposition are on the side of the people as well, and that we have some proposals that the Government have not yet adopted and that could help a bit. They need to understand that what the people want more than anything else is not help when they have a repossession crisis, when they have lost their job or when they cannot afford to pay the gas bill, but to see the Government following an economic policy that will get us out of this situation. They want the Government to offer some real hope to show that they have got on top of the banking crisis.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o256"><a name="81203-0011.htm_para12"><a name="08120353000019">In its early stages, the Gracious Speech referred to legislation for the banks. I have no objection to the Government wishing to put the banking code into legislation, and I understand that the banks have no objection either. The timing of the proposal is quite bizarre, however, because the Government are going to be legislating on banking conduct at precisely the time when a big chunk of the banking sector is coming under their direct control as a nationalised industry. Perhaps the Government do not trust themselves. Perhaps they suddenly see the need to have lots of banking regulation codified in statute because they are going to be the shareholder representatives, as well as choosing and getting rid of the directors and otherwise exercising some sort of control.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o257"><a name="81203-0011.htm_para13"><a name="08120353000020">This brings us to an interesting dilemma that the Government now face, and which they need to resolve. Again, it would be helpful if we could have some intelligent dialogue on this matter, rather than silly yah-boo politics. Here is the dilemma. The banks were called in on one famous weekend and told that they did not have enough capital for their existing amount of lending, and that they had to raise large sums of capital very quickly to satisfy the Government and the regulator, who could then say that the banks were secure and safe. That was a rather odd thing to do in the middle of a  <br>

very bad credit crunch. It would have been very good to have done it three years ago, before the credit explosion really got under way, because it would have taken some of the pressure out of the system and moderated banking conduct. It would also have been sensible to have done it in private, and not to have leaked it, so that the banks could have had a chance to raise the money from private sources without share prices being pushed against them by untimely and worrying leaks about how strong the banks really were.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o258"><a name="81203-0011.htm_para14"><a name="08120353000021">If the Government are serious that this is the right time to demand so much more capital for the existing amount of lending, they have to understand that the banks are going to lend less. There are two ways in which banks can meet the new capital requirements. One is to raise very large sums of money, and they have done that a bit, to the extent that they and the Government think that they can. The other way is to lend less, which will result in the ratio improving&#151;the ratio compares the lending with the amount of capital&#151;and this is primarily why the banks are lending less. They have been told, by the Government&#146;s regulator, that they need to lend less, relative to the amount of capital that they have.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o259"><a name="81203-0011.htm_para15"><a name="08120353000022">At the same time, however, the Government are saying that, now that the banks are coming under public ownership, it is terribly important that they should lend more. Are the Government going to adjust the capital ratio? Are they going to provide even more shareholder capital from the taxpayer? Or do they not understand that their statements are pointing in opposite directions and are contradictory? We need a better explanation from the Government of what they really expect from the banks. Do they want them to be super-prudent, now that they realise how imprudent the regulatory regime, the monetary regime&#151;and, yes, banking conduct&#151;were in the run-up to the credit crisis? Or are they now saying that they have probably overdone it, and they need the banks to lend more? If that is the case, they need to look again at the ratios and consider what they are going to do.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o260"><a name="81203-0011.htm_para16"><a name="08120353000023">Of course, no bank of any major scale must be allowed to go down, and I am pleased that the Government understand that. They normally suggest that people like me would like to see that happen, but of course I would not. I have gone blue in the face trying to explain why banks need to be supported, and that they need to be supported in the right way. I think that they need to be supported by an intelligent central bank that will lend them short-term funds when they need them, and by an intelligent regulator privately telling them how much extra capital they need to raise and giving them the chance to raise that capital, either by selling assets, cutting costs and generating more profit, or by going to the market, if that option is open to them. There are many ways in which banks can improve and increase their strength and their capital base, but they were not given the chance to do that because of the damaging leaks that occurred over that fateful weekend, when they were called in by the Government and the regulator.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o261"><a name="81203-0011.htm_para17"><a name="08120353000024">The subject of leaks is, of course, extremely topical, and I find it odd that such an asymmetric approach is being taken to the matter. A high-level inquiry is taking place into a series of leaks from the Home Office. There will be plenty of opportunity to debate that matter, and I do not wish to detain the House by talking about it  <br>

now. We need to know more before we can have an informed debate. I find it odd, however, that the same level of interest was not shown in the leaks about banking share capital, which were highly price sensitive and market sensitive, and which got out through a well-known conduit when what should have been secret talks were taking place at the Treasury. That had a big impact on the handling of the banking crisis in Britain. It speeded up the decision making, which possibly led to bad decisions being made, and, for some banks, it ruled out going to the market in the normal way or generating profit in the normal way to meet the targets. The leaks will prove extremely damaging to the taxpayer, and the information was highly price sensitive. It is surprising that no one is taking a great deal of interest in those leaks.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o262"><a name="81203-0011.htm_para18"><a name="08120353000025">The other day, we heard a statement that was meant to be the pre-Budget report. The pre-Budget report is quite rightly normally delivered as a statement, in which the Government revise their economic forecasts and give some background to the real Budget. On this occasion, however, the statement was not a pre-Budget report at all; it was a Budget. In fact, it was the biggest Budget that I have ever sat through in the House of Commons. It moved more money&#151;in absolute terms, and as a proportion of the economy&#151;than I have ever seen a Chancellor of the Exchequer propose to move. It was vast. It was a Budget that divided the House on party lines. The Conservatives rightly said that it involved the least sensible tax cut that could possibly be introduced, which would not have the desired effect. We also pointed out that the borrowing figures were so preposterously large that the Government would be running much too great a risk. The Government, however, believe that that tax cut and that amount of extra borrowing are the right way to handle the recession.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o263"><a name="81203-0011.htm_para19"><a name="08120353000026">That was a perfectly good disagreement that needed to be exposed. It was worth a decent debate. However, we got a debate only thanks to Mr. Speaker and only after a lot of huffing and puffing. A Government who come to the House in the person of the Prime Minister to say that they believe in parliamentary democracy should automatically have tabled two or three days to debate that Budget. The Prime Minister should have been proud of it, for heaven&#146;s sake. If he really believes in his case, if he thinks that he is right to gamble with so much borrowed money, and if he thinks that an immediate VAT reduction is what is needed to get everyone feeling happy and spending again, and to open the factories and stop the job losses, he has every entitlement to hold that view and to come and tell us about it. Surely he must be proud of it. I think that proposal is completely wrong; I wish it were not: if there were a quick, easy fix and if I thought that taking 2.5 per cent. off VAT would suddenly turn the economy around, I would be encouraging my colleagues on the Conservative Benches&#151;whether or not they agreed with me&#151;to say, &#147;Yes, this is exactly what we should be doing&#148;. Unfortunately, I do not think there is a prayer of it working. That is why it deserved a proper parliamentary debate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o264"><a name="81203-0011.htm_para20"><a name="08120353000027">That brings me to the concluding part of my remarks, which is about democracy itself.

the people against an over-mighty Executive. Now the form of the ceremony handles the King or Queen as the possible aggressor: that was true 300 to 400 years ago, but it is not true today in an era of a wonderful monarch, who is a democratic one and does not interfere in the political process. Today, the power is on the Treasury Bench; today, the power is in ministerial offices; today, the power is there in the form of Ministers who will not tell us what is going on, who will not answer to this House, who will not answer questions and who will not hold debates on the things that really matter.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o265"><a name="81203-0011.htm_para21"><a name="08120353000028">That is why Opposition Members&#151;I think Liberal Democrats as well as Conservatives&#151;are united in believing that the Government have to wake up and listen to those who say that we need a stronger democracy in this Parliament and that we will have better government if it is more accountable government. We will have better government if the Government respect the traditions of this place; we will have better government if Ministers try to answer questions instead of playing silly politics all the time and refusing to answer. It would not have hurt the Prime Minister to have treated my intervention seriously and answered my question about the &#163;487 billion that he is spending on the banks and the banking sector. It is a colossal sum of money; I, of course, wish him well with it; I agree with all the &#163;37 billion of it&#151;but it is not working and it needs to be reconsidered. The Prime Minister needs to re-examine the package to get it working quickly for all our sakes; otherwise, we are simply going to have more factory closures, more job losses, more office closures throughout this country&#146;s constituencies.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o266"><a name="81203-0011.htm_para22"><a name="08120353000029">If the Prime Minister cannot see that that is how he should conduct himself, it is going to be very difficult for him to make the difficult and important decisions he needs to make to start to get us out of this crisis. It is regrettable if he does not understand that most of the information handled in Government offices is not private information for Ministers to hoard and release to their favourite journalists when they choose, but public information that Ministers have a duty to release in due time and in the proper way to this House of Commons first. The privilege of belonging to this House should be that we get the information first and that we cross-examine the Government first. Why do we need that privilege? Because that is the way we do our job for our constituents. They expect to see Government policy and information tested in the furnace of the House of Commons first, not given to preferred journalists on the side and spun in favourable ways that do not allow the alternative case to be made.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o267"><a name="81203-0011.htm_para23"><a name="08120353000030">Our democracy is at risk. We have gone from having twice-a-week opportunities to cross-examine the Prime Minister to having only one opportunity. We were told, &#147;All will be fine, as you are going to get half an hour instead of a quarter of an hour&#148;, but that matters very much. It means that the Opposition have a chance of making the agenda only one day a week instead of the two days that we used to have with two 15-minute sessions. We have gone from a system under which most of the time most parliamentary questions got sensible answers in response to the question asked to a position today when most of written parliamentary questions I table get absolutely no answer at all.

We have two sorts of Ministers: very clever ones who know the answer and will not give it away because they find it so embarrassing, and not-so-clever ones who do not even know the answer that they must not give away. It is high time that we saw some Ministers on the Treasury Bench who know their subject well enough and have enough confidence in their case to tell us what the facts are, put the spin they want to put on it and try to satisfy the more moderate-minded people on the Opposition Benches. There are some and they would be satisfied with that; others would still disagree, but do so over something that mattered and based on proper information.</p>

All too little of that happens nowadays. That is why people outside are frustrated with this place; that is why people do not think it is working as it should be; that is why people feel that all the spin&#151;that the Government are on the people&#146;s side and the Opposition do not have a clue&#151;is not actually working. People are hurting out there; they are losing their jobs; their living standards are falling; they are under pressure.

He told us that he had foreseen the crisis&#151;well, congratulations on that&#151;and that the Government&#146;s measures were wrong, but he never told us what he would do.

He did not say whether he agreed with the Government&#146;s making liquidity available to the Bank of England, which will also help to get lending going again. He told us that markets were the answer, when it is markets that got us into this position in the first place. He criticised the failure to reduce interest rates, although he knows full well that those rates are controlled by the Bank of England, independently of the Government&#151;a development that his party welcomed. I was pretty critical of it, but all that contributed to high interest rates, which he denounced as the cause of the problem.</p>

Gentleman&#146;s speech, apart from having an extended Prime Minister&#146;s Question Time. Marvellous, but that will not help all the people who are hurting in the country at large. What we need is concrete measures, which I will come to in a little while. I have no doubt that the right hon.

I wish that flight had been a little longer, as we might have heard what he thought about the entire Liberal party.

Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon (Dr. Harris) for better Report stages are followed up, so that we can actually get to grips with all the amendments, including the Government amendments.

New Labour was an approach geared towards the economic management of good times and of steady growth, which we have had. We tend to forget it, but we have had long years of continuous growth that have made everybody in this country better off, improved schools, hospitals, public buildings and the centres of our cities. We should not forget that but we are now in a different situation; we are in a recession, a more difficult situation.</p>

It does not deserve the kiss of life that Lord Mandelson has been trying to give it. It was economics for another time and it has been killed, effectively, by the bursting of the bubble; a bubble based largely on increasing house prices, as a result of which everyone got optimistic and borrowed more. People felt able to borrow more and the banks felt able to lend more on the basis of increasing house prices. There is a simple law of economics, which is that if a thing cannot go on for ever, it probably will not, and it did not. The bubble burst and we are now in a new situation, one in which, I must tell the right hon. Member for Wokingham, we are all socialists now; even George Bush.

Only the state has the power during a recession to maintain a policy of fair shares. Only the state has the power to protect the individuals hit by the recession, as the Prime Minister announced today we are to do by strengthening the position of people who face repossessions; an important step in these economic difficulties. Only the state has the power to re-regulate in the way that the right hon. Gentleman clearly wanted.

I would join him in that because a better use for the money would be to pump it out into the community to spend rather than cutting VAT. When sales with discounts of 10, 20 and 30 per cent. have become a way of life in the high street, a cut of 2.5 per cent. in VAT makes no difference at all. As a camera fanatic, I shall finish my speech early so that I can get to Jessops to get 10 per cent. off its prices. Unfortunately, I see that it will be closed so my speech can extend to its natural length.</p>

We still have to deal with the 1 million or so who have not been compensated yet for the abolition of the 10p rate. Going by the mail I get, half that number appear to live in my constituency. That has to be dealt with. It is more sensible to take people out of tax altogether by raising the allowances and to help people by increasing benefits. Why not double the winter fuel allowance? Fifty pounds on the winter fuel allowance, which is now &#163;250 or &#163;400, for those over 80 is not adequate to deal with the huge rise in fuel bills people are facing this winter. Double it; increase benefits; and increase tax credits for working families. That directs the money straight at the problem of child poverty that we pledged to deal with.</p>

We want them to spend and buy; we want consumer demand to increase. The increase in the top rate of tax to 45 per cent. was welcome to me, but it should have been 50 per cent. and I think the community would have accepted that. There is a feeling that people who benefited so richly in the good years should now help to pay their share in the period of difficulty. Increase the top rate of tax next year; not now as we do not increase taxes in a recession. But the bottom 20 per cent. of the population pay about 40 per cent. of their incomes in direct and indirect tax whereas the top 20 per cent. only pay 35 per cent.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o285"><a name="81203-0012.htm_para15"><a name="08120353000055">Housing is a particular problem. Unfortunately, we are obsessed with ownership, and I think that that obsession has led us into having a real problem, because the rate of building of public housing for rent has been far too low. Unless the building of public housing for rent is kept pari passu with private building, there will be two developments: first, a bigger price increase than would occur if there were more public housing available for rent; and, secondly, people pushed into ownership who cannot sustain that. That is why we are now facing a repossessions problem.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o286"><a name="81203-0012.htm_para16"><a name="08120353000056">We must have a big-scale building programme of public housing for rent. The housing associations will play their part, and we are giving them money, which is very welcome. Housing associations are comparatively slow to build, however. They also have their own financial difficulties at present, and they have difficulty in raising credit in the current tight credit market. Building can best be boosted, therefore, by bringing councils back into building. It is an appalling fact that whereas in all the other big Labour building drives&#151;those of the 1960s and 1970s&#151;the rate of council house building kept up with that of private building, in the last year for which figures are available we built only 300 council houses. There are 2.8 million council houses in the country, and they require renovation and repairs, and their estates need upgrading and developing. We must allocate money to the councils to enable them to build again. It is no use our saying, &#147;We&#146;ll wait for the housing revenue account review that is now taking place.&#148; That will not be completed until May next year, and it cannot be implemented until May 2010, which is, in my view, a good month for an election. We should put money into the councils now, or stop taking as much out of the HRAs, and then the councils will build. The councils can put builders back to work if they are given the power and the money to build. That is the only way forward if we are to get the housing drive we need to stimulate the economy, and if we are to achieve the target, since demoted to an aspiration, of 3 million houses by 2020.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o287"><a name="81203-0012.htm_para17"><a name="08120353000057">There are 1.6 million people on council house waiting lists, and that figure is rising. They will have no chance of getting a house unless councils are allowed to build again. This is what we should do: large-scale building of council housing, because we have put too much emphasis on ownership and the ownership streams have not worked&#151;the numbers taking them up have been comparatively small. Affordable housing has turned out to be not very affordable, and shared purchase&#151;part-purchase from housing associations&#151;is not particularly popular either. Why should people take on the burden of doing repairs as well as paying the rent and the purchase price of part-purchase? We should provide the money for such building to take place.</p>

The Bank of England has now been more or less coerced into making the 1.5 per cent. reduction of last month, but we should consider the pressure that was required, and the representations it had to endure from so many organisations in industry and business and from all the economic pundits writing in the papers  <br>

crying out for interest rate reductions. It eventually did cut them. In my view, rates will have to be reduced further, because we need to get them down to the American level to stimulate the economy. That is the best means of making money available, stimulating the banks into lending, and bringing down costs, because interest rates are a cost on everybody. Our country is burdened with debt, and it needs lower interest rates if it is to come through and start spending.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o289"><a name="81203-0012.htm_para19"><a name="08120353000059">We should think about changing the rubric for the Bank of England. I argued for that at the time of the Treasury privileges inquiry. Our Bank has the rubric of only needing to maintain inflation at about 2 per cent. The Fed has a double-header ruling: to deal with inflation and to maximise employment. That is far more sensible, because it gives greater leeway to reducing interest rates and to matching them to the needs of the economy.</p>

We should make it profitable to do so by means of having a more competitive exchange rate. The value of the pound is coming down. It has now reached about the level it was after the Tory 1992 devaluation, when we left the exchange rate mechanism. In my view, it needs to come down still further, but let us look at what that fall in the value of the pound in 1992 did for growth in this country; it immediately produced growth without the feared inflation.

We should tilt the balance back towards manufacturing. We have to pay our way in the world. The oil contributions are going to fade away, and unless we produce in this country, we cannot pay our way in the world or provide our people with a good standard of living. The fall in the value of the pound is a major step in the direction of rebalancing the economy.</p>

I hope the Bill will go some way towards doing that. New duties must be imposed on the banks, and they will be, because the banks have failed us. We need to control their use of derivatives and off-balance sheet accounting, and to require them to register derivatives and special purpose vehicles. Registration implies a charge for the creation of the SPVs, which have been a form of gambling, but it could also ensure that the contracts arrived at are not legal unless the products in question are registered.

week on all these issues, the Conservative party has wrong-footed itself. Clear red water is opening up between the Government and the Opposition, and I and the Government are on the right side in using the power of the state to deal with the recession rather than using the Thatcherite processes that were employed in the recessions of the 1980s and 1990s.

The oil revenues, which the Labour Government of the 1970s had looked forward to as a means of rebuilding, expanding and improving this economy and providing a bonus for the people, as they should have done, were used, in effect, to smash British industry under the guise of modernisation and to break the power of the unions through high unemployment and stringent economic conditions. The revenues were used by the Government to fight their own people. That is what they were doing in the early &#145;80s, and it was a crime against the economy and against the British people. We cannot go back to those methods of dealing with a recession now; we have to move forward.

From his election to this House to the 1979 election there was industrial unrest, with people fighting the police in the streets; life was not the cosy little life that we are led to believe we have under Labour.</p>

Not everything that they have tried to do is wrong, not everything that they have done is wrong and not everything that they propose in this Queen&#146;s Speech is wrong, but the idea that on the red side it all goes well and on the blue side it is all wrong is a total misreading of things. Someone examining the condition of people&#146;s lives between 1979 and 1997, especially in the five years after 1992, when the years of continuous growth started, could look at the record and say that there was good to be said about both sides and things that each party could have done better.</p>

We have heard a lot of talk about banking, in terms of both the Bill that is to be introduced and the Government&#146;s involvement in the banking industry during the past few months. Let us pretend that I am in partnership in a good business where my partner and I work hard, produce a stream of revenue and have been paying back the bank loans for our premises. Let us suppose that we have done those premises up and, by doing so, we have provided building work and helped the economy to move around. Let us suppose that my partner wants to retire and that I made an application to a bank less than a year ago, telling it that buying out my partner would cost a certain sum and asking whether we could negotiate a loan. Let us suppose that the bank said yes in principle, but when I wanted the money six months later, because I plan in advance, the bank just flatly said no. I pursue it, but the bank sends another letter saying that things have changed.</p>

No one wants to go to the Financial Ombudsman Service for that; they want to have banking arrangements in this country which mean they do not just get sent a letter.</p>

Let us suppose that when the business tracks down the replacement, they say that their predecessor never even made a request&#151;presumably, because they had been told by people higher up that there was no point in their doing so&#151;and there was no record of our dealing with him. Let us suppose the business resubmits the request and is messed about for a few more weeks, and that when it subsequently makes contact, a director of the bank tells the business he is sorry for what has gone before but the case is going through the formal complaints procedure again and the request would be expedited. Let us suppose that that was four weeks ago, and when contact was made again very recently the bank said that it had no money as the funding from the Government was conditional upon something that was not happening until the new year.</p>

Until that sort of thing stops happening, and until banks start saying that they want to take on bankable propositions, the liquidity squeeze will continue, and it will do as much to put people out of work as any major restructuring of the economy.</p>

One has been the taking of a lot of infrastructure spending out of the hands of the Government. For example, the privatisation of British Telecom led to a massive investment in the telecoms infrastructure and to competitors coming in. The privatisation of ports led to this country&#146;s ports being resuscitated; that was the case not only for the non-public ports, but for the former public ports. The same thing happened to British Rail&#146;s hotels, to the British Airports Authority and to British Airways itself. Leaving people free to do their own investment can lead to greater infrastructure spending and the benefits that we want.

I do not think this has been considered by Members, because we have not tried sitting there for four hours during a debate with no knee room and no glass of water&#151;they have nothing at all. The House authorities should consider whether they can do something to help those in the Boxes.

Most of the time, to most of us, the Serjeant at Arms was independent, having been appointed by the Queen.

It may be different from how others might do it, but we should not focus our attention on the occupant of the Chair. Instead, we should have a system whereby everyone presumes&#151;unless there is evidence of a really serious crime or a court order that cannot be resisted&#151;that people in Parliament have a privilege on behalf of the public and that matters to the public. It does not matter to me a great deal if I am arrested, but it matters a great deal that everybody in my constituency has confidence that they can come to me&#151;be they a serving police officer, a civil servant, working in a bank or the health service, or unemployed&#151;and say, &#147;I think you and others should know about this.

the system has been changed four or five times by the present Government. It is still not right, and I think it would have been better if we had kept CHCs, as has happened in Scotland and Wales. There are no particular problems there, and there would be none here.</p>

Many doctors and some Members, including me, tried to tell Ministers that modernising medical careers, and the computerised application service, would have perverse results. Ministers said that everything would be all right, but we ended up with a system in which a clinical PhD in a relevant subject was worth less than 150 words written on leadership&#151;which was probably downloaded from a website in any case. It was a disaster and remedial action was required, but we cannot yet be sure whether that has worked reasonably well.</p>

In Worthing, our hospital was forced to have a system that meant that, up until two or three weeks ago, relatively simple things could not be done. A consultant could not, for example, transfer a patient to another consultant without wiping all the data and having to re-enter them. Lists of patients could not be printed for shift hand-overs three times a day by condition, by doctor or by bed&#151;three simple requirements. It took a week&#146;s programming, and it took a year to get it agreed. Once it was agreed, it was at least done fast.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o314"><a name="81203-0013.htm_para16"><a name="08120353000087">We need a more reactive system. When people provide warnings, they should be heeded. When they suggest ways to help, they should be taken up fast. Our system should work through the interaction of the experience of MPs, Ministers, civil servants, administrators, computer experts and the like. We could reduce avoidable waste and increase well-being by making systems work. Legislation can help, but it is not always the answer.</p>

They are down from 5,600 a year to under 3,000. Welcome progress has been made, including during the past 11 years. However, we could save three times that number a year through abdominal aortic aneurysm screening. If men&#151;it is a male problem&#151;were screened at 60, we would know who had a problem and who would be clear until they reached 75. That could save 7,000 unnecessary deaths a year. Ministers rightly reacted when they saw a demonstration from the Vascular Society, and the faster progress is made, the better. We should have such screening within a year for everyone who qualifies and is willing to take it up.</p>

That is the kind of disproportionality that gives data protection a bad name. I ask the health service, Ministers and all Departments, if they find examples of such disproportionate action, to send them to the Information Commissioner. We need more guidance on this, or a change in the law that would give people protection when they are trying to do something clearly in the public good but have made a technical slip. Such people should not be exposed to the worst kind of crisis.</p>

We established a basic right to roam through recent legislation but, because of a court decision perhaps a hundred years ago, we do not have a right to use rivers. We have a right to use inland waterways and canals, but I cannot take my canoe on some rivers without getting the agreement of every person with an interest in the land on either side of the bank from the beginning to the end of my journey. It is not an issue of how I gain access to the water, but of passing down the river. It is as if I could take my horse on to a bridleway only with the permission of the people who owned the land on either side of it. We would regard that as ludicrous, although my horse might disturb birds. We accept people using bridleways and footpaths, and we are likely to accept coastal access rights. We should therefore introduce the same rights to the use of rivers in England as exist in Scotland.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o318"><a name="81203-0013.htm_para20"><a name="08120353000091">I went to Scotland with the British Canoe Union and the Scottish Canoe Association and spoke about negotiating with landowners to obtain access to the water. Most canoeists are careful about spawning grounds in rivers and about anglers&#146; interests. We could incorporate access rights in the Bill, and if there are anglers who think that that would lead to serious problems they should talk to Scottish anglers about their experiences. We need to get rid of that prohibition, which is relatively recent, and give people the rights that they should have.</p>

 I agree with the comments by the hon. Member for Worthing, West (Peter Bottomley) about Mr. Speaker, although on the economy I am nearer to the position of my hon.

As we seek to build on the stabilisation of the financial sector, we need more investment. In making that investment, we need to think carefully about the technology and to relate it to larger projects. I am talking about carbon capture and storage.

That is much too late, because we have allowed others to get in front of us. The Chinese are already working on carbon capture and storage, as are the Americans and some Europeans. Our failure to move speedily&#151;I believe that, had we had the will, we could have had a small carbon capture and storage unit running in 2003&#151;means  <br>

that we have lost the opportunity for exports. Nevertheless, we cannot ignore the technology, because we require it for the future. We need to combine it with a grand scheme, and that is why I want the Under-Secretary to ask his colleague the Energy and Climate Change Minister to consider a project proposed by Yorkshire Forward.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o320"><a name="81203-0013.htm_para22"><a name="08120353000094">Yorkshire Forward has a plan to develop carbon capture and storage on a grand scale. The project would capture all the CO2 from the power stations in the region and from large industry and it would then be pumped out in a series of pipes to be stored in the oil wells in the North sea, which are the nearest oil wells to the Yorkshire coast. I understand that Yorkshire Forward has been refused Government aid, yet the project would create some 50,000 jobs. It would stimulate the steel industry and the engineering industry in Yorkshire, and would give great opportunities to new apprentices, offering the kind of apprenticeships that we want. In developing that technology and relating it to the project proposed by Yorkshire Forward, we could stimulate employment in the Yorkshire region. I hope that the Under-Secretary will urge the Energy and Climate Change Minister to consider the Yorkshire Forward project.</p>

Member for Wokingham (Mr. Redwood). I thought that it was a passionate speech, even though I did not agree with the economic analysis. Nevertheless, what he had to say about small and medium-sized industries was correct. On Friday, I visited such an enterprise in my constituency. It was a print works&#151;Print City, which employs some 50 workers. I was told by the management that there are difficulties with the banks, particularly in relation to overdrafts, but the company basically works for the banks. Most of its printing is for the banks; for example, it prints the forms that they use. The managers told me that the order book goes well into the future. Business is coming in from the banks, and the only thing not coming in is the credit from the banks to facilitate the company.</p>

If they do not, small and medium-sized enterprises will close, and we have already been given examples from some constituencies. The hon. Member for Worthing, West referred to the closure of some factories in his constituency. We cannot afford that. Our economy has moved towards small and medium-sized enterprises; 60 per cent. of gross domestic product comes from such enterprises. It is essential, therefore, that we get an understanding from the banks that the credit must flow towards industry.</p>

In my constituency, and in a number of constituencies represented by hon. Members from all parties, we see windrow composting, where green waste is set out on a concrete base in lines to rot in the open. It is turned from time to time, and as it is turned organic dusts&#151;or bioaerosols&#151;tend to be released. Those bioaerosols can be quite dangerous to communities that are near at hand.</p>

have seen and that I have had carried out suggests that the distance between the composting process and the nearest dwelling needs to be far greater. In fact, the most up-to-date study that has been done, which was produced at Giessen university in Germany, suggests that the composting process should be at least 500 m from the nearest dwellings.</p>

We need to move composting to a vessel-type system rather than leaving it in the open, where bioaerosols present a problem to nearby communities. We need DEFRA to ensure that in protecting the environment and the public, particularly in rural communities, it considers whether we should use a completely different process. I refer the Minister to a process that is considered safe: anaerobic digestion, which treats biodegradable organic waste in an enclosed vessel using bacteria in the absence of oxygen. The process breaks down the waste, generating usable products that include biogas, which can be burnt to produce energy, fibre for soil conditioning and a liquor that can be used in a liquid fertiliser. We would be recycling in a meaningful and productive way.</p>

There is a danger that unless we grasp the issue, in two or three years&#146; time we could engulf the country in a nauseating smell that comes from recycling. We must grasp the nettle now and we must ask the Environment Agency to work with the Health and Safety Executive to decide on a process&#151;I suggest the anaerobic digestion process&#151;that will ensure public safety.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o327"><a name="81203-0013.htm_para29"><a name="08120353000101">The Gracious Speech contains some very helpful proposals. One of them is the justice Bill, whose most important changes for my constituents will be the improvements to the coroner service and the process of death certification. The British Lung Foundation produced a report in 2007 entitled &#147;An Unnatural Death&#148;, which highlighted the problem that deaths as a result of mesothelioma cancer caused by asbestos are referred to as unnatural.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o328"><a name="81203-0013.htm_para30"><a name="08120353000102">When a person dies in that way, there has to be a post-mortem investigation and a coroner&#146;s inquiry. Often, that means that uniformed police in marked cars turn up at the home of an elderly lady because the gentleman who also lived there has passed away as a result of mesothelioma, and such visits can cause great but unnecessary concern. However, although coroners in England, Wales and Northern Ireland respond to mesothelioma cases and unnatural deaths in the way that I have described, the system in Scotland is different. There, people whose medical records show that they suffered from mesothelioma cancer are not considered to have died unnatural deaths. The fact that their deaths are considered to be natural means that the procedures that have to be followed are different from those in England, Wales and Northern Ireland.</p>

procedure would have to be followed: a policeman would visit the family and a short investigation would take place, after which there would be a post mortem and the coroner&#146;s inquiry.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o330"><a name="81203-0014.htm_para1"><a name="08120353000104">However, the union had a relationship with the coroner&#146;s officer, who would telephone me when his office was alerted to a death through pneumoconiosis. He would tell me where the death had occurred and when the visit would take place so that I could arrange for the family to be told that they were going to be visited. If the people being visited were elderly parents, I would arrange for younger family members to be present. That helped enormously.</p>

I know that the Secretary of State for Justice is conducting a public consultation exercise on pleural plaques, and that he will make an announcement when that is complete, but the Gracious Speech should have said that the Government were prepared to bring forward legislation to overturn the Law Lords&#146; decision.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o333"><a name="81203-0014.htm_para4"><a name="08120353000107">It has been suggested that when the public consultation exercise ends, we might get a proposal for a no-fault liability scheme. I believe that such a scheme would be detrimental because, before the Law Lords&#146; decision of 17 October 2007, a person who went to court and won compensation for the development of pleural plaques as a result of exposure to asbestos would also receive notification that the liability issue had been decided. In other words, the question of liability was decided when the court made a decision about compensation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o334"><a name="81203-0014.htm_para5"><a name="08120353000108">If a no-fault liability scheme is introduced and the Law Lords&#146; decision is not overturned, the question of liability would not be decided for the men and women who receive compensation. Consequently, they would be able to start to deal with the question of liability only if their condition worsened into mesothelioma cancer. That might be 20 or 25 years after the original compensation claim was upheld, with the result that the relevant documentation needed to substantiate liability might no longer be available.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o335"><a name="81203-0014.htm_para6"><a name="08120353000109">That is why I believe that we need legislation to overturn the Law Lords&#146; decision. I hope that the Minister who is listening to this debate will make the Department of Justice and the Secretary of State aware that we need legislation to overturn the Law Lords&#146; decision, rather than a no-fault compensation scheme.</p>

I was not arrested, nor interviewed under caution, but the visit happened because the police alleged that I had documents about the Iraq war. I did not allow them to search my premises or interview my staff, and I said that I had nothing to tell them. The officers went away again, and that was it.</p>

He said, &#147;I&#146;m afraid you can&#146;t cross this way.&#148; When I asked why, he said that a cordon sanitaire had been set up. I showed him my pass and said, &#147;I&#146;m sorry, I&#146;ve got six minutes to get to Millbank to do a piece on the &#147;World at One&#148;,&#148; to which he replied, &#147;I&#146;m sorry, you can&#146;t.&#148;</p>

I was so frustrated that, in the end, I made my feelings clear and the officer said, &#147;I&#146;m sorry, sir, but I&#146;m going to have to take your name.&#148; At that, I gave him my card. What I am trying to say is that, if I am arrested tomorrow morning, I hope that someone will pay my bail, because things have not been so good in Wales recently.</p>

bad position because 18 per cent. of its turnover is with Woolworths. If that is not bad enough, it has delivered &#163;585,000-worth of goods recently to Woolworths, and because those goods have been delivered, the proprietary interest has moved to Woolworths and the company is getting not a dime for all that work. It is an old family concern in my constituency. The managing directors&#151;two brothers&#151;are friends of mine. I am deeply concerned about them.</p>

I hope that, when we get to look at more detailed Bills, we will consider how it can be that that small company, having produced &#163;585,000-worth of goods and delivered them to F. W. Woolworth, is now told by the administrator, &#147;Sorry, lads, you not getting a dime for it.&#148; At the same time, the administrator is doing his best to sell off the goods. He will undoubtedly sell them between now and Christmas, if not well before then.</p>

As soon as those goods are delivered, any hope of being paid seems to go completely out of the window. The only saving grace is that other goods are on their way, and the administrator has said that a discounted sum will be paid for them. That is one good thing. I am mindful of the fact that we have only just had an insolvency Bill, but do we need to think again about looking at the insolvency legislation to provide for that kind of situation, so that the administrator could pay perhaps not the whole &#163;585,000 but a good chunk of that money to keep that company going and continuing to trade.</p>

I am no expert in that, but I hope that others who are more expert in the field who may read the report of the debate might be able to assist in due course.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o346"><a name="81203-0014.htm_para17"><a name="08120356000012">I hoped that the abolition of stamp duty would have been included in the Queen&#146;s Speech. That would have been one way to kick-start the economy. Stamp duty is a pernicious tax, and it has become more and more pernicious because it has not been uprated in the right manner, year on year, or Budget on Budget. Today, the Prime Minister mentioned the protection for those who face repossession, and I welcome that part of his speech very much indeed.</p>

I hope that, somewhere during the next round of legislative proposals, we can really get to grips with that. Can we not abolish VAT on electricity and gas, at least for the time being&#151;a simple point&#151;bearing in mind that an attempt has been made, via &#163;12.5 billion-worth of VAT, to spark the retail market? As the hon. Member for Great Grimsby (Mr. Mitchell) said, that is not going to work. It has not a chance of working when stores are discounting by 20 or 30 per cent. already. I would have thought that it would be far more effective if we were to alleviate the problem suffered by those people who are unable to afford to heat and light their premises.

I cannot see that anything would have remained if they had not done so; we would all have imploded if something had not been done. It might have been done earlier&#151;we can argue about that&#151;but it has been done; it has cost a lot of money; and we will have to pay for it at some future date. All that I understand, but I also understand that something had to be done. However, I believe that now is the time that we should look again at the way in which the banks work, bearing in mind that some of them are part-nationalised and others have been nationalised. We should tell them, &#147;Look. We expect you to start lending to one another,&#148; in order to deal with the examples that we heard from the hon. Member for Worthing, West (Peter Bottomley) about firms and companies with good trading histories being denied assistance. That is absolutely appalling. Whether that is to do with the gearing of their assets to lending, as the right hon.

It is usury, to use a Biblical word. It is absolutely foul. We all know of such examples. We talk about trying to get the economy back on its feet, but the ability to borrow is fundamental.

Only last week, during a debate, someone mentioned that an interest rate of 350 per cent. was being charged. I believe that charging such rates should be a criminal offence. It can be dealt with in the civil context. One can take the matter to a county court. If the interest rate is unconscionable, one has to prove it before a judge. Lawyers such as me can do that, but an individual who cannot afford a lawyer and will not get legal aid is expected to go along and argue that the rate that they agreed is unconscionable. That legal tool cannot be reasonably used. The only way forward is to criminalise such activities. I know that some people rely on that kind of credit, but heaven&#146;s above&#151;to make someone pay 350 per cent. interest is appalling.</p>

I came across it when I spoke with an ex-regional director of one of the four big banks who told me that the various bank managers had targets that they had to meet on the number of mortgages that they gave out each month, or whatever it might be. He told me that, if I went to them saying that I would like a mortgage of, whatever the amount might be, and my accounts were not okay, nine out of 10 of those managers would say to me, &#147;Go back, inflate your figures by 20 per cent., come back next week and I will give you the mortgage.&#148; In fine weather, that is lovely. The same goes for 120 per cent. mortgages on premises. But when it starts to rain, the roof leaks big time, to coin a phrase. That is such a common practice that that ex-regional director even referred to them as &#147;liar loans&#148;. The bank manager ticked the box, the customer was happy during fine weather and everyone seemed to be happy about that rosy boom, or whatever we might call it. That is part of what has been going on and someone at some point will have to account for it.</p>

If the vast majority of those on police authorities are elected councillors, there is democratic accountability and transparency already, so I do not necessarily think that directly elected police authorities will take us much further.</p>

Is it wise to tempt youngsters into obtaining a degree that might not be all that useful in the workplace and then expect them to carry a &#163;30,000 or &#163;20,000 burden?

However, we must have a properly structured apprenticeship scheme, so that people come out fully qualified and we do not have a six or nine-month affair that gives them one piece of paper that needs to be added to later, but which cannot happen because they cannot access further training.

Hundreds of thousands of our constituents may be put out of work in the next few months or lose their homes, so it seems rather odd suddenly to concentrate on lap-dancing clubs.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o362"><a name="81203-0014.htm_para33"><a name="08120356000030">The most revealing thing that I read about the Queen&#146;s Speech was the leak last weekend&#151;another leak&#151;from the Prime Minister that he was revising the entire speech to make it more recession friendly. That was revealing.  <br>

It is his mistake that he did not prepare us earlier. It is a bit late now suddenly to start making everything recession friendly.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o363"><a name="81203-0014.htm_para34"><a name="08120356000031">For example, 16 months after the collapse of Northern Rock, we still do not have a proper system of depositor protection for our constituents who have bank accounts. We do not have the reserve powers that the Governor of the Bank of England has said for months that he needs. They are in the Bill, which is winding its way slowly through Parliament, but 16 months have elapsed since the crisis and, time and again, the Government have been caught behind the curve, moving too slowly, making mistakes. Much more needs to be done, as several hon. Members, including my hon. Friend the Member for Worthing, West (Peter Bottomley), have pointed out. We are seeing a dramatic shrinkage in credit across our businesses&#151;small and large, including shops. A lot more needs to be done. I claim no prescience for my warning when I spoke on the banking package:</p>

The package is necessary, but it may not yet be sufficient.&#148;&#151;[<i> Official Report</i>, 14 October 2008; Vol. 480, c. 731.]</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o364"><a name="81203-0015.htm_para0"><a name="08120356000032">My right hon. Friend the Member for Witney (Mr. Cameron) has put forward a sensible proposal on credit insurance, and that and other measures are certainly needed now. We need to re-examine the rules on capital adequacy and consider whether the Financial Services Authority is applying the rules evenly across the banking sector. We also need to consider other ways of improving liquidity throughout the system. This may not be a popular suggestion, but I suspect that sooner or later the Government must address some of the toxicity within the system&#151;the non-performing loans that are undermining confidence between the banks and that are, in the end, making it more difficult for banks to trust each other and return to the levels of lending that we all want to see.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o365"><a name="81203-0015.htm_para1"><a name="08120356000033">I want to make three points about the Queen&#146;s Speech. My first point directly relates to the earlier comments by the hon. Member for Middlesbrough (Sir Stuart Bell) on how to address the banking decisions that will be taken. We are in a new era of state banking&#151;we own or part-own five of our 10 major banks&#151;and we need some rules. A body called UK Financial Investments has been set up, and the Queen&#146;s Speech should have included a legislative framework for it. If we leave such decisions entirely to ministerial discretion, credit will be rationed by lobbying. There is nothing wrong with lobbying, and hon. Members fight for their constituency interests, but it concerns me that those who shout loudest and who get closest to Lord Mandelson will get the finance that they need, whereas small businesses, such as shops and tiny family firms, that do not have the clout and regional power of, for example, the car industry or the aviation industry will lose out. It is always tempting in this House to focus on a factory or firm that employs 500 people, which is a huge number of people suddenly to be thrown on to the scrapheap, while perhaps neglecting 50 businesses that all employ 10 people, that do not get such attention and that may shut their doors in silence.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o366"><a name="81203-0015.htm_para2"><a name="08120356000034">UKFI will be with us for years. It is very powerful&#151;it owns or part-owns at least five of our 10 banks&#151;and it is already preparing to intervene in a range of matters, such as remuneration, the appointment of directors and  <br>

levels of lending. We need to be sure that UKFI is put on to a proper basis at arm&#146;s length from Ministers and that it is accountable to this House. The chorus of disapproval about bank bonuses and the frustration that we all share about the shrinkage of credit should not bind us to the dangers inherent in state-directed lending. I am looking for reassurance&#151;we want lending to flow again, but we also want it to be as commercial as possible&#151;and therefore think that the opportunity should have been taken in the Queen&#146;s Speech to put UKFI on to a properly accountable basis.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o367"><a name="81203-0015.htm_para3"><a name="08120356000035">Secondly, the Queen&#146;s Speech pays no attention to the growing disparity between pensions in the public sector and those available in the private sector. The collapse of stock market values is widening the gap between the quarter of the work force who work in the public sector, who will retire with an average pension of around 21 per cent. of final salary, compared with the remaining three quarters of the work force out there in the private sector, who will retire with an average pension of only 7 per cent. of final salary and who, through their taxes, must meet the cost of funding public sector pensions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o368"><a name="81203-0015.htm_para4"><a name="08120356000038">The problem is not only the lack of equity, but that the gap between the two kinds of scheme is growing, which is a moral issue that must be addressed. Of course, some measures need to be introduced on private pensions. I have no difficulty with introducing an element of compulsion as far as the second state pension is concerned, but we need to tackle the public sector schemes, too. If we accept, as my right hon. Friend the Leader of the Opposition accepts, that our own scheme, for example, should be closed to new entrants, we are recognising that something is wrong with our current system.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o369"><a name="81203-0015.htm_para5"><a name="08120356000039">We need to tackle the various inequalities. The issue concerns not only the disparity between final salary retirements, but other differences. Those in the public sector can largely still retire and take their pensions at 60, whereas others must soldier on for much longer. In a previous incarnation, the Health Secretary said this on 16 October 2005:</p>

Under our scheme, if hon. Members put in a decent number of years in this House, they retire not on 21 per cent. of their final salaries but on half their final salaries. It is even possible for Members to retire on two thirds of their final salaries on a contribution of either 6 or 10 per cent. That must be addressed sooner or later, and I suggest that that contribution will probably have to be raised. We certainly need more debate and more transparency about the cost in the public sector.

<p><a name="stpa_o374"><a name="81203-0015.htm_para10"><a name="08120356000044">Time and time again in dealing with constituency issues, I have been told that something cannot be done because of national criteria, national guidance, national rules and regulations or national standards that cut across decision making by elected councillors, and I shall provide three brief examples to illustrate that point. First, a recent parking review in Sevenoaks and Swanley resulted in our being told that every parking bay must have its own separate notice on its own separate post, irrespective of the characteristics of that road or avenue.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o375"><a name="81203-0015.htm_para11"><a name="08120356000045">Secondly, on licensing, the secretary of the Underriver village association has written to me complaining about not only the cost&#151;&#163;21 a time&#151;of obtaining a temporary events notice for the village hall, but the mechanics of going through the process, which do not allow for local common sense. She can fill in the application online, but she cannot apply online, which means that she has to print 24 separate pages of A4. One can avoid that process by obtaining an annual licence, but that involves 33 pages of forms and notes. Why is that matter not simply left to the common sense of local officials?</p>

However, it must also follow national priorities so far as homelessness is concerned and various other criteria laid down centrally by the Government. That discriminates against, for example, the need to give higher priority to those who are actually born and bred in the particular town or village rather than those who have come into it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o377"><a name="81203-0015.htm_para13"><a name="08120356000047">In all three cases, there is a strong argument for allowing councils more discretion&#151;indeed, for encouraging different practices to ensure more competition by emulation, which in some more federal systems is a huge source of renewal in public policy.

 The hon. Gentleman&#146;s point of view is perfectly reasonable, but I do not agree. We are nowhere near being, so to speak, an archipelago of 300&#151;or whatever the number is&#151;different islands. We have a highly centralised system that frustrates our elected councillors; the decisions that they make are simply contravened by national legislation, and they cannot exercise the power entrusted to them.

They give us no confidence that our homeowners and small businesses will get through this recession unscathed.

It was he who removed the power of the Bank of England to regulate the amount of debt in the economy and its responsibility for regulating banks. In place of that power, the Prime Minister set up a new, tripartite system under which no one was in charge. As a rather famous person was reported to have asked not so long ago, did no one notice what was happening? No member of this Government is responsible for anything, so clearly none of them did.</p>

The Prime Minister knew that nationalisation would lead to taxpayer loss, and that nationalised bank has made a loss of nearly &#163;600 million so far this year. My party was right to say that nationalisation would be a bad deal for the taxpayer, because that is how it has turned out.

When this was the mother of Parliaments and we had great powers, on the first day of the debate on the Gracious Speech the Chamber would be packed, particularly with Government supporters. Nowadays we have been dumbed down and no one bothers to listen to what we say. We have no power. This Government have taken power away from local government.

 The incoming Conservative Government may still be seven, eight or nine years away. The hon. Gentleman is a keen defender of the system of county government, and I think he has represented part of Essex for quite a long period. As a keen student of political affairs over the past 35 years or so, does he recall the local government reorganisation that led up to the major restructuring in 1973-74, which was of Conservative inspiration, and the major reorganisation in 1996-97, which took place in the later years of the Major Government? That reorganisation restricted the powers of and weakened local government, and was, in most cases, done in the face of resistance and hostility from the bodies being reorganised.

My constituents have to go through so-called local resolution, which we have for the health service and for the police, and when they have done that and eventually get to the IPCC, it is like a war of attrition. The police never apologise for anything, and it is one law for them and another for us. In the light of what has happened to a colleague, this is a tragedy, and we cannot leave it like that. For once, Members from all political parties must unite to restore the sovereignty of this place. I listened carefully to what Mr. Speaker said earlier, and I think that we were all heartened by that measured statement. He said that he will look very carefully at the wording of the motion that the House debates on Monday.</p>

They created that nightmare, but we are now told that they will strengthen Parliament&#146;s role. This morning, when I heard Lord Mandelson on the radio giving advice about a Member of Parliament&#146;s office being raided by the police, I did a double take. That noble Lord resigned from the Cabinet not once but twice, yet he now lectures us on dealing with a serious matter. He is the last person from whom I would take advice.

The terms of international maritime conventions have to be fulfilled and environmental management arrangements must be introduced. It has not been fully appreciated that Britain&#146;s seas are surprisingly crowded. The Bill needs to manage those pressures carefully, and it promises better opportunities for all stakeholders to help to shape the way in which our seas are managed. The question is whether their respective voices will be heard as the Bill works its way through Parliament.</p>

follow my hon. Friend the Member for Southend, West (Mr. Amess) and to listen to his views. I also commend the comments of my hon. Friend the Member for Sevenoaks (Mr. Fallon), who is experienced and knowledgeable about finance and economic matters. His speech gave us much food for thought. My right hon. Friend the Leader of the Opposition, who was in robust and dynamic form, made an excellent speech.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o404"><a name="81203-0016.htm_para10"><a name="08120356000086">In my area, there is fear and fury about the position in which our country and my constituents find themselves. They largely blame the Government for failing to deal with the real issues in the past decade. People in my constituency do not believe that all our economic and financial problems started in America. They are worried that, as our country goes into recession, we will be hit harder than other western European and other countries. Why are we in that position? It is possibly because in previous Queen&#146;s Speeches, legislative programmes and decisions for which the Government were responsible, the wrong policies were implemented at the wrong time.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o405"><a name="81203-0016.htm_para11"><a name="08120356000087">People in my constituency are hurting today. We will all judge the Queen&#146;s Speech and the recent pre-Budget statement against that background to ascertain whether either or both will address the serious financial and economic problems that our country faces. At first glance, it appears that they will not and that they represent yet another missed opportunity by the failing Labour Government. My constituents will judge the Queen&#146;s Speech on two counts: whether it helps resolve the mess into which the Government have got us on so many fronts and whether the measures are fair.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o406"><a name="81203-0016.htm_para12"><a name="08120356000088">To me, the Queen&#146;s Speech represents the dying rites of a tired and bankrupt Government. They claim that Britain should be fairer, but Labour policies have caused greater unfairness in our country in the past 11 years. People are fed up with the Government treating them unfairly on tax, benefits, housing, health, education and so on. It is laughable for the Government to have the audacity to take fairness as their theme for the legislative programme. In my constituency, the three top priorities are the economy, crime and health. I shall concentrate on them in my speech.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o407"><a name="81203-0016.htm_para13"><a name="08120356000089">Some measures in the Queen&#146;s Speech are welcome&#151;for example, the marine Bill, which my hon. Friend the Member for Southend, West mentioned. As my right hon. Friend the Leader of the Opposition said, some of the proposals were originally Conservative and the Government have now adopted them. We always welcome the Government Front-Bench sinner who repenteth.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o408"><a name="81203-0016.htm_para14"><a name="08120356000090">The content of the Queen&#146;s Speech is slim and it has no overwhelming vision for the future. It worries me that it is without vision or direction. The Government appear to have run out of ideas and do not know which way to turn. Our society is broken and the Labour Government have no idea how to mend it. One or two Government Members have said that new Labour is dead, and they are probably right.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o409"><a name="81203-0016.htm_para15"><a name="08120356000091">For all of us&#151;young or old, with families, in work or on benefits or pensions&#151;the economy is the overriding priority. Jobs, money, taxes, housing, mortgages and rents genuinely concern many people throughout our country. The Government talk the talk, but do not seem to understand or empathise with those truly worried people.</p>

 No, the hon. Gentleman has just come in and I want to continue.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o410"><a name="81203-0016.htm_para16"><a name="08120356000094">The Government have done too little, too late about the economy. Of course, we welcome the proposed Bill to introduce a framework to protect bank depositors. The measure will allow the Bank of England and other authorities to intervene when a bank gets into severe difficulties, and that is welcome. We are also pleased that several banks, including the Royal Bank of Scotland, will not move on repossessions for six months. That will provide some help for some people.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o411"><a name="81203-0016.htm_para17"><a name="08120356000095">However, people are genuinely fearful that they will be out of a job or unable to meet their mortgage payments, yet they have been highly taxed by the Government, who wasted money and did not put any aside for the future and the bad times that have now arrived. They taxed and spent and did not look to the future and save, so that, when the recession came, they could do something with existing resources.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o412"><a name="81203-0016.htm_para18"><a name="08120356000096">The economy is the big issue. There are businesses in my constituency that are struggling. Some are fearful of the new year. We need action to help to improve their cash flow, reduce their taxes and cuttheir national insurance contributions. Thousands of businesses are threatened with going bust and thousands of people will lose their jobs. The 2.5 per cent. VAT reduction was not a sensible move to kick-start our economy, as will be proved in time. The Government need to do more, but I do not think that they have any idea of what to do.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o413"><a name="81203-0016.htm_para19"><a name="08120356000097">The second issue that I wish to highlight is crime and antisocial behaviour. It is interesting that the Government&#146;s policing and crime Bill concentrates on the accountability of the police through directly elected representatives on police authorities. That is another Conservative proposal. As I have said in the House before, my constituents want to be able to walk the streets in their neighbourhoods and town centres without fear. Regrettably, there has recently been a considerable increase in burglary across my borough. Some people do not even feel safe in their own homes now. Constituents feel that the Government and the police do not devote enough time or manpower to the problem of burglary.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o414"><a name="81203-0016.htm_para20"><a name="08120356000098">There is also concern about the licensing situation and alcohol-induced crime. The Government liberalised the licensing laws. I very much regret the move to 24-hour drinking and believe that it has been a great mistake. The Government have looked at the issue again, but have still done nothing to address it&#151;indeed, they have not even proposed anything. Around the Broadway square in Bexleyheath, there are three large-volume licensed premises that can contain up to 2,500 people on a Friday or Saturday night. Police data show that the area has been a hotspot for violence against the person offences and for criminal damage. Between 2002 and 2006, alcohol-related disorder in the area rose by 43 per cent.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o415"><a name="81203-0016.htm_para21"><a name="08120356000099">Evidence showed that the incidence of alcohol-related crime, disorder and public nuisance in Bexleyheath town centre was increasing, despite the use of mechanisms outside the licensing regime, such as designating the area an alcohol control zone and a dispersal area. The Major of London has recognised the problems caused by alcohol in public places. He took immediate action on taking office to ban the consumption of alcohol on public transport in London, and he backed that up by putting more police on public transport.</p>

 Can the hon. Gentleman tell me why my Conservative council will not ban street drinking in local town centres, even though, as he says, the powers are available and there is enormous pressure from the local community to do so? The point is not about 24-hour drinking, because people purchase alcohol in supermarkets and then drink it in local town centres. Why will my council not do anything about that?</p>

 I cannot speak for the hon. Gentleman&#146;s local authority, but Bexley, which is under an excellent Conservative-controlled council, is taking those sorts of measures. We all need to unite to deal with alcohol-related crime, but the Government have not taken it as seriously as they could have done. However, I welcome those steps that the Government have taken and hope that the policing and crime Bill will move us in that direction.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o416"><a name="81203-0016.htm_para22"><a name="08120356000102">The third issue that I want to raise is health. The Queen&#146;s Speech says that an NHS constitution will be established outlining the rights and responsibilities of staff and patients. That is another Conservative policy and it is welcome indeed. We are looking forward to some positive moves by the Government. However, on the other side, my constituents are concerned about health care and the availability of services locally now.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o417"><a name="81203-0016.htm_para23"><a name="08120356000103">We in Bexley are still campaigning against changes to downgrade or cut services such as accident and emergency, and maternity services at Queen Mary&#146;s hospital in Sidcup. The campaign has brought together thousands of people from across the borough and beyond who are concerned about the future of the health services that they can access if the changes go ahead. One of the problems with the Government is that they make too many top-down decisions without looking at local need. The proposals in Bexley have now been referred to an independent review panel, which will look at them again. We eagerly await its recommendations and the Secretary of State&#146;s decision.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o418"><a name="81203-0016.htm_para24"><a name="08120356000104">The Government&#146;s proposed national health service reform Bill is one step behind, although the main proposals in the Bill are encouraging. We want patients to have a greater say about the care they receive, and we want PCTs to be more responsive to local communities. We also want to strengthen public involvement in commissioning. Those positive steps are very welcome, but my constituents are greatly concerned about polyclinics. There is fear that the hospital will be downgraded to become a large polyclinic if the downgrades go ahead.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o419"><a name="81203-0016.htm_para25"><a name="08120356000105">Despite the Government&#146;s claims that polyclinics will not be imposed on communities, half of all PCTs do not plan to consult local people about whether they want one in their community. People in my area are concerned that family doctor surgeries will close and that impersonal polyclinics will be introduced, with patients being lucky to see the same GP regularly and perhaps having to travel much further. The proposal for the new constitution is good, but many Conservatives are concerned about the delivery of services on the ground, and about the downgrades and cutbacks that have occurred, because if the Government have more financial difficulties, there will be real problems.</p>

whose expenditure on the NHS was going backwards. Does he welcome the fact that in the almost 12 years since 1997 the gross amount being spent has more than tripled to well over &#163;100 billion a year? Even allowing for NHS inflation, there has been a doubling in real terms as an effect of that. Had the Government whom he supported continued from 1997, the NHS would be nowhere near as strong as it is now.</p>

 There are a couple of points to make on that. Of course we welcome the resources that have gone into the NHS, but the issue is how efficiently that money has been used. I am afraid that much of it has been wasted, and has not been used efficiently for patient care. Too much has been spent on bureaucracy and administration, and not enough has been spent on front-line care. In the 1990s, productivity was going up considerably, and when we look at waiting times now, we see areas of concern for the future. We welcome the increase in resources, but we want them to go to front-line services, so that the medical side gets them, rather than the administrative side.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o420"><a name="81203-0016.htm_para26"><a name="08120356000108">Other measures were mentioned in the Gracious Speech. We are to look at education, yet again, as well as training and apprenticeships. We want excellence in education and of course we want the best opportunities to be available for every child, so that they can develop themselves and maximise their opportunities in life. However, some of the figures for exam results and for the number of people leaving school without basic qualifications, or five GCSE equivalents, make us worry that although money has gone in, the output has not been as good as we would have liked. On apprenticeships, we have a desperate need for more trained apprenticeships and for more skilled 16-plus students, but, regrettably, there has not been as much success in that area as we would have liked.</p>

Like my hon. Friend the Member for Southend, West, I hope that this will be the last Queen&#146;s Speech of this fading and discredited Government, who have no future and no vision.

It was used recently against two of my constituents: a local investigative journalist and a former detective sergeant in the police force. They were charged with that offence and brought to court fairly recently, but I am pleased to say that the charges were thrown out because the judge found errors of law and of fact in the case that was being brought against them.</p>

As I have just said, those privileges matter, as far as our constituents are concerned, but such charges&#151;which are common law charges, not criminal charges, as I think was suggested earlier&#151;are also being used against journalists, police officers and others in our constituencies. We need to bear that in mind as we discuss these issues.</p>

Many Members, especially on the Conservative Benches, have asked whether the huge sums&#151;&#163;487 billion has been mentioned&#151;that the Government have put into the banking system, either as direct capital injections or as guarantees, are giving us value for money. There was rather more discussion in the US Congress on these matters than I have heard from those on the Government Benches here. Congress debated whether the American public were getting value for money from what the American Government were doing, and whether main street or Wall street would be the beneficiary.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o426"><a name="81203-0016.htm_para32"><a name="08120357000006">I am glad that, at last, questions really are being put to the Government, and that they are under pressure to tell us whether the huge amount of public money that has gone into the banks is really getting through, whether the credit is starting to flow to small businesses, and, in particular, whether people are able get mortgages. We must not forget the people who have been priced out of the property market for many years by ever-rising prices. The tragedy now is that, at a time when property prices are starting to come down and there is a hope that homes might become affordable, many of our constituents&#151;especially the younger ones&#151;are going along to their bank or building society only to find that they are unable to get a mortgage. We need to look at that matter urgently. Lending needs to be done sensibly&#151;we do not want people to be offered six and a half times their income; such ratios have got people into difficulties in the past&#151;but I hope that Ministers will urgently address that issue, and that of looking after small businesses.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman is well known across the House as a decent, fair and reasonable individual. Would he accept the widely recognised view that the roots of the Equitable Life saga&#151;I guess that it is rather more than that&#151;go way back beyond 1997? Does he acknowledge that there is a shared responsibility between the previous Conservative Administration and this Government, and that it would be premature to allocate responsibility as though the problems started only in 1997, as they clearly did not?</p>

 I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman, for whom I have a great deal of respect. I was not really seeking to allocate blame as such, but the fact is that the hon. Gentleman&#146;s constituents and mine have been pretty badly let down through no fault of their own. That is a matter on which the parliamentary ombudsman&#151;an Officer of this House, Mr. Deputy Speaker&#151;has spoken very clearly to the Government. The hon. Gentleman&#146;s party is in power at the moment and that happened under his watch, so it falls to Government Ministers to come up with a fair and reasonable solution, notwithstanding any points about how those events have come to pass. Our economy does not need the vision set out by the Government, which will plunge the country into really frightening levels of debt for the future that our constituents will have to pay off with increased taxes for many years to come.</p>

Only this week I had e-mails from a number of constituents who were deeply concerned about future council tax increases. This is a tax that hits poorer people and pensioners, for example, particularly hard, so many of our constituents will find that any small cuts in VAT will be hugely outweighed by such increases.</p>

Friend the Leader of the Opposition has already outlined. We desperately need to get credit flowing to businesses with the sort of insurance scheme that guarantees commercial lending in the same way as does the scheme for inter-bank lending that the Government have already put in place. This is not state interference in decisions properly taken by banks, but amounts to standing back and providing an insurance-based guarantee that is already happening in parts of the financial system. That brings me back again to the issue of whether, when it comes to supporting our smaller businesses, we are getting value for this huge amount of taxpayers&#146; money.</p>

In these times of great cash-flow difficulties, it is incumbent on Treasury Ministers to ensure that their Department does its bit to ensure that money owed to businesses and individuals is actually paid back far more promptly.</p>

I wish I could introduce him to a small business man in Dunstable whom I had the pleasure of visiting earlier this year. He is a talented and ambitious young man who runs a small, but growing business. He faces problems largely because of the fall in the pound by about a quarter of its value over the past few months. That is causing tremendous difficulty for his business as the cost of what he imports has gone up. We need to remember that.</p>

I have experience in my constituency, as I am sure hon. Members on both sides of the House do, of people who have fallen through the net. When the Jobcentre Plus office closes at 5 o&#146;clock on a Friday night, those people have no money. They have not been able to get through to the social fund and they are not even going to be able to eat over the weekend. I call on the Secretary of State to undertake an urgent review of Jobcentre Plus, district by district across the country, as to what arrangements are in place to help people in those situations. We are not talking about huge numbers of our constituents but it matters desperately and it is a shame on our country that in Britain in 2008 we have people who fall through the welfare system. I know of instances where charities have had to take food round to people who would not have eaten over the weekend. I will say more about the people who did that later in my remarks.</p>

Sadly, in some parts of our country, engineering training is not all that it could be. Some local businesses have reported to me experiences that do not reflect well on the engineering training that certain of their employees have received. I also recently learned that in three major local education authorities&#151;Blackpool, Darlington and Islington&#151;not a single child took one of the three mainstream sciences at GCSE in 2007.

Friends have commented on the Government&#146;s local economic development and democracy Bill, which was mentioned in the Queen&#146;s Speech. I view that Bill with a little incredulity given the experience of my constituents in recent years, who have had major decisions on housing growth, and especially the number of local jobs and the transport and infrastructure links that must go alongside that, taken out of their hands and appropriated either to regional bodies or back to Government Departments.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o441"><a name="81203-0017.htm_para14"><a name="08120357000025">I strongly echo the remarks of my hon. Friends the Members for Sevenoaks (Mr. Fallon) and for Southend, West (Mr. Amess), who called for more powers and discretion to be given back to our local councillors. I am worried about the regional spatial strategy approach of the Government. If we are going to ask our constituents to go out to polling stations on wet Thursday afternoons to vote for local councillors, then those men and women who are duly elected by proper process, as we in this House are, need to have the power to take decisions locally, and also to be accountable for them so that if they muck up&#151;if they are not building the houses an area requires or meeting the needs of the community&#151;they can be voted out and a new lot of councillors can be allowed to try to do better. That is the basis of our democracy, and we undermine that locally at our peril.

This has some tangential relevance, because a child poverty Bill was announced in the Queen&#146;s Speech. I was pleased to hear that, not least because I am likely to be leading on it for the official Opposition. I very much look forward to that Bill. My right hon.

Earlier this year, Mr. Justice Coleridge, a man with 37 years&#146; experience of the family courts in this country, told the national conference of Resolution, the family lawyers&#146; association, that he believed that restoring family stability and doing something about family breakdown needed to be at the top of the Government&#146;s agenda. His remarks were prescient, and Members of this House should listen to a man who has 37 years&#146; experience of this country&#146;s family law system. The events involving baby P, which shocked all in this House, are a tragic reminder of what can go wrong when families break down in a truly shocking way.</p>

My right hon.

My right hon. Friend&#146;s questions were well put, because I am sometimes saddened by the lack of focus on what binds together our diverse country, which has people from many different backgrounds and races, and in many parts of which there are segregated communities. When the Queen arrived in Parliament today, we saw her ability to be a focus of unity for the whole country. My right hon. Friend has suggested a national citizen service as another thing that could help to bind us together. I say to Ministers that there needs to be more thinking about what draws us together, whatever our background and racial origin, and whatever part of the country we come from.

They have said in various media interviews that Britain is a secular society. That is part of the whole debate about Britishness and British values, and I disagree that ours is a secular society. It is a very diverse society, made up of people who are secular and people of very great faith, and many people at various points in between.

By contrast, the membership of the British Humanist Association is some 5,000 and that of the National Secular Society around 3,000. So when Ministers&#151;and the chief executive of a Government agency whom I heard the other day&#151;state confidently that we are a secular society, I would say that that does not tell the whole story.

I give credit to the Chapel street Jobcentre Plus in my area, which has been given a reprieve thanks to the announcement last week by the Secretary of State. It will remain open because of the likely rise in unemployment, although I hope that that rise is not too great. In Aberdeen, we have been relatively insulated against the effects felt in the rest of the country from the economic downturn, partly because of the continued high price of oil and the fact that we have a labour shortage in the area rather than a jobs shortage. That is not to say that people are not losing their jobs. Obviously, with the normal turnaround and with people moving in and out of work, it is important that Jobcentre Plus is sensitive to that.</p>

The local manager was willing to go beyond his obligations to ensure that the redundancy payments were in place very quickly so that the situation mentioned by the hon. Member for South-West Bedfordshire did not arise. I hope we will see that in offices of Jobcentre Plus across the country.

Women, even if they are in quite well-paid jobs, tend to work on shore and often earn less. There is also a lack of transparency, particularly in the oil sector, which means that it is not always possible for women who work in that sector to compare their wages with those of the men.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o454"><a name="81203-0018.htm_para1"><a name="08120357000039">Let me give an anecdotal example. I have a friend who works in the sector who told me that a woman who worked for an oil company discovered by accident that she was earning less than the men who she was line managing. That could have happened because of some reorganisation&#151;perhaps the men had previously worked offshore and were now working onshore&#151;and they were still on a reasonable salary, but it came as a shock to her to find out that she was earning less. That is why the proposal to have transparent pay audits and transparency in the salaries paid to men and women, ending the secrecy, will be a crucial element of the single equality Bill&#151;at least, I hope that it will be an element of the Bill.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o455"><a name="81203-0018.htm_para2"><a name="08120357000040">Such a measure is important because, more than 30 years on from the Equal Pay Act 1970, we still do not have equal pay. That illustrates that legislation is not the whole answer. We know that legislation on its own does not do everything. If it did, we would perhaps not need a single equality Bill. We know that we need to bring the different elements of equality legislation together in a single place and to make them easier for people to understand. At the moment, the legislation is a bit of a hotch-potch, with different definitions for what is reasonable or not that depend on whether we are looking at equality in terms of disability, race or gender. We need a coherent single language that will cross those three strands. We also need to ensure that the strands not covered by legislation at present&#151;age, sexuality and faith&#151;are covered, too, as part of a single equality Bill.</p>

He is right in what he says, although I am shocked by what he has told the House about Aberdeen airport. If he would like to pass the details on to me, I may be able to take the matter up with the companies at the airport. The problems with insurance are simply wrong and should not happen.</p>

Sometimes, when we discuss equality, we tend to think that there are only negatives and that there have been no improvements, but I have been using a wheelchair to get around since 1984 and I know that things have changed dramatically.</p>

when an existing Committee is ready to take on a job of that nature. I am somewhat concerned about the debate on Monday. It may sound like a good idea but, given that the Government will table the motion and that it appears this afternoon that we have been invited to suggest amendments, I worry that this will become a party political issue, rather than both sides coming together to try to find out exactly what went wrong.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o464"><a name="81203-0018.htm_para11"><a name="08120358000006">I now move on to the Queen&#146;s Speech. As with all such speeches, there were good and bad bits. What any objective observer would note is that a fair chunk of the good bits are Conservative ideas. Direct elections for police commissioners, or police accountability at least, the welfare reform package, the NHS constitution, the independent exam regulator or the points system for immigration&#151;these are all ideas that have first found expression on the Conservative Benches. I very much welcome those ideas, because they are ours, but it is noticeable that, if the Queen&#146;s Speech and the proposed legislation for the coming year were stripped of them, there would not be much by way of good ideas.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o465"><a name="81203-0018.htm_para12"><a name="08120358000007">We are told that the Queen&#146;s Speech has been streamlined to allow Ministers to focus on the economy&#151;and rightly so&#151;but I suggest that some of the Government&#146;s claims about the economy are falling apart. We have heard much in recent years about how prudent the Prime Minister has been, yet we are entering this recession with the largest budget deficit in the developed world. We have heard much about stability, yet unemployment is rising more quickly here than in any other major economy. We have heard talk about how boom and bust has ended, yet we are forecast focus to have the worst recession in the developed world.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o466"><a name="81203-0018.htm_para13"><a name="08120358000008">My real concern is the extent of the debt that we are taking on. It is an interesting fact that the Government have now taken on more debt than all previous Governments combined. That must be worrying. It can only be unsustainable. When questioned about the tax-raising measures that have been introduced, the Government cannot deny that they have provided only a small element compared with the black hole that is being created in our public finances. The Government seem unwilling to come clean and explain where the money will come from to plug that black hole. It can only mean higher taxes further on down the road. That must be a worry for future generations, because if an economy is burdened with higher taxes, it will take longer to recover. That cannot be for the good of the country. I urge the Government to come clean about the extent of the tax increases that must follow from the amount of debt that we have taken on.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o467"><a name="81203-0018.htm_para14"><a name="08120358000009">I notice that there is a Banking Bill carry-over in the Queen&#146;s Speech. In many respects, that is welcome. The system of regulation that the Prime Minister, the then Chancellor, designed has failed. In 1997, he removed the power of the Bank of England to regulate the amount of debt in the economy and its responsibility for regulating the banks. A new tripartite system was established, but it was not clear from the start who was in charge. That became very evident in the latest crisis. There was the first run on a bank for probably 100 years.</p>

failed in its primary purpose of maintaining a stable banking system. Therefore, that measure will be welcomed, but it corrects an error that was made previously.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o469"><a name="81203-0018.htm_para16"><a name="08120358000011">Members in all parts of the House have expressed concern that credit is still not flowing freely enough, particularly to our small and medium-sized enterprises and businesses. Too often in my constituency, small businesses are coming up against banks, in which we all now have a share, that are curtailing overdraft facilities and raising interest rates for the overdraft facility that remains. That is putting a real squeeze on smaller businesses in particular. In this place, we tend to underestimate the extent to which small businesses rely on overdraft facilities, particularly at this time of year. I urge the Government to take the opportunity provided by the Banking Bill to try to examine that problem. If they cannot do it here, they should do it elsewhere, but again I wish that I had heard about that in the Queen's Speech; there was nothing there about it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o470"><a name="81203-0018.htm_para17"><a name="08120358000012">On the fiscal stimulus that the Prime Minister has talked much about, I would question the effectiveness of a 2.5 per cent. cut in VAT when prices in the high street are already falling by 20 or 30 per cent. That cut may not sound much&#151;indeed it is not much when we consider small-ticket items&#151;but it is costing the Treasury about &#163;12 billion, which is an awful lot of money. It is the lion's share of the stimulus package.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o471"><a name="81203-0018.htm_para18"><a name="08120358000013">With that same amount of money, the basic rate of income tax could, I believe, have fallen by up to 4p in the pound. That would have really helped people in their pockets, particularly at the low end of the pay scale. Perhaps that would have been a better way to approach the matter. Then again, perhaps the Government were too concerned, worried and indeed scared about how attractive people might have found such a drop in income tax, even though it might have been only temporary. However, that would have helped hard-pressed families much more than a simple, very small cut in VAT, which will benefit only the well-off and the very wealthy in society who buy big-ticket items, and prices are already falling by up to 30 per cent. in the shops.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o472"><a name="81203-0018.htm_para19"><a name="08120358000014">I will mention the following point because I notice that the veterans Minister, the Under-Secretary of State for Defence, the hon. Member for North Durham (Mr. Jones), is on the Front Bench. I am sure that he will have noted the developments in France with regard to the recognition of nuclear test veterans there. I am sure that he is following that with interest. I urge him to look at that decision in France carefully to help us to build on the excellent progress that we are making, which he has been very much part of, in furthering the cause of our own test veterans, who are now almost alone in not having their Government recognise their case. There can be little differentiation now between the French nuclear test veterans and our own. We have seen the Canadian Government, the American Government and the New Zealand Government all make positive moves. I welcome the new Minister to his post. Since he has arrived, we have made progress on the issue and I thank him for that again, but I also ask him to reflect on the French decision and hope that we can drive the agenda forward now.</p>

 I am pleased to have secured this Adjournment debate Session on health services in Telford on the first day of the Shift. If hon. Members listen to the tone of my voice, they will know that I could do with some health services, but I have loitered here for seven hours to make this speech, not knowing when the previous debate would conclude, because this issue is incredibly important to local people. Health services in my constituency are important, and the issue is exercising the minds of local health professionals and those who represent our community locally.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o476"><a name="81203-0018.htm_para23"><a name="08120358000019">I want to cover two points this evening. First, I want briefly to discuss improving primary care services. Secondly, I want to discuss in some detail the impact on my constituents of the new health and health care strategy for Shropshire, Telford and Wrekin, which is being developed by the clinical leaders forum in the area and which is being discussed by the NHS trusts and local stakeholders at the moment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o477"><a name="81203-0018.htm_para24"><a name="08120358000020">We have an excellent range of primary health care providers in our town. Telford and Wrekin PCT will spend some &#163;230 million of public money in 2008-09 on the NHS serving local people. Primary care services are important, and PCTs act as local leaders in determining what services communities need and how those services are commissioned. Our PCT has a good reputation locally for working in partnership with other agencies and delivering more through partnership than it could achieve alone.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o478"><a name="81203-0018.htm_para25"><a name="08120358000021">For many people, the GP is their first point of contact with the NHS, and we have seen significant investment in GP services in Telford in recent years. New practices have been built in Oakengates, Dawley and Lawley, and more than &#163;3 million is being invested in 2008 to improve the 20 existing GP practices&#151;there has been significant investment at Stirchley and Sutton Hill, for example. That money is rightly being targeted at some of the most deprived communities in my constituency.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o479"><a name="81203-0018.htm_para26"><a name="08120358000022">In passing, I pay tribute to those who work in the Shropdoc out-of-hours service. I am pleased that the PCT is looking to provide more services for local people with a new GP practice and health centre in Telford town centre, extended hours GP drop-in and pre-booked appointments, sexual clinics and screening, an onsite pharmacy, counselling services and a minor injuries and minor surgery unit. That is a positive step forward in primary care, but it needs to be developed in partnership with other GP practices. Facilities such as the Dawley practice should be expanded to meet local needs alongside that town centre development.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o480"><a name="81203-0018.htm_para27"><a name="08120358000023">We have seen the provision of more NHS dental services in the town in recent years. I particularly mention the facility at Stafford Park and the service at the Park Lane centre in Woodside, which is part of a major estate regeneration process. That shows us putting together the jigsaw pieces of estate-based regeneration.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o481"><a name="81203-0018.htm_para28"><a name="08120358000024">Secondly, I want to discuss the development of the overarching health and health care strategy for Shropshire, Telford and Wrekin, which provides a framework for  <br>

improving health and providing health services over the next five years until 2012-13 and sets out the vision for 2020 and beyond. That approach is part of the work by Lord Darzi to shape the vision of the NHS. The latest proposals have been developed by the clinical leaders forum, which was commissioned to look at the development of services in the county. Its strategic focus is on developing world-class services for maternity, new-born care and children&#146;s health, planned care, mental health, getting healthy and staying healthy, long-term conditions, acute care and end-of-life care. That body of health professionals is bound by two guiding principles in the development of the strategy&#151;in fact, those principles have been established as part of the strategic process. The first is that any proposals that the body comes forward with for our area must make sense clinically, and the second is that they must make sense to the communities served. I shall return to those two points in a few moments.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o482"><a name="81203-0018.htm_para29"><a name="08120358000025">The clinical leaders forum has now produced a next-stage report that is being discussed by the primary care trusts and the local health scrutiny boards. The strategy does not focus only on hospital services, of course; a key focus in the report is the need to prevent disease and promote healthy lifestyles, and I welcome that. The report also looks at how we could provide services at home, or as close to home as possible. Again, that is welcome; the creation of hospital-at-home services makes sense, and I am pleased to note that the ambulance service, for example, is working hard right now to treat patients at first point of contact, therefore avoiding the need to admit so many people to A and E. However, we need to recognise that the A and E service in our county is often stretched to capacity and that many people still have to wait a long time to be seen.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o483"><a name="81203-0018.htm_para30"><a name="08120358000026">I also welcome the proposal in the strategy that minor surgery, out-patient appointments and many types of scans will take place increasingly in community settings rather than in acute hospitals. Having said all that, I recognise that the most controversial element of the report relates to a series of options for acute hospital services. In simple terms, the health bosses want to do two things. First, they want to keep children&#146;s assessment units at both the Princess Royal hospital in Telford and Wrekin and the Royal Shrewsbury hospital, but they want to put the in-patient children&#146;s service on one site. That, they say, is the safest option. They also want to develop a service to care for children in their own homes. As I have said, that would reduce admissions generally.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o484"><a name="81203-0018.htm_para31"><a name="08120358000027">Secondly, the bosses want to retain the A and E service on both sites, but with one dealing with the most seriously injured and ill&#151;those involved in multiple-trauma road traffic accidents, for example. Level 1 A and E would be provided at regional centres, as it is now, and the two acute hospitals would have level 2 and level 3 A and E services respectively. At present, no decision has been made about which site should have which services. The clinical leaders forum has produced a long list of four clinical options for sustainable acute services. More work is to be done on those prior to public consultation on the recommended options in spring next year. The Minister will say that she cannot comment on the configuration until further work has been done, and in many senses I accept that. However, she will understand that I am using this debate to lay down a marker on my thoughts. I hope that the clinical leaders forum will think hard about what I have to say.</p>

<notus-date day="3" month="12" year="2008" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><b>3 Dec 2008 : Column 114</b><br>

<p><a name="stpa_o485"><a name="81203-0019.htm_para0"><a name="08120358000028">The four options are for the medium term, and in my view we will ultimately have to examine the shape of services beyond 2020. I take the view that in the longer term we will have to look at the idea of developing a new emergency hospital situated between Telford and Shrewsbury and serving both. The Princess Royal and Royal Shrewsbury hospitals would be retained to deliver other services. I know that my proposal is controversial, but it would put to bed for ever the argument that rages in the county between the two towns.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o486"><a name="81203-0019.htm_para1"><a name="08120358000029">I have already said that it is important that we move to develop more community-based services, but we all know that there will be occasions when people need to use major hospital services. The history of hospital services in Shropshire includes a long struggle to get the status of Telford new town recognised as it grew from the 1960s onwards. The Royal Shrewsbury hospital continues to be the larger of the two acute hospitals in the county, despite the increase in Telford&#146;s population and its projected growth for the next couple of decades. The Princess Royal hospital was built in Telford after a long campaign and, ever since then, it seems that there has been a constant process of reviewing service delivery structures. To put it bluntly, I am pretty sick and tired of continual reviews of our local hospital services&#151;a view that I am sure Telford residents endorse and that local health service workers share. We seem to have the same discourse and discussions year after year, and it must be costing a fortune.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o487"><a name="81203-0019.htm_para2"><a name="08120358000030">I know from family experience how important Princess Royal hospital is to Telford people and to those from the east of the county. When I was a teenager, my grandfather spent nearly a year in hospital. He was a Shifnal man who spent most of his life as a chain maker. Princess Royal hospital had not been built in those days, and my mother travelled from Telford to Shifnal to pick up my grandmother every night so that they could go together to see my grandfather at the old Copthorne site at Shrewsbury. I used to go with them occasionally to visit him. If one factors in the return leg, that was a round trip of about 45 miles, night after night for a year. If there had been a hospital in Telford then, we would have benefited enormously as a family. We have come a long way since those days. The health service review does not threaten to take away the excellent hospital, Princess Royal, which serves my constituents, but I am going to fight to get the best deal that I can for local people, because I know how important that hospital is.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o488"><a name="81203-0019.htm_para3"><a name="08120358000031">For me, the argument is fairly simple. It relates to the second guiding principle that I laid out earlier: proposals for the local health service must make sense to the communities they serve. Telford is the largest population centre in the county, with approximately 133,000 residents; Shrewsbury has approximately 67,000 residents. Moreover, Telford is a growing town, and it is about time that the consultants and health managers recognised that fact. By 2026, at least 26,500 new homes will have been built in the borough of Telford and Wrekin, and that figure could expand to over 30,000 in the current review. Telford could easily grow to become a town of 200,000 people in the next two decades, and we need hospital services to reflect that fact.</p>

children aged nought to 15 live in deprivation, which is higher than the national average; in Shropshire, the figure is 13.2 per cent. Life expectancy is lower in Telford and Wrekin, and our public health indicators are worse than in the rest of the wider Shropshire area. Car ownership levels are also lower in Telford and Wrekin.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o490"><a name="81203-0019.htm_para5"><a name="08120358000033">That brings me to the effective catchment population figures for the two main acute hospitals. That information is on page 39 of the clinical leaders forum report, and it has been produced using drive-time data adjusted to reflect market share. Even if we include patients from Montgomeryshire, there are 224,838 people in the Princess Royal hospital catchment and 191,267 in the Royal Shrewsbury hospital catchment. Those of us from Telford want the county&#146;s main accident and emergency department to be located at Princess Royal, along with in-patient children&#146;s services.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o491"><a name="81203-0019.htm_para6"><a name="08120358000034">On all the social indicators, anyone can see the logic of structuring services around the Telford site. To put it bluntly, services should not be based on how the county looked 50 years ago or even 10 years ago&#151;they should be based on how it looks now and how it is going to look. If that means moving services to focus on Telford, then so be it. This process is basically about what services are available for those of us who live in Telford and those of us in the east of the county. The issue is too important for us to get bogged down in political squabbling, because we all need to work together to get the best deal for Princess Royal hospital.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o492"><a name="81203-0019.htm_para7"><a name="08120358000035">Princess Royal hospital is not doomed, and we need to campaign in a positive manner&#151;the people of Telford deserve nothing less. That is why, in the new year, I will launch an &#147;I&#146;m backing Telford hospital&#148; petition campaign to show local health chiefs the importance of our local services. That will give my constituents the chance to show their support for the Princess Royal hospital and the staff who work there. As I said, Telford people deserve nothing less.</p>

 I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Telford (David Wright) on securing the debate and on championing an important issue for Telford and the surrounding area. Yet again this evening, he has eloquently and clearly put his case on behalf of his constituents. I am especially pleased to join him in acknowledging the progress that has been made in the past decade to raise the national health service from the ashes of under-investment and neglect. I join him in paying tribute to the hard work and dedication of health service staff throughout Shropshire, which has experienced some fantastic advances in local health care.</p>

The trust is on course to deliver by the end of December the 18-week target for GP referrals for treatment. This year, the Healthcare Commission ranked the maternity services at Shrewsbury and Telford as best performing. It is right to applaud those achievements, but, as my hon. Friend acknowledges, we must also look forward, especially to the way in which we will build on the progress in the face of new challenges.</p>

 Thank you, Mr. Deputy Speaker. As my hon. Friend knows, an ageing population, heightened public expectations, new technologies and treatment and the changing profile of the disease burden place new demands on health services throughout the country. As he said, health services in Telford face particular pressures as the local population changes and expands.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o494"><a name="81203-0019.htm_para9"><a name="08120358000043">We expect the numbers living in Telford and Wrekin to rise by 17 per cent. by 2022, requiring more than 26,000 homes to be built and a decisive shift in local services to accommodate an ageing population. That is the debate currently happening in Telford. The county-wide strategy, developing health and health care, shows how the local NHS must evolve over the next five years to meet the new challenges.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o495"><a name="81203-0019.htm_para10"><a name="08120358000044">As my hon. Friend acknowledged, the recommendations take in the views of health care professionals, local authorities, community and voluntary organisations and patients, reflecting the broadest range of expertise and opinion. As he said, it contains plans to provide an increasing range of services in community settings, ensuring that people receive treatment, whenever possible and appropriate, close to their homes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o496"><a name="81203-0019.htm_para11"><a name="08120358000045">The key themes in the strategy document, as in others being developed throughout the country, are sustainability, choice and quality. We are talking about taking a hard look at local services and exploring how we can future-proof them against changing local needs without compromising patient care, as my hon. Friend articulated so clearly.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o497"><a name="81203-0019.htm_para12"><a name="08120358000046">My hon. Friend raised concerns about the future of two hospitals serving Telford and Shrewsbury. The report says that the vast majority of health care services at the Royal Shrewsbury hospital and Princess Royal hospital can and should remain there in the medium term. However, the report also expresses concerns that the current model is unsustainable. There is a particular issue concerning the availability of specialist clinicians and, as the population changes, the risk that patient safety could be jeopardised.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o498"><a name="81203-0019.htm_para13"><a name="08120358000047">As my hon. Friend said, the report sets out four options, each of which examines how accident and emergency, maternity, neonatal, in-patient paediatrics and urology services could be provided to reduce patient risk and ensure the highest quality of service for local people. The focus of any future consultation will be about ensuring that care is provided as close to home as possible, with 24/7 access and appropriate support.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o499"><a name="81203-0019.htm_para14"><a name="08120358000048">Similarly, as my hon. Friend will know, we would expect any settlement for maternity and neonatal services to be in line with the Department&#146;s framework document &#147;Maternity Matters&#148;, which makes it clear that maternity and neonatal care must be well co-ordinated and focused once again on patient safety and the highest standards of care. The point to stress is that the proposals are about specialisation and providing a better quality of service to patients.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o500"><a name="81203-0019.htm_para15"><a name="08120358000049">I know that my hon. Friend is particularly concerned about the A and E provision available to his constituents. I agree with him that it is paramount that there should be adequate coverage across Telford, Shrewsbury and Shropshire. I know that local health services are working closely with stakeholders, clinicians and the public to ensure that that is the case. I am sure that my hon. Friend would agree that although coverage is an important factor in A and E services, patient quality and safety are even more paramount. He and I want patients to get the right treatment as quickly as possible. Patient safety is always paramount.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o501"><a name="81203-0019.htm_para16"><a name="08120358000050">I understand that such issues are sensitive. It is therefore important to stress that the strategy document to which we are referring is by no means the final verdict. Rather, it looks at options. I want to be clear with my hon. Friend and his constituents: no decision has been made about the future direction of health services in Telford, and there are no current plans to close local A and E services. If the NHS organisations in Shropshire and  <br>

the strategic health authority consider it appropriate to pursue one or more of the four options, a full impact assessment would be drawn up with costings, followed by further public and stakeholder engagement and an NHS consultation next spring.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o502"><a name="81203-0019.htm_para17"><a name="08120358000051">I know that my hon. Friend appreciates that we are a long way from any action being taken and that, in securing this debate, he recognises that there will be other opportunities for him and his constituents to influence the debate before any decisions are taken. Until we have a proposal in place for consideration, I hope that he will accept that none of us should jump to hasty conclusions. I entirely understand his frustration in wanting to see the issues finally settled for the benefit of his constituents, following what he has described as a long and frustrating series of considerations. We have made it clear, in the next-stage review, that patient quality must be the driving force in a modern NHS. In Telford, as in the rest of the country, I expect any changes to support that guiding principle. They must be clinically led and focused squarely on the best outcomes for patients. I do not expect any changes to be made that will compromise the safety of my hon. Friend&#146;s constituents or the quality of care that they receive.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o503"><a name="81203-0019.htm_para18"><a name="08120358000052">My hon. Friend has put his case clearly today, and I know that he will put it again and again. He is quite right to do that on behalf of his constituents. Telford&#146;s health services will need to adapt to meet the region&#146;s changing needs, but any changes that are considered should, as I have said, improve the quality of treatment, not reduce it, and should have the full support of those whom they seek to serve. I know that he, in advancing his case, will use every opportunity to make sure that his constituents&#146; voices are heard.</p>
