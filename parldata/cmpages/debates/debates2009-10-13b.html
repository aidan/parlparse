 We have done much to narrow the gap in relation to the inequality of cancer services. The introduction of the two-week maximum wait from GP referral to seeing a specialist and the recent announcement of a diagnostic result one week after being referred will also be extremely welcome. There are differences around the country, and it is difficult to give a definitive answer, but we have ensured that doctors are educated and supported to provide the right kind of understanding.

 I regret that I did not really get an answer to my question. Since the Secretary of State wants to talk about cancer mortality, will he explain why, in the decade after Labour came to office, the gap in cancer mortality between this country and the European average widened? On the point other that he made, surely he must know that the issue in the NHS now is not primarily about the capital resources for additional diagnostics, but the staffing to support them. Diagnostic equipment could be better used if there were more radiographers and sonographers.</p>

 I can answer the hon. Gentleman on both points. As I said, cancer mortality fell over the decade in question. Cancer survival rates have been steadily improving. We accept that there is more to be done to close the gap between us and comparable countries, but that is precisely why I have taken steps on early diagnosis, which is the new frontier in taking on the battle against cancer.</p>

We have been investing not just in equipment, but in people. He mentioned radiographers. There were some 12,500 radiographers in 2000. In 2006 there were 14,500, and the plan is to have 17,500 by 2012. That is a genuine commitment to invest in the work force and the equipment that gives people in this country the best possible chance of surviving cancer. He cannot look me in the eye and say that his party in government did the same thing.</p>

 Does my right hon. Friend agree that he cannot say often enough that the real reason why we have been able to reduce the problems with cancer and many other illnesses, particularly heart disease, is the money that we invested in 2001 and the 1 per cent. increase in national insurance contributions, every penny of which went straight to the NHS? That had never been done before in any Budget. Conservative Members walked into the No Lobby and voted against that money. As someone who has had cancer and open-heart surgery, I cannot thank the NHS enough. I thank my colleagues for walking through the Aye Lobby and providing the extra money to find the people to do the job.</p>

At present in England different people get different assessments depending on where they live.

That is the kind of discussion about how the system would operate that we are having with counterparts in the devolved Administrations, including Scotland.

 First, may I congratulate the hon. Lady on her gallant fundraising efforts, through which she has achieved so much for the Anaphylaxis Campaign? The direct answer to her question is that it is, again, about commissioning. That is why the pilot and the evaluation of it are so important to us. We are meeting the national allergy strategy group on Thursday and we hope to discuss some of those issues, and in particular that raised by the hon. Lady. Until we have seen the evaluation of the pilot in north-west Manchester, it is more difficult to highlight best practice, which is what those involved are so keen to do.</p>

The Government have played their part in responding to the needs that we recognise among carers. The question is how that money is spent by local PCTs. The hon.

He knows, too, that the Department is producing a document to assist primary trusts and local authority commissioners to understand how the needs of carers may be effectively identified, and that we will seek to publicise that guidance as widely as possible.

 My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State has announced that the Care Quality Commission will be reporting in due course. He will not be surprised to hear that in a meeting with Charnwood carers group, I found that the quality of care in the community and in care homes is high on people&#146;s agenda. In fact, many were in tears at their own experiences, despite the tick-box reality of the commission&#146;s work. Will Ministers ensure that there is genuine personal care in such places?

 My hon. Friend is right to highlight issues of concern about the quality of care, whether it is care of people in their own home or in residential care homes. The Care Quality Commission plays an essential role in monitoring and inspecting care homes to ensure that standards are sufficient. We need to go further and ensure that all care, whether in a care home or in a person&#146;s own home, is personal and tailored to meet individual needs.

 Of course, the case of the 24-year-old woman, who did not live directly in my constituency but in Tyldesley, which is nearby and, as the hon. Gentleman knows, not so far from his constituency, was incredibly sad. I am led to understand that, in that case, the clinicians did not think it possible for the patient to travel. However, a decision was taken recently to expand ECMO provision in Leicester. The clinical advisory group advised that it was right to concentrate provision in that area, given the huge amount of training and intensive support that the unit needs.

 On a point of order, Mr. Speaker. I want to raise a chain of events that may be of some concern to the House. Today <i> The Guardian</i> reported that it had been prevented from reporting a written question tabled by a Member of Parliament. This morning I telephoned <i> The Guardian</i> to ask whether that MP was myself. The question was printed on the Order Paper yesterday and relates to the activities of Trafigura, an international oil trader at the centre of a controversy concerning toxic waste dumping on the Ivory Coast. The question also relates to the role of its solicitors, Carter-Ruck. I understand that yesterday Carter-Ruck, quite astonishingly, warned <i> The Guardian</i> of legal action if the newspaper reported my question. In view of the seriousness of this, Mr. Speaker, will you accept representations from me over this matter and consider whether Carter-Ruck&#146;s behaviour constitutes potential contempt of Parliament?</p>

Member for Newcastle-under-Lyme (Paul Farrelly) that I think that he has just made representations. I am grateful to him for his point of order and for courteously giving me advance notice of it. A written question has indeed been tabled, as he said, by the hon. Gentleman himself. It is not sub judice under the House&#146;s rules. It has already been published on the notices of questions, and it is also available on the Order Paper and, indeed, on the parliamentary website. There is no question of our own proceedings being in any way inhibited. If the hon. Gentleman wants to pursue this as a matter of privilege, there is of course, as he will doubtless know, an established procedure for raising it with me in writing. Furthermore, I now understand that an injunction is no longer being sought. I hope that that reply is helpful both to the hon. Gentleman and to the House.</p>

 I also wish to speak about the matter raised by the hon. Member for Newcastle-under-Lyme (Paul Farrelly), because it seems to me that a fundamental principle of this House is now being threatened by the legal proceedings for an injunction and the consequent proceedings for contempt of court in respect of injuncted material. As you know, we have enjoyed in this House since 1688 the privilege of being able to speak freely. We have also developed the right of British citizens to know what we say in this House and have it reported freely. Is there an opportunity for a wider debate on what I think is a very substantial matter, either through a consideration of privilege or on the Floor of the Chamber?</p>

 There are usually further opportunities, as the hon. Gentleman, as an experienced parliamentarian, can testify. I hope that he will not mind if I point out that one suitable opportunity to raise the matter might be at business questions, in relation to which he himself enjoys a privileged position.</p>

 You, Mr. Speaker, are the defender of our rights and privileges in this place.

That is how Parliament&#146;s reporting has been stopped by it. Could you undertake to the House to do two things? First, will you take legal advice to see whether the courts can be instructed not to grant injunctions that close down reporting of this place?

 On the same point of order, Mr. Speaker. While you are reflecting on that point, may I ask you also to reflect on whether the increasing habit of solicitors of seeking injunctions in advance of publication, not only in this case but in others, might prevent newspapers regularly from reporting such questions? Given that the efforts of John Wilkes MP in the 18th century to provide for the reporting of parliamentary proceedings were such an important breakthrough, and indeed led to the disuse of sedition laws against this House, would it be possible for you to reflect on that and see whether something urgently needs to be done to control the habit of law firms of seeking to prevent the reporting of this House?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o9"><a name="91013-0004.htm_para4"><a name="09101345000191">The standing of the House has never been lower. In a reversal of 300 years of democratic development, the very fact of being elected to public office is sometimes, it seems, regarded as a disqualification. We all know that this issue is not just about allowances. It is true that a thorough overhaul of the system is essential&#151;I think everyone accepts that now&#151;but what we have come across in our constituencies is more than a sense of anger about specific and identified expense claims. Rather, it is a more generalised rage against politicians as a class: a sense that MPs have become remote and self-serving, and that we have become spokesmen for our parties in our constituencies instead of the other way around.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o10"><a name="91013-0004.htm_para5"><a name="09101345000192">We have all heard, on doorstep after doorstep, &#147;You&#146;re all the same.

I want to shift power from the Executive to the legislature, from parties to Back Benchers, and from Government to people.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o11"><a name="91013-0004.htm_para6"><a name="09101345000193">Our constituents have a point when they complain that it does not matter how they vote. At four of the last five general elections, fewer than one in 10 parliamentary constituencies changed hands. The fifth of those was, of course, the Labour landslide of 1997, but even then, more than 70 per cent. of seats were held by the parties that already controlled them. In other words, most of us represent pocket boroughs. As long as we retain the right to stand under the colours of our parties, we have tenure. Our incentives are thus twisted. Instead of answering outwards to their voters, MPs in safe seats are encouraged by the system to answer upwards to their Whips.</p>

The Totnes primary cost the Conservative Party somewhere in the region of &#163;40,000, mainly in postage, yet my Bill is specifically designed to deal with that problem, and at zero additional cost to the taxpayer. Under my Bill, local people&#151;supported by one or more parties&#151;could petition their returning officer to organise a primary contest at the same time as a pre-existing local or European ballot. The primary election would be piggy-backed on to an election already due to take place. The returning officer would have to include an extra ballot paper with the names of those on the shortlist.

We would need to guarantee that charges could not be levelled against MPs simply because they had voted with their conscience.

Triggering a primary would require the backing of a significant number of local people, and it would also require confirmation of serious wrongdoing by the Committee on Standards and Privileges.</p>

Let us remember what happened in Winchester in 1997. It was the closest we have ever come to a recall ballot in this country. The seat having been lost by two votes, the result was challenged by the loser in the courts.

 New clause 12 addresses the Secretary of State&#146;s power to disapply the operation of part 2 of the Housing Grants, Construction and Regeneration Act 1996 from certain types of construction contracts. I am grateful to the Opposition who have had discussions about the need for the amendments, for which I thank them. While the Bill has been going through Parliament, we have been approached by a number of stakeholders from the industry and its customers concerned about the nature of the Secretary of State&#146;s power to exclude contracts from the provisions of the 1996 Act. At the moment, that Act contains an all-or-nothing power&#151;in other words, the Secretary of State can disapply from certain types of contract all the provisions in part 2 of that Act. We would like to substitute a new power enabling the Secretary of State to disapply any&#151;not necessarily all&#151;of the provisions in part 2. That approach would allow us to ensure that many of the valuable features of the 1996 Act, as amended by this Bill, continue to apply&#151;for instance, the right to stage payments, the right to adjudication and the right to suspend performance in cases of non-payment&#151;while giving us the flexibility to deal with specific issues of direct concern. The legislation could also respond proportionately to future contractual innovation. Amendment 23 simply references the repeal of the existing disapplication power, because we are replacing it with this provision.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o41"><a name="91013-0005.htm_para15"><a name="09101345000226">Amendments 21 and 22 concern pre-dispute agreements regarding adjudication costs. As alluded to in Committee, we reconsidered that issue. Clause 137 inserts new section 108A into the 1996 Act, preventing parties to construction contracts from entering into agreements before a dispute has arisen about who should pick up the costs of an adjudication. As a consequence of this broad and simple prohibition, pre-dispute agreements between parties, to the effect that an adjudicator can allocate fees and expenses as part of his decision, will also be caught. Allowing the parties to agree in their construction contract that the adjudicator has this power is current good practice, which we would like to preserve. Amendment 22 achieves that by carving out such agreements from the general prohibition.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o42"><a name="91013-0005.htm_para16"><a name="09101345000227">Hon. Members raised a number of issues and tabled further amendments concerning the construction contract provision that directly reflect the points raised during previous stages of the Bill. The first issue concerned the statutory payment notice framework and is the subject of amendments 9, 10, 20 and 11. The hon. Members for North Cornwall (Dan Rogerson) and for Falmouth and Camborne (Julia Goldsworthy) seek to introduce two changes, creating a situation in which only a payee can issue the statutory payment notice, and introducing a statutory period within which a notice amending the amount in the payment notice can be issued.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o43"><a name="91013-0005.htm_para17"><a name="09101345000228">It might help if I set out what changes the Bill makes to the 1996 Act statutory payment framework. The framework is of particular interest to small firms in construction supply chains and has been a matter of much correspondence and debate. The Bill takes a number of steps to tighten up the statutory payment framework to ensure greater clarity and certainty of cash flow, and requires that the amount in the payment notice as, and if, revised, be paid on, or before, the final payment date&#151;in other words, pay now and argue later. The 1996 Act did not achieve that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o44"><a name="91013-0005.htm_para18"><a name="09101345000229">If the parties agree in contract, the payee is allowed to issue the statutory payment notice under the 1996 Act. Under that Act, only the payer could issue the statutory notice. When the parties agree that the payer should issue the statutory notice and he fails to do so, we give the payee the right to issue the notice. The 1996 Act was silent on what might happen when the notice was not issued.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o45"><a name="91013-0005.htm_para19"><a name="09101345000230">The changes address the failure of the 1996 Act&#146;s payment notice framework to determine what will be paid. There is broad agreement in the industry that the amendments have the effect of crystallising what will either be paid or in dispute at the final date for payment, which we think is an important step forward. However, today&#146;s amendments take that a step further. Under the 1996 Act only the payer can issue the statutory payment notice. The Bill removes that restriction and allows the payer, the payee or a third party to issue the notice. The change is permissive, allowing a broad range of commercial practices to continue unburdened by legislation, rather than adopting the more restrictive approach proposed in amendments 9, 10, 11 and 20.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o46"><a name="91013-0005.htm_para20"><a name="09101345000231">Currently, some forms of contract provide, for instance, for an architect to certify the value of the work and issue the payment notice.

<p><a name="stpa_o47"><a name="91013-0005.htm_para21"><a name="09101345000232">Amendment 11 seeks the introduction of a statutory period within which a counter-notice can be issued. We considered that proposal and asked about it more widely around the industry. The general conclusion was that although the proposal might provide the payee with greater certainty about what would be paid, it would do so at the expense of extending payment periods and reducing the amount of cash flowing.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o48"><a name="91013-0005.htm_para22"><a name="09101345000233">A number of issues have been raised in connection with insolvency and new clauses 3 and 5, as well as amendments 5, 6, 7 and 16. New clause 3 would enable firms working under construction contracts to demand security of the payments due to them. New clause 5 and amendments 5, 6 and 7 would remove the 1996 Act&#146;s insolvency exception to the prohibition of pay-when-paid clauses. Another effect of amendment 11 would be to remove the provision that we have included to deal with any uncertainty surrounding the Melville Dundas court decision.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o49"><a name="91013-0005.htm_para23"><a name="09101345000234">All the proposals rest against the same core principle. That principle is simple and clear: the insolvency regime applies to all businesses, regardless of the sector in which they operate. Without that consistency across business, it is hard to see how the insolvency regime can operate in an equitable way. In their own way, each of the amendments seeks to create a different position for firms covered by the 1996 Act from those that are not. We feel that it would be wrong for legislation to distinguish between business sectors where there is an insolvency.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o50"><a name="91013-0005.htm_para24"><a name="09101345000235">New clause 7, tabled by the hon. Member for Shrewsbury and Atcham (Daniel Kawczynski), applies to single mandatory adjudication schemes and would ensure that the statutory adjudication provisions applied to all construction contracts offered under the 1996 Act. The Act intentionally covers a wide range of contracts between very many types of organisations in construction supply chains. Whatever we introduce must work in a broad range of commercial relationships&#151;for instance, a client&#146;s relationship with his or her architect or with the main contractor, as well as the main contractor&#146;s relationship with his or her subcontractor. Given this, we continue to believe that the flexibility for adjudication procedures inherent in the 1996 Act represents the right approach. I therefore ask hon. Members to withdraw their amendments, and to accept new clause 12 and amendments 21, 22 and 23.</p>

 I congratulate the Minister on wading into the construction contracts in part 8 of the Bill.

<p><a name="stpa_o51"><a name="91013-0005.htm_para25"><a name="09101345000237">We would do well to consider the wider issues that the new clauses and amendments are seeking to address, including the fact that late and disputed payments are a recurring problem in the construction industry. Anecdotally, we know that main contractors are known to hold money back, to the detriment of the small and medium-sized enterprises that are their subcontractors. We believe that the 1996 Act needs updating to tackle the continuing problem of late and unreasonably disputed payments in the sector, and we welcome the decision to legislate on this.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o52"><a name="91013-0005.htm_para26"><a name="09101345000238">We also support the strengthening of the adjudication system. Indeed, the Minister will know that we have consistently lobbied for that system to be overhauled over the past few years. It is a matter of regret that we are still not in a position, in the dying days of this Government, to meet the undertaking made by previous Ministers to introduce a stand-alone construction Bill that would be subject to a proper debate, rather than having this spatchcock addition to a Bill on local democracy and regional issues. Let us not be too churlish, however; we are debating the issue now.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o53"><a name="91013-0005.htm_para27"><a name="09101345000239">We support the aims of the clauses on payments, but we want to ensure that they are as simple and fair in their operation as they can reasonably be. There is not a consensus on this matter. Many of the trade organisations and associations&#151;to be fair, the vast majority of them&#151;have supported the changes in the Bill, but a number still have concerns, including the Construction Confederation. However, the specialist engineering contractors have consistently supported the proposals during the Public Bill Committee and Report stages.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o54"><a name="91013-0005.htm_para28"><a name="09101345000240">We have no opposition in principle to new clause 12, which will place on a more formal footing and a statutory basis the provision for adjudicators in the devolved nations to take corrective action in respect of material inaccuracies and irregularities in contracts. We see that as more of a tidying-up exercise, although I would add the slight caveat that the issue should have been addressed before Report stage. It could have been discussed in Committee, for example. Wales and Scotland have had devolved Governments for quite some time now, but someone obviously did not spot that. Having said that, we had a debate on clause 136 in Committee in June.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o56"><a name="91013-0005.htm_para30"><a name="09101345000244">I think the new clause is important for this reason. Of course we do not want to see undue bureaucracy and paperwork in the contractual relationship between smaller contractors and larger developers, but the situation is pretty critical in respect of how the economic downturn and recession have hit small and medium-sized enterprises. In those circumstances, it is well worth looking at any legislative measures to assist small building firms and contractors to stay in business and to have the peace of mind and security to safeguard their financial viability. I note that the Government did not dismiss the matter out of hand in Committee.</p>

Over the past year, there has been a more than 50 per cent. increase in insolvencies in the industry&#151;more than double the same figures for the manufacturing sector&#151;and according to PricewaterhouseCoopers, nine construction industry firms a day are going into insolvency.</p>

I will not steal the thunder of the hon. Members for North Cornwall (Dan Rogerson) and for Falmouth and Camborne, but their amendments have considerable merit. We are inclined to support them at this stage, but the Minister may well surprise us and accept them, and we look forward with interest to hearing what she will have to say.</p>

At present, the larger organisations have the whip hand. We fear that the views of the much smaller businesses that constitute the majority of the industry are not being heard, and are not being reflected in the Bill. That is why we have raised the issue of the balance of power between payee and payer in amendment 20 and consequential amendments 9, 10, 11 and 16, and the whole subject of conditional payments. The hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy (Mr. Llwyd) will raise similar issues involving insolvency. Although we agree that there is a wrong to right in the existing system, and I understand the Minister when she says that we need a tightening of the provisions, clarity and certainty, we feel that our amendments would achieve greater fairness, reduce complexity and minimise the amount of regulation that will be necessary.</p>

They are supported by the Federation of Small Businesses, the Specialist Engineering Contractors Group and Unite, the union. Although the Government proposals try to redress the balance and to create equality between the payee and payer, we are saying that, in effect, it is always the payer who has the greater power and that the arrangements will still leave the payer with the greater power, because the bargaining power of the payee is unequal. Our proposal is based on contracts legislation in New Zealand and other legislation in Australia, and we think that there is a precedent for pursuing that line. I hope that the Minister will heed the words of the hon. Member for Peterborough (Mr. Jackson), which are echoed on the Liberal Democrat Benches. We feel that there is consensus on the issue and that there is a need to move forward.</p>

that that has been adopted in New Zealand, Australia and Singapore. We have not had a decent explanation of exactly why the provision crept in. The conclusion that Liberal Democrats draw is that it had to do with some major lobbying, rather than inconsistency in law. I bring the Minister back to the issue of perspective. We are worried that insolvencies further up the line could generate more insolvencies down the line. There is a danger of a domino effect in the current economic situation.</p>

 A number of smaller firms sometimes find that they are working perfectly satisfactorily and are then hit by a large bad debt. Their security of payment has completely gone. They then have to lay off people who have been working jolly hard, because something further up the line has been visited upon them and they do not have the capacity to sustain it. We will lose a lot of jobs in the construction industry in very small firms, not because they have not been trying to work properly, but because people up the line who have owed them substantial sums have failed.

 My hon. Friend makes an important point. We have to remember that, in the construction industry in particular, so many of the costs are sunk: once the companies have built the building, they cannot recover the costs. It is difficult enough for them to manage the potential insolvency of their payer, let alone a third party. If we look at it from their point of view, how on earth are they supposed to get credit insurance to deal with such issues? They are being placed in an impossible position. It is an important issue that needs to be addressed. It ties into the point raised by the hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy (Mr. Llwyd).</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o71"><a name="91013-0006.htm_para14"><a name="09101345000269">The motive for the 1996 Act was the Latham report.

that flowed from them. I was even more fortunate as a Minister in the early days of the current Government to be in a position to introduce in the late-1990s the provisions of the 1996 Act, together with the scheme for construction contracts which was developed under the powers in that Act. That was a further reinforcement of the bipartisan approach towards improvements in the culture of payment and the reduction in litigation in the construction industry.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o72"><a name="91013-0006.htm_para15"><a name="09101345000270">Those proposals were not, of course, a total panacea. There remain problems and weaknesses in procedures that have not yet been tackled. There is obvious unhappiness on the part of some parties to construction contracts that payment is not always made when it should be, and that the stronger party can often use its muscle to try to impose unreasonable conditions, but for all that there has been an advance. The amount of litigation has been reduced, and the use of the adjudication procedure is now much more widespread. There is general agreement that the provisions of the 1996 Act have been beneficial.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o73"><a name="91013-0006.htm_para16"><a name="09101345000271">Having said that, there is still a need for further improvement, and this Bill carries forward proposals that were the subject of intense debate within the construction industry over several years but which should add further improvements to the provisions of the 1996 Act. Inevitably, this is a compromise. There is a range of different points of view within the industry. It is highly fragmented and it is almost impossible to anticipate a situation where a package of reforms would satisfy all parties and be unanimously agreed. However, the compromise the Government have proposed is a sensible and practical one that achieves significant improvements, both in terms of the adjudication procedure and some of the elements relating to payment procedures, and I welcome its provisions.</p>

 There are of course a number of different aspects to the issue of cash flow and the hon.

There is also the problem of cash flow resulting from payment by a contractor to a subcontractor down the supply chain. That exercises a lot of concern on the part of smaller and specialist contractors, and the payment and adjudication provisions in the Bill may help to improve it in some respects.</p>

Government were designed to outlaw the imposition by the more powerful party in a contractual arrangement of unfair terms requiring the other party to meet all the costs of adjudication, thereby deterring that other party from seeking adjudication in the first place. The sensible provision was to make null any contractual term that had that effect, in which case the scheme for construction contracts, which is the default provision, would come into force, and it, of course, would not include any such restrictive provision.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o76"><a name="91013-0006.htm_para19"><a name="09101345000276">That provision was sensible, but when looking at how it was due to work, I was advised by a number of people in the construction industry&#151;this was reinforced by the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors in its representations on the subject&#151;that it could have the malign and unintended consequence of preventing the adjudicator from getting any payment. That would be a serious deterrent to anyone taking on an adjudication. Clearly that was a proper and reasonable concern, so I aired it in Committee and subsequently tabled amendment 1 to remedy it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o77"><a name="91013-0006.htm_para20"><a name="09101345000277">The purpose of amendment 1 was simply to say that in the absence of any specific agreement the adjudicator would be entitled to the payment of</p>

</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o78"><a name="91013-0006.htm_para21"><a name="09101345000278">That seemed a fairly straightforward way to address the matter. The Government have come back with amendments 21 and 22, which address it in a different way but have the same effect. Amendment 22 specifically says:</p>
<a name="91013-0006.htm_brev4"><a name="09101345000366"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;The contractual provision referred to...is ineffective unless&#151;</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o79"><a name="91013-0006.htm_para22"><a name="09101345000279">On the surface, that seems to achieve the desired effect and I welcome it. I have heard some representations made that it could still leave a lacuna whereby a contract could be devised that included exactly such a provision for the adjudicator to be entitled to payment of reasonable expenses but that might separately seek to impose a condition about other costs, including the legal costs of the parties&#151;if they incurred such costs&#151;being met by one party. I am assured that that is not the case, but I would welcome reassurance from the Minister that there is no scope for such a lacuna in the provisions which would allow the good intentions of the Government&#146;s provisions to be bypassed. I hope that she will be able to give me that assurance. If she is able to do so, I will be happy not to press my amendment and to favour Government amendments 21 and 22.</p>

any redress is often a death knell to them. As has been made clear, the building industry has probably been the worst hit industry in this recession. That is no surprise, because it is always the first to be hit, but it has been particularly badly hit.

<p><a name="stpa_o82"><a name="91013-0007.htm_para0"><a name="09101345000283">We all know of various tales of woe of smaller small and medium-sized enterprises in the building industry hitting the wall not because of anything that they have done but because of the inequality between themselves and the main contractor, which I would describe as the inequality of arms par excellence. Let me cite one example. Two sister companies&#151;Pierse Contracting and Pierse Contracting Southern Ltd&#151;recently went into insolvency. Both continued to commission construction work and engage subcontractors over the past 12 months, when they were clearly insolvent. Just over a year ago, the net worth of each company was between minus &#163;400,000 and minus &#163;500,000. In the past year, the former company had 29 unsatisfied county court judgments against it and the latter had 43. Companies in Pierse Group&#151;the holding company&#151;regularly moved whatever assets they had between themselves and businesses in Ireland.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o83"><a name="91013-0007.htm_para1"><a name="09101345000284">Both Pierse Contracting and Pierse Contracting Southern Ltd were engaged by public sector bodies as main contractors. Such bodies included authorities in Wales and in England, and one was the Cheshire police authority. Pierse Contracting was the main contractor for the tactical training centre at Winsford in Cheshire&#151;a project to the value of &#163;10.7 million. As a result of Pierse Contracting&#146;s insolvency, a number of subcontractors have been put in peril, including one that has lost more than &#163;600,000. This situation, I regret to say, is not unusual within the industry&#151;nor is it new. Firms are engaging supply chains to carry out work when their liabilities exceed their assets&#151;in other words, when they are insolvent. Often work is commissioned by developers that are &#163;100 companies with no assets to speak of.</p>

</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o87"><a name="91013-0007.htm_para5"><a name="09101345000288">Given the fact that insolvencies up the supply chain are now causing severe distress to many small and medium-sized enterprises, which do not have the ability to protect themselves against insolvency risk or even to manage the risk through credit insurance or bank borrowing, it is now time for the House to legislate on the matter. Construction SMEs are now losing almost &#163;1.16 million a year because of non-payment, according to the recent Barclays local business annual late payments report. The incidence of insolvencies in the construction industry is four times greater than in other industries.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o88"><a name="91013-0007.htm_para6"><a name="09101345000289">During the Bill&#146;s passage through the other place, no less an expert than Lord Borrie QC introduced an amendment to help firms faced with the Pierse Contracting scenario. In effect, my new clause 3 reintroduces those amendments, and I believe that it is straightforward and self-evident. Firms in the construction industry already have a statutory right to suspend contracts for non-payment, and the proposal is that that right should be extended to cover circumstances in which a procurer of construction works is unable, on request, to provide security such as a bank guarantee or payment bond. Where such security cannot be provided, and there is evidence of the payer&#146;s inability to pay, the payee would be able to suspend the contract.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o89"><a name="91013-0007.htm_para7"><a name="09101345000290">Let me dispose of some of the arguments against the new clause. First, if the payer were to fail, fewer assets would be available to satisfy other creditors. As I have said, the sub-contractor already has a statutory right to suspend a contract for non-payment. If that happened and then the payer subsequently discharged the payment, there would still be fewer assets left for creditors in the event of the payer becoming insolvent. Failure by the payer to provide a bank guarantee or payment bond indicates that he does not have the funds to discharge payment when it falls due.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o90"><a name="91013-0007.htm_para8"><a name="09101345000291">Moreover, why should the payee continue to provide valuable work and materials when he knows that he is unlikely to be paid for them? New clause 3 would simply extend the use of the statutory right of suspension as a pre-emptive strike, as it were. Non-construction creditors are likely to have more effective ways&#151;such as the retention of title clauses, for example&#151;to deal with insolvency risk: why should construction firms be expected to continue working to benefit their creditors? If the new clause were to help 1,000 small and medium-sized enterprises in the construction supply chains from going into insolvency, thereby saving a substantial number of jobs, it would have served its purpose.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o91"><a name="91013-0007.htm_para9"><a name="09101345000292">Moreover, payment security would help small firms seeking funding from their banks. The new clause would help to address the problem posed by the banks&#146; current reluctance to lend to SMEs. It has been said that compelling the payer to provide security would be expensive, and that ring-fencing any of the payer&#146;s funds could increase the risk of the payer&#146;s insolvency. However, if the payer cannot provide a form of security that shows his ability to pay, he should not commission the work.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o92"><a name="91013-0007.htm_para10"><a name="09101345000293">It is extremely expensive for the payee to finance the provision of plant, equipment, work and materials over the lengthy credit periods that are now common in the industry. A period of 60 to 90 days is becoming the norm, and the fact that the payee&#151;usually an SME&#151;is expected to finance such a long period increases the risk that he will become insolvent. That risk is further increased by the possibility that the payer could also become insolvent.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o93"><a name="91013-0007.htm_para11"><a name="09101345000294">In some sectors of the industry, such as lift installation and structural steel work, 80 per cent. of the value of a contract&#151;that is, for lifts or steel&#151;is supplied to a site without any payment being made. The payment process does not begin until the goods are on site, and there is no deposit on order. In addition, the payee is normally expected to provide security for performance, through instruments such as performance bonds and retentions&#151;the practice by which 5 per cent. of payment is withheld until work is completed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o94"><a name="91013-0007.htm_para12"><a name="09101345000295">The Government believe that, in contrast with other industries, construction firms should get preferential treatment over unsecured creditors, but that argument is relevant only if the payer becomes insolvent and the security mechanism kicks in. On the other hand, if the payee goes into insolvency, the payer is likely to have at least eight weeks of the payee&#146;s moneys in the amount withheld in retentions, the performance bond and a parent company guarantee. Therefore, other unsecured creditors currently get preferential treatment over construction creditors, as they can take advantage of the funds intended for the insolvent&#146;s supply chain. An administrator for the main contractor is usually called in when that contractor has been put in funds for onward transmission to the supply chain. It is widely accepted that payees in the construction industry do not have the ability to protect themselves against payer insolvency&#151;for example, retention of title clauses are of little use. Once goods and materials have been used in a construction, title is lost. Furthermore, because of the current economic crisis, credit insurance has been withdrawn from thousands of firms.</p>

Member for Greenwich and Woolwich (Mr. Raynsford)&#151;which led to the Construction Act 1996, Sir Michael Latham fully acknowledged the problem of lack of protection against payer insolvency. He recommended statutory trust funds, but that proposal was not carried through in the Act. He repeated his recommendation in a report in September 2004 and the then Minister agreed to look at the problem.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o96"><a name="91013-0007.htm_para14"><a name="09101345000297">Throughout Europe, north America and Australia, the problem is acknowledged in construction-specific legislation, offering payee protection against payer insolvency. The Miller Acts in the United States, which apply at federal, state and local authority level, require main contractors to give payment bonds to their subcontractors. Canada and the States have a system of liens, or charges, that can be placed on the building by those who are owed money.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o97"><a name="91013-0007.htm_para15"><a name="09101345000298">France has legislation to require payers to provide bank guarantees and to pay subcontractors directly if a middleman goes into insolvency. German legislation requires all procurers of construction work to provide adequate security. Swiss legislation enables construction firms to place a charge on the property within three months of the date that payment became due.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o98"><a name="91013-0007.htm_para16"><a name="09101345000299">At present, millions of pounds-worth of construction works are being procured by firms with little or no assets&#151;as I said, &#163;100 development companies often procure multi-million pound projects. The majority of main contracting companies do not have the wherewithal to pay their supply chains unless or until they receive cash from their employers or clients. Once the cash is received they hold on to it for as long as they can, until they themselves go into insolvency and the cash is instead handed over to the secured creditors. It is, therefore, not surprising that the number of insolvencies in the construction industry is far greater than in other industries.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o99"><a name="91013-0007.htm_para17"><a name="09101345000300">There is concern that the new clause would mean that the construction industry was treated differently in respect of creditors, but as I have explained they are already treated differently, to their detriment. Section 159 of the Companies Act 1989 provides an exemption from the rules for distribution of an insolvent&#146;s assets. The exemption applies to schemes operated by investment exchanges and finance clearing houses in relation to the settlement of debts arising under market contracts. That appears to be an exception.</p>

(Mr. Raynsford) has mentioned the Latham review. We have had two substantive and detailed public consultations, detailed papers by the then Department of Trade and Industry, and the policy of the Welsh Assembly, yet only now, years after the Latham review, are the Government bringing forward the proposals, tacked on to another Bill and not as part of a substantive construction Bill.

The hon. Member for Peterborough (Mr. Jackson) asked about the single statutory adjudication review. I assure him that the secondary legislation will be reviewed in the light of the responses to the consultation. We hope to consult early in the new year. Of course, the statutory scheme will continue to apply where parties make inadequate provision in their contract for adjudication. We will deal with that in secondary legislation.</p>

Friend the Member for Greenwich and Woolwich were the inspiration for amendment 22. But, I want to assure him that there will not be a lacuna. We will allow a particular type of pre-dispute agreement, regarding costs&#151;a clause in the parties&#146; construction contract to the effect that an adjudicator will be able to allocate his own costs as part of his decision.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o106"><a name="91013-0007.htm_para24"><a name="09101345000310">I shall now address new clause 3. As the hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy (Mr. Llwyd) has said, the new clause would introduce to the 1996 Act a provision enabling firms to request security regarding payments from the payer. That would give the payee under a construction contract the statutory right to demand adequate security from the payer in the form of a charge or a bank guarantee in respect of the payer&#146;s payments under the contract. If no security were forthcoming, the payee would be entitled to suspend performance until it was. Moreover, the payer would have to pay the payee an additional sum reflecting the extra costs that the payee incurred in stopping work.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o107"><a name="91013-0007.htm_para25"><a name="09101345000311">Consequently, if the main contractor were to fail, his other creditors&#151;quite possibly not construction firms&#151;would be in a much weaker position. Depending on the type of security, there would be fewer assets available to satisfy claims. Any trading partner of the contractor would be able to request such security during the normal course of business, but that partner would not be able to demand it. The ability to demand security would put the construction sub-contractor in an unjustifiably stronger position.</p>

 Surely the point is that the sub-contractor would have delivered materials to the site, used employees to build a building and done everything that he could, up to a point.

For example, a bank would charge for a guarantee, and, if the nature of any security were such that funds had to be ring-fenced so that the payer was unable to use them for day-to-day operations, the payer would be more likely to fail anyway.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o108"><a name="91013-0007.htm_para26"><a name="09101345000314">New clause 5 would repeal section 113 of the Housing Grants, Construction and Regeneration Act 1996. The new clause would, it appears, allow the parties to a construction contract to rely on all types of pay-when-paid clause. However, amendments 5, 6, 7 and 16 would continue to prevent the parties from relying on pay-when-paid clauses, and because of that new clause 5 would remove the insolvency exceptions. We need to be careful that we do not create a different situation for construction insolvencies from those involving other businesses, and preventing construction firms from using pay-when-paid clauses in insolvency cases would clearly do that.</p>

both sides of the House that this has been a matter of some concern for local authorities since the Court of Appeal handed down its judgment in the LAML&#151;London Authorities Mutual Ltd&#151;case in June 2009.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o118"><a name="91013-0008.htm_para6"><a name="09101345000329">In July, my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government published the consultation paper &#147;Strengthening local democracy&#148;, which sought views on the scope of local authority powers, particularly as regards their powers to undertake mutual insurance arrangements. The consultation response attracted 96 responses to the specific question on mutual insurance, with 82 per cent. agreeing with the proposed power. New clause 19 provides permissive powers for authorities to enter into mutual insurance arrangements, if they wish to do so. Authorities exercising the power will need to ensure that any proposed arrangement meets the duty of best value as laid down in legislation. While it seems unlikely that all local authorities will wish to establish or participate in an insurance mutual, for those for which it makes good business sense to do so, clear and specific legal powers will be available to them for that purpose.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o119"><a name="91013-0008.htm_para7"><a name="09101345000330">The amendment provides that best value authorities, which are described as &#147;qualifying authorities&#148;, may establish and become members of a corporate body&#151;for example, a company&#151;the object of which is to provide insurance in relation to insurance risks to authorities that are members of the mutual. Only qualifying authorities may be members of the mutual.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o120"><a name="91013-0008.htm_para8"><a name="09101345000331">The mutual may also provide insurance to other bodies, which may be prescribed by regulation and which I will call &#147;affiliates&#148;. They will be bodies that have some association with qualifying authorities&#151;for example, arm&#146;s length management organisations, academy schools or wholly owned subsidiaries. Broadly, the intention is for a qualifying authority to be able to sponsor an affiliate to bring it within the mutual&#146;s insurance cover, as we understand that many local authorities arrange insurance cover for ALMOs and some schools. However, affiliates will not be able to become members of the mutual.</p>

They can also assume financial obligations in relation to affiliates. The Secretary of State in relation to England, and Welsh Ministers in relation to Wales, may by regulation subject to the affirmative procedure amend the list of qualifying authorities. They may also impose restrictions or conditions on the use of the power by regulation subject to the negative resolution procedure. We intend to consult on the content of such regulations. Qualifying authorities are required to have regard to any guidance issued by the Secretary of State or Welsh Ministers and to any documents specified in regulations, such as guidance from the Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy. Again, we want to consult on that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o125"><a name="91013-0008.htm_para13"><a name="09101345000336">The Government have long been committed to ensuring that councils have a wide range of powers and providing them with the freedom to be innovative and act in the local interest. Indeed, we introduced the well-being power in 2000 as a broad power of first resort to enable local authorities to act for the benefit of their local community. In 2003, we introduced new freedoms and flexibilities for capital finance, including prudential borrowing powers. At the same time, we provided powers for best value authorities to charge for discretionary services and enabled new trading powers to be conferred on authorities.</p>

However, they are complex issues that need careful consideration. I assure the House that we are committed to such consideration following the recent consultation, but I am concerned that &#147;power&#148;, as it is expressed in the amendment, would not give councils the certainty that they need if they are to take part in mutual insurance. Indeed, the Court of Appeal judgment, which in a sense is at the root of the Government amendments, indicated that any general power would be unlikely to provide local authorities with the necessary confidence to engage in mutual insurance and similar arrangements. We are introducing our amendments today to address that problem, but, as I have said, we are committed to considering other ideas that came forward in the consultation.</p>

parties in a region. The Bill already has a very clear focus on enhancing the role of local authorities in economic development through the introduction of economic prosperity boards and local economic assessment duties and by providing a statutory basis for multi-area agreements.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o132"><a name="91013-0008.htm_para20"><a name="09101345000343">The economic assessment duty, for example, will provide a shared and agreed understanding of local economic conditions and will form a key part of the evidence base that will inform priorities for regional strategies and their implementation plans to ensure that local circumstances and perspectives are properly reflected. In that context, the focus should be on the principle and practice of joint investment planning, which can be achieved within the existing legislative framework, rather than on delegation of RDA functions. The key is closer working between RDAs and local authorities in planning the implementation of the regional strategy, which will deliver the optimum outcomes at local level.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o133"><a name="91013-0008.htm_para21"><a name="09101345000344">Certainly, we propose a joint approach to planning and investment in the region, which will enable local authorities to take on a large degree of responsibility for delivering agreed programmes and projects in their areas.

 The new arrangements that we are introducing&#151;the RDA and leaders boards&#151;will address some of the issues raised by the question whether RDAs have an input from local government when they are drawing up regional strategies.

We have therefore looked at how to ensure that RDA boards work closely with the leaders boards from local authorities. In many instances, they are drawing up joint boards to consider particular aspects such as planning and transport. This brings together local authority colleagues with the regional development agency boards in a joint approach, which will be very important.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o135"><a name="91013-0008.htm_para23"><a name="09101345000348">The key point is that RDAs and local authorities will jointly agree what programmes of intervention will be undertaken in particular areas, but the RDAs will retain the responsibility to make the final decisions.

colleagues from the LGA, local authorities and RDAs to develop guidance for joint investment planning. The principles that we are following mean that that should be light touch and partnership-based.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o137"><a name="91013-0008.htm_para25"><a name="09101345000350">New clause 9 was tabled by several of my hon. Friends, including my hon. Friend the Member for Milton Keynes, South-West (Dr. Starkey) in her key position as the Chairman of the Select Committee. It calls for the Government to place a duty on local authorities to develop, in consultation with members of the public, a strategy for the provision of public toilets in their area, and to review this on an annual basis. The Government believe that decisions about the provision of local services and amenities such as public toilets are best made at local level, so we want to devolve the powers, resources and flexibility to local authority partnerships. We have therefore taken concerted action to empower communities, so that people have more influence over local decisions. We believe that that is the right way to bring about the changes that people want to see in their areas and is a better and more sustainable approach than always providing direction from the centre on how particular public services should work, which can constrain the ability of councils to respond in the ways that best meet the range of local needs and priorities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o138"><a name="91013-0008.htm_para26"><a name="09101345000351">As in other parts of the Bill, we have tried to introduce ways in which people, through petitions and requests to which councils must respond, can raise the needs of their community. In 2007, we undertook to consult all relevant bodies about the issue of public toilets. As a result, we published our strategic guide on improving access to better quality toilets in March 2008. It highlighted the range of powers and approaches available to local authorities and their partners that can help them to improve publicly accessible toilets in their area. That included further guidance on the community toilet schemes, under which members of the public can use toilet facilities, free of charge, in local businesses such as caf&#233;s, restaurants, pubs and public buildings.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o139"><a name="91013-0008.htm_para27"><a name="09101345000352">We believe that the right approach is for parts of the Bill to be used by local councils to influence such provision. Rather than imposing a duty from the centre&#151;in many ways, we have tried to pull back from that&#151;we want local people to have means of raising such issues and making councils more accessible and responsible. We would rather do that than always say from the centre, &#147;This is how you need to address your toilet issues.&#148;</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o140"><a name="91013-0008.htm_para28"><a name="09101345000353">New clause 1, tabled by the right hon. Member for Hitchin and Harpenden (Mr. Lilley), is similar to his proposal in Committee, when he explained that he wished to close a loophole that he thought would allow councils to meet their housing targets by applying for planning permission in another local authority area. I wrote to him on 25 July and explained&#151;I hope&#151;that houses built in a particular area can count only towards the planned housing supply for that area. His new clause is therefore unnecessary. It proposes that no local authority should be able to meet its housing target by promoting</p>

Indeed, they are required by law to consult each other. However, local authorities have no powers to require another local authority to accommodate housing numbers allocated to them. Our policy is that local authorities should accommodate the level of housing identified for their area in the regional spatial strategy or regional strategy. We support councils working together so that they can decide between them how best to accommodate their respective housing needs across a sub-region area. However, they cannot simply require another local authority to accommodate the number of houses allocated to them.</p>

I am familiar with the arguments put by my right hon. Friend the Member for Hitchin and Harpenden (Mr. Lilley) in Committee. Our Front-Bench colleague, my hon. Friend the Member for Bromley and Chislehurst (Robert Neill), is looking closely at the matter raised by new clause 9. The Minister made a reasonable point about the undesirability of putting new burdens on local authorities on to the statute book, but our view is not carved in stone and we will listen carefully to what she has to say. Like my hon. Friend the Member for Peterborough (Mr. Jackson), I welcome back the Minister. She is the one fixed point in the turning world of the Government Front Bench.

<p><a name="stpa_o144"><a name="91013-0009.htm_para3"><a name="09101354000003">The Minister went through the background to Government new clauses 19 and 20 in some detail, and there is no need for me to repeat her in taking us through the LAML case and what happened in court. However, it may be worth pointing out that LAML is an all-party body, in that Conservative-controlled councils such as Croydon, Hammersmith and Fulham, and Harrow are members. Also, both the Local Government Association and Chris Leslie, the director of the New Local Government Network and a former and&#151;who knows?&#151;perhaps future Member of this House, were disappointed with the judgment. It is also worth pointing out that in response to the Government&#146;s consultation paper on strengthening local democracy&#151;of which more later&#151;the LGA said that the</p>

Specific legislation on mutual insurance would do nothing to tackle the wider limitations of the existing well-being power which the case has highlighted.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o145"><a name="91013-0009.htm_para4"><a name="09101354000004">Let me pause at this point and say to the Minister that we are inclined to give her new clauses a fair wind. She made much of the fact that our new clause to introduce a new power of a general competence would not do the trick on mutual insurance. Our answer is that we are not seeking&#151;at least not at this stage&#151;to delete her provisions on mutual insurance, so they would stand. However, we have a couple of questions and concerns that are worth raising. We are curious to know whether the Department has made any assessment, as it should have, of any risks to local authorities. We have received indications from some sources of that possibility, so we are curious to know what the Minister thinks about that. Also, new clause 19(5) refers to guidance. If the Minister has not already told the House when she intends to issue that guidance, it would be welcome if she did so.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o146"><a name="91013-0009.htm_para5"><a name="09101354000005">An examination of the clauses on mutual insurance naturally leads us to the wider subject of the power of general competence.

Part 5 of the Bill sets out a regional strategy, and it is worth examining it in the context of the Department&#146;s own view of the representations that it received in response to the sub-national review.

<p><a name="stpa_o164"><a name="91013-0009.htm_para23"><a name="09101354000024">The new clause arises from one of the recommendations in the Select Committee&#146;s report on the provision of public toilets, published in October 2008.

I have not been involved in a Communities and Local Government inquiry that has excited as much public interest as that one on the provision of public toilets. I shall also explain why we thought it necessary for councillors to have a duty to draw up a strategy.

There is nevertheless a huge public interest in ensuring an adequate supply of public toilets in every area of the country and that any such provision should be of high quality.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o166"><a name="91013-0009.htm_para25"><a name="09101354000026">Although this is clearly an issue for every single member of the public, there are certain groups among the population who feel particularly deeply about it. One of those groups is, obviously, the elderly. I think it is a biological fact that as they get older, both men and women tend to have a more frequent need to use public toilets, and those needs become considerably more pressing.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o167"><a name="91013-0009.htm_para26"><a name="09101354000027">These things are often not spoken of publicly, but I think it is extremely important for us to do so. The ability of elderly people to have a nice day out, to go shopping or to visit the public library is often constrained by the fact that they are not absolutely certain that, should they need to use a public toilet, one will be conveniently available, and they fear that if one is available, it will not necessarily be very clean or a pleasant place and they will feel slight concern about using it. That is why many of the organisations representing elderly people, such as Age Concern, have been so active in raising the issue of the need for adequate public toilet provision, and why they have been so supportive of our report. In fact, they have subsequently used it as a campaigning tool with local groups in an attempt to raise the profile of the issue with their local councils.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o168"><a name="91013-0009.htm_para27"><a name="09101354000028">The issue also affects families with young children. As we all know, young children often have pressing and urgent needs to use public toilet facilities. They tend not to look ahead, so to speak, and go to the loo before they leave home. They swear blind that they do not need to use a loo, and then suddenly and very urgently need to use one. Although the public tend to turn a blind eye to small persons using the natural greenery of the landscape to camouflage these vital activities, it would clearly be much more satisfactory if there were an adequate supply of toilets so that families out with young children could use the proper facilities when they require them, rather than being forced to rush into the nearest bank&#151;should one be open&#151;to ask whether they can use the staff facilities.</p>

It was asking for local authorities to be given a duty to draw up their own local strategies in consultation with their local populations. The best councils are already doing that, but not all councils are. That is why we suggested that every council should have a duty to draw up its own strategy.

That is another issue that is not often spoken of publicly.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o170"><a name="91013-0009.htm_para29"><a name="09101354000032">Another group affected consists of people with severe disabilities, and, in particular, the families of children and adults with such disabilities, who need to be able to gain access to good disabled toilets, especially the excellent ones promulgated by the Changing Places campaign. Let me at this point put in a good word for my own constituency&#151;well, not my constituency, but Milton Keynes council, which was one of the first to provide a Changing Places toilet in the Milton Keynes shopping centre. The shopping centre is not in my constituency, but in the adjacent constituency of the hon. Member for North-East Milton Keynes (Mr. Lancaster).</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o171"><a name="91013-0009.htm_para30"><a name="09101354000033">For families caring for severely disabled young people or adults, the ability to gain access to a Changing Places toilet is even more important. Our Committee heard evidence from one family who had been unable to enjoy a day out as a family until Changing Places toilets were provided. If their disabled family member had an accident, they had to give up their whole day and all go home because there was no way in which they could gain access to suitable facilities. If there is not decent public toilet provision, those groups do not have the freedom of movement that everyone expects in order to use leisure and shopping facilities. That is not to mention issues about tourism and the need for resort towns, for example, to ensure that visitors have adequate public toilet provision.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o172"><a name="91013-0009.htm_para31"><a name="09101354000034">There is a public hygiene aspect. We had strong evidence from those representing residents associations, which are particularly concerned about the public nuisance that is caused in some city centres where there is inadequate public toilet provision, where there are lots of pubs and clubs and where lots of young people drink a great deal, come out on to the streets and often cause extreme nuisance in public places and in front gardens. Therefore, a huge range of people think that this is an important issue to which not enough attention has been given, either locally or nationally, and they were very supportive of the Committee&#146;s inquiry. Many were keen that councils should have a duty to provide public conveniences. We did not go as far as many of the groups that made representations to our Committee wanted us to go. We did not think that it was necessary for local authorities to have a duty to provide public conveniences. The Minister raised points about the need for local authorities to be able to take decisions on the way in which they use their resources and provide for local needs. However, although some councils have been excellent, many councils have not been, so we thought that there should be a duty to draw up a strategy in consultation with the local community.</p>

 As I have said, I am in two minds about that argument. The right hon. Gentleman will be aware that the Committee has just published a report on the balance of power between central and local government, where we argued strongly for local government to be given considerably more powers. I am in two minds because of the evidence that we received from individuals and organisations. Although there has been significant public pressure from individuals and groups in many localities to get their local council to take the issue seriously and to look at the best practice of councils that are providing good toilet provision, often through community toilet schemes, where they have worked with local businesses, pubs and caf&#233;s to ensure that a range of provision is available&#151;much of it is provided by the private sector, primarily for its customers, but also for public use&#151;regrettably, quite a lot of councils still do not seem to be susceptible to pressures from such groups. They seem to be locked into the idea that the provision of public toilets is extremely expensive, cannot be done these days and is beyond them. They do not seem to be looking at the good practice of other councils and thinking imaginatively about the way in which they could provide such facilities. That is why we put forward the recommendation that councils should have a duty to draw up a strategy in consultation with the local community. That would give more weight to the local groups that want such facilities and are pushing councils into activity.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o173"><a name="91013-0010.htm_para0"><a name="09101354000037">The Minister provided a pre-emptive response to my proposal in which she reiterated the Government response to our original recommendation. I have some sympathy with the notion that we should not at this time be putting additional constraints on local authorities. In her response however, the Minister gave the impression that this was about councils directly providing facilities, whereas in fact it is about councils drawing up a strategy. I accept that even drawing up a strategy and having a public consultation is not cost free; there is of course a certain financial cost to the council in doing that, but drawing up a strategy is not quite the same as the council directly providing public toilets. Therefore, I hope that the Minister might reconsider some of the emphasis in the original Government response to the report and recognise that this is not about direct provision but about strategy.</p>

However, before I definitively decide that I am not going to pursue this matter, I shall need the Minister to give me a bit more reassurance, such as on how the additional powers in the Bill could be used by local groups to push recalcitrant councils into at least having a strategy. If she were to state that on the record, it would at least be a further campaigning tool that all those organisations could use against recalcitrant councils in order to get them to be more active.</p>

 The hon. Member for Milton Keynes, South-West (Dr. Starkey) has raised an important issue that we have not discussed previously in proceedings on this Bill. It is important to pay tribute to the Changing Places campaign that has done so much to draw attention to this issue and to put pressure on local authorities to improve their standard of provision. I can understand why the hon. Lady is in two minds as to whether there should be some kind of statutory duty. The way the process works at present in many areas of local government is that national guidelines tend to set a lowest common denominator which councils then feel they have to reach as a minimum level. We do not currently have a system with a highest common denominator whereby the excellent work of some councils&#151;which some Conservative Members have raised&#151;sets the standards that other councils have to try to achieve. I wonder whether a way of dealing with this might be to set up a system whereby the impetus is on local authorities to reach the highest common denominator rather than on their being beaten into trying to attain the lowest common denominator.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o177"><a name="91013-0010.htm_para4"><a name="09101354000042">I find the Minister&#146;s response on this whole issue rather bizarre, because she says there is no way this should be within the remit of central Government and that it should be a matter entirely for local government, yet we are discussing a piece of primary legislation that sets out in minute detail and thousands of words and pages how councils should respond to petitions. There is therefore double-think in the Minister&#146;s response in that she can take one view on the provision of public toilets but a very different view on the minutiae of much of the other work that local government undertakes. Perhaps she could square that in her response&#151;I will be impressed if she manages to achieve that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o178"><a name="91013-0010.htm_para5"><a name="09101354000043">I turn now to the initial Government new clauses relating to the Court of Appeal ruling on local authorities and mutual insurance. The Liberal Democrats are not going to oppose them, because they deal specifically with the problem that the ruling identified, but they are necessary to although not sufficient for the needs of local government. The new clauses do not address a much more general issue relating to how the well-being power could be applied. The Minister&#146;s remarks seemed to indicate that she was prepared to take a piecemeal approach, addressing other issues that might arise from the way the well-being power was exercised. Such an approach is unnecessarily complicated, because introducing a much more general power of competence would address the matter far more effectively.

are saying about the general power of competence, because such a power would make things explicit and deal with them in a simple way, rather than saying, &#147;We&#146;ll deal with each issue as it arises, depending on what rulings may or may not be made.&#148; Like the hon. Member for Wycombe (Mr. Goodman), I understood that this was not an either/or approach, because we could adopt it in addition to matters relating to the LAML case.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o179"><a name="91013-0010.htm_para6"><a name="09101354000044">I shall keep my remarks brief, because I know that many hon. Members want to raise specific points today and I wish to give them the opportunity to do so. On the Conservatives&#146; new clause 15, Liberal Democrats are broadly supportive of the need to push down to a more local level power and resource from any level further up the line, be it central or regional. I was slightly concerned about the language that was used, because I would much rather see a push to devolve funding and decision making, rather than simply to delegate it. One of the problems that I have with the regional organisations, which seem to have so much power, is that they are not actually responsible for decisions; they see themselves purely as making delegated decisions and they are delivery arms of central Government. In a sense, where someone is undertaking and executing delegated powers, it does not matter whether that is being done at a national, regional, sub-regional or parish level, because ultimately they are doing only what is being required of them by the central Government guidance. I would much rather there be devolved powers than delegated ones.</p>

 I have a lot of sympathy with the point that the hon. Lady is making. Our intention was simply to dangle in front of Ministers a proposal that, as it would leave a power in the hands of Ministers, they might accept. Unfortunately, our offer is likely to be rejected.</p>

 I suspect that it might be rejected, but I was pleased to see that new clause 15 refers specifically to resources. My real concern is that powers and responsibilities are easy to hand down, but unfortunately the resources that should go with them never seem to make the full journey. What the Minister was saying was bizarre. She was saying that the Government have an excellent track record on pushing these responsibilities down to regional level and that they want to focus on getting councils to push responsibilities down to communities&#151;I do not have a problem with any of that. My problem is that the bit in the middle is missing: why can regional bodies not have a duty to push down responsibilities to the local authority level too? The Government&#146;s approach is strange and the thinking is certainly not joined up, particularly in respect of the group of provisions that we are dealing with today.</p>

RDAs still exercise a huge amount of reserve powers, and concerns have been raised about the number of decisions being taken by people who have not been elected and who have power over people who have been elected.

one narrow area that is being raised here, because there are much broader concerns about the priorities of RDAs and where their powers go back to&#151;ultimately they go back to the Secretary of State. I hope that we get the opportunity to return to this issue.</p>

 That is precisely the point, is it not? The title of the Bill is a misnomer. It is yet another Bill that should be entitled &#147;Interfering with local government&#148;, rather than having its title suggest that it is about local democracy. The hon. Member for Falmouth and Camborne (Julia Goldsworthy) was right to ask what the difference is between leaving the determination of a policy on toilets to local authorities and telling them how to deal with petitions, with informing people about councils and with many more important issues. That explains why I wish to speak to new clauses 16 and 15.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o182"><a name="91013-0010.htm_para9"><a name="09101354000050">New clause 16 deals with a general competence power, about which there has always been a debate. I recall serving on a national executive sub-committee in the 1980s and discussing what a new Labour Government would do for local democracy&#151;we were doing that because the huge rows about rate capping and the abolition of the county councils had taken place. My right hon. Friend the Member for Blackburn (Mr. Straw) was on the same working party. Many of us thought then that a general competence power should be given to local authorities&#151;I still think that&#151;but he came up with this stunning argument: if there were such a power, what would there be to prevent Islington from making an atom bomb? I do not know why he chose to use Islington in that absurd example, but if seriously intelligent and respected people such as he come out with absurd arguments such as that, there really is no argument against giving a general competence power to local authorities.</p>

I could give three quick examples that apply to my constituency. It is blighted by appalling private landlords, whom we have fought for a long time. We now have a scheme that regulates them, but because the Department does not like it we suffer terrific interference from the centre in the detail of the regulation. It is completely unnecessary because the scheme is beginning to work and the local authority should be left to decide the best areas for the scheme to operate in and how to implement it.</p>

He has done excellent work on the Commonwealth games in Manchester and I was a colleague of his on the Manchester ship canal. As a capitalist, he has put a great deal of effort into the community. On his appointment to the board, he said, &#147;We have to be the referee between local government and central Government.&#148; That is completely silly. He is an excellent man, but I think he was looking for justification for a job and position that have no justification. People who are elected do not need someone to referee between them and Government. As a leader of a council, I was quite capable of agreeing or disagreeing with the right hon. Member for Suffolk, Coastal (Mr. Gummer). That is the way it should be. Local government should speak directly to central Government, because both have a mandate from the people.

They are capricious policies that are damaging the economy of the north-west. That is a simplification&#151;in detail, it is worse.

They will do that much better than the present system does. However, while the present system exists, we need to tackle this pernicious loophole, which is, I understand, being exploited by councils in several parts of the country. It came to my attention as a result of a chain of events in my area.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o190"><a name="91013-0010.htm_para17"><a name="09101354000061">Luton and South Bedfordshire councils were obliged to meet the housing targets imposed on them within the Milton Keynes and South Midlands sub-regional spatial strategy. Initially, the councils designated as their preferred areas for development locations within their boundaries. Then, as occasionally happens, they met local resistance, but they discovered the loophole and decided that they would overcome that local resistance by proposing an area in my constituency&#151;as it happens, it is named Lilley Bottom and is one of the most beautiful features of my constituency&#151;as their preferred area for development, thereby escaping any retribution from their voters and leaving the voters in the threatened area powerless to oppose them.</p>

It seemed to me that she was saying that they were in some way meeting sub-regional spatial strategy housing targets. Certainly, the only reason that the councils are proposing to build in north Hertfordshire is that they believe it will help them to meet their housing targets. I shall look very closely at what she said, and if they are acting on a misapprehension I shall draw that to their attention and they will promptly stop. However, I fear that that is not the case.

I submit that we cannot have democracy without accountability. If one council can build in another council&#146;s area and therefore not be responsible to those affected by its action, that is a negation and denial of democracy.

If we consider what is happening in our area&#151;my constituency neighbours that of my right hon. Friend to the east&#151;we can see that good planning is not what is happening. The Government have said that they want Luton to expand and they also want Stevenage to expand. These towns are very close to one another. They are not big cities with great hinterlands or anything like that. If that is to happen&#151;although I think it is a grave mistake&#151;it has to be done in the most careful way.</p>

Why should it be able to do that, especially as no proper consultation has been undertaken? I spoke to the chief executive of North Hertfordshire district council about this only recently. The council has had to complain to Luton about the fact that it has not been involved in any sensible discussion. It is an example of terribly poor planning, and I therefore support new clause 1.</p>

In principle, therefore, I want the new clause to be accepted, but I am sorry that he did not take his argument one stage further.</p>

Our system does not allow a council in that position to benefit from that choice, and so such matters are not debated properly with local electorates.</p>

 I disagree fundamentally with my hon. Friend. First, when development does take place, the problem in our society is underdevelopment rather than overdevelopment. The most dense housing area in Britain is the Royal Crescent in Bath. Our problem is bad development, not overdevelopment or underdevelopment. Bath and Monte Carlo are two examples of places where people want to live, and both areas have been built in a dense way, but sensibly. When that happens, it is possible to meet the density requirements, but unfortunately we have not insisted on a quality standard for local development.</p>

I am fed up with people at the centre telling local authorities what is good for them. If local authorities are given powers, they will often make mistakes&#151;of course they will, but central Government usually do. In my experience, it is important to spread decision making around, as people who are close to decisions make fewer mistakes than those at the centre who always think that they know best.</p>

That is better than having a lot of faceless bureaucrats at regional or Government level who believe that they know how many seats there ought to be on a bus in Manchester&#151;a matter of supreme unimportance to them but of great importance to the people of Manchester.</p>

Member for Falmouth and Camborne (Julia Goldsworthy), I shall describe in a little more detail how the Bill will help to reinforce the duty on councils to consult. There are also mechanisms, such as petitions, whereby people can raise local issues. That goes to the heart of some of the debate on the role of central Government in setting strategic direction and on how we expect local councils to respond to issues raised by the community. I venture to suggest that the public toilet provision falls into the category of central Government trying to work with organisations and local authorities&#151;as in our strategic guide&#151;to say, &#147;This is how you can have good provision.&#148;</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o211"><a name="91013-0011.htm_para14"><a name="09101354000093">We have also issued further guidance on how to set up community toilet schemes.

On 13 January, Baroness Andrews, then a Minister, met representatives from the consortium on 13 January to discuss the progress of the campaign and investigate how we could help to highlight the consortium&#146;s work, building on the review of the British standard relating to the design of sanitary facilities to meet the needs of disabled people.</p>

Member for Wycombe (Mr. Goodman) about risk assessment in the context of mutual assurance. We undertook an assessment of risk as part of the impact assessment, which has been published today. The mutual will need to be authorised, supervised and regulated by the Financial Services Authority, like any other insurer. It will also need to operate in accordance with the FSA handbook and meet all FSA, Government, risk management and reporting requirements. I emphasise that these are enabling powers. Local authorities will need to ensure that any proposed arrangement meets the duty of best value and improved services for their communities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o224"><a name="91013-0011.htm_para27"><a name="09101356000016">From the work that I do in the Yorkshire and Humber region and the visits that I made around the country during the summer recess visiting the RDAs and local authorities and meeting a number of businesses, I know that the help and assistance given through regional development agencies has been invaluable in the economic circumstances that we face. It would be extremely unwise for the Opposition to destabilise the situation by indicating that if, by any unfortunate chance, they were elected, regional development agencies would be abolished. That would cause huge problems for businesses. I invite the right hon. Gentleman to have more discussions with representatives of businesses in his area.</p>

<p><a name="st_o187"><a name="09101356000017"><a name="91013-0011.htm_spnew11"><a name="09101356000051"><b>Mr. Gummer:</b>
 I have had those discussions, and business representatives are quite clear. They do not think that they have anything to do with Luton, and they want those powers to go back to the county council, because that is where they should be. Suffolk is one of the largest counties in Britain and has always run such matters very well. Why on earth do we have to think about places that are nothing to do with the region or any kind of regional development that affects us?</p>

 The more that the right hon. Gentleman denies the help that is going out there, the more worried local businesses will become about the idea that anybody is talking about the abolition of regional development agencies.</p>

 I always listen carefully to my right hon. Friend&#146;s argument, but that is the nonsense of it, is it not? The natural extension of what she is saying is that local authorities would not be able to use exactly the same money to help exactly the same businesses and exactly the same people. That is not the case. Local authorities could use that money at least as effectively.</p>

 And the whole point of the Bill is to enable multi-area agreements and economic prosperity boards, so that local authorities can work together, but in a regional context. That is why it is important to take forward the changes introduced through the sub-national review, which bring together RDA boards and leaders boards represented by local authorities to look at the overall strategy for the region. This has been incredibly important in looking at big strategic investment proposals. I know through my work as regional Minister, as do colleagues who are regional Ministers, that that is endorsed by business organisations and local businesses in our areas.</p>

 The whole point of the Bill is that it does what a number of authorities, including Conservative-led authorities, have asked us to do, which is to give a statutory underpinning to measures such as multi-area agreements. They allow councils to co-operate, and councils have been asking for that power. The Under-Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government, my hon. Friend the Member for Dudley, North and I signed with local authorities in the west midlands an agreement that has all-party support and does exactly what I am talking about&#151;it allows local authorities to work together.

that is why the National Association of Local Councils came to me to seek to clarify the issue of parish polls. The very reason why we are in this place is to pursue democracy in all its forms, and there is no more democratic a form than what those of us who have been involved in it for a long time would refer to as the first level of representative government, never the lowest. I have been, and still am, proud to represent my community, even if I make it to fewer meetings than I used to. I think that fellow attendees are more grateful for that than I am, but, when I do get to such meetings, they always seem to take twice as long, as one would expect with me. However, I shall not take up a great deal of time now; I shall move on and look at the arguments.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o239"><a name="91013-0012.htm_para14"><a name="09101356000042">The problem with parish polls is that they are subject to abuse. The most recent and well known case is the parish&#151;my memory deceives me, but I believe that it was in either Wiltshire or Hampshire&#151;that decided to call a poll on the Lisbon treaty. As a staunch opponent of the treaty, I might say that that decision was absolutely right and that where that parish went yesterday, perhaps Parliament and the country should go tomorrow. However, I think that I would be quickly ruled out of order, so I shall say only that, as much as I sympathise, the debate was not appropriate at parish level. The great thing about parish polls is that they can be both divisive and, more particularly, very expensive.</p>
<a name="ordayhd_14"><a name="91013-0012.htm_ordayhd0"><a name="09101356000048"><h5 align="left">6.45 pm</h5>
<p><a name="stpa_o240"><a name="91013-0012.htm_para15"><a name="09101356000043">The real issue is that parish polls are an important element of the way in which parishes function, but the power to call a poll has not been amended for a long period. I could wax lyrical about what would happen if every parish were to carry out a poll on an issue of great importance to them, but polls are not used widely. When they are used, however, they can be abused, so my new clause asks the Government to update an old-fashioned approach. The new clause refers to section 9 of the Local Government Act 1972, which allows a parish poll to be proposed at a parish meeting. The problem is that such parish meetings can involve a very small number of people, so the new clause would increase the number of people and the seriousness that determines when such an issue should be progressed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o241"><a name="91013-0012.htm_para16"><a name="09101356000044">It is easy to say, &#147;Why would you retain the power within the chairman of the parish?&#148; The fact is that that is how the law is constituted, and I intend not to rewrite the law completely, but to update it. That is the essence of my new clause. I would like to go further, because the conduct of parish polls is another issue, and I shall ask the Minister to respond to that point. Polls are limited to the hours between 4 pm and 9 pm, and, if a parish poll is held at the same time as a local government election, it seems rather silly for them not to keep the same hours. If the Government want to look into that issue, they could find a way to introduce similar times for elections and polls. If they take place at different times, we should limit the time for a parish poll. I have not moved such a proposal, but it should be dealt with if we update this vital part of our democracy. The poll&#146;s use is limited. Indeed, I am in a sense trying to limit it further, so that we use polls for their intended purpose, because they have been abused by people who have tried to bring before the parish a completely irrelevant issue as a way of publicising some other issue.</p>

I remind her that there are many more parish councillors than anything else&#151;there are 80,000 of us. If she wants to curry favour with all those wonderful people, she should accept my new clause.</p>

 I shall be very brief, Mr. Deputy Speaker, because I believe that I am able to speak not to the other new clauses and amendments in this group, but simply to new clause 2 alone. That is correct, is it not?</p>

 In which case, I shall begin by responding to the hon. Member for Stroud (Mr. Drew) and new clause 2. In essence, he said that he wanted to update what happens at such polls in order to discourage any frivolous debate or vote. When wanting to update a proposal it is always worth asking the Minister about the law of unexpected consequences to see whether there would be any side-effect that could somehow result in ensuring that such legitimate debate does not take place. That is the reassurance that we would look for, as would the whole House, with regard to new clause 2.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o243"><a name="91013-0012.htm_para18"><a name="09101366000012">We have not yet had a chance to hear the case that the hon. Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, Central (Jim Cousins) will make on new clause 4. I want to listen to that carefully. We have received representations presenting the proposal that he wants to advocate as an equality issue. We will want to be sure that on the other side of the balance there is no question of unnecessarily restricting without very good cause what an independent body can do. I therefore look forward to hearing his remarks&#151;almost as much as those of the hon. Member for Thurrock (Andrew Mackinlay) on local authority areas, and those of the hon. Member for Manchester, Blackley (Graham Stringer), who I thought at one point would serve on the Committee. Sadly, that did not happen; I do not know whether that was connected with the Government Whips.</p>

We have already been able to touch on some of the main themes that we explored in Committee, one of which is very simple. We do not see why it is necessary to write on to the statute book things that any decent local authority should be doing anyway&#151;promoting democracy, responding to petitions, and securing the involvement of people in their local area. That seems likely to bring about the very opposite of the result that Ministers claim. We believe that the Government&#146;s mission, whereby everything and everyone must be micro-managed by Ministers and officials from Westminster and Whitehall, serves only to depress local government turnout and to demoralise local councillors. In Committee, we could scarcely find one person on the Government Benches other than the Minister who would defend in principle those three aspects of the Bill. The right hon. Member for Greenwich and Woolwich (Mr. Raynsford) is not here, so I will not embarrass him by quoting directly what he said on  <br>

However, in July, just after the Bill came out of Committee, they took the notable decision to publish a consultation paper called &#147;Strengthening local democracy&#148;, which announced:</p>
<a name="91013-0012.htm_brev0"><a name="09101366001150"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;This consultation explores whether local government has the powers it needs to meet today&#146;s challenges...It sets out a range of proposals to promote local democratic renewal.&#148;</p>

It might have been better had consultation on these matters preceded the Bill instead of the Government&#146;s having yet another consultation right in the middle of the Bill&#146;s going through the House&#151;hence our amendments, which I hope the Minister will take in a spirit of due gratitude. They seek to give the Government time to look at the results of the consultation, which is not yet complete, and to consider whether Ministers want to amend any part of the Bill in the light of its findings. Then, after the election victory for the Minister&#146;s party that I know she is anticipating, she will have time to consider what the consultation has said and to produce any changes that she wants to produce by 1 July next year. We will be interested to hear her response to this moderate suggestion, which seeks not to obviate the provisions but to give her time to consider them in the light of the consultation that her own Department has issued.</p>

Member for Falmouth and Camborne (Julia Goldsworthy). This morning, I conducted an experiment by going to every Government Department website and punching in the word &#147;petitions&#148; to see what was the response. Only in a very few cases&#151;the Downing street website is one exception to the rule; the Department for Communities and Local Government may be another&#151;is there any indication that the Department is organising a response to the petitions that it receives. Surely, before laying down this duty on local authorities, the Government should put their own house in order so that when one types &#147;petitions&#148; into the website of the Foreign Office or the Ministry of Justice one is not referred to petitions that apparently have nothing to do with what that Department does.</p>

 I understand the hon. Gentleman&#146;s going through the failure of all Departments to address this issue. However, the consultation specifically refers to regional bodies. I am sure that a lot of people would be frustrated to find that the petition of 30,000 signatories against the south-west regional spatial strategy has had no formal response. Should not the Government have considered that whole process and could they not have dealt with it without the need for any legislation?</p>

<p><a name="st_o202"><a name="09101366000022"><a name="91013-0013.htm_spnew1"><a name="09101366001171"><b>Mr. Goodman:</b>
 The hon. Lady makes a perfectly valid point and reminds me not to go through all the Departments&#146; responses, which would take up a great deal of time. However, it is remarkable that if one types the word &#147;petitions&#148; into the website of, say, the Ministry of Justice, which must receive petitions, all one gets is references on to company windings-up and bankruptcy petition statistics, not a response from the Department itself.</p>

In Committee, we argued that most right hon. and hon. Members will have known of cases involving a complaint about a councillor to the Standards Board where that councillor may not have known the name of the person bringing the charges against them. Such situations are clearly unjust and have an effect on the willingness of new councillors to stand and of old councillors to remain.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o253"><a name="91013-0013.htm_para3"><a name="09101366000024">In her interesting response to the debate in Committee, the Minister conceded a great deal of our case by emphasising that the conduct regime was devolved last year and saying that the board&#146;s role has changed to that of a strategic regulator providing local authorities with the tools, training and guidance that they need to reinforce the often robust conduct regime in local authorities. I put it to you, Mr. Deputy Speaker, and to the House that if phrases such as &#147;strategic regulator&#148; are hurled around into the atmosphere, one must examine them very carefully.</p>

After all, if it is guidance that local authorities need, the Local Government Association can provide that, as my right hon. Friend the Member for Skipton and Ripon (Mr. Curry) said at one point in Committee. If financial impropriety is the problem, the local government ombudsman is there to investigate it as district auditor. If there is a case of libel or slander, that is covered by the civil law, and breaches of the criminal law are of course eligible to be investigated and prosecuted by the police, the Crown Prosecution Service and the courts. Everyone is casting around for a reason why the Standards Board should be in place, but there really does not seem to be any substantial reason on offer. As we say in our paper &#147;Control Shift&#148;, the Standards Board should be abolished. If the Minister does not commit tonight to doing so, that is the commitment that we have made if we are elected to Government.</p>

evidence, the Minister or the right hon. Member for Greenwich and Woolwich would have produced it. The second was that it is hard to find a comprehensive figure for how much it costs. The Lyons review, using an estimate prepared by the National Audit Office, not a figure that the Department has produced, estimated the cost at &#163;2 billion. Michael Frater, the original head of the Lifting the Burdens Task Force, said that 80 per cent. of the costs were those of reporting to central Government, rather than to the local communities that councils are there to serve.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o256"><a name="91013-0013.htm_para6"><a name="09101366000027">In her response in Committee, the Minister did not claim that the regime was working in the sense of producing any kind of tangible result.

 I wish to speak to new clauses 10 and 11. As we discussed in the previous debate, the Bill is in a very real sense a lost opportunity to deal with the relationship between local, regional and central Government and to allow local government to deal with many of the problems that it faces. It surprises me, given that the Bill deals with petitions and consultations, some of which I believe are best left to local choice, that it misses out a matter that has become increasingly demanded by local people when there are difficult issues: the regulation of referendums.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o257"><a name="91013-0013.htm_para7"><a name="09101366000029">Referendums are difficult matters. It is difficult to know where they should begin and end in a democracy that, at both local and national level, has been predominantly representative for its whole history. In parts of the world, referendums have been used by extreme right-wing Governments. They have been used to death in California so that local or state democracy fails to work, because referendums can come to opposite conclusions. They can both reduce expenditure and increase the demands on it at the same time. They are therefore particularly difficult issues.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o258"><a name="91013-0013.htm_para8"><a name="09101366000030">What is clear, however, is that all parties have now accepted referendums in principle. All three parties had in their manifesto a commitment to a referendum on the Lisbon treaty, or the European constitution as it then was. My party had in its 1997 manifesto a commitment to referendums on devolution, which it carried through with a positive result. There was also a commitment to referendums on elected mayors, which have been used in a number of districts, and there have been referendums on a regional assembly in the north-east and congestion charges in Edinburgh and Manchester.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o259"><a name="91013-0013.htm_para9"><a name="09101366000031">Although I start from a moderately sceptical point of view on referendums, having participated in the debates on both regional assemblies and the congestion charge in Manchester, it seems to me that done properly, they can involve a lot of people and bring about an outcome that people accept, whichever way it goes. At some times and in some areas, referendums are the right path to take. How strange, when we have had all that experience of them, that there is not a specific responsibility in local government Acts to allow them to take place and to regulate them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o260"><a name="91013-0013.htm_para10"><a name="09101366000032">When the congestion charge referendum was agreed to in Manchester, it was not clear whether it would be held under section 45 of the Local Government Act 2000,  <br>

section 116 of the Local Government Act 2003 or section 170 of the Transport Act 2000, all of which were introduced for different reasons but were not satisfactory. Although it was called a referendum and everybody recognised it as such, it was not technically a referendum within the legal meaning. That meant that the promoters of both the congestion charge itself and the referendum were one and the same person, which is not satisfactory. Although that experience turned out to have no bad consequences, it was wrong in principle, and it is the reason why I have tabled the new clauses. I shall not press them, but I am interested to hear what my right hon. Friend the Minister says in response.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o261"><a name="91013-0013.htm_para11"><a name="09101366000033">What happened in Manchester, apart from the fact that people made it clear that they did not want the congestion charge, was that the promoters of the scheme appointed the person who ran the referendum. He was given an office in Manchester town hall next to the people who had done the detailed work on the congestion charge and the transport innovation fund bid. During that period, he accepted undisclosed hospitality from the promoters of the scheme. When I put in a request, I found that that was not part of the declared expenses.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o262"><a name="91013-0013.htm_para12"><a name="09101366000034">When it came to determining the question to be put on the form, the only people who were talked to were the promoters of the scheme. Most bizarrely, although again with no actual consequences, when it came to the result of the referendum on the congestion charge the only people allowed to speak were the losers, the promoters of the scheme. Those of us who had been on the other side were not allowed to speak. It was as though there had been an election for a Member of this House and the only person allowed to speak was the loser. It was the most extraordinary circumstance.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o263"><a name="91013-0013.htm_para13"><a name="09101366000035">In that particular case, the issues involved and the bias of the returning officer were so clear that they probably helped the no campaign, but it would not always be that way. In a much closer referendum, a biased returning officer, such as the one we had in Manchester, could affect the result. I therefore think that when there is an increasing appetite in our democracy for referendums on difficult issues, the Government need to find the right space in the legislative programme to regulate them, first so that people can ask for them and, secondly, so that there is a clear framework so that people cannot try to fiddle the system. I will be very interested in my right hon. Friend&#146;s response to that point.</p>

We should have had an opportunity to remove hurdles in primary legislation, including unintended hurdles, that are effectively blocking the effective function of local democracy. The Bill should have been an opportunity for a bottom-up process, whereby the blocks could have been presented to the Government, who could then have addressed them.

concern was that referendums could be hijacked and that they could be irrelevant.

They do not just want to know that their local council is as good as any other at delivering a service; they want to know that it is good in absolute terms.

<p><a name="stpa_o274"><a name="91013-0013.htm_para24"><a name="09101366000050">It is important to explain that I am not talking about honorary freemen. They are a common part of the work of every local authority, and we are entirely familiar with their situation. Nor am I talking about the statutory position of freemen of the City of London, which is excluded in the proposed new clause.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o275"><a name="91013-0013.htm_para25"><a name="09101366000051">The Municipal Corporations Act 1835 swept away the historic position of freemen who, through the guilds, had been the original governors of local communities up and down the country. In a significant number of places, freemen continued to exercise functions, usually charitable, whereby they used certain property and land for certain statutory purposes. That is the case in York, Chester, Coventry, Northampton, Durham, Beverley, a number of other places and, most significantly from my point of view, the city of Newcastle.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o276"><a name="91013-0013.htm_para26"><a name="09101366000052">I can best explain the new clause and its importance with reference to the city of Newcastle, which has already been referred to today by the right hon. Member for Suffolk, Coastal (Mr. Gummer). I suspect hon. Members will be pleased that I am not going to accompany my references to Newcastle with references to John Lewis&#151;a splendid store of which perhaps all in this House have learned rather too much in the recent past.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o277"><a name="91013-0013.htm_para27"><a name="09101366000053">The freemen of the city of Newcastle continued to exercise functions after the 1835 Act. Their responsibility was to safeguard the Newcastle town moor and to use the benefits of grazing cattle on it for the benefit of the poor citizens of the city. The town moor therefore survived in a way that it probably would not have survived if it had simply been left in the hands of the council of the day. If that had happened, the moor probably would have been physically developed, but it has not. The moor remains, at the heart of the city of Newcastle, an area of open space that is protected by the right of the freemen of the city to graze their cattle. Importantly, the freemen do not control the freehold rights over the moor; they control only the right of herbage, but that safeguards the use of the land.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o278"><a name="91013-0013.htm_para28"><a name="09101366000054">I can best explain the significance of this by saying that over the years the freemen have supplemented the income that they get from the grazing of cattle by allowing areas of town moor to be taken in for certain specific purposes. For instance, Newcastle United football club is one of the town moor intakes. The club is almost unique among city football clubs these days in being in the centre of the city. It exists because the freemen of the day agreed that the football club could use that land. If successive owners of the football club had been careful enough about due diligence, they would have discovered that it does not own the freehold of the land on which it stands. It is allowed to exercise its functions because the freemen of the city have agreed that it may do so. A small fee is paid to the freemen of the city each year by the football club to recognise the fact that the freemen choose not to exercise their right to graze their cattle on the football ground. Over recent years, that point has been the subject of many ironic references by my constituents. The fee tops up the income of the freemen and enables them to exercise their charitable functions. The same applies in other areas where the stewardship of the freemen survives, including York, Beverly and Chester.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o279"><a name="91013-0013.htm_para29"><a name="09101366000055">In Newcastle, because of the large area of land in the city centre and the intakes, the system is of great significance to the people of the area. But the only people who can become freemen are the sons of the freemen, who have a right of hereditary succession. I am no great defender of the right of hereditary succession, but it is anomalous that only sons, and not daughters, may exercise the right to become freemen. That anomaly is gradually undermining the freemen system, because it depends on the male line, and if that dies out there is no replacement and it becomes an ever more limited group. New clause 4 would confer a right on daughters to become freemen, alongside sons.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o280"><a name="91013-0013.htm_para30"><a name="09101366000056">I accept the point made by the hon. Member for Wycombe (Mr. Goodman) that this is an issue of equality, and this is the right time to put it right. I have for some years, in various ways, attempted to do that with the support of the stewards of the freemen of Newcastle. I have been given assurances that the Government would give this issue a fair wind or would deal with it in various pieces of legislation. Sadly, that has not been possible. With the help of Lord Graham of Edmonton, I have attempted to introduce legislation to correct this anomaly, but without success. I hope that today, at a time when the House is taking equality issues seriously, we can put right this anomaly and allow daughters of freemen, as well as sons, to exercise this important aspect of our constitutional heritage reflected by freemen in those areas where they continue to exist. So far as the city of Newcastle is concerned, we would then know that the future of the town moor would be safe in the hands of a significant body of people who will protect it and its heritage in the interests and for the benefit of the citizens of the city as a whole.</p>

 The hon. Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, Central (Jim Cousins) should be thankful for small mercies: at least the freemen of the city of Newcastle are not dependent on the Rural Payments Agency to support the cattle grazing on the common. If he had ever dealt with the paperwork necessary to sort out such payments, he would settle for what he has. I note that his football team is top of the Championship, so we all live in hope.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o281"><a name="91013-0014.htm_para0"><a name="09101366000058">I wish to reflect on the remarks on referendums made by the hon. Member for Manchester, Blackley (Graham Stringer) and to agree with what he said. This Bill is like a gigantic ice cream cone: there are a few tasty things at the top, a thin framework and nothing in the middle. Instead of all this nonsense about petitions&#151;90 per cent. of this Bill could be disposed of without any loss&#151;we should put in something of substance and actually give local people a voice in some of these decisions. The hon. Gentleman listed the areas in which referendums had been held&#151;on congestion charging, devolution, an assembly in the north-east and elected mayors. There are other examples of what might be called mini-referendums. For example, the only ever vote on the future of grammar schools was held in Ripon, although the previous Prime Minister rigged the electorate to ensure that the vote was &#147;No&#148;. It could be said that housing transfers are still subject to vote by the tenants, so in a sense that is a referendum. Occasionally, councils have also consulted on options for the level of council tax, so the referendum idea has a good pedigree.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o282"><a name="91013-0014.htm_para1"><a name="09101366000059">I am passionately hostile to referendums at the national level. Such referendums are the nearest thing to a political landfill tip&#151;everybody dumps into it all the rubbish they cannot sort out in any other manner. However, local referendums are much more specific. People cram into school halls if the council proposes closing a school or is considering a house building proposal. If people are really concerned, they will seek to have a say, but at the moment the means that they have for expressing their opinion are too limited. There is therefore a good case for saying that, in specific circumstances in which the question can be closely defined, people should be genuinely empowered to decide&#151;in contrast to the froth of phoney empowerment in the Bill.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o283"><a name="91013-0014.htm_para2"><a name="09101366000060">The hon. Gentleman said that he would not press the issue to a vote, and I respect that, but I hope that this and future Administrations will revisit it so that we can clarify what we mean by &#147;decentralisation&#148; and &#147;localism&#148;. Very few people have any idea what is meant by those concepts. The best instrument of empowerment is to give people a vote on specific issues that affect their lives, and we should make that option much more available.</p>

new-fangled cabinet system, but you cannot reach your decisions by a series of committees, unless you are a local authority below a population of about 85,000.&#148; There is neither logic nor fairness in Parliament telling councils that they cannot make their decisions in a particular way. That way had endured for 100, and perhaps even 200, years&#151;certainly since the great local government legislation of 1888 and 1889&#151;and still endures in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland, where councils can so choose how they reach their decisions. If the House is mindful to support my new clause, it will not be saying to councils, &#147;You will do your deliberations in this way,&#148; but &#147;You may&#148;&#151;I repeat &#147;may&#148;&#151;&#147;decide to do your business in this way.&#148;</p>

 I would like to say how much I agree with the hon. Gentleman.

 Bob Thomas! He was the prime minister of Manchester. He was the big man of Manchester, and people deferred to him. The chairpersons of the committees of Manchester city council had a quasi-ministerial&#151;cabinet, as we now call it&#151;role. Nevertheless, there was some decision sharing. Some councils were without a particularly strong party political tradition, with residents, independents and a smattering of people representing political parties serving on them. A committee system certainly worked in those instances.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o288"><a name="91013-0014.htm_para7"><a name="09101366000070">I draw upon my experience as a young man, as a local government officer working for Surrey county council, where I observed, and served, the committee system as a committee clerk.

conservative tradition, they readily accommodated the few Labour, Liberal and independent members in the decision-making process. There was a degree of contentment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o289"><a name="91013-0014.htm_para8"><a name="09101366000071">I have further relevant experience from my time as a minority council member in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames. I look back, even now, and remember occasions when I was able to persuade, in committee, the Conservative majority about the prudence of a particular course, decision or project. I would not have achieved those successes had there been this hard-and-fast, miniature mirroring of proceedings in Westminster. I have concluded that Westminster proceedings are very sterile and synthetic. Day after day, Members stick their tongues out&#151;basically&#151;at those on the other side of the House. There is no mature decision making. The committee system in local government gave and promoted a degree of collegiality, and gave people with a particularly good case the opportunity to advance it and persuade others, despite party politics. Frankly, that brought with it better decision making. I would like that option to be restored to local government.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o290"><a name="91013-0014.htm_para9"><a name="09101366000072">The cabinet system, which councils are now basically obliged to follow, unless they go through the tortuous process of a referendum on a directly elected mayor, is unhealthy. It has all the chemistry for arbitrary decision making and government. It also means&#151;much more so even than in this House, where it is bad enough&#151;that if someone is not a member of the so-called cabinet, they are an also-ran; they are not on the inside. It has always surprised me that we pay councillors lots of money to attend meetings at which fewer decisions are taken. There is less of a feeling of ownership and commitment, and of that natural progression by which people can gain experience, become municipal fathers and mothers and emulate Bob Thomas and others such as Jeremy Beecham, who I think had a distinguished period in Newcastle. No doubt those on the Conservative and Liberal Benches can think of their own distinguished municipal leaders.</p>

Gentleman&#146;s proposal works equally well in the more modern world, where party political groups are likely to predominate in councils, because the most important thing is the role of the average councillor.</p>

Not only do they not have a proper role in the decision making of the authority to which they were elected with equal strength to those who do, but they do not even have the same ability to hold the administration&#151;the executive&#151;to account for the people whom they represent in their wards and divisions, because we all know that the officers do not take them as seriously if they do not have executive power and are not members of the cabinet. I have known councillors who cannot even get information out of their council, but surely a councillor should have a privileged position and expect to see the business of the council, if necessary on terms of privacy, if it relates to individuals or sensitive matters.</p>

If they are powerful speakers, if they feel passionately about something, if they have a good case or if they are on the popular side, they will have the joy of knowing that they will help to form the group proposal.

I thought that I was doing the right thing, but it was a lot stronger if I could take it to those in the group and persuade them, because then I knew that they would vote for it willingly, unlike under the current system, where things are worked out in private, often on the advice of the officers and without a lot of political sense involved. Then things have to be driven through against the unwillingness and the voting patterns of the majority councillors, with all sorts of arm twisting of the kind that people sometimes experience even in this place, in a way that gets in the way of good government and common sense.</p>

Of course we need a Cabinet&#151;we all understand the importance of Cabinet government&#151;but successful Cabinet Ministers in this place are Ministers who consult, consider and listen to colleagues before they go snap on a policy. Successful Cabinet Ministers not only understand their policy and know how to pilot it through this place, but are people who have tested it out in advance and do not think that everything has to be secret. Then they know that they have a constituency for change. I hope that we can vote on new clause 8 and free local government to have that option.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o301"><a name="91013-0014.htm_para20"><a name="09101366000087">The setting up of the executive is a bizarre concept in itself. Indeed, I can describe my last executive meeting. I sat there alone, the only member with a vote. First, I had to declare whether I had any interest. I welcomed the members of the public who had come along, said hello to the officers and then invited the two opposition spokesmen&#151;Conservative and Labour&#151;to sit at the table with me. I tried to bring them in, but at the end of the day, they could not have what they really wanted, which was to be able to move something or to vote on the issue. The situation is depressing. In the end, some of my meetings have lasted no more than five or 10 minutes. Why would they last any longer? Who do I talk to? Myself? Should I go through something with the officers that I have already gone through with them?</p>

My colleagues raised some very interesting points, which relates to the point made by the right hon. Member for Wokingham about his experience of trying to talk the thing through beforehand. The current system does not really allow that to happen, because the executive member is smothered by information. The executive member spends all their time trying to absorb the information given to them, but in the committee structure the information was shared. The committee chair, the vice-chair and the opposition spokesmen all felt that they would play a part and be able to move something.</p>

To deny local government the option to choose what is best for itself was the biggest mistake of all. If there were a vote today in the local authority that I represent in the city of Portsmouth, all 42 members would, without a shadow of doubt, vote unanimously for a return to the committee structure. Why? Because that would give a genuine sense of belonging. It would give the back benchers a chance to play a part, rather than being bit players in something in which many of them get involved only half a dozen times a year.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o304"><a name="91013-0014.htm_para23"><a name="09101366000090">The committee structure, with committees meeting monthly and in some instances more regularly, meant that back benchers could play a significant role. They built reputations because of their role on a committee. Somebody who was passionately interested in housing became one of the leading housing experts in the city of Portsmouth. They built a truly great reputation in local government, not through their ability to be the chairman of the housing authority, but through their ability to be an opposition member who became an expert and was listened to by those on all sides.</p>

for the service, but be honour-bound to listen to the wider group voice and the public as well. That is a horrendous task in local government. There is very little sharing of knowledge or ability, and it frustrates people. It is interesting to analyse how many people serve only one term on local authorities nowadays. They do not stay the course because they feel unfulfilled and let down by the concept, which they thought that they could bring something to. How inappropriate is it that good people who came into local government because they have something to offer are unable to deliver it? They leave very quickly for that reason. If I were the Government Minister responsible for this, I would cherish those people, cultivate them and make them think that they have a future in local government.</p>

We learned that we could contribute there, but we all contributed to a system in which committees played a part, and in which we became a junior member of a committee and then, with more expertise, moved on to become a committee chairman or an opposition spokesman. The system no longer works like that, however. Now, only a small group has control of the policy. Even that group&#151;unless it is exceptionally lucky&#151;does not have the ability to co-operate easily with the rest of the council. The opportunities are not there. Members do not want to meet every week as a full council, but many of them would love to meet once a fortnight or once a month as a committee to deal with important matters such as housing, social services and education.</p>

I hope that she will instead say, &#147;Okay, hands up, we made a mistake. Now we will try to get it right. We will give local authorities a chance.&#148; The hon.

 This group of amendments focuses on the local democracy section of the Bill, and we can tell from the lively nature of the debate just how passionately right hon. and hon. Members feel about the issue.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o310"><a name="91013-0015.htm_para5"><a name="09101366000099">Speaking of passion, I shall start with new clause 10, tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Manchester, Blackley (Graham Stringer), which deals with referendums. It is identical to an amendment that we debated in Committee. As I explained during that debate, the principal local authorities in England currently enjoy considerable flexibility to hold advisory referendums and local polls using their powers under section 116 of the Local Government Act 2003. That power is widely drawn, and it gives councils maximum freedom and flexibility to hold referendums on any issue relating to their functions or their powers of well-being, as set out in the Local Government Act 2000.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o311"><a name="91013-0015.htm_para6"><a name="09101366000100">The existing power to hold referendums has been used many times by councils to seek the views of their communities on matters of local interest. For example, the London borough of Sutton council is currently holding a local poll on whether to keep a piece of graffiti that was produced by a well-known graffiti artist. I am not sure whether the referendum on the Manchester congestion charge was held under that legislation, but my hon. Friend discussed that matter. The use of this power could increase as a result of the petitions clauses in this Bill. Through our proposed petition scheme in part 1 of the Bill, councils might well decide to hold a local poll as part of their substantive response, as required by clause 14, to a petition with the specified number of signatures. We would welcome such a development as an appropriate means of involving local communities in a council&#146;s decision-making process. That is, of course, if councils choose to make greater use of the power as part of their response to petitions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o312"><a name="91013-0015.htm_para7"><a name="09101366000101">At the heart of these debates lies the issue of local democratically elected bodies having the power to choose whether they want to hold referendums. While the petitions provided for in chapter 2 of part 1 of the Bill, and the existing powers in section 116 of the Local Government Act 2003, permit councils to hold such referendums, the new clause would require them to set up a facility and agree a scheme for holding them.  <br>

Councils would also be required to hold a referendum in circumstances set out in their referendum schemes. The new clause would therefore impose an additional uncosted burden on councils. As I made clear in Committee, we believe that accepting the new clause as it stands would be a step too far.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o313"><a name="91013-0015.htm_para8"><a name="09101366000102">Yes, we require councils to carry out certain actions in relation to petitions, but we do not adopt the same approach to the holding of referendums. Some might say that that is contradictory, but I say that the two issues are very different. Our approach to petitions in chapter 2 rightly addresses the issues identified by the Local Government Association survey, which found that only 28 per cent. of the 102 councils that responded guarantee an automatic response to petitions submitted by the public.</p>

 Is the Minister saying that her only reason for objecting to the proposal is the possible cost implications for council tax payers, or is she going further than that?

 No, I did not say that; I said was that there were two reasons. The first is that councils have the power to hold referendums, if they choose to do so&#151;the new clause requires them to hold them. We have had a number of discussions about the fact that in some cases we place a duty on councils to do certain things, whereas in others we say that the councils may do so, if they want to. That was the first and major reason I gave for rejecting the new clause. The second reason is that the proposal is uncosted and would impose a new burden on councils, which would have to set up facilities to carry out the duty.</p>

What I am saying is that in the Government&#146;s view, without the necessary evidence, it would not be appropriate to impose another burden on local authorities. We are well aware of the wider debate about democratic renewal, and local referendums may well become part of it. If there are any issues about local polls, we want to hear about them in that context.</p>

part. People have a right to know how local government and other local public services are run and what decisions are taken on their behalf. They should also know how they can take part in making those decisions, including the possibility of becoming a councillor. Raising awareness is a necessity.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o317"><a name="91013-0015.htm_para12"><a name="09101366000108">We have taken the route of establishing a duty on councils based on solid evidence. There is a strong commitment to establishing councils as the hub for local democratic activity and to embedding the promotion of local democracy within their DNA. The duty addresses the lack of awareness of local democracy. As many of us know, a lack of awareness of councillors&#146; roles was identified by the Councillors Commission and others, including the deeply respected all-party parliamentary local government group. To illustrate the point, an Ipsos MORI survey for the Local Government Association showed that fewer than a third of people know even a fair amount about what their council does. That lack of awareness is certainly a major barrier to civil and civic participation, and it contributes to the lack of diversity among councillors and others with civic roles.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o318"><a name="91013-0015.htm_para13"><a name="09101366000109">We all know that we are not making the most of the potential talent among communities, including women, people from black and ethnic minority communities and people of working age, who are currently under-represented as councillors and in other civic roles. We want to ensure that people feel that local democracy is relevant to their everyday lives and that local authorities become the hub of local democracy. By doing so, local people will have a single, easily accessible port of call for information about how they can participate in decision-making at the local level, including as or through a councillor.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o319"><a name="91013-0015.htm_para14"><a name="09101366000110">We all agree about the importance of the aim behind those duties and the importance of raising awareness and of looking at the evidence for the fact that only 28 per cent. of councils guarantee an automatic response to petitions. We know that there is good evidence for requiring councils to respond to petitions and to publicise their petition schemes, which will help people to feel that they can influence local decisions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o320"><a name="91013-0015.htm_para15"><a name="09101366000111">If we all agree on the importance of these duties, how do we ensure that they are achieved? Do we really want the coercive and, might I suggest, distrustful approach proposed in the new clauses? We have to ask ourselves how that would be received by the local government sector. We need to trust local authorities to respond effectively and imaginatively to the new duties. The duties are subject to parliamentary scrutiny and have been imposed because Parliament recognises that these are activities that councils should add to their functions in order to make real improvements for local people.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o321"><a name="91013-0015.htm_para16"><a name="09101366000112">We intend to set money aside to enable councils to carry out the duties, and we will provide them with full support through guidance and a sector-led best-practice approach. There are already legal remedies for enforcement, but we do not rely on them to ensure compliance in this case any more than we do in relation to most other legal duties that apply to local authorities. There is no direct enforcement mechanism in the provisions, and we do not think it appropriate that there should be one. In conclusion, there is already an intention to ensure that local authorities involve people and to look at the petitions system, but as many hon. Members have said, we do not want a more coercive approach.</p>

Friend mentioned this&#151;an extension of the hours during which they can be held. We entirely agree that there should be robust and effective parish poll provisions, and I am grateful to my hon.

As he said, at the time when the changes were made, it was decided that local authorities with fewer than 85,000 electors could retain the committee structure to which he referred. As it happens, a fair number of the councils involved have moved on to the new system. I think it has been recognised that the executive arrangements have delivered more in terms of effective, transparent decision making and clearer accountability, and I think there is a general consensus that it represents a better approach.</p>

<p><a name="st_o232"><a name="09101366000128"><a name="91013-0016.htm_spnew0"><a name="09101366001201"><b>Ms Winterton:</b>
 What I am saying is that the new structures are well bedded in. We generally legislate in ways that accord with existing structures, and if we start to unwind that arrangement, complications will ensue.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o328"><a name="91013-0016.htm_para0"><a name="09101366000129">New clause 17 proposes abolition of the Standards Board for England and the Adjudication Panel for England, which are two important and effective bodies. If that were to happen, councillors and members of local authority standards committees who look to the Standards Board for advice, guidance, training and direction about the conduct regime for local authority members would be cut adrift.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o329"><a name="91013-0016.htm_para1"><a name="09101366000130">In 2008 we devolved the conduct regime for local authority members to local authorities, and in doing so we created a new role for the Standards Board for England. The board is still there to investigate the most serious allegations of misconduct by local authority members, but since 2008, when we devolved the conduct regime for local authority members to local authorities, it has also functioned in its new role as strategic regulator for local authority standards committees.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o330"><a name="91013-0016.htm_para2"><a name="09101366000131">The regime that we have introduced accords with the recommendations of the Committee on Standards in Public Life, including its recommendation for the establishment of a more locally based decision-making regime for the investigation and determination of all but the most serious misconduct allegations, but with the Standards Board at the centre of the revised regime with its new strategic, regulatory role to ensure the consistency of standards. If Conservative Members are challenging that, they are obviously challenging the recommendations of the Committee on Standards in Public Life, which recently approached the Standards Board for England for advice on how a successful, robust and transparent conduct regime should operate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o331"><a name="91013-0016.htm_para3"><a name="09101366000132">The Standards Board for England is now fully equipped to perform its new role. Legislation came into force this summer that allows the board to become directly involved with local authority standards committees if its scrutiny of the way in which the conduct regime is operating in an authority causes them concern, or if they are invited to do so by the authority itself. The board has restructured, and has shed staff. Its budget has fallen from just over &#163;8 million in 2008-2009 to &#163;7.4 million in 2009-2010, and it is planned for it to fall further in future years as ongoing efficiency savings are made.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o332"><a name="91013-0016.htm_para4"><a name="09101366000133">Today is the second day of the Standards Board for England's eighth annual assembly of standards committees&#151;<i> [Interruption.] </i>I think that I have sent them a video recording of my speeches, so that should cheer them up. More than 800 delegates, councillors, local authority monitoring officers and standards committee members are meeting in Birmingham to discuss all aspects of the conduct regime, to share best practice and to attend training and question and answer sessions. They will be discussing, among other things, the role of standards in parish councils&#151; I am sure that my hon. Friend the Member for Stroud (Mr. Drew) will be pleased to know that&#151;how to engage council leaders, embedding standards and how to communicate the standards regime to the public. They will also be discussing how standards regime practitioners can support councillors who serve on licensing and planning committees.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o333"><a name="91013-0016.htm_para5"><a name="09101366000134">The Adjudication Panel for England performs vital functions. It considers appeals made by councillors against the decisions of local authority standards  <br>


<meta name="Date" content="13 Oct 2009">

committees and makes decisions about the most serious breaches of the code of conduct, deciding what sanctions are appropriate in cases where a breach is found to have taken place. That is a serious obligation. Where a serious breach of the code of conduct is found to have occurred, the consequences are, rightly, serious, too. The Adjudication Panel for England has the power to ban a person from being a councillor for up to five years. It is right that it should have that power. Actions that result in a breach of the code such as bullying can have a profound effect on the victim of the actions that led to the breach. We consider it appropriate for a national body to have such powers, but we question the alternative, which is the abolition of the Adjudication Panel, giving a local authority standards committee the power to stop a person being a councillor in any other authority for up to five years.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o334"><a name="91013-0016.htm_para6"><a name="09101366000135">The vast majority of local authority members observe the high standards of behaviour that the electorate rightly expect of them, but we have seen that a robust conduct regime is essential to provide redress when the code of conduct is not observed. The Standards Board for England is needed not just to provide regulation for local authority standards committees that are enforcing the code of conduct, but to supply advice, support and training to local authority members to ensure that they work within the conduct regime. The abolition of the Standards Board and the Adjudication Panel would be a blow to high standards of conduct in the democratic process. Moreover, it would send a message that, far from building a fair, transparent and robust conduct regime, Parliament is intent on removing bodies whose purpose is to support the conduct regime.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o335"><a name="91013-0016.htm_para7"><a name="09101366000136">The amendments tabled by the hon. Members for Wycombe (Mr. Goodman), for Peterborough (Mr. Jackson) and for Ludlow (Mr. Dunne)&#151;amendments 24, 25 and 26&#151;seek to ensure that the duty to promote democracy, the petitions duty and the extension of the duty to involve, do not come into force until July 2011. I have listened carefully to the concerns that they have raised, a number of which were raised in Committee. I can confirm that no final decision has been taken about the commencement of these provisions. We have been working to ensure that everything is in place to allow the duty to be commenced at the earliest possible date, but we are keeping all options open at this point and are considering the best way forward in the wider context of the Government's work on strengthening local democracy, including responses to the consultation on the subject, which has just come to a close, and in light of the current economic climate. The amendments would limit our flexibility to decide the most appropriate time to commence these duties. However, let me be clear that, in order to keep all options open, including the option of bringing the provisions into force in April 2010, prompt action may need to be taken to allow the appropriate stages to be taken, such as issuing draft statutory guidance for consultation.</p>

 It sounds as though the Minister may have made a rather important announcement. Can she confirm that, in effect, she is withdrawing parts 1, 2 and 3 of the Bill? Can she remind the House whether there was a commencement date for those parts and whether she is proposing to alter that date if it was in the Bill?</p>

 The provision will be by order. We have said that we want to aim to bring in the provisions in 2010, but obviously we have not taken a final decision. We do not want to be restricted, as would happen under the hon. Gentleman's amendments.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o336"><a name="91013-0016.htm_para8"><a name="09101366000139">If I could turn finally&#151;[Hon. Members: &#147;Hooray.&#148;] Are you enjoying this? On new clause 4, I can certainly see how strongly my hon. Friend the Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, Central (Jim Cousins) feels about the issue. It did not escape my notice that the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasury, my right hon. Friend the Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, East and Wallsend (Mr. Brown), was present during his contribution, which shows what an important issue this is in the Newcastle area.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o337"><a name="91013-0016.htm_para9"><a name="09101366000140">I agree with my hon. Friend&#146;s central argument that women should be afforded the same rights as men, particularly in relation to freedoms granted for an area. He talked about the town moor in Newcastle. I happen to live on the town moor in Doncaster. Opposite we have the town fields, which are covered by similar provisions for freemen. People can take their sheep on there if they want. The Bill already makes provision allowing guilds to admit women.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o338"><a name="91013-0016.htm_para10"><a name="09101366000141">There is one other thing that I need to deal with. I will keep hon. Members in suspense on that one. Could someone find new clause 18? <i> [Interruption.] </i>As I was saying, the Bill makes provision allowing guilds to admit women. The provisions in clause 27 were inserted through an amendment tabled by Lord Graham.</p>

 May I invite the Minister to consider this point? The provision in the Bill does not confer a right other than if the freemen of that particular body choose to confer a right. New clause 4 confers the right untrammelled. There is no brokerage. The right is conferred directly to the daughters of freemen. It does not depend on the brokerage of another body to achieve that.</p>

<p><a name="st_o236"><a name="09101366000143"><a name="91013-0016.htm_spnew4"><a name="09101366001205"><b>Ms Winterton:</b>
 Yes. As I was saying, the provisions of clause 27 were inserted through an amendment tabled by Lord Graham and received cross-party support in the other place. We continue to believe that clause 27 strengthens the Bill by allowing admission rights to be changed more easily. Clause 27 provides for guilds to change their admission rights, including allowing women to become freewomen. However, my hon. Friend has put forward a powerful argument that it should not be discretionary, but that women should be afforded the same rights as men in such circumstances. Indeed, when accepting that the provisions of clause 27 should be inserted in the Bill, my noble Friend Baroness Andrews stated that we attach great importance to seeking equality between men and women and that</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o339"><a name="91013-0016.htm_para11"><a name="09101366000144">I can tell my hon. Friend the Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, Central that on that basis the Government support the inclusion of new clause 4 in the Bill. That is the good news. The bad news is that we cannot accept new clause 18 because it abolishes the comprehensive area assessment system, which is proving to be extremely successful and is generally recognised to be raising standards. However, we can certainly accept new clause 4,  <br>

 New clause 6 has a number of similarities with other amendments in this group, which raise concerns and questions about the proposals to extend the powers and remit of the regional development agencies. It goes back to the original remit of the RDAs, and highlights our concern that the economy will remain the key and most prominent driver of development, despite claims made in earlier debates on this Bill that the agencies&#146; role would be broadened to include wider sustainability issues.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o357"><a name="91013-0017.htm_para12"><a name="09101366000638">If the Government are serious about those claims, they need to go back and amend the original legislation outlining the powers and remit of the RDAs.</p>

 I agree, but unfortunately that is only the latest in a long line of disappointments on this issue. The Government like to talk a good game about wanting to give people real information about the public money being spent in this area, but they seem to try to prevent that debate at every opportunity. The result is that they do not have to deliver the commitment that they promised in earlier legislation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o358"><a name="91013-0017.htm_para13"><a name="09101366000641">I shall not spend long on the new clauses in this group, as I hope that we will have an opportunity to vote on them. The Government have the opportunity to address their tarnished reputation on sustainability&#151;an issue dear to my heart, as I have outlined already.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o359"><a name="91013-0017.htm_para14"><a name="09101366000642">New clause 13 would compel the Government to publish local spending reports. That is a cornerstone of engaging people in local democracy and decision making, because it gives them an opportunity to see how public money is being spent. When they know that, the next step is that they will want to have a say about where it could be better spent. The Government have not delivered spending reports in the way they promised when we debated the Sustainable Communities Act 2007.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o360"><a name="91013-0017.htm_para15"><a name="09101366000643">New clause 14 would make a series of improvements to the 2007 Act. It would ensure that people would have more than just a one-off opportunity&#151;it proposes a rolling programme that would allow communities to have a real say about the changes needed to make a real difference to their lives. In addition, the new clause would allow local authorities to submit proposals on a rolling basis and involve town and parish councils&#151;a serious omission from the 2007 Act.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o361"><a name="91013-0017.htm_para16"><a name="09101366000644">I hope that the Minister will address these issues of sustainability, for which there is a real need and appetite at local level. What amazed me the most about the 2007 Act was that it was a local campaign that turned into a legislative programme. If the Government are serious about involving people and re-engaging them in politics, these are the sort of provisions they should be supporting rather than trying to run away from.</p>

<p><a name="st_o244"><a name="09101366000645"><a name="91013-0017.htm_spnew5"><a name="09101366001679"><b>Mr. Stewart Jackson:</b>
 I too shall be brief. I concur with my right hon. Friend the Member for West Dorset (Mr. Letwin): it is a disgrace that the House should have been detained by the nonsense and ephemera of the Minister&#146;s 35-minute filibuster when there are important issues to discuss in respect of the Sustainable Communities Act 2007.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o362"><a name="91013-0017.htm_para17"><a name="09101366000646">I turn now to a subject to which far too little attention has been paid over the past few months and years&#151;the economic assessment of ports. It is totally appropriate for us to debate that subject now, albeit briefly.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o363"><a name="91013-0017.htm_para18"><a name="09101366000647">The Government&#146;s policy is that retrospective taxation should take place only when it is fair, proportionate, necessary to protect revenue and in the public interest. The tax on ports is a clear breach of those tests. When they introduced that retrospective tax, the Government disregarded their own rules. No impact assessment was made, no consultation exercise was carried out with those affected&#151;</p>

going against the policy of the Government. We may have gone over the issue, but we certainly have not resolved it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o364"><a name="91013-0017.htm_para19"><a name="09101366000650">The Government&#146;s policy also contravenes the Treasury&#146;s guidance on retrospective taxation. The Treasury Committee concluded that consideration should be given to the proposal to maintain the rating system in statutory docks and harbours at the levels published in the April 2005 rating lists until the new lists are published in April 2010. Those new taxes will hit the wider economy as a range of companies, such as those in the car and road haulage industries, are based in ports. The Prime Minister has failed to realise that his policies will lead to jobs being lost.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o365"><a name="91013-0017.htm_para20"><a name="09101366000651">As we have seen tonight, Ministers are in denial about the harmful effects of those unfair, retrospective taxes. For instance, GEFCO, Peugeot&#146;s and Citroen&#146;s main distributor in Britain, is being hit with a retrospective &#163;3 million rates bill. It makes a mockery of Lord Mandelson&#146;s claims that the Government are trying to help the car industry. Those taxes are a kick in the teeth for local firms in the depths of recession.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o366"><a name="91013-0017.htm_para21"><a name="09101366000652">The retrospective tax fiasco highlights the joint incompetence of the Valuation Office Agency and Ministers. It is resulting in firms being pushed into insolvency and needlessly laying off workers. Indeed, the Government were forced to accept the principle that the retrospective charges were undesirable in the Business Rate Supplements Act 2009, via Conservative amendments during the Bill&#146;s passage through the other place. Should that principle not have wider implications for business rates in general? The effect on business is acute. The Humber docks rating revaluation group estimates that 600 businesses could be affected. Some firms have already started to lay off workers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o367"><a name="91013-0017.htm_para22"><a name="09101366000653">I turn briefly to the comments of the Home Secretary, the right hon. Member for Kingston upon Hull, West and Hessle (Alan Johnson), who was quite happy to vote with his party but was keen locally to &#147;reopen&#148; the issue of retrospective bills, which are to hit port companies with a tax bill of more than &#163;200 million in Hull.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o368"><a name="91013-0017.htm_para23"><a name="09101366000654">The proposals are at the heart of economic assessment. The Government have done everything they can to fail to face the issue and debate it in the House in a proper and meaningful way, as the Minister for Housing knows full well. For the avoidance of doubt, Conservatives believe, and have said, that the current 2005 rating list system should remain in force for ports, and that any new system should be introduced only in the 2010-15 rating cycle, following appropriate consultation with industry with proper advance warning&#151;as has failed to take place thus far.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o369"><a name="91013-0017.htm_para24"><a name="09101366000655">On the basis of the case I have made this evening about the ports tax and the damage it will do to our industry and ports, I ask the House to support our amendment.</p>

<p><a name="st_o247"><a name="09101366000656"><a name="91013-0017.htm_spnew7"><a name="09101366001682"><b>Joan Walley:</b>
 Given my long-standing interest in the whole issue of sustainability, and the length of time I have sat here hoping for an opportunity to speak to the amendments, I want to impress on my right hon. Friend the importance of putting a definition of sustainable growth in the Bill&#151;an explicit reference to make sure that the regional strategies that the Government are now introducing include&#151;</p>

 I am very well aware of the interest my hon. Friend has shown in the issue&#151;as has my hon.

 I am most grateful. I look forward to an urgent meeting with great interest. I should like the Campaign to Protect Rural England to be involved as well. Like many voluntary organisations, the CPRE has impressed on us the importance of making sure that we do not repeat the mistakes that were made when the Government set up the regional development agencies without giving proper powers on environmental sustainability. Some RDAs have made a lot of progress, but if we are now to have regional strategies, it is really important that we get the guidance right. On that basis, I look forward to my right hon.

 I shall speak to amendment 3, tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Stroud (Mr. Drew). It is important to stress that the amendment would not reward nimbyism. Rather, it would facilitate the truly democratic sustainable development that the Government appear to seek, given the stirring title of the White Paper on which the Bill is partly based&#151;&#147;Communities in control: real people, real power&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o370"><a name="91013-0017.htm_para25"><a name="09101366000662">The amendment would require local authorities to conduct meaningful consultation with local communities, and would go some way to countering the cynicism with which many of our constituents regard the planning process at a local level, not to mention the decision-making process in local and central Government. I urge colleagues to support this progressive amendment, and I take the opportunity to move it&#151;</p>

I also thank the Exchequer Secretary to the Treasury, who was briefly a member of our Public Bill Committee and who dealt admirably with the clauses on construction.</p>

<notus-date day="13" month="10" year="2009" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><b>13 Oct 2009 : Column 261</b><br>

<p><a name="stpa_o390"><a name="91013-0019.htm_para10"><a name="0910143000978">This is an important Bill with two key aims. It is about strengthening local democracy and giving people a stronger voice in their communities, and it empowers local authorities and partners to promote economic recovery and growth. In the difficult economic times that we have faced in recent months, the role of local authorities, playing an important economic part in their local economies, has come to the fore. I am sure that all hon. Members agree that in many instances local authorities can work with local partners to give support to individuals and local businesses. Local authorities have worked to get immediate help out there&#151;I am thinking of the housing changes made by the Minister for Housing&#151;and have helped in planning for the future by looking at skills provision and local economic needs. That is why I believe that the Bill is so important, particularly in respect of the role that local authorities can play in promoting local economic development. The Bill gives local authorities and regional development agencies powerful tools with which to promote economic recovery.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o391"><a name="91013-0019.htm_para11"><a name="0910143000979">Other issues debated this evening stem from the review of sub-national economic development and regeneration, where the Minister for Housing again made such a vital contribution. Local authorities can work together to promote economic development in the regional context, which is incredibly important.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o392"><a name="91013-0019.htm_para12"><a name="0910143000980">I repeat that Conservative Members want to dismantle many of the structures put in place to deliver real help during difficult economic times, which is the completely wrong approach. In my experience&#151;not only as Minister for Regional Economic Development and Co-ordination, but as regional Minister for Yorkshire and the Humber&#151;individuals and businesses appreciate the help given and want local authorities and regional development agencies, working with the new leaders board, to play a greater, not lesser, role.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o393"><a name="91013-0019.htm_para13"><a name="0910143000981">I commend the Bill to the House. It has been well scrutinised and it makes some key changes, which we should all be pleased to welcome in respect of economic development and strengthening local democracy.</p>

 I want to record our thanks to all those who have devoted so many hours to debating the Bill, but it also falls to me to point out to the Secretary of State, who has kindly graced us with his presence for the final 10 minutes of the debate, that the Minister for Regional Economic Development and Co-ordination undoubtedly shouldered most of the load, and I commend her on that. However, although she announced to the House that she was thoroughly enjoying doing it&#151;at length&#151;I have to say that, at certain points, some of us found the experience less than enjoyable.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o394"><a name="91013-0019.htm_para14"><a name="0910143000983">I particularly thank Lord Bates of Langbaurgh, who shouldered the load for us in another place, and my hon. Friends the Members for Peterborough (Mr. Jackson) and for Wycombe (Mr. Goodman), who led for us so admirably from the Front Bench on this lengthy Bill. I think it right also to record the contributions to the Committee stage of experienced former Ministers&#151;my right hon. Friends the Members for Hitchin and Harpenden (Mr. Lilley) and for Skipton and Ripon (Mr. Curry)&#151;as well as the valuable role played by my hon. Friend the Member for Ludlow (Mr. Dunne).</p>

<notus-date day="13" month="10" year="2009" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><b>13 Oct 2009 : Column 262</b><br>

<p><a name="stpa_o395"><a name="91013-0019.htm_para15"><a name="0910143000985">It is disappointing that, as a result of lengthy discussions on earlier amendments, we failed to reach what is probably the most important clause in the Bill&#151;the one that enables planning powers to reside in the hands of unelected and unaccountable officials in the regional development agencies. My strong objection to the Bill throughout has been that removing powers from the hands of democratically elected representatives and placing them in the hands of bureaucrats and quangos is fundamentally undemocratic and at odds with the very title of the Bill. If the Bill had any pretence to living up to its description as a local democracy Bill, it would scrap regional planning and return those powers to local government, where they truly belong.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o396"><a name="91013-0019.htm_para16"><a name="0910143000986">However, it is not just the centralising nature of the Bill that is so at odds with public demand. The powers are being transferred to RDAs at a time when we are experiencing one of the worst recessions that have been seen so far. We shall have to use every weapon in our arsenal in competing with other countries to pull ourselves out of recession. Is it not folly of the first order to divert RDAs from their original purpose of dealing with planning and house building at this time?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o397"><a name="91013-0019.htm_para17"><a name="0910143000987">The Bill contains a rag-bag of measures. I think it right, in his absence, to record that it was the hon. Member for Thurrock (Andrew Mackinlay) who described it as nonsense. At least he put his money where his mouth was this evening by tabling an amendment that garnered considerable support. It might have brought a bit more sense to a Bill which is indeed, in large part, nonsense. So much of it is either duplication or plainly unnecessary. I must ask the Minister whether she understands that the things that she is pressing local authorities to do by means of statute are things that they have been doing for years as a matter of course. For example, the requirement to promote democracy is part of the essence of what a local authority does most of the time.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o398"><a name="91013-0019.htm_para18"><a name="0910143000988">The Bill emerged to fill a vacuum in legislation after the &#147;Communities in Control&#148; Bill was quietly dropped by the Government. It bears all the hallmarks of legislation that has been scratched together in the absence of any real direction or leadership. It is a landmark in missed opportunities. People are crying out for their elected local representatives to have real power over decision making, but the Bill provides for the opposite. It is prescriptive where it should simply be permissive, and it codifies in tiny detail matters that are best left for councils to decide.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o399"><a name="91013-0019.htm_para19"><a name="0910143000989">Where is the action to help people who are struggling to pay their council tax bills, and businesses that are struggling to stay afloat and facing an onslaught of tax increases? Where is the route map for getting more homes built? We want to stimulate house building, but nothing in the Bill will achieve that. In fact, the Bill does nothing to address any of the most pressing issues that people face. It shows more than ever the extent to which the Government have simply run out of road. When our country is crying out for bold and radical change, all Ministers offer is more of the same.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o400"><a name="91013-0019.htm_para20"><a name="0910143000990">It is not the place of anyone in the House to predict the outcome of the next election. Nor should a new Government seek to scrap every piece of legislation put through the Commons by the previous one. None the less, we have made it crystal clear from the start that the Bill is fundamentally flawed. Therefore, today I am  <br>

putting local authorities on notice that, if elected, we will take remedial action by scrapping large parts of the Bill and all the other bureaucratic burdens that write on to the statute book what local authorities already do in any event. We are also going to abolish the entire regional strategy chapter of the Bill. Whether we get that opportunity is a matter for the electorate and can never be taken for granted, but the Bill, almost more than any other, painfully demonstrates that the electorate need to be given the opportunity sooner rather than later.</p>

 I shall keep my remarks fairly brief. I have had the privilege, in the brief time that I have been in the House during this Parliament, to serve on a number of Public Bill Committees. On those occasions, I may not have agreed with what was happening when we reached Third Reading, but at least there was a feeling that something would change the world in some way.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o401"><a name="91013-0020.htm_para0"><a name="0910143000992">We have reached Third Reading with this Bill. We have devoted a lot of time to debating it, and we have attempted to improve it and to give it some meaning. Even this evening, there have been a few last-ditch attempts to do that. What we have ended up with is nonsense, as the hon. Member for Thurrock (Andrew Mackinlay) has said. The Bill will not offer anything at all, when people need support. They need some of the control that central Government have put on local government&#151;the previous Government as well as the current one&#151;to be released to allow local authorities to come up with solutions that are appropriate to their areas.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o402"><a name="91013-0020.htm_para1"><a name="0910143000993">The Bill does nothing appreciable to improve conditions so that local democracy can flourish. Many of those in the construction industry remain unhappy with the elements of the Bill on construction. The Bill&#146;s attempts to improve economic prosperity and its tinkering will not unlock the potential in the regions to develop an economy that will see us through into recovery. It is a huge missed opportunity.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o403"><a name="91013-0020.htm_para2"><a name="0910143000994">I share in the Minister's tribute to all hon. Members, both in the House today and in Committee, for their contributions, but it is with a sense of genuine disappointment that I find us here on Third Reading discussing a Bill that offers nothing, for all the effort that has been put into dealing with it. I pay tribute to the work that my hon. Friend the Member for Falmouth and Camborne (Julia Goldsworthy) has put into the Bill. I also thank Steve McAuley and Beth Warmington, who have put in a lot of work in doing research and conducting discussions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o404"><a name="91013-0020.htm_para3"><a name="0910143000995">A lot of people watching our debate will feel let down, particularly on the construction elements of the Bill. There was an opportunity to put the matter right, but that has not happened. With great sadness, I have to say that the Bill fails to achieve any of its objectives.</p>

 The Bill faces in absolutely the wrong direction. The core of the Bill is to give more powers to the regional development agencies, which are unaccountable bodies. It sets up leaders panels, heavily chaperoned by the Secretary of State, as was said in Committee, to  <br>


<meta name="Date" content="13 Oct 2009">

manage the consultation process. The situation should be exactly the other way round&#151;those powers should go to local government. Local government works well together. The multi-area agreements work and the leaders panels have something to be said for them, but they should be bidding for the powers that are presently vested in the regional bodies, along with private sector partners and the third sector, because they are ultimately accountable and those regional bodies are not.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o405"><a name="91013-0020.htm_para4"><a name="0910143000997">If we take the combined effect of the Planning Act 2008, the Infrastructure Planning Commission and the powers given to the regional development agencies, there is a huge retreat from accountability with the Bill, which is very bad for democracy. The title of the Bill is a parody of what its impact will be in practice. Perhaps before the Government implement this, they should read Tristram Hunt&#146;s book, &#147;Building Jerusalem: The Rise and Fall of the Victorian City&#148; and contemplate how much they and perhaps all of us have at times contributed to its fall. It is about time that we engineered its rise again.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o415"><a name="91013-0020.htm_para14"><a name="0910143001483">Barry Gardiner (Brent, North) (Lab): There is a challenge facing the world, and it is to seal the deal on combating climate change at the UN conference on climate change meeting in Copenhagen in December. In its last report, the intergovernmental panel on climate change considered that the 2° C rise in temperature that marks dangerous climate change would be triggered by a CO2 emissions concentration level of 450 parts per million. Many of us now believe that figure to be hopelessly optimistic, and consider that a concentration level of 380 ppm, or even 350 ppm, to be more in keeping with the latest science. However, for the purpose of this debate, I shall use the 450 ppm figure.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o416"><a name="91013-0020.htm_para15"><a name="0910143001484">To stay within the target of 450 ppm, the world must curb its projected greenhouse gas emissions by 17 gigatonnes per annum by 2020. However, by 2050, the total emissions each year from the entire global population must be no more than 20 gigatonnes if we are to stabilise the climate within the 2° C dangerous climate margin. That is a huge mitigation challenge&#151;a reduction of at least 47 gigatonnes from a business-as-usual scenario.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o417"><a name="91013-0020.htm_para16"><a name="0910143001485">Globally, biofuels and biomass could play an important role in meeting those mitigation targets. Nationally, the UK renewable energy strategy, published earlier this year, has indicated that approximately 30 per cent. of the UK&#146;s renewable energy target could come from bioenergy for heat and power. That could rise to 50 per cent. if biofuel for transport is included.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o418"><a name="91013-0020.htm_para17"><a name="0910143001486">The target is for 15 per cent. of our energy to come from renewables by 2020, which means that in the next decade we should see the UK growing 4.5 per cent. of its heat and power. In 2006, Peter Kendall, the president of the National Farmers Union, argued that British farmers were uniquely well placed to deliver the renewable transport fuel obligation in a sustainable manner, thanks to the widespread adoption of farm assurance schemes. He said:</p>
<a name="91013-0020.htm_brev5"><a name="0910143001540"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Developed in a sustainable way, in the context of a wide-ranging strategy for alternative crops, biofuels offer society a win, win, solution.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o419"><a name="91013-0020.htm_para18"><a name="0910143001487">Part of the win for farmers is the &#163;47 million subsidy that the Government provide through the rural development programme, under which payments of 40 per cent. of the actual establishment costs of energy crops are made to encourage farmers to plant for energy. However, this is where farmers need to gauge relative reward: certainly, the high price of wheat, even from lower yields on poor-quality land, has not encouraged them to switch from traditional food crops as fast as the Government would have wished. That has prompted the Government to decide to increase the planting grants from 40 per cent. to 50 per cent. of actual establishment costs in England from 2010.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o420"><a name="91013-0020.htm_para19"><a name="0910143001488">But subsidy is a two-edged sword. It should be used to tackle market failure; it should not be used as market manipulation for the protection of domestic interests. Last year&#146;s report from the World Bank entitled &#147;Biofuels: The Promise and the Risks&#148; highlighted the effects of the support for biofuels among different Governments around the world. It stated:</p>

Land use change that replaces biodiversity with monoculture can do incalculable damage to the ecosystem, and is capable of turbo-charging climate change, ultimately resulting in greater greenhouse gas emissions rather than lesser.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o423"><a name="91013-0021.htm_para1"><a name="0910143001491">Malaysia and Indonesia have seen a staggering loss of forest cover replaced by oil palm trees. Such monoculture plantations drive the loss of tropical forest biodiversity, which is not simply a problem for the orang-utans, around which such a notable campaign has been organised recently; it is a problem for the planet, as the planet loses all the ecosystem services that the forest provides, including carbon sequestration, climate regulation, soil stabilisation and watershed protection, as well as the habitat and provisioning services. When those are factored in, the price of biofuel may appear very high indeed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o424"><a name="91013-0021.htm_para2"><a name="0910143001492">The grain required to fill the tank of a Range Rover with ethanol is sufficient to feed one person in the developing world for an entire year. American ethanol from maize uses fossil fuel at every stage of its production process&#151;from fertiliser production to tractor harvest, to processing and transportation to destination. It has been calculated that the growing of maize for ethanol uses 30 per cent. more energy than the finished fuel produces. It also leaves eroded soil and polluted waters in its wake.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o425"><a name="91013-0021.htm_para3"><a name="0910143001493">Globally, the land cover under biofuel crops is projected to grow by 240 per cent. between 2005 and 2030. That has to be set against the rising demand for food crops as the planet&#146;s population rises from 6 billion towards 9.7 billion by 2050. That is not just 50 per cent. more mouths to feed, but 50 per cent. more carbon footprints at a time when rising living standards for developing countries are seeing rising demand for less-efficient meat over cereals.</p>

However, very openly, very honestly, the report also states that it has made no estimate of the likely conflicts over land use that may arise after that. I suggest to the Minister that this is an important piece of research that must be commissioned urgently. We must ensure that credible, robust and widely accepted sustainability standards are put in place so that biofuel production does not lead to  <br>

Only if such standards are established can biofuels and biomass play an important and positive role in the mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions and in avoiding dangerous climate change.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o427"><a name="91013-0021.htm_para5"><a name="0910143001495">In the remainder of my speech, I shall set out key policy proposals and trust that in his reply my very good friend, the Minister&#151;</p>

<p><a name="st_o262"><a name="0910143001496"><a name="91013-0021.htm_spnew0"><a name="0910143002964"><b>Mr. Elliot Morley (Scunthorpe) (Lab):</b>
 Will my hon. Friend give way?</p>

<p><a name="st_o263"><a name="0910143001497"><a name="91013-0021.htm_spnew1"><a name="0910143002965"><b>Barry Gardiner:</b>
 Of course.</p>

<p><a name="st_o264"><a name="0910143001498"><a name="91013-0021.htm_spnew2"><a name="0910143002966"><b>Mr. Morley:</b>
 First, I pay tribute to the work my hon. Friend has done through the global organisation, both on biodiversity and on biofuels. As he sets out his proposals, will he consider the following points? First, will he touch on the need for an assessment of the impact on diversity of some of those crops? That is very important.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o428"><a name="91013-0021.htm_para6"><a name="0910143001499">Secondly, biofuels will never completely be a substitute for fossil-based fuels. Should there be some kind of targeting, such as that in the aviation sector for example, which has fewer options compared to the automobile sector? Thirdly, should not the subsidies be directed away from conventional crops, and their distortion of the market in the US, and more towards second-generation biofuels, in particular growing them on marginal land in developing countries?</p>

<p><a name="st_o265"><a name="0910143001500"><a name="91013-0021.htm_spnew3"><a name="0910143002967"><b>Barry Gardiner:</b>
 I am delighted; although my right hon. Friend intervened at some length, every word that he said was apposite. I am grateful for his intervention and his deep knowledge of the subject.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o429"><a name="91013-0021.htm_para7"><a name="0910143001501">I trust that in his reply, my hon. Friend the Minister will be able to indicate three things for each of the policy proposals that I shall put forward. First, does he accept that the proposal is correct? Secondly, will he indicate whether it is already Government policy? Thirdly, where it is not, will he indicate whether he will endeavour to make it Government policy?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o430"><a name="91013-0021.htm_para8"><a name="0910143001502">I turn to the proposals. First, the expansion of biofuel production should occur only where there is conclusive evidence of significant full life cycle CO2 reductions relative to fossil fuel comparators. The Minister will realise that if the land under cultivation has a high stock of carbon in the soil, or if existing vegetation is removed to enable biofuel planting, there is a strong risk that carbon from the soil or pre-existing vegetation will be released into the atmosphere, offsetting any potential positive carbon reductions from the use of the biofuel product. Land where carbon stock cannot be compensated within a reasonable period by the greenhouse gas savings from use of the biofuel should not be converted to biofuel production.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o431"><a name="91013-0021.htm_para9"><a name="0910143001503">In accordance with the EU renewable energy directive, the calculation of emissions of greenhouse gas from biofuel production, EB, should account for all of the following: emissions from the extraction or cultivation of raw materials, including tillage, cultivation, the carbon costs of waste and leakage, and the production of chemicals or products used; annualised emissions from carbon stock changes caused by direct land use change; emissions from processing; and emissions from transport and distribution, as well as the emissions from the biofuel when used.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o432"><a name="91013-0021.htm_para10"><a name="0910143001504">There should be subtracted from that any carbon capture and sequestration and/or excess electricity from co-generation, together with the proportion of emissions saved through co-products. Those emissions should be compared against a fossil fuel comparator&#151;E<SUB>F</sub>&#151;and the net saving, if any, calculated as That will indicate an overall percentage greenhouse gas saving, and the biofuel in question should be considered sustainable only if the percentage saving is significant.</p>

</center>










<p><a name="stpa_o433"><a name="91013-0021.htm_para11"><a name="0910143001505">The second proposal is that the expansion of biofuels should not come at the expense of food security or of land of high biodiversity and conservation value. To achieve that, land use planning both in the UK and in developing nations should be promoted, so that account can be taken of the likely impact of land use changes upon food prices, particularly for local indigenous communities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o434"><a name="91013-0021.htm_para12"><a name="0910143001506">The third proposal is that the Government should work with stakeholders to create internationally recognised sustainability criteria that are credible, consistent and independently certifiable. Fourthly, trade regulations and barriers should be reviewed so as to promote certified biofuels as a means of reducing greenhouse gas emissions and promoting economic development. Biofuels classified as agricultural goods are subject to high and sometimes punitive duty when exported into the US or EU, as well as other major markets. That distorts the market, stifles economic growth in developing countries, and perversely rewards those producing fuels that contribute to greater carbon emissions. It must stop.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o435"><a name="91013-0021.htm_para13"><a name="0910143001507">Finally, considerable investment is required into research and development of the next generation of biofuels to improve the quality of feedstocks, into research to reconcile anomalies between the end of waste directive and the environmental permitting regulations that govern the treatment of the biofuel manufactured from waste, and into research to develop soft cellulose-derived fuels and to improve the efficiency of conversion. That will require substantial investment. How much will the Government commit?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o436"><a name="91013-0021.htm_para14"><a name="0910143001508">I am confident that my hon. Friend the Minister will agree privately with all five points in his own mind. If he can formally agree with all five in his speech, I shall think that the future for biofuels and the prospects for our avoiding dangerous climate change have come a little closer to being reconciled with feeding an expanding global population.</p>

to write to him on any points that he feels have not been covered by what I say now in response to his contribution.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o438"><a name="91013-0021.htm_para16"><a name="0910143001511">I, like my hon. Friend, would like to make the point that land and our natural environment play a vital role in helping the UK to achieve its own goals of decarbonising its energy production and increasing its security of supply. The conversion of biomass through a range of technologies to produce renewable heat, power or transport biofuels can cut carbon emissions and provide a valuable contribution to our energy mix. However, land is not a boundless resource, and that was the entire point of my hon. Friend&#146;s argument. Issues such as rising populations and changes in lifestyles in the developed and developing worlds mean that the demands on space are greater than ever. In the agricultural sector, in particular, we see increased requirements for food, animal feed and energy production. Scientific evidence suggests that any changes in the way that land is used or managed can have direct and indirect environmental, economic and social impacts. Of course, that is the entire point of my hon. Friend&#146;s case.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o439"><a name="91013-0021.htm_para17"><a name="0910143001512">Sustainability and land use considerations are therefore at the heart of the Government&#146;s policies and actions to build a competitive, low-carbon bioenergy sector. We intend to reduce greenhouse gas emissions without harming the environment, and, in doing so, we aim to maximise the benefits to biodiversity, farming and forestry, rural communities and employment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o440"><a name="91013-0021.htm_para18"><a name="0910143001513">I know that my hon. Friend is less focused tonight on the renewable energy strategy that the Government produced in July, but, as he said, the Government set out a comprehensive action plan for meeting the UK&#146;s target of 15 per cent. renewable energy by 2020. It is an ambitious but, I should say, legally binding target that was agreed at European Union level, requiring an almost sevenfold increase in current renewable energy levels. So my hon. Friend accurately pointed out that the production of heat, power and transport fuels from a range of biomass feedstocks can play a key role in meeting that target cost-effectively. Analysis indicates that about 30 per cent. of the UK renewable energy target could come from bioenergy for heat and power, and, as my hon. Friend said, that equates to 4.5 per cent. of the UK&#146;s overall energy needs in 2020.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o441"><a name="91013-0021.htm_para19"><a name="0910143001514">I shall move on to the very important points that my hon. Friend has raised with me, but I just point out in pursuit of that renewable energy strategy the contribution made by the renewables obligation that already exists, the feed-in tariffs that will exist by April next year and a renewable heat incentive that will exist in the April beyond that. In addition, my hon. Friend mentioned the grants that are available for the installation of various types of biomass heat and power installations to help to develop a biomass supply change and infrastructure.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o442"><a name="91013-0021.htm_para20"><a name="0910143001515">Before I move on to the thrust of my hon. Friend&#146;s contribution, I want to mention the good work that he did as a Minister, when he launched the Forestry Commission&#146;s wood fuel strategy in March 2007. In doing so, I want also to praise the work of my noble Friend Lord Clark of Windermere, who has been the commission&#146;s chairman for the past eight years.

should like to put on the record already my appreciation of his wisdom and enthusiasm and the way in which he has led the Forestry Commission and made it so much more relevant to the kind of debate that we are having tonight.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o443"><a name="91013-0021.htm_para21"><a name="0910143001516">The Government are taking forward several measures to ensure that increases in biomass production in this country are sustainable. That is why, in April this year, we introduced mandatory sustainable reporting on biomass under the renewables obligation, for example. We are very aware of concerns that energy crops will compete for land used for food production, so we are already, as my hon. Friend asked me to confirm, encouraging and contributing to research on the social, economic, environmental and land use effects of biomass for heat and electricity. For example, results will shortly be available on Government-funded research identifying idle and marginal land for energy crop production and developing solutions for growing crops so that their potential benefits to soil carbon and biodiversity are realised. That is the kind of work that my hon. Friend wants to encourage not only in this country but around the world.</p>

 Much of this debate has focused on the finite land resources of the planet, but I would like to raise one point that has not been made&#151;the huge waste of land resources that results from the waste of food production because we throw so much food away. It is thought that almost 50 per cent. of our food is wasted. If we dealt with that, it would release more land resources for more productive and more climate change-friendly uses.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o444"><a name="91013-0021.htm_para22"><a name="0910143001519">Let me turn to international sustainability criteria. Biomass is a global commodity, and as supply is set to expand across the world, we clearly need to act internationally to ensure sustainability. The UK Government are actively working at a European and global level to develop efficient and effective sustainability criteria for bioenergy. The Government believe that mandatory sustainability criteria for large- scale users and suppliers of biomass are essential. That is a tick for another of my hon. Friend&#146;s questions. At the end of the year, the European Commission is due to report on the need for sustainability criteria for the solid biomass used for energy generation in the EU and to bring forward proposals as appropriate. The Global Bioenergy Partnership project to develop an international approach to sustainability is due to finalise its criteria and indicators for bioenergy in 2010. Given the close interest that my hon. Friend shows in these issues, he is probably aware that that project is chaired by the UK.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o445"><a name="91013-0021.htm_para23"><a name="0910143001520">Recent growth in global biofuel production has generated much debate about land use change and the impact that that can have on food availability and prices, as well as other social and environmental outcomes, as my hon. Friend vividly set out. The renewable energy directive does indeed contain an ambitious target for the UK to  <br>

source 10 per cent. of our transport energy from renewable sources by 2020. I heard what he said about the urgent need for a greater research base for the years 2020. Biofuels, as a readily deployable renewable transport technology available on a large commercial scale, are expected to provide the major contribution to meeting the target. If produced sustainably, biofuels have the potential to offer considerable carbon savings compared with traditional fossil fuels.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o446"><a name="91013-0021.htm_para24"><a name="0910143001521">However, the Government recognise that we need to do more to ensure sustainability with regard to the indirect effects on the environment. Our challenge is to support and promote the &#147;good&#148; biofuels&#151;those that do not cause environmental or social damage. The UK is already at the forefront of the debate on sustainable, cost- effective biofuels. We are one of the first to establish a reporting system into the sustainability of our biofuels, and we are pursuing an ambitious research strategy based on the best available science, which will inform our policy on all levels. The Government are supporting the development of sustainable advanced&#151;or next generation&#151;biofuel technologies, which my right hon. Friend the Member for Scunthorpe (Mr. Morley) asked about, and which can produce fuels from a wide range of biomass feedstocks, including crop residues and biodegradable wastes, and from ligno-cellulosic processes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o447"><a name="91013-0021.htm_para25"><a name="0910143001522">The Government are also active internationally, and the UK has been instrumental in ensuring that the renewable energy directive contains mandatory sustainability criteria for biofuels, including delivering greenhouse gas savings of at least 35 per cent. and making it a condition that they must not be sourced from areas of high biodiversity or from high-carbon soils such as rainforests or wetlands.</p>

 I welcome what my hon. Friend is saying about the Government&#146;s sustainability criteria, and indeed they have done an awful lot in relation to such things as forestry standards. However, he raised the matter of certified biofuels. Can he tell me whether there is any progress on that in European discussions or in Government thinking on standards?</p>

<p><a name="st_o270"><a name="0910143001524"><a name="91013-0021.htm_spnew7"><a name="0910143002972"><b>Mr. Kidney:</b>
 All that I have said about the research and discussion to develop the policy in the European Union leads to the conclusion that that is needed, but we are not at the stage of concluding that work. I strongly agree that it is necessary, but I cannot say tonight that we have reached that position yet. We aim to do so.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o448"><a name="91013-0021.htm_para26"><a name="0910143001525">The criteria do not currently cover the indirect effects of biofuel production such as the indirect land use change that my hon. Friend the Member for Brent, North pointed to as being so crucial to our deliberations.  <br>

Those effects relate to new biofuel crops that displace existing agricultural production into areas of rainforest and high biodiversity, for example. We agree that the European Commission needs to produce a report on indirect land use change in 2010, and the UK will be focusing its research efforts on trying to find a workable methodology for accounting for the indirect impacts of biofuels under the renewable energy directive.</p>

<p><a name="st_o271"><a name="0910143001526"><a name="91013-0021.htm_spnew8"><a name="0910143002973"><b>Mr. Robert Goodwill (Scarborough and Whitby) (Con):</b>
 Does the Minister believe that his sustainability criteria would bear scrutiny by the World Trade Organisation, which has so far failed to recognise such considerations when examining barriers to trade?</p>

 I was just coming to some of the five questions that my hon. Friend the Member for Brent, North asked me about policies, and this matter was one of them&#151;it was No. 4. That is a tricky question to answer, which is why my hon. Friend raised it. It will require difficult and, I suspect, long-lasting discussions in the WTO to bring the work on sustainability that we are discussing tonight into the trade environment. I commit to my hon. Friend that I will investigate how best to move forward with that work and bring the matter into that discussion forum, but I cannot say tonight what the WTO&#146;s response will be. It is, after all, a member organisation with many member Governments around the world.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o449"><a name="91013-0021.htm_para27"><a name="0910143001528">I have just one of my hon. Friend&#146;s points left to respond to, which was about investment in research. I have said a lot about the research that we are doing, so I hope he will agree that the Government are committed to doing the appropriate research. However, when he asks how much the Government will commit and whether I can give him the figure tonight, he is being a little ambitious. That is definitely one of the points about which I will write to him.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o450"><a name="91013-0021.htm_para28"><a name="0910143001529">Decarbonising energy supply and use is at the heart of the Government&#146;s efforts to tackle climate change. We have put in place a clear strategy and an action plan to deliver significant increases in the production of renewable energy in the UK, and we expect sustainable biomass-based energy and fuels to play an important part in achieving our goals. Ensuring sustainability is key to the development of a viable bioenergy sector, and the Government will continue to focus on optimising our land based resources to deliver food, feed and energy in a way that meets environmental, social and economic objectives.</p>
