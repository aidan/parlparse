I know that the Government are hoping to tackle the problem in their 10-year programme for financial inclusion, but can the Chancellor provide some comfort this morning that the part of the community that is excluded financially&#151;and also socially&#151;will be incorporated in the coming years?</p>

The crackdown on illegal money lenders, which started in two areas of the country and was extended to another three, making five, will now be extended to every region. With the local authority working with the police for higher prosecutions, we can send out a signal that we are not going to tolerate illegal money lenders charging exorbitant rates of interest, often running into hundreds of per cent. We will continue that crackdown, but I have to say that the economy&#146;s success over the last 10 years is such that people&#146;s real living standards have risen, with wages going up by 48 per cent. over the last 10 years and consumer price index inflation by only 18 per cent.</p>

Gentleman&#146;s party acquiring a sensible economic policy that is line with ours, so that we can support sensible levels of investment in infrastructure and the economy. When we came to power in 1997, public sector net investment was 0.7 per cent. of GDP. It is now nearly 2Â1/4 per cent. of GDP, it has risen every year, and it will continue to rise in the next few years. Investment in infrastructure and transport is running at &#163;18 billion, investment in schools is running at &#163;6 billion, and investment in the health service is running at more than that. It is possible to produce such figures only by achieving the right balance between tax, spending and borrowing, and by having a sensible economic policy. I urge the hon.

The report shows that more people have departed from the ministerial services team, which works closely with the Chancellor, than any other section. Does that not show that there are serious problems at the Treasury under the current Chancellor of the Exchequer?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o28"><a name="70125-0004.htm_para5"><a name="07012579000202">Finally, last week, the Leader of the House referred to the dossier that I issued before Christmas, showing that there were 1,000 unanswered parliamentary questions in the last Session. He claimed then, and last week, that my figures were wrong. Sadly, he has been guilty of a certain amount of spin. Rather than going into all the details now, I will write to him, but to give just a taster, he said that an unanswered question about the number of pupils in each local authority in England who left school without any GCSE qualifications, excluding equivalents, since 1997 had indeed been answered. Well, it had not; the answer did not give the number of pupils, did not give a local authority breakdown, and used a different definition of qualifications.</p>

I hardly think so. Is it really an excuse to say that some answers had not been published in <i> Hansard</i>? Written parliamentary answers should be available to all hon. Members and the public, and not just the Member who asked the question. If answers are not being published in <i> Hansard</i>, the House should know, and the right hon.

Friend the Chief Whip, and I know that she, too, is committed to making the system work.

Member for Maidenhead (Mrs. May) made was that fewer Bills than had been anticipated would operate under the system. It is worth pointing out that when I put the recommendations of the Modernisation Committee to the House, I said that they would apply to all Bills introduced to the House after 1 January. In fact, the Bill that she asks about was introduced before then. It is a measure of my right hon. Friend the Chief Whip&#146;s commitment that we have been anxious to start with that Bill. On the two-weekend separation, it is the rule that there should be two weekends between First Reading&#151;the Bill&#146;s introduction&#151;and Second Reading, but that is not the rule for Committee stage. The Whips will do their best to ensure a reasonable period, but I do not promise two weekends. I doubt that that can be provided, but it depends on the exigencies of the timetable.</p>

highly successful ability to deliver on the economy. My right hon. Friend has just reminded the House, particularly Conservative Members, that we are about to enter the 40th successive quarter of economic growth under the Government&#151;a record unrivalled by any British Government and almost any western Government since 1997. [Hon. Members: &#147;Governments&#151;plural.&#148;] No, it is 40 successive quarters under this Administration since 1997. It is 58 quarters if we include the previous Administration but I am very happy indeed to look at the first 10 years of the Conservative Administration. Of those 40 quarters, I recollect that there were a good 10 quarters in which there was no growth, and a good 10 quarters in the early 1980s and again in the late 1980s in which, far from any growth at all, there was a depression.</p>

It will be embarrassing for her&#151;and some of us remember with acute embarrassment her research into the titles of pop songs, which she tried to name in July&#151;but the research turned out to be wrong. I deprecate the practice of leaving any question unanswered, and I particularly deprecate the failure to answer a question tabled in February until November. That is quite unacceptable, and I have always made that clear. My colleagues are told in terms if there are such problems. I do not want any unanswered questions, but may I tell the right hon. Lady&#151;and she and I have discussed the matter with the Chairman of the Procedure Committee&#151;that Ministers and officials have to work hard to answer all questions on time? It is an issue for the whole House, and it would affect any Government with whom she served, as the number of written questions has expanded, and expanded again.

Will he consider a similar system for the Order Paper, so that debates are clearly marked as being suitable for the Prime Minister? Before yesterday&#146;s debate, we were told at different points by the Prime Minister&#146;s spokesmen that he does not do Back-Bench debates&#151;apparently, a debate in Government time opened by the Foreign Secretary is a Back-Bench debate&#151;that he does not do foreign affairs debates, and then that he never attends such debates, whatever the topic may be. May we be assured that there are at least some debates that the Prime Minister would feel it appropriate to attend, rather than chumming up to the CBI? Perhaps one of them might be a debate on four years of war in which brave British soldiers are being killed on every day of every week.</p>

Member for North-West Cambridgeshire (Mr. Vara) in Chancellor&#146;s questions? Not only are there questions about the implementation, but practical difficulties. The Leader of the House knows that we support a tax on aviation, although we support a tax on the pollution caused by planes, rather than on the passengers who travel in them. Is it not the case that because the duty is retrospective, it will cause chaos in our airports and great difficulties for both travellers and airlines, as well as huge financial disadvantage to tour operators? A tour operator in my constituency, Gerry Copsey, points out in a letter to me that the tour operator has to absorb the first 2 per cent. of any surcharge, which he has not collected because the tax did not exist. That is therefore a direct and substantial windfall tax on tour operators. It cannot be right, and the House should have the opportunity to debate it.</p>

As a result of the decision to merge the Tuesday and Thursday Prime Minister&#146;s questions into one, he misses Prime Minister&#146;s questions far less frequently than did previous Prime Ministers. It has been the practice in the House for as long as I can remember&#151;over 28 years&#151;for Foreign Secretaries to lead debates on foreign policy. I would like another debate on Iraq, not least so that the House can be informed of the views of the previous leader of the Liberal Democrat party, Lord Ashdown&#151;it is a terrible shame that this did not come out yesterday&#151;who writes today in <i> The Independent</i> excoriating the policy of the current leader of the Liberal Democrat party and his irresponsibility in proposing that we should cut and run from our responsibilities in Iraq.

It is common practice for the rate changes to all major duties to have immediate or near immediate effect.

Kettering citizens advice bureau is getting a growing number of complaints about such arrangements. May we have some Government action?</p>

I am sure that you are aware of the recent court case that has led to yet another reversal in the attempt to limit the protest in Parliament square. Whatever one thinks about that, there can surely be no human right to fill the square with incessant amplified noise, which interferes with the ability of Members to do their work, and which is a distraction and danger to police who are in the front line of providing security to the House. Have you received any advice as to whether the latest court judgment entitles the protestor in the square to recommence, as he has done, the broadcasting of amplified messages at unbearably high volume in that public place, which would not be allowed anywhere else that I can think of?</p>

I believe we have had nearly 60 pieces of Home Office legislation since 1997. The judiciary complain that the law has become so opaque and incomprehensible and there are so many rules and regulations that they have difficulty in keeping pace with what is happening. We have seen many examples of repeal of Government legislation before the relevant schedule has even been implemented, and this appears to me to be exactly such an example.</p>

earlier legislation&#151;indeed almost before that earlier legislation has been implemented in full. Is there not a procedure that would allow the Government to tell us, when legislation goes through the House and particularly when it goes into Committee, what they expect to be the earliest and latest dates of implementation? Unless that can be done, we shall continue to experience terrible practical problems when one Bill is overtaken by another. Moreover, we shall not be doing our job in making the process clear to the public and the practitioners.</p>

The other day I spoke at an event celebrating the 50th anniversary of the organisation Justice, along with the hon. Member for Beaconsfield and the Attorney-General. The Attorney-General said that he and the Government support the objective of codifying the criminal law. We also do so&#151;as, I think, does the Conservative party. The best way to start to achieve that objective is to make sure that as proposed legislation comes before us in Home Office business&#151;it will mainly come before us in Home Office business, but it will also occasionally come across Law Officers&#146; desks&#151;we update wider legislation so that we end up with a consolidated Act, as it were, on the subject in question. Therefore, in the context of this Bill on jury trial, we should end up not with a Bill that is slim and appealing&#151;as this one is&#151;but with an updated version of either the Fraud Act 2006 or the Criminal Justice Act 2003. We would then have only one piece of legislation, and therefore when we start to put proposed legislation in 2007 together with legislation enacted in 1998 or 2003 or whenever, what has not been addressed that should have been addressed will become obvious to us, and many more issues will be dealt with.</p>

A new parliamentary process has belatedly been adopted which did not apply to this Bill: before the merits of the wording of legislation are deliberated in Committee, there is the ability to take evidence on it. Although the Bill missed the deadline, we have now agreed to that process, so I am not criticising the Government. I hope that that process will be valuable, because I hope that the people who give evidence to us about the practical implications of Bills will be the sort who are likely to say to us, for example, &#147;You do  <br>

<p><a name="stpa_o66"><a name="70125-0007.htm_para9"><a name="07012579000352">I do not object to agreeing to the new clause. It is more than a technical amendment, but it is not the most substantive part of the Bill by any means&#151;we will come to that shortly. However, it raises questions to do with the process of government and, to be blunt, as my party&#146;s Front Benchers have often said&#151;as have Conservative Front Benchers&#151;if we had legislated less and administered better in the past 10 years, criminal justice and the Home Office would not have such an unsettled or declining reputation.

Until section 51B is in force, reference will be made to section 4 of the Criminal Justice Act 1987. I do not propose to go into the details of that Act, because that legislation is not before us and I fear to stray into areas that are not the subject of today&#146;s debate. I have assured the hon. Gentleman&#151;and I repeat that assurance&#151;that the Government are committed to ensuring that cases are dealt with as efficiently as possible, and discussions are continuing about how best to achieve that. We aim to make an announcement in due course. I am assured that the two sections are almost identical. The differences are only in terminology and procedure, and are not relevant to the Bill.

In the principal legislation, the House debated whether there might be exceptions to the rule that serious criminal cases should have a jury trial. Parliament agreed&#151;this has been enacted&#151;that in certain cases that can now happen. The most obvious case that has been agreed is where there has been tampering with the jury. There is a procedure that allows an application for a non-jury trial in that exceptional circumstance. It was acknowledged that that should be allowed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o72"><a name="70125-0007.htm_para15"><a name="07012579000362">There was another Government proposition&#151;which had been raised and debated before&#151;that there should be a trail without a jury in serious fraud cases. As Members will recall, that was extremely controversial. Because it was both controversial and was raised at the end of the parliamentary Session, it put at risk the Government&#146;s ability to secure the agreement of both Houses of Parliament to that Criminal Justice Bill. The outcome of the ensuing negotiations between the then Home Secretary, the right hon. Member for Sheffield, Brightside (Mr. Blunkett), and Baroness Scotland and Opposition spokespeople in both Houses was that that part of the Bill would be implemented only if an affirmative order were subsequently passed by both Houses. Effectively, it was put on hold except in cases when Parliament agrees to its implementation. Since then, the Government have sought on one occasion to implement it by using that process. They managed to get the order passed in this House, but it was made clear to them that it was unlikely that the order would be passed in the House of Lords, so they did not proceed down that route. The Bill provides a mechanism to return to that issue, but by way of a new and substantive piece of primary legislation.</p>

Obviously, many matters have been devolved, and we supported that, but we still vote on legislation relevant to Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales, Mr. Deputy Speaker, as you well know.

However, that will not happen today. All my colleagues from all three parts of Great Britain will vote, because they are as committed as I am to retaining jury trial for all serious cases in England. I should say in passing that people from Scotland and Wales often appear before the courts in England and Wales&#151;more from Scotland, by definition&#151;and they might well hold the same strong views in that regard.

throughout the debate has been that one flaw of the present system is that one has to cut down a case, as it were, to put it to the jury, because it would otherwise become too long and complex&#151;in other words, too risky in terms of the jury&#146;s comprehension. As a result, not all the defendants who might be charged in a given case are charged, or not all the charges that might be put on the indictment are put.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o83"><a name="70125-0008.htm_para3"><a name="07012579000378">Interestingly, the only jury who have recently spoken on this issue did not say that the prosecution had confused them, although they did point out that the defence was sometimes not as clear as it might have been. Our view is that, in the interests of justice, we should always make sure that everybody who should be charged is charged, but the interests of justice are not necessarily served by having 24 or 48 counts on an indictment if six will do. The House will be aware that because the maximum sentence for one count is the same as for another, similar count, a court&#146;s ability to punish someone with imprisonment&#151;actual and immediate, or suspended&#151;or a fine, for example, is not changed simply by the addition of counts. Of course, if there were 10 counts, for example, a judge could say that they must be served consecutively, but 12 or 24 counts are not needed to achieve the justice that a smaller number of counts can achieve.</p>

If one puts 21counts on the indictment, one then has to adduce evidence as to those 21 counts. That is likely to be extremely confusing for a jury, who will face an inordinate and quite unnecessary amount of evidence.</p>

The other day, a constituent came to me to discuss a parent&#146;s allegation of discrimination in a school against their child. In the end, the case brought was based on a specimen count&#151;that on a particular day, the child was treated in a particular way. Bluntly, if the case were won on that basis, the same argument could apply in respect of the preceding and subsequent days and months, because the same treatment occurred then. So it is absolutely in the interests of justice that we do not have extra and unnecessary counts.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o84"><a name="70125-0008.htm_para4"><a name="07012579000381">Of course, if there are different types of offences, one puts them on the charge sheet and into the indictment. Or if there was a pattern of behaviour five years ago, then a break, and another pattern a year ago, that might be reflected in the charges. However, the criminal justice system has never sought to put everything before a jury. Indeed, many cases would be much slower and more confusing and the chances of successful conviction would be smaller. If someone is convicted, they have the opportunity to ask for other offences to be taken into consideration so that they are not left on the file.</p>

Before any charges have been laid, people have appeared in the press and on the radio and television as the likely defendants. One could argue that the interests of justice would dictate that the members of a jury would not be able to disregard what they had heard, read or seen to enable them to reach a correct judgment. My experience of the courts is that in every case where that is an issue&#151;perhaps there has been widespread national or regional publicity&#151;the judge has gone out of his or her way to make it clear that the members of the jury have to put what they have heard or read about the case out their minds.

If we have to have a Bill like this, it needs to be made tougher, and that is what these new clauses aim to do.</p>

Cases involving terrorism and conspiracies, for example, or ones with many people accused of drugs offences are also long and complex. We are setting a dangerous precedent if we accept that it is only length or complexity that justifies a non-jury trial, because that is to create an argument&#151;irresistible in logic&#151;that the same conditions should be applied to non-fraud cases.</p>

The Government have a track record of doing that, and they have tried many times to dilute the classes of case in respect of which a jury is required to be empanelled. I refuse to grant Ministers that precedent, because I object fundamentally to these proposals.</p>

The Government have form in such matters, and will use any argument that comes to hand.

The Government have gone out of their way&#151;they have no option but to&#151;to insist that juries are capable of returning true verdicts. If they were to depart from that principle, they would announce their complete lack of confidence in the entirety of the jury trial system. Indeed, we know from the Wooler inquiry into the collapse of the Jubilee line case&#151;one of the very few pieces of evidence that we have about the ways juries function&#151;and from the supporting research documents that went with it, which I conveniently obtained the day before Second Reading, that in that trial, which meandered on for 18 months before it collapsed, the jury had a very good grasp of the issues in the case. There is every reason to suppose, when one considers the responses that the jury gave to those who investigated the matter, that had they had an opportunity of returning the verdict, no one could suggest from the evidence that the verdict would have been unsafe or unsatisfactory, because after 18 months they had preserved a complete grip on the issues that they were having to consider.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o107"><a name="70125-0009.htm_para3"><a name="07012579000422">We must be realistic about this. In our daily lives most of us have had the opportunity to meet people, not necessarily in a professional context, but neighbours or friends, who have served on juries. Some people find doing two weeks&#146; jury service, which probably includes four or five days sitting and the rest of the time being sent home, to be burdensome. I would not wish to say that they were being lily-livered. It may well be that the impact on their own lives has been considerable. Equally, I have done long trials lasting many months when it seemed to me that the jurors were deriving considerable enjoyment from the work that they were being called on to do. Friendships are made. Indeed, in some cases marriages have followed. Many, particularly those who may be retired or are not in full employment, have found it an extremely fulfilling and important experience in their life. That is a reason why we have jury trials. Simply to imply that length leads to burdensomeness seems to be mistaken.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o108"><a name="70125-0009.htm_para4"><a name="07012579000423">I have retained the issue of complexity. We know that many extremely complex trials that take place will not fall into the category of being capable of being assigned to a judge alone. For example, the Crevice trial which is taking place has lasted many months. We do not know when the verdict will be returned. It is an ordinary criminal case being tried by a jury. It is a matter of great importance involving scientific evidence, and the jury is thought to be capable. My practice included health and safety work. The cases which are contested are often extremely technical in their nature. Jurors arrive in the jury box and are presented with three or four Lever arch files to share between two of them, including documents, background material and the business documents of the company concerned and other contractors. During the course of the trial they have to consider expert evidence and sometimes look at models which have been made and brought into the court. All such trials are as complex or as likely to be as complex as any fraud trial that I can imagine, and sometimes they last many weeks and months. Yet in those circumstances the Government at the moment&#151;I am mindful of what the hon. and learned Member for Medway says about the risks of the wedge in the door&#151;have not considered suggesting to the House that those trials should be removed from jurors.</p>

Is the most important thing the wedge or the fraud aspect?</p>

Gentleman knows, the Government whom he supports are greatly driven by opinion polls. Indeed, I have come to the conclusion that they frequently take opinion poll soundings. We know a little bit about such soundings, although things may have changed. I once saw an interesting internal document that the Government produced a couple years ago&#151;I am not sure that I should have seen it, but it seemed to land on my desk. It explained some of the Government&#146;s background motivation on the issue of fraud trials. It recognised that support for the principle of jury trial was extremely high. Equally, the Government&#146;s soundings showed that the public were disquieted by occasional examples of fraud trials that cost huge sums, ran for many months and then collapsed. On the back of those findings, the Government seemed to adopt the approach that they should apply their mind to the issue of long and complex fraud trials, because the findings were a justification that juries should be dispensed with in such cases.</p>

Another important point is that the evidence suggests that long and complex fraud trials that collapse do so for reasons that have nothing whatever to do with juries. That is the evidence that came out of Mr. Wooler&#146;s report into the Jubilee line case, although at first sight, when his findings were splashed all over the papers, a bad impression was created of a trial with a jury that had lasted 18 months and had collapsed. The trial had cost millions of pounds&#151;I cannot even remember the sums involved, but they were colossal&#151;so it appeared to have a somewhat scandalous quality. However, when one reads Mr. Wooler&#146;s report, it turns out that the problems lay with the Crown Prosecution Service&#146;s approach to the matter. There may also have been other factors on which Mr. Wooler was not in a position to comment, but one thing is certain: the collapse had nothing to do with the jury. The supporting documentation went quite the other way and showed clearly that the jury was working well in that case.</p>

It is apparent that the propaganda machine was well tuned up and that case was seen as a particular opportunity.

To some extent, we have dealt with those arguments because, as I observed in Committee, the Government do not accept that there will be any effect on the safety of the verdict. We think that judges are able to reach verdicts and that they are able to reach verdicts that are safe. Indeed, every day in this country, district judges do that in magistrates courts and nobody complains about that.</p>

That has been done by reducing the number of counts on the indictment so that all the counts that could have been put are not put, by dropping some of the less serious defendants out of the indictment so they never get punished, and by severing indictments so that we get two trials rather than one.</p>

there is a certain amount of academic interest, rather than practical interest, in the sense that the trial probably would not have been suitable under section 43 of the Criminal Justice Act.

We all know the problems that have arisen in serious and complex fraud cases and we all know that they have not arisen in the same way in many other cases. The Government see such cases as a unique issue, which has a long history that other areas of law do not have. We can say with absolutely firmness that there is no wedge. I cannot put it more clearly than that.</p>

</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o129"><a name="70125-0010.htm_para9"><a name="07012579000487">The purpose of the condition, however, is not to state the consequence of a finding that the trial is likely to impose a heavy burden, but merely to define the degree of burdensomeness that must be present before use of the power is considered. If the judge finds that a trial is likely to be burdensome to the required degree, it does not follow that he must make an order under section 43 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003. There may be other considerations that prompt him not to do so.</p>
<a name="ordayhd_7"><a name="70125-0010.htm_ordayhd0"><a name="07012579003799"><h5 align="left">2 pm</h5>
<p><a name="stpa_o130"><a name="70125-0010.htm_para10"><a name="07012579000488">Let me give an example: under section 43(5), defendants are entitled to make representations, and those representations need not be confined to the likely length or complexity of the trial, or the burden it would impose on the jury. A judge might be satisfied that the trial would be burdensome, but might nevertheless find the defendant&#146;s representations so persuasive that he decides against making a section 43 order. That is not a problem under the current subsection (5), but the formula in new clause 4, tabled by the hon. Member for North Southwark and Bermondsey, unhelpfully suggests that in such circumstances the interests of justice would require a juryless trial to be ordered. The new clause that he proposes would therefore pose a serious problem, as it would prejudice the rights of defendants and would invalidate their representations.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o131"><a name="70125-0010.htm_para11"><a name="07012579000489">The other reason why new clause 4 would not be appropriate is that the ultimate decision on whether a juryless trial should be held does not rest solely with the judge hearing the application. The approval of the Lord Chief Justice is also required, under subsection (4). The &#147;serious consideration&#148; referred to in section 43(5) relates not only to the trial judge&#146;s consideration in light of representations from both parties&#151;defence and prosecution&#151;but to consideration by a more senior judge of whether a juryless trial is desirable and practicable in all the circumstances. On that basis, I think that the hon. Gentleman is entirely wrong on both new clauses, and I invite hon. Members to reject them.</p>

<p><a name="st_o294"><a name="07012579000490"><a name="70125-0010.htm_spnew11"><a name="07012579004127"><b>Simon Hughes (North Southwark and Bermondsey) (LD):</b> This debate has been more interesting than I anticipated it would be.

<p><a name="stpa_o132"><a name="70125-0010.htm_para12"><a name="07012579000491">I shall concentrate on new clause 5. The fundamental flaw now revealed in the Government&#146;s argument&#151;it has been quoted by Liberal Democrat Members&#151;is that they are praying in aid an argument that could apply to any long trial. I should like to discuss the evidence in the Jubilee line case. To those who read our proceedings later, I commend the full, officially commissioned report, &#147;Report on Interviews with Jurors in the Jubilee Line Case&#148; by Professor Sally Lloyd-Bostock of Birmingham university. A section entitled &#147;Effects on employment and careers&#148;, from which the Solicitor-General took examples and read excerpts, does indeed say that a long trial could impact adversely on the individuals concerned, but it goes on  <br>

to address, in greater detail, the issue of fraud trials and the type of trials that we are discussing.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o133"><a name="70125-0010.htm_para13"><a name="07012579000492">The only substantive addition that I want to make to the debate is to put on record what the report said on that subject, because this debate is not about long trials, but about fraud trials, and uniquely and unusually, we have clear evidence on fraud trials. A section headed &#147;Portrayal in the media&#148; said:</p>
<a name="70125-0010.htm_brev5"><a name="07012579003760"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Jurors felt unfairly portrayed as the cause of the collapse of the trial. They particularly objected to the portrayal of them in the press as unable to understand evidence or remember evidence and reach a fair verdict. Some were not particularly concerned, but others were very upset.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o134"><a name="70125-0010.htm_para14"><a name="07012579000493">Then there is a quote of someone:</p>
<a name="70125-0010.htm_brev6"><a name="07012579003761"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;I was just so angry&#151;to blame us when it was not managed properly, it was a farce.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o135"><a name="70125-0010.htm_para15"><a name="07012579000494">There is a whole section dealing with jurors&#146; responses to cases such as the Jubilee line case. Bearing in mind that that was one of the longest trials ever and that it was later aborted, it is interesting that under the heading, &#147;The jurors&#146; attitude to their jury service at the start of the trial and as it progressed&#148;, the report says:</p>
<a name="70125-0010.htm_brev7"><a name="07012579003762"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;All but one juror still definitely support the principle of jury service. There was considerable concern...expressed about the removal of the right to jury trial, including for long trials.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o136"><a name="70125-0010.htm_para16"><a name="07012579000495">That is the jurors, and not the politicians, speaking. The report quotes a juror:</p>
<a name="70125-0010.htm_brev8"><a name="07012579003763"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;on any trial, [trial by jury] is a fundamental right of any British person. If you start bringing in judges, or financial wizards or whatever you are not being judged by your peers.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o137"><a name="70125-0010.htm_para17"><a name="07012579000496">The professor&#146;s report goes on to say, in a section called &#147;The jury&#146;s understanding of the case&#151;overview&#148;, that</p>
<a name="70125-0010.htm_brev9"><a name="07012579003764"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;There are obvious limitations to assessing the extent to which the jury in fact understood the evidence and the issues in the case on the basis of the interviews. Because a juror says he or she understands, we cannot be sure he or she really did. Moreover, the jurors were interviewed almost five months after the...trial...Within those limitations, it did appear that when the case collapsed this jury, taken as a group, had a good understanding of the case, the issues and the evidence so far, as presented to them... The interviews show the importance of considering the jury as a whole.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o138"><a name="70125-0010.htm_para18"><a name="07012579000497">The report continues:</p>
<a name="70125-0010.htm_brev10"><a name="07012579003765"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;The jurors&#146; assessments of their own and others&#146; understanding produced a consistent, generally optimistic picture.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o139"><a name="70125-0010.htm_para19"><a name="07012579000498">In that same section, following paragraphs show that even though the jurors were interviewed five months later, without their notebooks and their notes, they were not thrown by the fact that the trial was a fraud trial. That is the fundamental point.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o140"><a name="70125-0010.htm_para20"><a name="07012579000499">The Solicitor-General is wrong when he says, &#147;We&#146;ve tried everything else&#148;, because we have not yet done so. In the past two years, there has been the Lord Chief Justice&#146;s protocol of 2005, the changes brought about as a result of the Jubilee line case, the inspector&#146;s report and the Law Officers&#146; recommendations, the Fraud Act 2006, and the testing of the Domestic Violence, Crime and Victims Act 2004. In addition, there is a cross-governmental review that has not yet produced its final report and recommendations. All that has meant that there have been practical changes in the way in which prosecution and defence manage their cases.</p>

Again, I preface my remarks by saying that they do not qualify our views about the Bill, which we do not want. After the preceding debate we are even more clear that the case for the Bill&#151;that fraud trials need judges without juries&#151;appears weaker, because the argument seems to be that long trials are a problem. That problem should be dealt with by procedural means, and many remedial steps are in train.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o152"><a name="70125-0011.htm_para8"><a name="07012579000990">However, if we are to improve the Bill, there are three proposals that my colleagues and I put before the House, and further proposals in the group from other colleagues. Our first proposal is that if an application for a trial without a jury is allowed to be made to a judge and approved by the Lord Chief Justice, it should be possible for it to be made by the prosecution or by the defence, and by any one of the defendants, if there are more than one.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o153"><a name="70125-0011.htm_para9"><a name="07012579000991">During the previous debate, the Solicitor-General commented that in Committee the Opposition had proposed that the exemption from jury trial for serious cases should be extended. We were arguing, as he knows, not that we want that to happen, but that if some serious fraud cases in a ring-fenced group of cases are to be heard by a judge alone, there is no logic in justice why both parties to the case&#151;the prosecution and the defence&#151;should not be able to apply for that. It cannot be a fair system if only one side can apply.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o154"><a name="70125-0011.htm_para10"><a name="07012579000992">It could be argued that it would usually be to the advantage of the prosecution to go before a judge alone, because judges are&#151;I do not mean this pejoratively&#151;hardened in dealing with such cases, whereas juries are not. Members of a jury are unlikely ever to have done a long or difficult case before, and unlikely ever to have to do a jury case again, because they are usually exempt from jury service after serving on a long or difficult case. Jurors therefore come fresh to the case and give it their particular attention, never having served on a jury before.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o155"><a name="70125-0011.htm_para11"><a name="07012579000993">Many defendants, those representing them and their witnesses might think the system was unfair if it allowed only the prosecution to put the case for going before a judge alone. They might ask why they should not have the same right. There might be cases where a defendant preferred the case to be tried by a judge rather than a jury. Apart from the situation that I mentioned earlier, I can think of only two examples, which are simplistic, in which there had been a great deal of press coverage before an arrest or a charge.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o156"><a name="70125-0011.htm_para12"><a name="07012579000994">If the defendant or one of the defendants was a woman and the judge was male, the woman might prefer to put her case to a mixed group of people, including women. Similarly, a black or minority ethnic defendant might prefer a jury to a white judge, male or female. However, there are some cases, usually those that have attracted publicity, where defendants might prefer to go before a judge. Such cases are fairly rare. I have not heard defendants make the case to me, or to us, by representation, for a judge trial rather than a jury trial.</p>

<p><a name="st_o298"><a name="07012579000995"><a name="70125-0011.htm_spnew3"><a name="07012579004603"><b>Mr. Hogg:</b> May I add the other category, to which I alluded: cases which are likely to be a substantial cost to the defendant, through lack of employment or through direct cost?</p>

<p><a name="st_o299"><a name="07012579000996"><a name="70125-0011.htm_spnew4"><a name="07012579004604"><b>Simon Hughes:</b> Indeed. That is more true now that the rules on legal representation have changed. There has been criticism&#151;justified, in some cases&#151;that people who appear to be well off have been getting legal assistance from the public purse for a long case, and there may be more of those cases.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o157"><a name="70125-0011.htm_para13"><a name="07012579000997">To summarise, people might normally prefer a jury to a judge, because they think a jury might represent them better, for gender, ethnic or other reasons, but in a case that has attracted great publicity or, as the right hon. and learned Gentleman says, in one involving substantial cost, they might prefer to appear before a judge alone. New clause 9 argues for equality of opportunity to make the case.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o158"><a name="70125-0011.htm_para14"><a name="07012579000998">New clause 10 makes the supplementary point that, if a judge is to consider an application from the prosecution, there should be an opportunity for oral representations&#151;a public presentation of the reasons for not wishing the case to go to a judge-only trial&#151;or, if one defendant made such an application, the other defendants should have the right to present orally to the court the reasons for not wishing the case to go before a non-jury trial.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o159"><a name="70125-0011.htm_para15"><a name="07012579000999">New clauses 11 and 13 are similar. They are perhaps the most important in the group and would provide for a necessary further safeguard. If an order to go to a judge-only trial was found not only to be unnecessary in the interests of a safe verdict or in the interests of justice, but that it would</p>
<a name="70125-0011.htm_brev0"><a name="07012579003766"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;significantly disadvantage or otherwise prejudice a defendant or any of the defendants&#148;,</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o160"><a name="70125-0011.htm_para16"><a name="07012579001000">there must be an opportunity for the law to say that it should not be permissible. The balance of argument must allow that, even if only one of a large group of defendants would be prejudiced, the alternative of a judge-only trial would not be open to the court.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o161"><a name="70125-0012.htm_para0"><a name="07012579001001">I want to comment on the number of cases that we are considering and the reason for my hope that hon. Members believe that every defendant&#146;s right should be taken into account. Let me give the numbers of cases in which the Serious Fraud Office reported that it had been involved in recent years: eight trials in 2001-02; 14 trials in 2002-03; 14 trials in 2003-04; 22 trials in 2004-05; and 10 trials in 2005-06. As we would expect, there are many more than one defendant per trial. Let me provide the number of defendants in that five-year span: 13 in 2001-02; 25 in 2002-03; 39 in 2003-04; 58 in 2004-05; and 23 in 2005-06. There are many defendants and it is important that the interests of each are considered. Serious fraud cases are, by definition, more likely than other types of cases to involve many defendants.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o162"><a name="70125-0012.htm_para1"><a name="07012579001002">If we wish to protect the interests of defendants, we must examine the other two or three columns that the Serious Fraud Office produces each year on the success rate of the current system. We do not argue that changing from one system to another would or should increase convictions or acquittals. The Government appear periodically to make the case that, if we changed the system, there would be more convictions. However, there has been a significant number of convictions and the Serious Fraud Office has never claimed that serious fraud cases result in an unusual number of acquittals.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o163"><a name="70125-0012.htm_para2"><a name="07012579001003">Before our current debates, the Government never made such a claim. We understand the reason for that when we consider the number of convictions for the past five years: 10 in 2001-02; 17 in 2002-03; 20 in 2003-04; 37 out of 58 cases in 2004-05; and 13 out of 23 in 2005-06. The difference is obviously the number of people acquitted. The conviction rate is 77 per cent.; 68 per cent.; 51 per cent.; 61 per cent. and 57 per cent. Those percentages apply to big cases, in which many people are involved. The conviction rate is regularly over 50 per cent. On one occasion, it exceeded 75 per cent., and, on two others, it was more than 50 per cent. though less than 60 per cent. The Liberal Democrat case is that the current system has worked relatively well but is working better because of changes. It would adversely affect the interests of the defendant and of justice if further changes, such as those for which the Government argue, were made. However, if further changes occur and fraud trials are tackled differently, defendants must be treated the same as the prosecution, and the interests of every defendant&#151;not only that of the defence as a whole&#151;must be considered.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o164"><a name="70125-0012.htm_para3"><a name="07012579001004">I hope that hon. Members will be sympathetic to those arguments and that we shall have the opportunity to test the House&#146;s opinion on at least some of them.</p>

<p><a name="st_o300"><a name="07012579001005"><a name="70125-0012.htm_spnew0"><a name="07012579004605"><b>Mr. Grieve:</b> The new clauses are important and we had an opportunity to explore some of the issues surrounding them in Committee. They raise a difficult matter, as touched on by the hon. Member for North Southwark and Bermondsey (Simon Hughes). New clause 9&#151;or, for that matter, new clause 13, which was tabled by my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Sleaford and North Hykeham (Mr. Hogg)&#151;has the consequence that more trials without juries are likely. The provisions give the defence an opportunity to make an application for trial without a jury.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o165"><a name="70125-0012.htm_para4"><a name="07012579001006">In Committee&#151;and even now&#151;I found myself slightly torn on the matter. I believe in jury trials and I do not believe in the Bill, but I also believe in fairness. It seems to me that if a system is to be introduced by which a prosecutor can go to a judge on an application and argue that the defendant should be deprived of the opportunity of a trial by jury&#151;notwithstanding the fact that the defendant may wish to have one&#151;it is very difficult intellectually to argue that the defendant should not have a similar right if he does not wish to be subject to jury trial.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o166"><a name="70125-0012.htm_para5"><a name="07012579001007">That has had the effect of overcoming my initial reluctance, because the more I think about it&#151;and if I have to contemplate the fact that the Bill will one day be on the statute book&#151;the more I believe that it becomes apparent to anyone looking at the mechanisms that this has been produced entirely for the benefit of the prosecutor. In a sense, the proof of the pudding will be in the eating because if defendants wish to rely on jury trial and the prosecutor does not ask for them to be deprived of it, they will doubtless not make the application in the first place. For those reasons, I take the view that new clause 9&#151;or, for that matter, new clause 13&#151;could provide a minor improvement to this very bad Bill, which I do not support in principle.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o167"><a name="70125-0012.htm_para6"><a name="07012579001008">I was rather struck by the fact that this matter was discussed by the Solicitor-General and me in Committee and that the Government were subsequently informed that if they were to move an amendment to allow this provision to happen, Conservative Members would not seek to stand in their way. Interestingly, the Government turned down the opportunity. In a letter to me and other members of the Committee, the Solicitor-General said:</p>
<a name="70125-0012.htm_brev0"><a name="07012579003767"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Opposition members also raised the question whether defendants, as well as the prosecution, should be able to seek non-jury trial. There are strong arguments for allowing defendants to waive their right to trial with a jury, and indeed a general power of jury waiver was originally included in the 2003 Criminal Justice Bill, although this was subsequently removed following Opposition resistance. A case could certainly be made for a limited provision enabling defendants in serious and complex fraud cases to waive jury trial.

First, the Solicitor-General appears in his letter to conflate the general resistance, which we saw in 2003, of allowing any defendant to make an application for trial without a jury, with the specific issue that we have to consider here. I want to make it absolutely clear that the two have no similarity whatever. I would resist to the bitter end any suggestion that defendants should be given a general power to elect trial without a jury. Indeed, we rehearsed that in 2003 and we made it quite clear then that it was probably a charter for the white collar defendant who wanted a sympathetic judge, rather than a jury that might take a robust view of his activities. For that  <br>

However, these matters classically illustrate that that is very likely to happen. There would be a remorseless logic, once we started shifting away from jury trial in some cases, that would allow other people or groups to make similar applications. We cannot get away from that. The best thing that we could do with the Bill would be to vote it out on Third Reading. In the meantime, however, we have to live with the reality. There must be fairness, and as the Bill stands there will be a perception that it has been put together for the benefit and advantage of the prosecutor, and not of the defence.</p>

That is the issue that new clauses 9 and 13 try to address. This is an important point and, as I have freely said to the Solicitor-General, it is one about which I feel quite uneasy. On the one hand, I wish to support the principle of jury trial. On the other hand, however, there is a logic&#151;a slightly remorseless logic&#151;that says that once we have given a prosecutor this right, it is unfair to a defendant not to give him the opportunity to make a similar application, should he wish to do so.

It is designed to ensure that a judge who considers an application for a non-jury trial should be in a position to refuse that application if he or she concludes that the non-jury trial order would significantly prejudice the interests of the defendant. That seems to me to be a clear test, which is in accordance with natural justice and which I strongly commend to the House. Being as dispassionate as possible, I cannot identify a decent argument against it, save the argument of my friend the hon. and learned Member for Medway (Mr. Marshall-Andrews), who asserts repeatedly that the Bill is so bad that we should have nothing to do with it.

and deny it to the defendant, seems to me to be manifestly unfair. I can identify no principle on which someone who asserts that proposition could stand. The argument of parity of arms, equality of position and plain fairness points irresistibly in the direction of giving the defendant the same right as that given to the Crown.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o180"><a name="70125-0012.htm_para19"><a name="07012579001024">Were the Solicitor General to accept this or a similar proposal, while we would denounce the Bill and the process, I would not accuse him of pushing the wedge into the wood, as I know that we are pushing the wedge into the wood. It would be dishonest of me to criticise him on that narrow ground, and I promise that I would not do so. I do not suppose for a moment that my hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Grieve) or the hon. Member for North Southwark and Bermondsey would do so, as we know that we are pushing the Government on this point.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o181"><a name="70125-0012.htm_para20"><a name="07012579001025">Leaving aside the issue of whether the proposal is right in principle, the question also arises as to whether there are cases in which the defendant is likely to want to make such an application. We must consider that for two reasons. First, of course, we must consider whether the general right should be incorporated into the Bill. Secondly, if the answer is that it should, we must prescribe the criteria. The criteria on which the defendant will seek to make an application are not the same as those on which the Crown will seek to make an application; they are different, and probably different in kind. Therefore, I have tried to set out in new clause 14(5) the broad test that a defendant would have to satisfy to procure a non-jury trial order.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o182"><a name="70125-0012.htm_para21"><a name="07012579001026">I suggest that there are at least five cases&#151;doubtless there are others&#151;in which a defendant might wish to make such an application. The hon. Member for North Southwark and Bermondsey identified two. The first, which I ventured to mention earlier, is cost. Increasingly, defendants will be paying their own costs. I do not particularly object to that in proper cases. Even when the legal aid fund pays the costs, the defendant can incur substantial losses through loss of employment or the fact that he or she cannot earn his or her income. In some cases a non-jury trial is likely to be shorter than a jury trial, and for that quite narrow reason a defendant might want a non-jury trial. It is a perfectly good reason, and one that should be available to defendants.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o183"><a name="70125-0012.htm_para22"><a name="07012579001027">Secondly, I can contemplate a number of classes of case that a defendant might prefer to be tried by a judge alone. Defrauding of pensions is an example, in a climate in which people are very sensitive about their pension rights. If the allegation against the defendant was conspiracy to defraud a pension fund, for example, I can imagine the defendant being rather uneasy about leaving that question in the hands of a jury, given the background of which the House is now aware.</p>

In libel cases, the answer is sometimes no, and what is true of libel cases may well be true of criminal cases. A fairly unattractive  <br>

Sexual cases are another example. Are we really saying that juries should not be allowed to deal with cases involving inherent prejudice? That is an extremely wide range of cases. The example relating to pensions is rather a bad one, if I may say so. I know of no class that is more concerned about pensions than the judiciary.</p>

I understand that argument: it has considerable force, and it is the reason why the hon. and learned Gentleman and I will vote against the Bill on Third Reading. As my hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield suggested, once we open up this can of worms we are driven by logic to extend the class. That, of course, is why we are all against the Bill. However, within the narrow limits of a Bill whose provisions are confined to fraud cases, I think that we are entitled to go where the logic points, provided that what we do is fair within the framework of the Bill. That is my answer to the hon. and learned Gentleman. I know that we do not entirely agree on this point.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o186"><a name="70125-0012.htm_para25"><a name="07012579001032">Let me now deal with two further categories. The hon. Member for North Southwark and Bermondsey&#146;s point about publicity was entirely right. While applications to stay proceedings on grounds of abuse of process are available to defence counsel, there will be a range of cases in which a defendant might think that the degree of pre-trial publicity is such as to taint the process, although the force of the submission would not be so strong as to secure a stay of proceedings on those grounds. In those circumstances, the defendant might well seek a non-jury trial.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o187"><a name="70125-0012.htm_para26"><a name="07012579001033">My last category, which was canvassed in Committee, is where a defence reveals some dodgy behaviour or unattractive conduct, but that falls short of the offence with which the defendant has been charged. In those circumstances, a defendant might think that a judge alone would be more likely to disregard the unattractive nature of the defence and to direct his or her attention exclusively to the legal merits of the allegation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o188"><a name="70125-0012.htm_para27"><a name="07012579001034">My point is that there are a range of circumstances&#151;I have no doubt that Members will identify others&#151;in which a defendant might want to make such an application. In new clause 14(5), I have tried to define criteria that meet the totality of the possible circumstances, and it also reinforces the argument that a defendant should be entitled to make an application.</p>

I hesitate to make that point in the presence of the hon. and learned Member for Medway, as he will say that I am driving in the wedge, but we are talking about fraud cases only and we should be able to give the defendant the opportunity to say, &#147;I cannot stand financially the prospect of a very long fraud trial.&#148;</p>

Under new clause 9, the defendant&#146;s right would replace that of the prosecution to make an application, which would clearly be unacceptable to the Government. When the hon.

The provision that we were considering would, like that in the 2003 Bill, have given defendants a right to non-jury trial, subject to veto by a co-defendant who wanted to be tried by jury. We doubt whether it would be practical to require a defendant, as the prosecution must, to satisfy any condition in order to secure non-jury trial, along the lines proposed in new clause 14(5). Our view was that, if jury waiver is to be available, it probably ought to be available on request. For example, if, in order to make the application, the defence had to show in detail that the exposition of its defence was likely to result in a long and complex trial&#151;rather than the evidence being put forward by the prosecution&#151;it might have to expose all the detail and complexity of its argument.

I accept that the right hon. and learned Member for Sleaford and North Hykeham (Mr. Hogg) would say that he would not seek to use against me an allegation of bad faith if I responded to the Opposition&#146;s request. However, I note that he subsequently went on to argue, despite saying that he would not do so, that there is an inevitable logic in extending the provision once we have got it. He was saying, in effect, that if we accepted the Opposition&#146;s position, we would be accepting the inevitable logic of the provision&#146;s being extended to other areas. He used that argument honestly&#151;I am not implying any other motive&#151;but I point out to him that there is a way of not extending that provision, which is to take the view that one will not do so.

Leaving aside the past assurances&#151;although I respect the Solicitor-General&#146;s position on that&#151;how will the Government answer the question of fairness and equality of arms when the measure appears to give a special power to the prosecutor to circumvent the ordinary system of trial by jury, but denies a defendant a similar right to make an application to do so? Hypothetically speaking, a defendant might feel strongly about that point or be told by his advisers that the length of the trial, the burden on the jury and other issues might prejudice a fair verdict. How will the Government answer that argument?</p>

Therefore we would not create equality of arms. In a sense, we would be giving the defence greater rights than the prosecution. The unfairness would apply in a different way. I accept the strength of the hon. Gentleman&#146;s argument and throughout this debate I have conceded that there are strong arguments on his side. Indeed, the Government put those arguments forward some years ago and still subscribe to some of them, but in putting forward this Bill we agreed to abide by what was in the 2003 Act and that is why I have taken the view that I have on the issue.</p>

them, but Ministers also have to take a view about where they stand on an issue. I have done that, and the Home Office has done that, and this is where the Government stand. Another Government and other Ministers may take other views, but this is the position of this Government on this Bill.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o197"><a name="70125-0013.htm_para8"><a name="07012579001052">The premise underlying new clauses 11(2) and 14(2) is that an order for non-jury trial under section 43 might disadvantage or prejudice the defendant. The Government do not accept that non-jury trial is capable of having that effect. Proposed new subsection (3) of new clauses 9 and 11, and proposed new subsection (6) of new clause 14, amend section 43(7) of the 2003 Act. That requires the judge, in considering whether there are steps that he could take that would reduce the length or complexity of the trial, to disregard any step that might significantly disadvantage the prosecution. The amendments refer instead&#151;or, in the case of new clause 14, in addition&#151;to steps that would disadvantage the defendant. However, the judge is under no obligation to make an order under section 43, and he certainly need not take steps prejudicial to the defendant in order to justify refusing to order trial without a jury.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o198"><a name="70125-0013.htm_para9"><a name="07012579001053">New clause 10, which is the same as the new clause moved in Committee, and proposed new subsection (3) of new clause 14 would allow representations to be made in relation to an application under section 43. As hon. Members accepted in Committee, section 45 of the 2003 Act already does what we believe to be necessary. Section 45(2) provides that an application under section 43 must be determined at a preparatory hearing, which takes place orally. Section 45(3) provides that parties must be given an opportunity to make representations. If there is any ambiguity of interpretation, the Pepper <i> v.</i> Hart provision means that judges will be able to look at what I as a Minister have said in this House.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o199"><a name="70125-0013.htm_para10"><a name="07012579001054">Proposed new subsection (3) of new clauses 10 and 14 both relate to representations made when the Lord Chief Justice&#151;or the head of criminal justice, Sir Igor Judge&#151;is called on to consider whether to approve a section 43 order. The Government do not consider it necessary to prompt the Lord Chief Justice or Sir Igor Judge to consider whether the parties have been given an opportunity to make representations, as proposed in new clause 10, or to consider whether they should be given the opportunity to do so before him, as proposed in new clause 14. We believe that such matters are best left for the senior judiciary to determine, as that is what they are there for.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o200"><a name="70125-0013.htm_para11"><a name="07012579001055">I anticipate that the process is likely to be that, after a full oral hearing for the initial application, the head of criminal justice will determine whether a further oral hearing is required. That would be entirely a matter for him, in all circumstances. Sometimes, that further hearing would not be needed, but sometimes it might. I make no commitment on that: we believe that the matter is best left for the senior judiciary to determine. The oral hearing will take place before the initial judge, and that is the best place for it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o201"><a name="70125-0013.htm_para12"><a name="07012579001057">New clause 9 is different from new clause 13, as it would allow an application on the instigation of the defendant alone, whereas new clause 13 would allow equality of arms. Those of my colleagues at the other end of the Corridor who oppose the Bill believe that, if we are obliged to go ahead with it, then trials should be held without a jury only at the instigation of the defence, and not at the instigation of defence and prosecution. None of us wants to go down that road, but the equality argument&#151;one of the central planks of this short debate&#151;remains valid, despite what the Solicitor-General said to the hon. Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Grieve). If there is a case for the prosecutor to go to the judge and say that the case should be heard by a judge alone rather than by a jury, I cannot see how justice is done if the defendant cannot also do so.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o202"><a name="70125-0013.htm_para13"><a name="07012579001058">To put it bluntly, there are two proposed alternatives. The first is that the defendant alone could make the application. I understand that the Government will resist that. The second is that there is equality of arms. I have not heard such a strong argument against that. The Government have said honestly that that was not where they were coming from, so that was not where they were. If, despite our opposition, the Bill receives a Third Reading and goes to the House of Lords for consideration, I hope that the Solicitor-General will reflect on whether at least that might be a step in a direction that made it more attractive&#151;not that we would change our view on the substance of the Bill this year, but if the Bill were to become law in future.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o203"><a name="70125-0013.htm_para14"><a name="07012579001059">There is a difference in importance between new clause 10 and new clause 11. I understand what the Solicitor-General said about the other sections in the 2003 Act which deal with the procedure of putting to the judge in a preparatory hearing the case for both sides before the judge makes that decision. New clause 10 barely increases the strength of the right to do that. It would make a small adjustment. New clause 11, however, would make a significant adjustment to the proposition. It adds another safeguard. We absolutely do not want the Bill, but if we are to have it, there need to be safeguards: the interests of justice safeguard, the security of the verdict safeguard and the interests of the defendant or the prejudice to the defence safeguard. The new clause seeks to ensure that we retain the prejudice to the defendant safeguard.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o204"><a name="70125-0013.htm_para15"><a name="07012579001060">Finally, I turn to the matter that was referred to in the Government&#146;s consideration of the position. I do not believe that the Government argument that if one gave equality of arms, it would suddenly open up the debate, stands more than minimal investigation or consideration. Of course there would be the potential for more applications because both prosecution and defence would apply. Therefore there might be more trials of this type. The Government case is that this would be limited to serious fraud in any event, subject to the check of the judge and all the arguments, and then the check of the Lord Chief Justice or others, so there will be many checks down that road. In a way the Government have put their case on the basis of its being an experiment. For there to be an experiment, both sides need to have an equal opportunity to participate. That is not the case. It is a reason why the  <br>

alternative course of action in the Bill. New clause 15 is drafted simply, and it provides a mechanism so that the prosecution can apply for trials to take place without a jury. The Solicitor-General will know that since the matter first arose in 2003 I have suggested that the Government consider the alternative of special juries if they were worried that the burden would be too great for people summoned off the street to serve on a jury panel and if they feared that those jurors would not be able to cope with a lengthy trial.</p>
<a name="ordayhd_11"><a name="70125-0014.htm_ordayhd0"><a name="07012579003803"><h5 align="left">3.45 pm</h5>
<p><a name="stpa_o214"><a name="70125-0014.htm_para5"><a name="07012579001992">I suggested that a panel might be set up, drawn from organisations such as the Institute of Chartered Accountants, the Society of Actuaries and other persons who clearly had a knowledge of financial documents. The panel could be called upon to form special juries when they were necessary in long and complex fraud cases. The scheme would have the added advantage that those who served on such a panel might well have taken early retirement, would have the sagacity, wisdom and time to do the work, and would be willing to do it.

Members, and that we had the opportunity to discuss in his chambers in Buckingham Palace Gate the issues surrounding the options, but without the wider consultation that I expected as a result of the assurances given in 2003 by the then Home Secretary, the right hon.

exceptions&#151;I am always prepared to accept that&#151;but I do not think that there will be very many. Oddly enough, the exceptions are most likely to come&#151;certainly in my experience of long fraud trials&#151;from judges who also do civil work.

I am conscious that it will be seen&#151;particularly in the other place, I fear&#151;as a breach of a previous undertaking.

I do not take issue with him on this; it is a decision for him, for the Law Officers and for the Government. It is clear, however, that the amendments represent a change from the previous assurance to try to bring people round to the Government&#146;s way of thinking. In that sense, what I said earlier was absolutely correct, as I am sure the Solicitor-General will agree.</p>

During our conversations, the hon. Gentleman said that the Opposition&#151;the Conservative Opposition, at least&#151;in another place would not support this change. It was our initial wish that Crown court judges be allowed to carry out the trials. We listened to early representations from the Opposition on the matter back in July, and agreed to change the proposal. However, when the issue was again raised by the Opposition, we took the opportunity to take further soundings from the judiciary, and now we are back here where we are.

The Solicitor-General has said that we are talking about only a handful of cases a year. In those circumstances, while it might prove burdensome for the High Court judges&#151;I am sure that that is why they would like gently to get someone else to do the work&#151;I am afraid that that is a burden that we shall have to impose on them. The Government have in the past recognised people&#146;s anxiety that, if such trials were to take place before a judge alone, they should be heard by judges of the highest calibre.

It is true, however, that many Crown Court judges have extensive experience in fraud cases. I do not have the experience of fraud cases that the hon. and learned Member for Medway (Mr. Marshall-Andrews) has, but I have been involved in two long fraud cases in recent years, both of which were conducted before a Crown court judge. One has only to keep in mind the nature of the cases going through the Old Bailey to recognise that many of its judges have substantial experience in long fraud cases. Some, of course, do not, and that is why a procedure for designation by the Lord Chief Justice or a High Court judge nominated by him as the designating judge should be allowed. I therefore conclude that we should not confine such trials to a High Court judge but extend the right to Crown court judges who are designated by the Lord Chief Justice.</p>

Does not he share my sadness, however, that amendment No. 13, which he and I tabled jointly, has failed to make the cut? It would have ensured that the case would be tried by the same judge who decided whether it would be judge-alone. First, that is sensible, as the same judge would be reading the papers. Secondly, it would prevent the danger, which I am afraid exists, that one judge will dump on another judge the responsibility of trying a case on his own.

He knows that we have all tried to find ways in which some of the arguments used can be accommodated. One of the difficulties is that the argument for the Bill changes almost every time that it is put&#151;sometimes within the space of 10 minutes. The Solicitor-General can veer from one argument in support of the Bill to a totally different one when stymied by an intervention from the Opposition. It is therefore difficult to work out what the Government are trying to achieve. In good faith, however, we have asked whether there are better ways of managing such complex and lengthy trials and of protecting jurors from the difficulties that they might face.</p>

Is he suggesting a form of judging panel, not consisting of lay members of the public who are the peers of the accused? Is he suggesting a different way of setting up a panel of judges?

The professionals suggested by the hon. Gentleman would presumably be better placed to do that than a person drawn at random from the population. The new clause does not, however, pass the other tests that the Government occasionally adduce as reasons for the Bill, and, as I have said, it loses an important ingredient in not retaining the nature of a lay jury.

Given, however, that the Government have decided that these are the most difficult, complex and lengthy fraud cases&#151;so much so that they must remove a key safeguard in our judicial system, and make a judge become a finder of fact as well as assessing the law&#151;it strikes me as perverse that they should be heard by not a High Court but a Crown court judge.</p>

Goodbye, and see you again in six months.&#148; Therefore, there will be a specialist cadre of judges who will look at such cases week in, week out, month in, month out and year in, year out. That raises another important issue in relation to serving the interests of justice&#151;case-hardening for judges, particularly if they are finders of fact as well.</p>

High Court judges are a brainy lot, but one of the problems in our system is that they often come from a background in which they deal with no crime at all. Our system is unique: we elevate people who are experts in trusts, codicils and wills to the rank of High Court judge and then expect them to deal with murder, mayhem and crime. We have very good Crown court judges, and they understand the problems that the Bill will cause. They will have a far better understanding of the matters we are discussing than High Court judges, and in truth they will be far less likely to grant applications.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o239"><a name="70125-0015.htm_para14"><a name="07012579002039">That leads me to my last point. We make huge demands on Crown court judges. There are enormous amounts of work for them to do. They not only have to hear cases involving the huge panoply of new offences that the Government daily create, but now even have to consider carefully whether there are any prisons with free places to which to send the accused person at the end of the case if they are convicted. Our Crown court judges need to be on the circuit where they can do their valuable work. It is worrying that the Government&#146;s proposal might have a diluting effect on the judiciary at Crown court level.</p>

Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Grieve)? Crown court judges are experienced in fraud trials, but only in fraud trials with juries, and they are not experienced in bench trials. In our system, such trials happen on the civil side but not on the criminal side. Also, High Court judges have experience as fact finders in complex civil trials.</p>

The number of judges who are used to trying both criminal and civil cases in Crown court is now extremely limited, so the argument that there is familiarity falls on that basis.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o241"><a name="70125-0015.htm_para16"><a name="07012579002048">New clause 15 would give rise to a number of difficulties. The role of the expert members is uncertain, and there is a risk that their private views about the expert evidence that had appeared before the court would find their way into private discussions with the judge and influence matters in a way that the defence or prosecution might not have had an opportunity to comment on. It is also unclear whether suitable members could be found, how they would be paid, and so on. However, the hon. Gentleman was good enough to say that although he has tabled the new clause, it is not really the way that he wants to approach matters. He wants a special panel that sits separately from the judge.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o242"><a name="70125-0015.htm_para17"><a name="07012579002049">Our view throughout has been that a key issue is the need to manage such trials in a way that enables a judge to prevent procrastination by defence lawyers. That issue emerged from the report on discussions with the jurors in the Jubilee line case, who were concerned about defence procrastination. Moreover, there is the question of the ability to let lawyers know during the course of proceedings that the judge did understand the nature of the documentation before him, and of the ability to ensure that the case proceeds with much more care and skill and reaches an appropriate and just verdict. In our view, that means that in certain cases, particularly very lengthy and complex ones, there need not always be a jury, and that there would be many cases&#151;at least half a dozen a year&#151;that would benefit from a judge-only trial.</p>

He has said again that there will be about six such cases a year. On what basis has he come up with that figure? I understand that it comes from the Serious Fraud Office, and that the presupposition is that all such cases will be mounted by it. In fact, the vast majority of cases in which such applications are likely to be made are those mounted by Customs and Excise, particularly missing trader intra-Community fraud cases. It seems to many of us who practise in that area that the likelihood is that those applications will be made in far more than six cases.</p>

However, on looking at the number of cases that, in practice, lasted more than six months in the past four or five years&#151;some lasted more than a year&#151;the figure worked out at about half a dozen. I do not envisage that there will be any great wish to have non-jury trials unless necessary, so it is my view that the likely number is about half a dozen. My hon. and learned Friend is right to say that Her Majesty&#146;s Revenue and Customs is one prosecutor that would be likely to make such an application. We have engaged with HMRC and the SFO and talked to them about the sorts of cases in which they might seek a non-jury trial. Our judgment remains that it would be about half a dozen a year. It could be up to 20, but it is very unlikely to be in that range. We are looking at a much lower figure, and certainly in the next two or three years it may be even fewer than six. I cannot give my hon. and learned Friend a cast-iron figure. We do not have anything in statute and we are to some extent relying on the way in which the prosecutors and courts  <br>

It is not their role to take sides on a controversial political issue like this. I can say that we have discussed the issues. My right hon. Friend knows, because it is a matter of public record, that Lord Justice Auld&#151;and before him, the Roskill report&#151;set out a view, having considered in detail the concerns expressed about serious and complex fraud cases over several years by many sources, including judges and lawyers. Therefore, I shall openly avoid my right hon. Friend&#146;s question by saying that I do not want to put the senior judiciary into the position of taking a side on a controversial political issue like this. That is our job.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o243"><a name="70125-0016.htm_para0"><a name="07012579002054">However, it is appropriate for the senior judiciary to say that they would like to be able to manage in a particular way an issue on which this House has decided. I sought express consent from the president of the Queen&#146;s bench division and head of criminal justice, Lord Justice Sir Igor Judge, to indicate his view on the subject and he agreed that I could say that it was his wish that Government amendment No. 1 should form part of the Bill to enable the courts better to manage the process of dealing with non-jury trials.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o244"><a name="70125-0016.htm_para1"><a name="07012579002055">New clause 15, tabled by the right hon. and learned Member for Sleaford and North Hykeham (Mr. Hogg), would have a similar effect to Government amendment No. 2, the main difference being that our amendment gives to the head of criminal justice a power to nominate or designate a Crown court judge. The new clause would confer the power on the Lord Chief Justice with a specific power of nomination. We consider, and the senior judiciary are confident, that the power is one that it is appropriate to give to the head of criminal justice. Therefore, our view is that the president of the Queen&#146;s bench division, the head of the criminal justice system&#151;at present, Lord Justice Sir Igor Judge, and I take this opportunity to congratulate him on confirmation of his position as head of criminal justice yesterday&#151;is the appropriate person to make this decision. It does not have to be the Lord Chief Justice and indeed his view is that he would prefer it to be the Head of Criminal Justice, who is the president of the Queen&#146;s bench division.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o245"><a name="70125-0016.htm_para2"><a name="07012579002056">The Government amendments were prompted by concern that clause 2 of the Bill might, in its present form, be too inflexible. Opposition Members spoke in Committee of the potential difficulty of finding High Court judges to deal with what, by definition, would be extremely long trials. They argued passionately that I should look at the matter, and I agreed to do so. Government amendment No. 1 is the result. I have spoken to the senior judiciary, who said that they were in favour of it.</p>

Some of the cases in which a section 43 order is made would no doubt be assigned to a High Court judge in any event, but we believe that it makes sense, where possible, to assign very long and complex trials to judges of exceptional ability and appropriate experience. That is why we took up the proposal for a requirement that section 43 applications, and any ensuing trials, should be assigned to High Court judges. However, while some circuit judges are more than capable of dealing with such matters, others are not, and we believe that it is appropriate for the Lord Chief Justice and the head of criminal justice, the head of the Queen&#146;s bench division, to take a view as to which judges are suitable.</p>

We envisage that the head of criminal justice would identify a judge to hear an application, and that if he decided that section 43 applied, that same judge would normally take the case through. However, circumstances might intervene&#151;for example, the judge involved might die, fall ill, or be tied up in another case for a long time.</p>

Moreover, if the case changes and a defendant decides to plead guilty after previously pleading not guilty&#151;and if that plea had been part of the original judge&#146;s contemplation when making the judge-only ruling&#151;another judge will have a great deal of difficulty in unravelling the original judge&#146;s thinking.</p>

read the arguments advanced by my hon. and learned Friend and me, and we should leave it to him to determine which judge should handle any given case. In some circumstances, he may decide that the judge who heard the initial section 43 application is not the right one to deal with the trial as a whole. It is, however, the case that the way in which the whole process will evolve is one in which hon. Members would prefer the same judge to deal with the case, where that is possible and practicable. That is as far as I want to go. I would rather leave the discretion in the hands of the head of criminal justice. I cannot give an undertaking in relation to any amendment from the Lords.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o251"><a name="70125-0016.htm_para8"><a name="07012579002064">A number of circuit judges are amply qualified to handle these cases. People like Sir Geoffrey Rivlin and others spring to mind. They could deal with the serious cases if they were disposed to do so. It is not intended that any old circuit judge, to put it carefully, should deal with them. The head of criminal justice will take a view on who would be the appropriate judge to deal with these issues and will ensure that the appropriate judge can handle the array of evidence put before him. Many judges in their careers as barristers will have handled masses of complex material and had to form an opinion on it. I do not see the difficulty with that.</p>

That argument does not stack up. We need to ensure that we have the right judge for the right case. We can do that with the Government amendments, and I hope that the House will support them.</p>

Currently, both lay magistrates and district judges hear public interest immunity applications and go on to find on the facts. The same is true of Crown court judges, dealing with confiscation proceedings. We are confident that these procedures will work equally well when used in the course of an application under section 43.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o255"><a name="70125-0016.htm_para12"><a name="07012579002070">Doubts have been expressed about the impartiality of a judge who, having heard information prejudicial to the defendant, goes on to hear the facts. However, having detailed knowledge of this sort of information does not necessarily mean that the judge will automatically be considered prejudiced, as some of those raising objections seem to imply. Rather, the key question must be whether there are any ascertainable facts which would raise legitimate and objectively justified doubts about a judge&#146;s impartiality. I am not convinced in general that there are.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o256"><a name="70125-0016.htm_para13"><a name="07012579002071">The first point to note is that information prejudicial to the defendant is not likely to be the subject of a PII application in any event, but it is possible. Secondly, the judge is perfectly able to disregard any irrelevant information and may indeed be well used to doing so. In the case of R <i> v.</i> H and C, the House of Lords made the following relevant observations:</p>
<a name="70125-0016.htm_brev0"><a name="07012579003773"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;If PII applications are confined, as they should be, to material which undermines the prosecution case or strengthens that of the defence, the bench will not be alerted to material damaging to the defendant. If it is, the principles which should govern the court&#146;s decision whether to recuse itself are the same as in the case of any other tribunal of fact, but the court&#146;s duty of continuing review ordinarily militates in favour of continuing the proceedings before the court which determines the PII application.&#148;</p>

The judge stated that in reaching his decisions in the confiscation proceedings, he had ignored any material that he had earlier decided attracted public interest immunity and should not be disclosed. The appellants argued that that was unfair and that the judge should have &#147;recused&#148; himself.</p>

and the concept of an expert panel have many shortcomings, but I regret that the Government are so implacably opposed to special juries, because although they, too, have drawbacks, they would be infinitely better than the course on which the Government are embarking, which is to get rid of juries altogether in select cases.

My clear interpretation of the assurances then given to the House was that the measure in the Bill would be subject to affirmative resolution and that it would not be introduced at any stage without the approval of both Houses. That is my understanding of what was said, and it reflected a deal. Anything that departs from that is a departure from assurances given.</p>

What we are doing today is laying the foundations for a Parliament Act procedure, because it is extremely unlikely that the other place will pass the Bill in its present form. The Government are laying the basis for such a procedure, and I find that deeply offensive for two reasons, although I am basically against the Parliament Act, but that is by the way.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o268"><a name="70125-0016.htm_para25"><a name="07012579002085">I shall touch on my second point briefly, because I want to remain in order. When we look at what we are doing, we must consider its constitutional propriety. The Bill is going to be pushed through on the back of Members who represent Scottish constituencies, but the Bill does not touch on Scotland. If the Parliament Act is invoked, that will be even more offensive because it will be invoked using Members representing Scottish constituencies when this very Bill does not have any impact on their constituencies. It will be extraordinary if almost the first act of the Chancellor of the Exchequer on becoming Prime Minister&#151;I assume that he will&#151;is to use the Parliament Act to impose on this country measures that have no application at all to the constituents whom he represents. I find that constitutionally offensive. It is a matter for a wider debate and it will have to be resolved, but it is not right that Scottish Members should have a decisive say on English-only business.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o269"><a name="70125-0016.htm_para26"><a name="07012579002086">Therefore, for the general reason and the particular reason, I hope very much that the House will approve the amendment.</p>

It is wholly desirable that there should be a further opportunity for the House to use the affirmative procedure before this dreadful Bill is brought into effect. Losing the protection of the affirmative procedure is wholly undesirable. As a matter of principle and in view of my attitude towards the Bill generally, it would be a very good thing if the House were to support the amendment.</p>

The pragmatic reason is that I will do absolutely anything that might frustrate the Government&#146;s intentions. This is yet another opportunity to do so. The reason for the pragmatic approach of wishing to frustrate the Government by any means possible is the principle of the retention of jury trial. That principle is not only right but is accepted widely in the country at large.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o271"><a name="70125-0017.htm_para0"><a name="07012579002090">Another principled reason for supporting the amendment relates to precisely what the right hon. and learned Member for Sleaford and North Hykeham (Mr. Hogg) said: there would be no Criminal Justice Act 2003 were it not for the existence of section 330(5)(b), on commencement. It was solely on the basis of that agreement, reached in the room just behind the Speaker&#146;s Chair, by me and my hon. Friend the Member for North Southwark and Bermondsey (Simon Hughes), the hon. Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Grieve) and his colleagues, and the then Home Secretary, that there was any possibility of the Criminal Justice Bill, as it then was, reaching the statute book. To rip up, in effect, that agreement in order to facilitate the passage of this appalling little Bill seems not only wrong in principle but an abnegation of that agreement. That is why the section should be retained.  <br>

The Bill enables the most serious and complex fraud trials to be heard by a judge alone to ensure that justice is done in those sorts of cases. A trial by a judge sitting alone will only be appropriate for a small number of cases&#151;our estimate is about half a dozen cases each year. The maximum would be about 20, but we do not anticipate that we are likely to get close to that figure. To give us plenty of margin, and so as not to mislead anyone, that is the figure that we have considered. If we are able to have such trials, it will be possible to expose the full criminality of complex and serious fraud cases in court, and our criminal justice system will have the tools that it needs to deal properly with such major crime.</p>

We are discussing a particular policy to deal with a particular issue. About 30,000 contested trials take place each year. The Bill is likely to affect half a dozen of them. In the magistrates court each day in our country, a district judge often decides verdicts, so no fundamental principle is being breached in the Bill.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o289"><a name="70125-0018.htm_para3"><a name="07012579003075">What is unique in this case is that there is a long history of reports by Lord Roskill, Lord Justice Auld and others calling for a new way of dealing with complex and serious fraud cases. No such reports have been produced about other areas of criminal law. The Bill is not a general attack on jurors; it deals with a specific issue in a way that is manageable for the courts and that ensures that justice is delivered.</p>

I was not sure what his argument was; in any event, it was not a good one. As for the American criminal justice system, it is very different from ours. We have our own traditions and processes. One of the key ways in which the Americans deal with cases involves an element of plea bargaining. We are considering all those issues in connection with the fraud review, and in due course we will be able to say how we expect to proceed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o296"><a name="70125-0018.htm_para10"><a name="07012579003091">Our argument has not been that the jury does not understand the process of a complex and serious fraud trial. I have emphasised that it is no part of our argument that jurors do not understand the evidence before them, but that has not prevented some Members from making exactly that claim. That has never been our argument, but it is extraordinary how many times it is necessary to deny having relied on a line of argument that we have made clear we do not advance. Our argument has always been about the burden on the jury, not about lack of understanding.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o297"><a name="70125-0018.htm_para11"><a name="07012579003092">Our trial system requires oral explanation of documents, and in many complex fraud cases there can be thousands of pages of documents and trials can last for many months, or even for a year or more. Although jurors usually understand the cases before them, the huge burden that the system places on them is, in many ways, intolerable; the Jubilee line case illustrates some of those burdens&#151;it illustrates other issues, too, but I will not rehearse the arguments in respect of them. Despite attempts to use procedural changes to keep trials within reasonable bounds, complex and serious cases can drag on for a year or more. Few people can afford to give up their normal lives for so long, so those who remain on juries are sometimes not entirely representative.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o298"><a name="70125-0018.htm_para12"><a name="07012579003093">Prosecutors attempt to deal with that problem by reducing the burden on the jury. They adopt stratagems, such as reducing the number of charges on the indictment before the court, dropping the less serious defendants from the entire case so that they might never be brought to justice, and severing the indictments thereby splitting the trial so that there is more than one of them. Each of those stratagems prevents the full culpability of the criminal from being exposed in court. Judges sitting alone will be able to avoid those problems and can hear a large number of charges, look at all the evidence and restrict long-winded speeches by lawyers&#151;which I hope to avoid today.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o299"><a name="70125-0018.htm_para13"><a name="07012579003094">The Government have carefully considered how to introduce the Bill and we have tried to keep faith with the principles behind it. I have considered Opposition arguments that we should extend some of the provisions for non-jury trials, so that the defence can elect to have such a trial&#151;I explain for the benefit of Members who were not in the Chamber earlier when those arguments were made. We have decided not to do that, although there are arguments for doing it, because we said as a matter of faith that we will stick with what we have proposed, which is that the prosecution will be able to ask the court for non-jury trials and that we will restrict the numbers of such trials.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o300"><a name="70125-0018.htm_para14"><a name="07012579003095">We have decided to allow, by way of amendment, certain circuit judges as well as High Court judges to hear such cases. That is the right approach. It has the  <br>

Leaving that point aside, I want to ask the Solicitor-General a question: would he like to be a judge sitting in trial over someone with the individual responsibility both for determining whether that person is guilty and for sending them to prison for many years?</p>

<p><a name="st_o384"><a name="07012579003098"><a name="70125-0018.htm_spmin5"><a name="07012579006540"><b>The Solicitor-General:</b> Judges in our country often have enormous responsibilities and have over centuries taken on the burden of delivering justice, so I think that they are well capable of doing what we would ask them to do. They already do it in some of the most difficult civil cases. They often have to make decisions in respect of confiscation orders and a range of cases where they sit alone. Our judges are capable of making those judgments, and of making them well. They have a track record in terms of other sorts of cases that they have dealt with that shows that they can do that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o302"><a name="70125-0018.htm_para16"><a name="07012579003099">There are about 30,000 jury trials in this country, and our proposals will affect a tiny number&#151;about half a dozen. Also, if we are able to make a move in relation to Diplock courts, in due course the number of jury trials might well increase. Therefore, there is no justification in Opposition Members&#146; claims that this is a general attack on juries. It is my personal view that juries provide one of the best ways of deciding justice, particularly in serious cases, but they are not the only way of delivering justice. I believe that justice is also delivered well in our magistrates courts. When the Bill is enacted&#151;I hope that it will be&#151;we will ensure that we deal with justice in our Crown courts in a very effective way.</p>

It is always the prelude to announcing legislation or a policy that will undermine the principles and practices that are of value to our freedoms and the way that our civil society operates, and which will do absolutely nothing whatsoever in the interests of justice or of reducing crime. This Bill, presented to the House virtually unchanged now that it has gone through on Report, has all the hallmarks of doing the same thing.</p>

Once the Government establish the principle in the Bill, they will inexorably move toward arguing that other long and complicated trials are also burdensome and that, as a result, they, too, should be tried by a judge alone.</p>

The Jubilee line report and the interviews with jurors show clearly that, whatever those burdens may be&#151;they are burdens that jurors have to carry in any major criminal trial&#151;jurors are capable of doing the work. In so far as there may be a problem in that area, one of my regrets is that during the Bill&#146;s passage, we have been unable to look at any alternatives because its terms have been so tightly drawn. From Second Reading on, we had to consider only trials without juries. The jury system can be made to work, yet the Government constantly blinker themselves and ignore the improvements that can be made. They themselves have provided in future for the possibility of trial on specimen counts, with the judge determining the other counts thereafter, yet they failed totally to take that into account in bringing the Bill before the House.</p>

Many of the cases that the Government have relied on in support of their argument collapsed not because the jury was to blame, but because the prosecuting authorities were to blame. The cases were withdrawn from the jury by the judge before the jury had a chance to consider them. Nothing that the Government have put forward deals with that scenario.</p>

The Government particularly demeaned themselves at the end of the Jubilee line trial, when they put it about in the press that the jury was at fault&#151;a point that emerged clearly during the interviews with the jurors.</p>

trials can be made to work, as has already been shown by the Lord Chief Justice&#146;s protocols and guidelines on how such cases can be conducted. It simply is not good enough the Solicitor-General&#146;s saying that there are all sorts of cases that are never brought to court&#151;cases that are never tried at all&#151;because of the various difficulties and the burdens on the juries.</p>

I have sat through all the proceedings, but I have not heard a persuasive argument from him to justify what will happen if this Bill goes through. In reply to the hon. Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Grieve), my hon. and learned Friend mentioned the senior judiciary, but then he backtracked and said that he could not quote them. Other than Ministers and their Parliamentary Private Secretaries, I cannot find a single person who is in favour of the Bill. Certainly I am not surprised that so many of my colleagues on the Back Benches have not come in to support the Government on this occasion.</p>

If only a few cases will be affected, why on earth are we proceeding with a measure that will have fundamental consequences for the way in which we deliver justice in this country?

I know that he is not driving it, because I did not see from him the passion that I have seen in his 15 years in the House on other issues, even other flawed Home Office Bills.

I hope that when the Division comes colleagues will realise that one cannot object to it by voting for it or abstaining. One can object to it only by opposing it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o312"><a name="70125-0019.htm_para0"><a name="07012579003120">On 20 November 2003, the then Home Secretary said that, if this proposal did not achieve the agreement of both Houses, the process of finding an acceptable alternative that did not involve a single judge sitting alone would begin. However, this is not the Bill that the Government were looking for, because it does not contain that alternative mechanism.</p>

We have tried to improve it, although our purpose was not to amend it but to bury it. The right hon. Member for Leicester, East (Keith Vaz) gave some of the reasons why this is a bad Bill.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o314"><a name="70125-0019.htm_para2"><a name="07012579003122">First, given the argument about the burdensome nature of certain cases for juries, it cannot be claimed that the Bill will not be the thin of the wedge. Other long cases have just the same effect on jurors&#146; lives. Secondly, although lawyers, judges, the police and the prosecuting authorities are entitled to support the Bill, this House has to balance other considerations. We are entitled to say that their case is not overwhelming. For example, the director of the Serious Fraud Office has said that prosecutions are sometimes not possible under the present jury system that could be held before a single judge. That suggests that jurors are not able to reach the right answer, and that more convictions could be obtained in judge-only trials. That is an unacceptable proposition, as it undermines the entire case for jury trials.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o315"><a name="70125-0019.htm_para3"><a name="07012579003123">Thirdly, the Solicitor-General keeps saying that the Government should not be misunderstood and that the Bill has been brought forward only because they want the full culpability and criminality of a case to be put before the court. If that is what we want, we must continue to improve the rules so that it can happen, and indeed many of the relevant rules have been changed in the past few months.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o316"><a name="70125-0019.htm_para4"><a name="07012579003124">Fourthly, we believe that it is important for the criminal justice process that the roles of judge and jury be separated. In serious cases that come before the senior criminal courts, the jury decides the facts and the judge decides the sentence. The SFO, the Crown Prosecution Service and Her Majesty&#146;s Revenue and Customs have not said that they cannot do their work. In fact, they do it increasingly well, and we do not get huge numbers of failed prosecutions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o317"><a name="70125-0019.htm_para5"><a name="07012579003125">Fifthly, the Solicitor-General says that the Bill will apply to about six cases a year only but, if that is true, it is not worth making this nonsensical change, as so few cases cannot be a huge burden on the criminal justice system. Sixthly, our present jury arrangements involve lay people at the highest level of the criminal justice system, and that is the most important guarantee that it retains public confidence. A move to having professionals alone deciding innocence and guilt will undermine that confidence. Moreover, successful appeals against judges&#146; decisions will undermine the respectability of the judges&#146; role.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o318"><a name="70125-0019.htm_para6"><a name="07012579003126">Seventhly, the evidence from the Jubilee line case is not that the jurors complained about the procedure.

<p><a name="stpa_o319"><a name="70125-0019.htm_para7"><a name="07012579003127">Finally, the Solicitor-General has said on previous occasions that lots of things have changed, with new orders introduced by the Lord Chief Justice, but they have been going for less than two years and are barely tried. In addition, the Fraud Act 2006 is still very new, as are some of the relevant recommendations that have been made. The system that is now in place is very new and untried: we should allow it to bed down properly.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o320"><a name="70125-0019.htm_para8"><a name="07012579003128">The Government&#146;s case for getting rid of jury trials does not improve with serial repetition. Lay juries are a fundamental guarantee that the public play a crucial part in the criminal justice process. More than ever, we need lay people to have confidence in our institutions.

Jury service is not a burden; it is a privilege. It is a privilege which derives from the freedoms with which we were all born. We did not earn the privilege; it has been passed to us from generation to generation over 800 years. Like all privileges, it is not necessarily a pleasure. Often it is not, but as the hon. Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Grieve) said earlier, jury service can be and often is a pleasure, particularly on long trials. He mentioned that long associations are made between jurors and that occasionally they marry. I recollect being invited to just such a wedding after my client, no doubt as a result of the representation that he received, was convicted by those jurors.</p>

Nobody who has sat through a long fraud case or a long trial and watched how jurors&#151;our fellow countrymen&#151;deal with these cases can agree. People come as jurors to trials believing that they will never understand them. After weeks, the fascination with the trial grows. The jurors learn; they bring concentration to the trial. All that gives the lie to the false psychology that tells us that our fellow countrymen have an attention span of three minutes.</p>

That is as much of a right. The Government are not simply giving up the right of people to be tried, but are conceding the right of professional judges to try our fellow citizens which has been with us for 800 years.</p>

I do not have a background of knowledge about the armed forces, but ever since I agreed to be a parliamentary aide to the Secretary of State for Defence nearly two years ago, I have been increasingly impressed by the work that the armed forces do in the community.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o335"><a name="70125-0020.htm_para5"><a name="07012579003689">It is often said that the armed forces are the best education that many young men and women can get. Our schools have improved over the past few years, but some people still slip through the net. They leave school with few qualifications and no skills. As well as providing those young people with a trade, the armed forces have often helped them to gain qualifications, and have even helped them with the basics of literacy and numeracy. The Army, Navy and Air Force have given many young men and women a basic education, life skills, discipline and a strong sense of identity and self-worth. As well as being an exciting and rewarding career, for many young people being in the armed forces is their education.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o336"><a name="70125-0020.htm_para6"><a name="07012579003690">It struck me that if the armed forces can help so many young people to succeed once they have left school, why can they not play a greater role while they are still at school? Traditionally, cadet forces have offered many attractions for young people, including the chance to try hill climbing, abseiling and other outdoor sports. Cadet forces have also given them opportunities to learn about subjects such as aviation and engineering, which cannot be offered by mainstream schools. They have given young people a strong sense of belonging to a community, and they have helped to instil them with a sense of self-discipline and respect.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o337"><a name="70125-0020.htm_para7"><a name="07012579003691">Today, Sir Keith Ajegbo, a former head teacher and a Home Office adviser, published a Government-commissioned report that says that more needs to be done to engage white pupils, particularly those who are working-class. His report says that white pupils can feel just as disfranchised as pupils from other ethnic backgrounds. He says:</p>
<a name="70125-0020.htm_brev9"><a name="07012579003787"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Many indigenous white pupils have negative perceptions of their own identity&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o338"><a name="70125-0020.htm_para8"><a name="07012579003692">He continues:</p>
<a name="70125-0020.htm_brev10"><a name="07012579003788"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;It makes no sense in our report to focus on minority ethnic pupils without trying to address and understand the issues for white pupils. It is these white pupils whose attitudes are overwhelmingly important in creating community cohesion.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o339"><a name="70125-0020.htm_para9"><a name="07012579003693">We could encourage some of those young people to join the cadets to regain their pride and identity and, at the same time, have great fun. The cadets are exactly what many young people need to remain engaged at school and to prevent them from becoming disillusioned, bored and, ultimately, truanting from school. At present, as well as 100,000 cadets in youth groups outside school, there are more than 40,000 cadets based in schools as part of the combined cadet  <br>

force. That investment in schools costs the taxpayer &#163;80 million a year. More than 200 of the 253 cadet school units, however, are based in independent schools. I shall not go into the reasons for that but, historically, there have always been cadet forces at our top public schools, which have long recognised their educational value.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o340"><a name="70125-0020.htm_para10"><a name="07012579003694">From the 1980s onwards, funding pressures, perhaps combined with the squeamishness of some teachers in the state sector about the armed forces, meant that the number of units dwindled. It is time for reassessment. Why should those of us who believe in a good state education sector allow public schools to monopolise a programme that could benefit children from less privileged backgrounds? Indeed, it could benefit them even more than it benefits much more affluent children. I appreciate that many teachers are concerned about the issue, and instinctively recoil from anything that smacks of militarism and authority, but I am persuaded that cadet forces offer many young people, particularly white boys, something of real educational value, and I wish that the opportunity to join was more widely available.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o341"><a name="70125-0020.htm_para11"><a name="07012579003695">The cadets offer a range of activities such as camps, expeditions, exchanges, first aid training and sports, as well as qualifications that are valuable to young people, whatever direction they take. Those qualifications include the Duke of Edinburgh&#146;s award and specialist BTECs offered by the Cadet Vocational Qualification Organisation, which says on its website:</p>
<a name="70125-0020.htm_brev11"><a name="07012579003789"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;CVQO is dedicated to helping both cadets and instructors of the Cadet Forces get ahead personally and professionally. The qualifications on offer have been designed to show employers and educators the wide range of skills that young people and adults learn in the Cadet Forces.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o342"><a name="70125-0020.htm_para12"><a name="07012579003696">I was very pleased that the Government have announced a pilot scheme to establish six new combined cadet force units in state schools. The Chancellor of the Exchequer wants more young people to join the cadets, as he believes that the programme provides</p>
<a name="70125-0020.htm_brev12"><a name="07012579003790"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;an introduction to both military and community service&#148;,</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o343"><a name="70125-0020.htm_para13"><a name="07012579003697">as well as a chance for young people to</p>
<a name="70125-0020.htm_brev13"><a name="07012579003791"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;engage in their local communities&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o344"><a name="70125-0020.htm_para14"><a name="07012579003698">However, it is about more than that, as it provides an opportunity for our armed forces to give something back to the communities that have traditionally provided many of their recruits.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o345"><a name="70125-0020.htm_para15"><a name="07012579003699">Many companies and entrepreneurs accept that they have a corporate responsibility to the communities in which they operate. In recent times, various commercial organisations have invested heavily in improvements to young people&#146;s education. For instance, in my own constituency the Conservative peer Lord Harris of Peckham, who is the owner of Carpetright, has just taken over a failing school and transformed it into an academy. After just two terms, we are beginning to see improvements at the Harris Academy Merton. If commercial organisations invest in our young people&#146;s education as part of their commitment to communities, the armed forces, too, should sign up to the principle of corporate responsibility and consider investing in more of our schools.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o346"><a name="70125-0020.htm_para16"><a name="07012579003700">I have mentioned one of my local secondary schools, but there are three in total, and I am delighted that two are now academies. At the 2005 election, I pledged to turn Mitcham Vale and Tamworth Manor schools in the east of my constituency in Mitcham, into academies. Both schools have been almost completely rebuilt since 1997, and they now have some of the best facilities anywhere in the country. Previously, however, while other schools in Merton were improving fast, they were in the bottom percentage of schools, both for GCSE results and for the value added to pupils&#146; education.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o347"><a name="70125-0020.htm_para17"><a name="07012579003701">Those of us who campaigned for academies received great support from the Department for Education and Skills, particularly from my noble Friend Lord Adonis. In fact, I cannot praise him highly enough because, with his support, we were able to find two excellent sponsors that fit perfectly the needs of the neighbourhoods served by those academies. The Church of England, which has been involved in education for centuries, took over one school, which was renamed the St. Mark&#146;s Church of England academy. The Church of England is perfect for that part of my constituency, because demographic changes have brought many black African communities with a strong Christian faith to Mitcham. They want a local faith school based on Christian values, morality and good behaviour. The new Church of England school therefore appeals to many of those parents. The other school, as I said, is sponsored by Lord Philip Harris of Peckham, the millionaire owner of Carpetright. As a local businessman who sees himself as coming from a very modest background, he, too, is a perfect role model for young people in my constituency, except, of course, for the fact that he is a Conservative peer.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o348"><a name="70125-0020.htm_para18"><a name="07012579003702">Since becoming academies, both schools have made enormous strides. There has been an immediate change of ethos, there are new uniforms, and there is a new approach to discipline and hard work. Residents tell me that behaviour has improved on the way to and from school. Young people want to work hard and get good results, and they tell me that the atmosphere in class is much more professional. One girl told me that bullying has stopped and she is no longer afraid to go to school. Last year, before they became academies, the two schools received only 132 first choice applications combined for the 480 places available, and overall there were more than 900 unfilled places. However, just last week I learned that they will be oversubscribed next year, such is the support from local parents.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o349"><a name="70125-0020.htm_para19"><a name="07012579003703">Unfortunately, there is a third school in my constituency. Although the two academies in Mitcham have got off to a fantastic start, Bishopsford community school in the south of my constituency is still struggling. Bishopsford is based in the predominantly white estate of St. Helier. Its latest GCSE results showed just 27 per cent. of pupils passing five or more exams at grade C or above, and if we disaggregate the boys and girls, I suggest that we will find the boys doing much worse. Two weeks ago the school was given a notice to improve by Ofsted, following an inspection in November. If it does not improve, it will be placed on special measures.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o350"><a name="70125-0020.htm_para20"><a name="07012579003704">Much is already happening to try and improve the school. There is a new head, Andrew Barker, who I am sure will prove a very good appointment, and who I hope will have the support of parents, pupils and teachers. The school has been completely renovated under a private finance initiative programme that has delivered some excellent buildings and playing fields, and it has received extra funding and support under the Fresh Start initiative. But one thing that I have learned from my experience with our academies is that they have been able to improve substantially by changing their identity and ethos. They have to offer something that chimes with the parents and communities around those schools.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o351"><a name="70125-0020.htm_para21"><a name="07012579003705">What can Bishopsford offer its parents and pupils to make it a more attractive proposition? How can it shine when there are other good schools elsewhere? I have met the director of education at Merton council, the LEA covering Bishopsford, and the Under-Secretary of State with responsibility for schools, my noble Friend Lord Adonis, and they have been extremely supportive of plans to improve the school. They have also shown an interest in the potential for involving a cadet force in the school&#146;s improvement plan.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o352"><a name="70125-0020.htm_para22"><a name="07012579003706">A partnership with the armed forces, through the cadets, would add greatly to the appeal of Bishopsford school, reduce many of its internal problems, and help it compete against other schools in the area. Such a partnership would offer it a new unique selling point that would help it first to survive, and then to thrive. The St. Helier estate on which Bishopsford school is based has strong links with the armed forces. A number of houses and flats have been built for ex-servicemen and women on the Haig Homes housing association estate in Green lane, which is next to St. Helier station. Hundreds of ex-service families live in the community.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o353"><a name="70125-0020.htm_para23"><a name="07012579003707">The Royal British Legion is one of our most active and welcome community organisations, offering grants and support to former servicemen and women in my constituency. I often refer individual cases of people who come to my advice surgery to the legion, and I find it quick, helpful and extremely supportive. Other regimental charities also frequently help out in cases of hardship and need in the St. Helier area. If the armed forces wish to extend their commitment to the communities in which they operate, I can think of few better contributions they could make than establishing a cadet force at Bishopsford school.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o354"><a name="70125-0020.htm_para24"><a name="07012579003708">I appreciate the opportunity to praise the cadets and the Government&#146;s commitment to improving young people&#146;s life chances. I hope that this Adjournment debate is useful. I warmly welcome the work that the Government have done to extend the combined cadet forces to more state schools. I believe that many young people, especially working class boys and girls, would like the opportunity to take part in the activities that the CCF offers. The CCF is a further demonstration, if one were needed, of the armed forces&#146; reputation for offering good educational opportunities. I should like the cadets to be extended to many more state schools as a way of contributing something back to the communities in which they operate. I am not alone in wanting that to happen, and I have spoken to several hon. Friends who are as excited as me about the prospect of extending cadets to more state schools.</p>

Friend the Member for Nottingham, North (Mr. Allen) has even gone as far as working towards persuading the armed forces to sponsor a local academy. My noble friend Lord Adonis is also interested in pursuing that idea. I hope that the debate has helped put many of the arguments in favour of it. I hope that Bishopsford school in my constituency might be considered as the base for a new cadet unit in the near future to help it improve the life chances of young people in St. Helier, Mitcham and Morden.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o356"><a name="70125-0020.htm_para26"><a name="07012579003710">I am grateful for the opportunity to present the case.</p>

Friend the Member for Mitcham and Morden (Siobhain McDonagh) on securing the Adjournment debate. I am delighted that she is such a keen advocate of our cadets and I was pleased to hear her speak so highly of the tremendous benefits they offer our young people. As she acknowledges, the cadet forces are a genuine success story.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o357"><a name="70125-0020.htm_para27"><a name="07012579003712">With a membership of some 130,000, the cadets are one of the biggest youth organisations in this country today. They make a huge contribution to local communities and our nation&#146;s youth. I know that they are highly valued by my colleagues in the Department for Education and Skills, the Home Office and across Government.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o358"><a name="70125-0020.htm_para28"><a name="07012579003713">I should like to begin by setting out the structure of our cadet forces. That will help clarify the funding structure. In total, the Ministry of Defence sponsors four separate cadet forces. The vast majority of the funding we provide&#151;some 89 per cent. of the total&#151;goes to the three single service cadet forces: the Sea Cadet Corps, the Army Cadet Force and the Air Training Corps. Together, they account for 88,000 cadets and 24,000 volunteers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o359"><a name="70125-0020.htm_para29"><a name="07012579003714">All three cadet forces are community based in more than 3,000 locations in towns and cities throughout the country. Indeed, in many small towns they are the most visible defence presence. There are plenty of opportunities for young people to join their local cadet force&#151;including in my hon. Friend&#146;s constituency of Mitcham and Morden. Any boy or girl who wants to become a cadet in the Morden area can join any of the single service cadet forces. All are well represented in the area.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o360"><a name="70125-0020.htm_para30"><a name="07012579003715">The fourth cadet force, which receives 11 per cent. of total Ministry of Defence funding, is the combined cadet force. The CCF is based solely in schools and has a further 42,000 cadets with 2,000 volunteers. Today, the establishment of a CCF is open to any school prepared and able to support one. There are 253 CCF contingents based in schools around the country&#151;currently 52 of them are in state schools, but as my hon. Friend knows, the figure will be increased by a further six schools through the new pilot schemes that we have announced.</p>

The school chooses the section, and the choice is often based on the preferences of the young people. Each CCF is a partnership between the  <br>

individual school and the Ministry of Defence, with the head recommending officers and instructors from the school staff. The Ministry of Defence provides training, some equipment and administrative support. However, I stress that the commitment of the school, the pupils, and especially the teaching staff, are critical to the success of the CCF.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o362"><a name="70125-0021.htm_para1"><a name="07012579003717">The CCF had its origins in boarding schools because those children were not able to join community-based cadet forces. Given that most boarding schools were in the independent sector&#151;although some were state schools&#151;it followed that most CCFs were in independent schools.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o363"><a name="70125-0021.htm_para2"><a name="07012579003718">I want to make one crucial point, however. My hon. Friend suggested that the majority of Ministry of Defence funding goes to CCFs in those independent schools. That is not the case. In fact, the share of the cadet budget given to independent schools today represents only 9 per cent. of Ministry of Defence expenditure on all cadets throughout the country.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o364"><a name="70125-0021.htm_para3"><a name="07012579003719">Over the years, CCF units have spread beyond the boarding sector to include other state schools. We want to build on that success to give more children in the state sector the opportunity to benefit from membership of a CCF. That is why we announced a pilot scheme to expand CCF units in the state sector, in an initiative that the Treasury is funding to the tune of an additional &#163;800,000.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o365"><a name="70125-0021.htm_para4"><a name="07012579003720">The first school to participate in the pilot, Haberdasher&#146;s Aske&#146;s in London, was announced last year. I announced four more schools in England and Wales earlier this month, and we aim to announce the final participant in the pilot&#151;hopefully from Scotland&#151;soon. Those schools were chosen from among those that applied for the scheme, and my hon. Friend may be aware that Bishopsford community school did not apply. I understand the points she made in her speech.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o366"><a name="70125-0021.htm_para5"><a name="07012579003721">In deciding which schools to select, we had to take into account a number of factors, including geographical spread, the facilities at the school and its capacity to provide the level of commitment from busy teachers and other staff to make the CCF work, as well as the availability of MOD personnel to help with staffing. It was a pretty stringent process&#151;it had to be&#151;and I am confident that the schools we have chosen will give the pilot scheme the best possible prospect of success. I can equally understand the disappointment of the schools and their supporters who were not included in the scheme.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o367"><a name="70125-0021.htm_para6"><a name="07012579003722">Our pilot scheme will run for three years, which will give us the opportunity to determine demand and our capacity to expand further. We will be working closely with these schools throughout the process, building strong and effective educational partnerships with each contingent and giving as much support as possible. In the meantime, we will also continue to keep in touch with those schools that expressed an interest in having a CCF, so that we can get a clear picture of the demand.</p>

into schools that are currently in difficulty and are not achieving the sort of results that the Government would hope for? Perhaps something rather similar to the academy process could be directed.</p>

I take her points on board.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o368"><a name="70125-0021.htm_para7"><a name="07012579003725">As I was saying, our pilot scheme will run for three years, which will give us the opportunity to determine demand&#151;that is the important thing&#151;and our capacity to expand in future. I was also saying that we will keep in touch with those schools and I would encourage any school that is applying to log on to the MOD website for further information.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o369"><a name="70125-0021.htm_para8"><a name="07012579003726">The cadets are a huge and diverse organisation. In fact, I think it is pretty fair to say that there is no such person as a &#147;typical&#148; cadet. What they do have in common is a huge range of opportunities to offer our young people to help them meet the challenges and realise their potential. The cadet forces are the largest operating authority for the Duke of Edinburgh award, and I am not sure that it is widely known that membership gives young people the opportunity to gain nationally recognised qualifications.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o370"><a name="70125-0021.htm_para9"><a name="07012579003727">The cadets, not just the combined cadet forces, are Edexcel&#146;s most successful partner in the delivery of the BTEC first diploma in public services, and more than 8,000 cadets have so far gained that qualification, which is not widely known. The BTEC is a vocational qualification equivalent to 4 GCSEs at A to C level. It is a qualification that can make a huge difference to a child&#146;s life chances, because without it, nearly half those children would have left school with fewer than five GCSEs. For others, the qualification is enough to provide a vital step-up into further education, or in some cases it has contributed to cadets getting into their university of choice.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o371"><a name="70125-0021.htm_para10"><a name="07012579003728">The curriculum is expanding all the time. A first diploma in the performing arts has recently been introduced and a BTEC engineering diploma and a team-leading certificate will be launched shortly. All  <br>

those qualifications are provided at no cost to the cadets taking part. As I said before, we are committed to opening up those opportunities for our young people.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o372"><a name="70125-0021.htm_para11"><a name="07012579003729">The MOD is playing a key role in driving forward the Government youth agenda. We are working closely with the Youth Justice Board, for example, to explore ways in which the cadet forces can help young people at risk of offending. While the cadets are very much the flagship of the MOD youth agenda, we are also working with other Government Departments&#151;most notably, the DFES&#151;on a number of other initiatives such as the skill force programme, which helps to provide alternative training for young people at risk of exclusion.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o373"><a name="70125-0021.htm_para12"><a name="07012579003730">We are also working closely with the Home Office on helping vulnerable young people through the outreach programme and on an Army Cadet Force youth and community project, which helps socially disengaged young people to become responsible citizens. The success of the scheme has been independently evaluated by the National Association for the Care and Resettlement of Offenders, showing an 85 per cent. improvement in school attendance and community behaviour. These results are excellent. I should add that the Home Office&#146;s historically important funding of this project also makes an important contribution.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o374"><a name="70125-0021.htm_para13"><a name="07012579003731">These are exciting times for the cadet forces. Their potential and importance has been recognised across government, and they represent a success story that we want to carry forward. But let us not forget that this success owes much to a very special group of people: the adults who devote a huge amount of time and energy to running cadet forces up and down the country. Each and every one is deeply committed, and we are very grateful for the work they do, as it really does make a difference to the lives of so many young people.</p>
