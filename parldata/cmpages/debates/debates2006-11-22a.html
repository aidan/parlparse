it monitors performance. In addition, there is mandatory surveillance
for MRSA and other infections. People admitted to hospital are
vulnerable, and of course there are infections, but we must make sure

increase in cases of Clostridium difficile in Northern Ireland, and
given that deaths from MRSA have risen fourfold in the past four years

the power to override managers and insist on closing wards, isolating
patients when clinically necessary, even if that means breaching
Government targets?</p><p><a name="st_o6"><a name="06112238000033"><b><a name="61122-0001.htm_spnew6"><a name="06112238000771">Paul

those issues. Although he presents a long-term picture he, like me,
will be encouraged by the fact that MRSA infections in our hospitals
show signs of decreasing as a result of the rigorous enforcement of
strategies that have been put in place. If it is clinically necessary
to close a ward, we will do so. It is important, however, to prevent
infections in the first place, particularly through the ward sisters
charter that I launched a few weeks ago, in which we make it quite
clear that the ward sister is in charge. Whether someone is a
consultant or a cleaner, a patient or a visitor, they have a
responsibility to make sure that the hospital is kept as clean as

absolutely key; if it falls over on Friday, there are no prospects of

to be a lot of point in proceeding with the rest of the process. I
remind the right hon. Gentleman that, as the hon. Member for Foyle

particularly given his key position as Chairman of the Northern Ireland
Affairs Committee. It was always the case that nobody will be taking
ministerial office on Friday. Ministerial office is taken on 26 March
when the pledge is taken. On Friday, it is an absolutely key and
indispensable part of the St. Andrews process&#151;let the
House be in no doubt about that&#151;that the parties make an
indication to nominate for 26 March, when the pledge will be taken.
Everybody knows that when they give that indication on Friday, they
accept the process whereby they will be taking the pledge when they
assume full ministerial office, because it will be the law of the land,
assuming that the legislation receives Royal Assent. That is what
should proceed on Friday; if it does not, I do not think that people
will have any confidence at all in the rest of the

that I made in passing last night. If inflammatory statements are made
by DUP Members about never devolving policing and justice &#147;in my
political lifetime&#148;, that is hardly an encouragement to Sinn
Fein to move as quickly as we all want it to move on policing. It is
already co-operating on policing, as it needs to do and as any
democratic party holding ministerial office needs to do. If it is a
question of moving the process forward, making statements such as
&#147;never in my lifetime&#148; when Parliament has expressly
legislated for the devolution of policing and justice is hardly an
encouragement to those who need to fulfil their obligations on policing

quickly.</p><a name="subhd_o2"><a name="61122-0001.htm_sbhd2"><a name="06112238000019"><h3 align="center">Sewel

helps to deal with some of the causes of extremism in some of the
madrassahs. Not all madrassahs are as my hon. Friend describes, but it
is important that those that are potential breeding grounds for
terrorism are dealt with. One of the most hopeful signs that I got from
my visit to Pakistan was the sense that it understood that anything

Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs (Margaret
Beckett):</b> It seems generally accepted that the
international environment in which our country finds itself is one of
the most difficult and complex that it has seen for many a year. It is
difficult because international challenges&#151;global terrorism,
nuclear proliferation, climate change, conflicts within and between
states, illegal migration, rapid globalisation in some parts of the
world and chronic underdevelopment in others&#151;are increasing both
in scale and severity. Their direct impact on Britain is increasing,
too. Foreign policy is one of the most crucial means by which we can
deliver on our domestic priorities. That international environment is
complex, because its many different aspects are closely linked and are
mutually reinforcing; they cannot each be dealt with in isolation, but
must be tackled
together.</p><p><a name="stpa_o15"><a name="61122-0004.htm_para3"><a name="06112238000156">Let me begin
by setting out some of the most immediate and urgent challenges that we
face. The Prime Minister has stated often that there is no more
pressing diplomatic task for the country or the international community
than to seek a peaceful resolution to the ongoing conflict between
Israel and the Palestinians. If we can do so, it will benefit the
entire region and remove a key source of global tension and division.
That is why we are working closely with the European Union, the United
States and regional partners, both to develop practical initiatives,
such as strengthening Palestinian institutions and improving
Palestinian security, and to restart the political process
itself.</p><p><a name="stpa_o16"><a name="61122-0004.htm_para4"><a name="06112238000157">At the same
time, we remain one of the world&#146;s biggest donors to the
Palestinian people; this year alone, despite our concerns about a Hamas
Government in office, we have committed &#163;30 million to the
people of Palestine, and played a key role in developing the main
international mechanism through which all donors can channel assistance
while bypassing the Hamas-run Finance Ministry. We intend to contribute
&#163;12 million through that temporary

people have already pointed the finger at Syria, but it is too early to

destructive meddling in Lebanon. It is increasingly the will of the
international community that there should be an end to outside
interference in Lebanese affairs, as was mandated by Security Council
resolution 1559. Indeed, as we have identified before, Syria faces a
strategic choice. If the Syrian authorities are ready to play a
constructive role in the region, we have made it clear that we will be

road.</p><p><a name="stpa_o20"><a name="61122-0004.htm_para8"><a name="06112238000176">The same
strategic choice faces Iran. We, with France, Germany and our other
European partners, are leading efforts to encourage Iran to address
international concerns about its nuclear ambitions, its support for
terrorism and its dismal internal human rights record. Thanks in part
to those efforts, the international community is now more united than
it has been for a long time, and the Iranian regime has been presented
with a clear choice. On the one hand, we have offered Iran the chance
of an improved relationship with not only Europe, but the wider
international community. That would give Iran help in developing a
civil nuclear power programme, an energy partnership and a trade
co-operation partnership with the European Union. It would give Iran
help with joining the World Trade Organisation and with the first
lifting of US sanctions since the 1979 resolution in some areas of real
need. However, if, on the other hand, Iran continues to defy the
International Atomic Energy Agency and the Security Council, it should
be in no doubt that that relationship will deteriorate and that the

security forces is well under way. Prime Minister Maliki is determined
to press ahead with that, and we are equally determined to help him to
do so successfully and sustainably. We expect Najaf to be the next
province to be transferred to Iraqi control in December. In our own
area of responsibility, we expect Maysan to follow in January, and the
progress of our current operation in Basra gives us confidence that we
may be able to achieve transition in that province too at some point

half going to Africa; to cancel debt worth another $50 billion; and to
provide AIDS treatment to everyone who needs it. During our presidency

ambitious pro-development deal that we all want. There have been some
encouraging signs. Pascal Lamy has restarted WTO negotiations at a
technical level. Leaders at the Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation
summit in Hanoi made a commitment to break the deadlock, and they
recognised that to do so all sides would have to move beyond their

together on that agenda, which is clearly in all of our interests, it
weakens the hope of building a global consensus, whether on
counter-terrorism, international crime or energy security. Nowhere is
that need for mutual trust and action more obvious or vital than in the
global challenge that may come to define our generation&#151;climate

policy issue simply fail to grasp the sheer magnitude of the challenge
that we face. An unstable climate will place huge additional strain on
the international tensions that we are already trying to resolve. Many
of them are at breaking point, but climate change has the potential to
stretch them far beyond that point. As I have reminded the House

role in pushing ambition in the EU, through our increasing co-operation

states in the United States, Britain is helping to set and drive the
agenda&#151;but no country, however powerful, can address any of the

focused debate, especially on Afghanistan, as that was at the heart of
the terrorist problem that we faced on 11 September. The Foreign

address fundamentally how the distraction of Iraq had undermined our
effectiveness in dealing with the problem in
Afghanistan.</p><p><a name="st_o143"><a name="06112238000227"><b><a name="61122-0005.htm_spnew14"><a name="06112238000926">Mr.

take a few as well, if they arise.</p><p><a name="stpa_o40"><a name="61122-0005.htm_para14"><a name="06112238000228">In the past year alone, as the
Foreign Secretary said, we have seen the escalation of two major
attempts to break out of the constraints of the non-proliferation
treaty, to one of which there has been a fairly effective and united
response but to the other of which there has not. We have seen the
continued unacceptable abuse of human rights in countries such as North
Korea, Burma and Zimbabwe. We have seen continuing conflicts in some
parts of Africa, with the United Nations sometimes struggling to assert
its authority. In the western Balkans there have been signs of a slow
reversal in some of the progress that has been made. Of course, we have
all been immensely concerned by what appears to be a steady
deterioration in the situation in the wider middle east, which has
inflicted a terrible human toll on Iraq, Afghanistan, Lebanon and Gaza.
I echo what the Foreign Secretary has said about the outrage that we
all feel about the assassination of Mr. Gemayel yesterday in
Lebanon. It has reminded us of how serious the situation is. It is not
unreasonable, in the light of that and other recent events, to be
genuinely alarmed about the situation and worried that our policies
might be overtaken by events.</p><br>

mistake our readiness to debate such matters for a sign of weakness.
Far from it&#151;it is a sure demonstration of our strength.
Nevertheless, when the Chief of the General Staff speaks out as he did
about the presence of our troops in Iraq, when the Prime Minister

credit&#151;to a televised suggestion that the situation there is a
disaster and when the Chancellor says that the decisions that were made
in the early days could and perhaps should have been different,
Ministers should be neither surprised nor irritated that others in this
House have many questions to ask. The public want to know where we have
gone wrong, why mistakes were made and what Britain should do next to
improve matters. Just as the Government are entitled to support for
many of their objectives, the House is entitled to ask many

together for proper access for aid workers, the implementation of peace
agreements and the acceptance by the Government of Sudan of a United
Nations peacekeeping force. The framework determined at the weekend
between the UN Secretary-General and the Khartoum Government to add UN
forces to the African Union mission in Sudan appears to be a major step
forward and we welcome the comments of the Prime Minister and the
Foreign Secretary today about achieving a larger, stronger and better
equipped force in Sudan, and further intense pressure being placed on
the Sudanese Government, if
necessary.</p><p><a name="stpa_o45"><a name="61122-0005.htm_para19"><a name="06112238000235">In those
matters, we are at one with the Government, and the same is true of
another area of crisis in recent months&#151;North Korea. Its testing
of a nuclear device met with clear resolve and unity in the UN Security
Council, including a vital and determined response from China. The
return of North Korea to the six-party talks is testament to the
influence of the Security Council when acting in a united fashion. I
know that the Foreign Secretary agrees that it is imperative to
maintain that resolve. North Korea must not be allowed simply to buy
time or deflect international criticism by going along with talks, and
the sanctions against North Korea must be enforced
rigorously.</p><p><a name="stpa_o46"><a name="61122-0005.htm_para20"><a name="06112238000236">Perhaps
the Secretary of State for Defence can say in his winding-up speech
whether he is confident that the coalition necessary to enforce those
sanctions, especially the provision on cargo inspections, is in place
and that any supply of nuclear technology to North Korea can be
detected and stopped, especially without South Korean co-operation in
the proliferation security initiative. Perhaps he can also say whether
the onward proliferation of material from North Korea to other
countries can be prevented and whether United Kingdom naval assets will
have a role to play in boarding and inspecting suspect
vessels.</p><p><a name="stpa_o47"><a name="61122-0005.htm_para21"><a name="06112238000237">The response
to North Korea is in sharp contrast with that to Iran. The importance
of Iran&#146;s progress in nuclear capability is hard to overstate,
especially given the possible effect of that success on the intentions
of half-a-dozen or so other middle eastern nations, which may wish to
develop a nuclear arsenal of their own. If that happens, the efforts of
two generations of world leaders, diplomats and intelligence agencies
to prevent the uncontrolled spread of nuclear weapons will be in
ruins.</p>

international community is in danger of losing credibility in its

Since Iran was referred to the Security Council by the International
Atomic Energy Agency on 4 February this year, because it was
found to be in grave breach of the non-proliferation treaty, nine
months have passed with no substantive action by the international
community. Together, the members of the Security Council have potent

informal restrictive measures against Iran. They should at least be
prepared to do that. Such measures could include EU action against

Korea in the past year demonstrates beyond doubt that the
non-proliferation treaty is in urgent need of attention and some
repair. Up to 40 countries are now considered to have the technical
know-how to produce nuclear weapons, and black market proliferators are
at work. The risk of a nuclear device or nuclear material falling into
the hands of terrorists has grown. Thinking is going on around the
world about how to strengthen the bargain inherent in a
non-proliferation treaty, possibly by the creation, some argue, of
international fuel banks to make enriched uranium accessible to all
legitimate nation state customers for peaceful purposes.</p><p><a name="stpa_o53"><a name="61122-0006.htm_para5"><a name="06112238000251">Is it not now time for this

deploys, so the UK has set a rather good example in that respect. What
happens in the future is a matter for debate, but I was glad to hear
the Foreign Secretary say earlier that she is committed to maintaining
a British nuclear deterrent, since there had been some discussion in

quickly to discussing the situation in the wider middle east, which has
become a cauldron of dangers where the prospects for peace have gone
backwards rather than forwards in some respects in recent months. The
various crises in Afghanistan, Iraq, Lebanon and the
Israeli-Palestinian post-peace process should be approached first of
all with frankness, as over-optimistic assessments destroy our
credibility and undermine public support; then with realism,
acknowledging that there are no quick fixes; and long-term application
and planning. Many of these problems will be with us throughout the
life of this Government and well into the next. We must make every
possible effort to work with cultures that are very different from our
own.</p><p><a name="stpa_o56"><a name="61122-0006.htm_para8"><a name="06112238000256">It is
particularly important not to think of these conflicts as simply
different fronts in a single struggle, as the motivation of an Iraqi
militia man may be very different from that of a supporter of Hezbollah
in Lebanon and quite different again from that of an al-Qaeda terrorist
hiding on the Afghan-Pakistan border. Terrorism is now the greatest
threat to our national security, but it does not come from a single or
simple source and our rhetoric should not encourage the idea that we
are engaged in a clash of civilisations. It should encourage the idea
that we are in the business of making long-term friends among the many
peoples and Governments of the middle east and north Africa who have no
hostility towards us.</p><p><a name="stpa_o57"><a name="61122-0006.htm_para9"><a name="06112238000257">Our strategy should not lump
countries and peoples together, but appreciate their differences. Syria
may respond differently in future from Iran and perceptions held by

states. Similarly, recognition in the House that terrorism cannot be
defeated by military means alone&#151;partly, as it has turned out,
because it has some of its roots in our own society as well as
overseas&#151;means that in fighting it, we must uphold our own

Minister ranged over some middle east issues in his major speech on
foreign policy last week, but we would like to understand more about
what it meant in practice. It seemed that its emphasis on dialogue with
Iran and Syria was meant to be significant and new, but the policy that
he articulated was not. Ministers have always been open to dialogue
with Syria and Iran, as indeed they should be. The Foreign Secretary
did not discuss what thought has been given to the wider diplomatic
machinery that could be established, irrespective of Syrian and Iranian
engagement. It may be difficult to secure that, but those countries
could join in such machinery in the future. There is surely a good case
for creating a contact group of major powers, working closely with
constructive nations of the region such as Turkey, Jordan and the
countries of the Gulf Co-operation Council. Such a group could be
developed and strengthened over
time.</p><p><a name="stpa_o59"><a name="61122-0006.htm_para11"><a name="06112238000259">That may be one
of the ideas being considered in Washington by the Baker commission. It
is important that there be British engagement with that commission, and
the Prime Minister was absolutely right to speak to its members last
week. However, the Secretary of State did not say what continuing
contact Foreign Office Ministers will have with that commission and
whether parallel thinking is taking place here on this side of the
Atlantic at the same time. Although we have already debated the case
for an inquiry on Iraq&#151;we will return to it on another
occasion&#151;I hope that Ministers will be clear that one of the
things that everyone will wish to examine in future is the advice given
by the British Government to the Bush Administration now and in the
coming weeks. I hope that the Defence Secretary will be able to expand
on that later
today.</p><p><a name="stpa_o60"><a name="61122-0006.htm_para12"><a name="06112238000260">International
co-operation and external support for Iraq, anchored in a powerful
contact group, are almost certainly necessary, given that at some stage
an Iraqi Government will have to stand on their own. Whenever that is,
their early days could be shaky, to say the least. Equally, however,
external diplomacy alone is not going to solve the problems that have
now arisen within Iraq and we should not delude ourselves into thinking
that it will. Surely those problems can be solved only there.</p><p><a name="stpa_o61"><a name="61122-0006.htm_para13"><a name="06112238000261">On the background, I suspect
that there is still a lot of common ground between Ministers and
Opposition Front Benchers. We, like them, believe that the invasion of
Iraq and the overthrow of Saddam Hussein were justified. We, like them,
believe that many mistakes were made in the aftermath, although they
are irritated when we say so even though they say so themselves. We
agree with them that the adoption of an arbitrary timetable for
withdrawal would be unwise, given that it would obviously set a
timetable for insurgent activity itself, but the Foreign Secretary
suggested in her speech today a hopeful transfer of more responsibility
to Iraqi forces. At the same time, I suspect that we all recognise that
a partition of Iraq is unlikely to present a solution, other than an
extraordinarily bloody and violent one, and that the military means
available are no longer sufficient on their own to guarantee
success.</p><br>

increased involvement of troops in training Iraqi forces. A lot has
been done already. Is there a similar line of thinking among our own
Government? To what use will the &#163;100 million offered by the
Chancellor at the weekend actually be put? Our assessment of the
importance of these domestic objectives and whether they can be
realised within Iraq will surely determine the effectiveness of our
military contribution and our international diplomacy. Only when we
know that the Iraqi Government are capable of accomplishing those
objectives can we all assess how long our military presence will be
useful. The same applies to Afghanistan.</p><p><a name="st_o156"><a name="06112238000264"><b><a name="61122-0006.htm_spnew10"><a name="06112238000939">Jim

Foreign Secretary and the shadow Foreign Secretary set out the vast

the Foreign Secretary was right to say is as much a matter of foreign

the Foreign Secretary said in her opening remarks, this is a
fast-changing and uncertain world. That puts stresses and strains not
experienced for generations on the diplomatic corps and armed forces.
Nowhere is that more obvious than in Iraq. The Liberal Democrats

strategy.</p><p><a name="stpa_o99"><a name="61122-0007.htm_para27"><a name="06112238000319">Britain has

capabilities have been stretched in the last few years, and
particularly in the last few months as Britain has taken on its extra
responsibilities in Afghanistan. Five years after the invasion to oust
the Taliban, the need to support a free and democratic
Afghanistan&#151;free from international terrorists&#151;is
unchanged, and for our own safety here at home we need to be
successful. As has been said, huge progress has been made, not least
thanks to the sustained efforts of our armed forces, diplomats and
others, and also our European and NATO allies&#151;but the successes
are in danger, and our mission has clearly changed. Over the past six
months, we have had to face up to the consequences of the disastrous
diversion in Iraq as the Taliban has re-emerged more violent and more
focused than ever. That has meant British soldiers fighting a war
rather than keeping the
peace.</p><p><a name="stpa_o104"><a name="61122-0007.htm_para32"><a name="06112238000325">Our armed
forces face enormous challenges and terrible dangers. They must have
the weaponry, the equipment and the assets that they need, and along
with our NATO allies we must have a coherent strategy with the
resources to make it work&#151;but that will not provide the whole
solution. Hearts and minds will not be won by military action alone.
Such action must be one part of a concerted approach, with adequate
resources to create new livelihoods that do not depend on the export of
death and misery from the poppy fields. Building a new country is
essential if we are to avoid another failed state; otherwise we are in
danger of failing that state, and reaping the consequences here at
home.</p><p><a name="stpa_o105"><a name="61122-0007.htm_para33"><a name="06112238000326">That is also
true of the middle east. The horrors of yesterday&#146;s events in
Lebanon go beyond the terrible tragedy of Pierre Gemayel&#146;s
assassination. Whoever was responsible, and whoever lies behind whoever
was responsible, has made the terrible calculation that to destabilise
Lebanon further after the disastrous war with Israel earlier in the
summer and the political manoeuvrings of recent weeks will advance
their influence and cause. But to what end? If there is one recurring
lesson in the middle east it is surely that violence generates violence
and disaster for all the peoples of the region, and even by the bloody
standards of the conflicts of the last few decades, this has been a
truly appalling year.</p><br>

earlier this year, and in recent weeks the shelling of Israelis from
Gaza has created more fear, injury and death. In such circumstances
there can be no doubt that Israel has a right to defend itself, but
there are constraints under international law. Once again in recent
weeks&#151;as we saw earlier in the year&#151;the scale of
Israel&#146;s military response has been disproportionate. While this
goes on, the prospects for peace remain limited. Nevertheless, the

Khartoum regime is a coalition, and that not all the people in it are
necessarily guilty of the problems in Darfur. As China could do more

one further issue in particular: cluster munitions. Earlier this summer
up to 1 million bomblets were fired on Lebanon, and it is reported that
only 50 per cent. detonated on impact. Of the cluster-bomb strikes, 90
per cent. occurred in the last 72 hours of the conflict in Lebanon.
That has left up to 500,000 devices that are still live, littering
hillsides, villages, orchards and fields in civilian areas. Reports say
that so far at least 21 Lebanese civilians, including children, have
been killed and more than 100 have been injured by late-detonating
bomblets.</p><p><a name="stpa_o113"><a name="61122-0008.htm_para5"><a name="06112238000342">On Monday,
Israel admitted that its use of cluster munitions broke its own army
rules. General Halutz said that there were enough grounds from a
preliminary inquiry to convene an official investigation into whether
court-martial offences had been committed. Such admissions are welcome,
and we hope that an official investigation will be undertaken, and that
those responsible will be held to account. The point is, however, that
such munitions should be banned; as the Secretary of State for
International Development has said, they are equivalent to land
mines.</p><p><a name="stpa_o114"><a name="61122-0008.htm_para6"><a name="06112238000343">What is being
done to get them banned? Earlier today, the Prime Minister did not
address that question when it was put to him by my hon. Friend the
Member for Dunfermline and West Fife (Willie Rennie), who asked about
Britain&#146;s role at the conference in Geneva last week. Is it
right that Britain obstructed progress at those talks? Also, can we be
told a little more about the distinction that we understand is
beginning to be made between &#147;dumb&#148; and
&#147;smart&#148; cluster munitions&#151;a distinction which,
frankly, very few people outside the United Kingdom Government seem to

took the lead. It is nonsense to say that no nation other than the
United Kingdom understands the distinction between &#147;dumb&#148;
and &#147;not dumb&#148; cluster munitions. At a conference at the
beginning of November, we took the lead in trying to get a mandate to
discuss those issues between the states parties&#151;the convention
on certain conventional weapons parties. We have obtained that. The
Norwegian initiative, which I think the hon. Member for Dunfermline and
West Fife was referring to in his question today to the Prime Minister,
would take the issue outside that forum. That means that it would be
discussed by people&#151;very well-meaning people, no
doubt&#151;who do not use or produce cluster weapons. We have taken
the lead in getting the issue discussed among producers and users of
cluster weapons, because we think that that is the most important step
forward to
take.</p><p><a name="st_o185"><a name="06112238000346"><b><a name="61122-0008.htm_spnew6"><a name="06112238000967">Mr.

very high level indeed.</p><p><a name="stpa_o116"><a name="61122-0008.htm_para8"><a name="06112238000347">On the second point, it has
been very difficult to get information on the Government&#146;s

perhaps the most extensive statement that we have thus far had. I
suggest to her that she might wish to make a written

Gerald Kaufman (Manchester, Gorton) (Lab):</b> I want to
welcome the visit of my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister to
Pakistan, and to emphasise the important links between Pakistan and
this country. I very much hope that these improved links will lead at

appreciate the reference in the Gracious Speech to the situation in
Palestine, which remains one of the worst injustices in the world. The
fact that there are other tragedies does not detract from the nature of
that tragedy. What is more, it is a running sore that will poison the
middle east until a solution has been arrived at. Members in all parts
of the House have condemned the assassination of Mr. Gemayel
in Lebanon, but it has to be pointed out that the Israeli Government
carry out targeted assassinations of Palestinian leaders regularly and
frequently, often killing innocent people in doing so. The Israelis
complain&#151;justifiably&#151;about the impact on their country
and its morale of rockets fired from the Gaza strip on to, for example,
the home town of the Israeli Defence Minister, Amir Peretz. But they
now admit that they have used cluster bombs illegally in their invasion
of Lebanon.</p><p><a name="stpa_o120"><a name="61122-0008.htm_para12"><a name="06112238000352">Let us
remember that, although this was called a war between Israel and
Lebanon, it was not: it was a war between Israel and Hezbollah, which
was accompanied by an Israeli invasion of, and appalling damage and
casualties to, Lebanon. That invasion, which achieved none of its
objectives&#151;the two kidnapped soldiers remain kidnapped, and the
threat from Hezbollah remains and will continue&#151;attracted
international attention. However, it must be pointed out that, although
that invasion was deeply culpable, it is not the only Israeli invasion
and aggression that has taken place in the middle east. Israeli
soldiers have been kidnapped by Hezbollah and by Hamas, but the
Israelis themselves kidnap people&#151;including many members of the
Palestinian Government&#151;but of course, they call it
&#147;arrest&#148;, not kidnapping, so that is all right.</p><p><a name="stpa_o121"><a name="61122-0008.htm_para13"><a name="06112238000353">Gaza remains the hidden tragedy
in which Israelis indiscriminately slaughter innocent civilians,
including many children. When 13 members of one family, including
children and a baby, were killed by the Israelis a short while ago, the
Israeli Prime Minister called it a &#147;technical error&#148;.
Just imagine what he, other Israelis and militant Jewish organisations
would have said if Jews and Israelis had been killed and it had simply
been dismissed as a technical
error.</p><p><a name="st_o187"><a name="06112238000354"><b><a name="61122-0008.htm_spnew8"><a name="06112238000969">John

stated reason for Israeli aggression in Gaza, remains unfree. So the
situation remains: the Israelis kill and maim, their own citizens are
killed and murdered&#151;by rockets, for example&#151;and their

achieve none until a peace process is arrived at.</p><p><a name="stpa_o123"><a name="61122-0008.htm_para15"><a name="06112238000357">Meanwhile, every single
Palestinian is in grinding poverty, and there is widespread
unemployment. Palestinian unemployment, poverty and deprivation, which
are at third-world levels, are made even more unacceptable by the fact
that the Palestinians live minutes away from Israelis who possess
first-world standards of living. Such living standards are often a
result of subsidisation by the United States Government, who also
subsidise Israeli armaments.</p><p><a name="stpa_o124"><a name="61122-0008.htm_para16"><a name="06112238000358">The Palestinians are not only
forced into grinding poverty; they are humiliated at the 300 or more
checkpoints that the Israelis have erected, and which impede
Palestinians&#146; freedom of movement. I led our House of Commons
and House of Lords official Inter-Parliamentary Union delegation to the
Palestinian territories just under a year ago, and we were treated
abominably by Israeli soldiers, who threatened us at gunpoint. But we
experienced that for only a few days; for the Palestinians, that is
their life, every single day, with no let-up. That is totally
unacceptable to any civilised society, including the civilised society
upon which Israel was founded, and according to which it conducted
itself for so long under enlightened leadership. Such leadership is
distinct from this ineffable Israeli Prime Minister, whose rating has
fallen in the Israeli polls to 7 per cent., and&#151;I am very sorry
to say&#151;from the Defence Minister and leader of the Israeli
Labour party, who has tarnished that party&#146;s wonderful record as
the founding party of
Israel.</p><p><a name="stpa_o125"><a name="61122-0008.htm_para17"><a name="06112238000359">The
wall&#151;the illegal wall, which was condemned by the International
Court of Justice&#151;is still being built, as has been pointed out.
However, none of what the Israelis are doing is doing them any good
whatsoever. The wall is not only being built in Palestinian territory
and creating deprivation and separation; it is turning Israel into a
self-created ghetto. My family came to this country from the ghettos of
eastern Europe. Israel was created to ensure that no Jews ever again
would have to live in a ghetto. So the Israelis have now created their
own ghetto, in which their own Jewish and Arab citizens have to live,
and in which they have no freedom of movement whatsoever. Therefore,
the situation is not only appalling for the Palestinians, but for the
Israelis. They are still getting away with murder, and there is no
point in pretending otherwise. They kill large numbers of people,
whether through technical errors, as they call them, or in other ways,
and destroy families, none of which does the Israelis any good, let
alone anyone else.</p><br>

Afghanistan, Iraq and the Balkans and in a number of other countries,

accuse the Ministry of Defence of refusing to define what
&#147;overstretched&#148; means, because it will never accept that
our armed forces are overstretched because any normal definition of the
word would mean that the armed forces cannot do what they are being
asked to do. Because of the &#147;can do&#148; attitude of our
armed forces, they will always do their utmost to do what they are
asked. Nevertheless, there are worrying breaches of the harmony
guidelines. Some 15 per cent. of the Army had exceeded harmony
guidelines at the end of the last financial year. However, some people
might suggest that the harmony guidelines are meaningless, because they
come into play only when people have been out of their own beds for 10

powers and other challenges, and other forces, such as China, India and
Russia, are emerging. That makes redundant the simplistic Bush-Blair
analysis of the world, with its view of good versus bad, and democracy
against the axis of evil. As a result, the age of hard power is making
way for the soft power of dialogue and diplomacy, and our foreign and

year. We are told that staying in Iraq would mean winning Iraqi hearts
and minds, yet neighbourhoods are now too hostile for us to enter. The
Prime Minister defines &#147;the job&#148; as defeating terrorism,
yet there was no terrorism in Iraq until we went there, and it is there
now because the absence of the promised comprehensive reconstruction
plan created a vacuum into which the terrorists surged. What the

al-Qaeda and their international terrorism. However, we should not be
in Helmand. As the House knows, we went there on a false prospectus.
The best chance of stabilising Afghanistan is from the centre. If we
look at history, we see that pacification from the outside has never
worked. We need to rebuild confidence in Kabul and in the central area.
We must effectively undermine the warlords and drug barons who hold the
Afghan farmers in hock&#151;that is the hold that they have over the
farmers; the issue is not just the poppy. We must offer the people of
Afghanistan better incomes and better lives, and we must abandon the
conceit that Afghanistan is a task for the west alone. India, China and

flexibility was obstructive. A new process must be initiated, and a
genuine ceasefire, fully observed by all sides, is a necessary
precursor. That itself should be preceded by the freeing of those on
all sides who are improperly detained. The new process should include
all those who must play a part in securing a two-state solution in a
stable middle east. Prospects of renewed engagement with Syria are
therefore welcome, but &#147;inclusion&#148; must mean Hamas and

took the view that if the invasion went ahead, as it did eventually, it
would destroy one of the most murderous dictatorships around. There
have been many evil dictatorships since 1945, and Saddam&#146;s was
undoubtedly one of the worst. The other evening, on a Channel 4
programme, we saw corpses that were located after the mass murder that
had been conducted by the regime in the 1980s. Many other murders have
been committed by that regime. Who does not welcome the fact that the
regime has gone? Surely, no one can question the fact if there had been
no invasion Saddam would still be in power, his sons would follow him
and, for all we know, once the international pressure was off the

positive things have occurred, as has been acknowledged. Free elections
have taken place in Iraq and a Government were duly elected. Other

turned out that way. Far from it.</p><p><a name="stpa_o161"><a name="61122-0009.htm_para26"><a name="06112238000401">As has been said, hardly a day

death and suffering to wholly innocent people going about their daily
business&#151;shopping or going to and from work. Those are the
people who are being murdered. It is an unusual day if we do not hear
news of further terrible executions and mass murder. The occupation
troops cannot prevent that; if they could, they would obviously do so.
Our troops have enough difficulty trying to protect themselves. Nor can
the elected Government do anything about the situation. They are
impotent; there is no way that they can undertake the necessary
security precautions for their people. Indeed, it is suspected that
some of the police&#151;and, perhaps, some Iraqi troops&#151;are
involved in sectarian murders.</p><p><a name="stpa_o162"><a name="61122-0009.htm_para27"><a name="06112238000402">There is a tendency to tell us

about the numbers, although I do not particularly want to do so, but
those who talk about the number of people who have died should point
out how they died. Since the end of the invasion, in the main, people
have died as a result of terrorist action&#151;it was not due to the
occupation troops; it was outright murder by terrorists. The last thing
those terrorists want is a democratic society in

declared war on Serbia as a result of perfectly honourable concern
about Serbia&#146;s internal policy towards the province of Kosovo.

Albanians. However, we have now seen the ethnic cleansing of the
Kosovar Serbs. The original purpose of the intervention was to ensure
autonomy for Kosovo in Serbia, but we now know that that is
non-deliverable. Kosovo is going to become an independent state and,
probably, a centre of criminality. There will be further fragmentation
of the region, but that was no part of the policy of the Prime Minister
or NATO. The situation will lead to further dangers not only in the
Balkans, but in other territorial disputes in Abkhazia, South Ossetia

possibility, abandoned that aspiration when they saw that they had NATO
behind them, even if NATO did not share their
objectives.</p><p><a name="stpa_o171"><a name="61122-0010.htm_para4"><a name="06112238000416">We now
come to the situation in the middle east. I will not comment on Iraq in
detail today, but, again, initiating a conflict without being able to
control its consequences and creating a power vacuum has led to the
precise opposite of what President Bush and our Prime Minister actually
sought. Everyone who knew the middle east was aware that the real
threat to the region came not from Iraq, but from the growing power of
Iran. Iraq was a busted flush, not because Saddam Hussein was any nicer
a man than he had been, but because 10 years of sanctions, the defeat
in the Gulf war and the imposition of the no-fly zone had emasculated
his power. That was not just my view or that of some
individuals&#151;why else did Turkey, Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Syria,
which joined the coalition during the first Gulf war, decline to join
the coalition of the willing in the invasion of Iraq? It was because
they knew that they were not facing a
threat.</p><p><a name="stpa_o172"><a name="61122-0010.htm_para5"><a name="06112238000417">Iran was

power of Iran, it is now likely that the President of the United States
and the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom will have to go cap in
hand to Iran to ask for assistance to get out of the mess that has been
created in Iraq. The Iranians cannot believe their luck. They had two

to the potential dialogue with Iran that the United States has offered,
but the one policy that might just deliver the right results would be a
proposal from the United States that in exchange for Iran giving up in
a credible way its nuclear aspirations and its support for terrorism,
the United States would be prepared to consider not just dialogue, but
a full normalisation of its relations with that country. That would
represent an end to the axis of evil rhetoric, an end to calls for
regime change&#151;that is a matter for the Iranian people, not the
American people&#151;an end to the sanctions that the United States
has imposed since 1979 and a willingness to treat Iran not as a
friendly country, but as a country as friendly as the Venezuela of Hugo

closest chums of the current Administration in
Washington.</p><p><a name="stpa_o175"><a name="61122-0010.htm_para8"><a name="06112238000420">Of course,
that would be difficult for the United States, but would it really be
much more difficult than the case of Libya? Colonel Gaddafi had
sponsored terrorism. Colonel Gaddafi was responsible for the Pan Am
bombing that led to the deaths of many hundreds of Americans and for
many other similarly monstrous acts, yet the United States swallowed
hard and not only resolved the problem with Libya, but established
diplomatic relations and dropped economic sanctions. The United States
is now pursuing a more normal relationship with Libya, so why should
not the effort be made with Iran? If such effort was made, it is
possible that it might work, which would be a tremendous achievement
for the benefit of all. However, if it did not work, how much stronger
would the position of the United States be when it called for credible,
real, tough and effective sanctions against Iran? Economic sanctions
would then, hopefully, be endorsed by the Security Council. Pressure
would be exerted on financial institutions to stop their assistance to

Europe. The Prime Minister said that he would be at the heart of

see the European constitution that he supported materialise because
France and the Netherlands ruled that out for him. Indeed, through his
policy on Iraq, he did more to divide all the new Europe than any
single world statesman other than President Bush. The policy has been
rotten. For the time being, British foreign policy is on hold. European
policy is determined by Merkel, Chirac and Putin&#151;the British

the most effective, fighting force in the world. It causes me no small
anger when my Government, in trying to deflect criticism from their

with our foreign policy is that it does not exist. It does not exist
because the Prime Minister is obsessed with the belief that there
should not be a space between our foreign policy and that of President
Bush and the neocons in Washington into which it would be possible to
slip a cigarette paper. In the Prime Minister&#146;s approach to
foreign policy, he is also wrong to perceive the greatest threat to the
world as international terrorism. Many years ago, before a single
bullet was fired in Iraq, my right hon. Friend the Member for Holborn
and St. Pancras (Frank Dobson) said that the real weapons of mass
destruction were poverty and AIDS. In my view, that list has been added
to by environmental decay and destruction, but these do not seem to be
areas that figure prominently in the Prime Minister&#146;s thinking
about how we approach the rest of the world.</p><p><a name="stpa_o178"><a name="61122-0010.htm_para11"><a name="06112238000424">I hope that the changes

withdrawal of our troops. I do not call for the immediate withdrawal of
American troops, but I know, as everyone else in the House and in the
country knows, that when it becomes of overriding importance for the
Republican party to withdraw US troops&#151;and not doing so would
put the Republicans in serious danger of losing the next presidential
election&#151;those troops will be withdrawn and, as night follows

ours.</p><p><a name="stpa_o179"><a name="61122-0010.htm_para12"><a name="06112238000425">Central to what

Syria and Iran. I entirely agree. It was a very great Israeli Prime
Minister&#151;who, regrettably, was assassinated by one of his own
citizens&#151;who said that one does not create peace with
one&#146;s friends; one creates peace with one&#146;s enemies. That
is a lesson that seems to have been pushed drastically to one side, for
reasons about which I could hazard an opinion concerning the White
House in Washington, but I would not waste the time of the House. To
give our Prime Minister credit and to be fair to him, he attempted, in
a somewhat half-hearted way, to float that idea way before the Baker

people in uniforms that had been specially created in America so that
they could not be taken by insurgents. They were to be given only to
members of the supposed Iraqi police force. Hundreds of people were
taken out of the highest academic offices in Iraq. Many of them are
still missing and some have been found dead. It is therefore clear that
there is no innate central security in Iraq. We are seeing the country

to have a structured debate on the changing nature of our policy on
Iraq, which is undoubtedly going to change in the very near future, and
that we do not seem likely to have such a debate in the near future.
Three weeks ago, we had a half-day debate contrived by the nationalists
on an inquiry into the origins of the war and the Foreign Secretary
took a most extraordinary view in that debate. She developed a doctrine
that it was somehow disloyal and unpatriotic to talk about the war

helpful, for those provinces that would be handed over to the Iraqi

of video conferencing with the Baker Iraq Study Group. I suspect that
he did that because he was conscious of the fact that it might appear
at home that he had no influence on events if he did not do so.
However, I suspect that his impact on the workings of the Baker group
will be absolutely minimal. It is quite obvious that British policy at
the moment is to wait for President Bush to explain to us how we are
all going to get our troops out of the country. It also seems to me
that President Bush is waiting for James Baker and his study group to
come up with some new idea that might get the troops out in a way that
minimises the President&#146;s loss of face. That is the underlying
situation that gives me no confidence at all that a satisfactory result
will be achieved. I have the highest regard for James Baker; I am
delighted to see him in the frame and Donald Rumsfeld out. However,
James Baker is faced with an almost impossible task given the events of

coming out most fashionably from the discussions going on are, first,
that the way forward means a closer involvement of Syria and Iran and,
secondly, that policy must now move to a phased withdrawal. Both sound
attractive, but they are the haziest notions of an unworked-out policy,
and I shall comment on both of them and express some of my

involvement of Syria and Iran&#151;and I would add a number of other
middle eastern players who are looking anxiously at what is happening
in Iraq&#151;would have been a very good idea had we involved them at
a very much earlier stage. When we first got involved with the problems
of Iraq, it was obvious, as many people have said, that, once we had
changed the regime, no future for that country on its own could be
secured until it was on terms with its neighbours. Looking again to the
future, it is absolutely essential that the accommodation between Iraq,
Syria and Iran one day resumes some sort of
normality.</p><p><a name="stpa_o194"><a name="61122-0011.htm_para3"><a name="06112238000445">I fear that
it is very difficult to expect very much at the moment of Iran and
Syria. That is not surprising when we look back and consider the
original intention of the neo-Conservatives when the invasion took
place. It was explained to me quite frequently by more than one of them
that Syria would be forced to come into line with western policy
because it would be subjected to shock and awe when it saw what had
happened to its Ba&#146;athist neighbour. I was also told that the
Iranian regime would be changed in a matter of months as the brave
students of Iran rose in response to an American show of power in the

place.</p><p><a name="stpa_o195"><a name="61122-0011.htm_para4"><a name="06112238000446">To make the

encouraged hopes that we would now receive some help from those two
regimes to assist us to get out of Iraq with dignity seems to me a
triumph of hope over recent experience. Both regimes have been
immensely strengthened by the events of the past three years, not least
because the whole illusion of the unbeatable supremacy of the United

every member of our Government who I have ever heard deal with the
issue has ruled those out as utterly unacceptable. They are prices that
we cannot pay. However, Syria and Iran know that they are now going to
play a great part anyway in future events in Iraq. They have been
placed by our invasion in a situation in which they can do that. Syria
will not resist intervening in the affairs of its neighbour,
particularly given the Sunni contingent there, and Iran, as my right

cannot believe that anybody in Iran ever expected that the

everyone who has said that we cannot just pull out now. The present
chaos would turn into a period of even more terrible bloodshed with a
totally uncertain outcome, although unless we get back in control of
events, there may eventually be no alternative. It is pointless to set
a timetable that would become a timetable for terrorist activity, but
phased withdrawal must mean quicker withdrawal on an altogether shorter
time scale than we have been given. That means that we must brace
ourselves for very much reduced expectations of what we will leave

All those plans for imposing a friendly democracy are, alas, an

gone into a dangerous area without our NATO allies. We do not have a

are a weapon of mass destruction. By their very nature they are
indiscriminate in their use and who they affect. This country and the
other four members of the Security Council, the five declared nuclear
weapon states, all signed a non-proliferation treaty, under which any
signatory nation must not develop its own nuclear weapons, but the
existing declared nuclear weapon states must also disarm. It is true
that there are fewer nuclear warheads on patrol and fewer available to
this country than there were in the past, but we are still a nuclear
weapon state, and the idea that we should expend &#163;25 billion or

and a further &#163;50 billion on deploying them over the

we have set ourselves, and that is of long-term nuclear disarmament. I

to renounce violence and honour previous agreements, does not help the
Palestinian cause any more than the continual firing of missiles from
Gaza. However, to answer the right hon. Member for Suffolk, Coastal
(Mr. Gummer), that does not justify the wholesale annexation
of land not only behind the barrier, which is way beyond the green

justify the existence of road blocks, bypass roads for the exclusive
use of settlers and the confiscation of and restrictions on land around

the election of Hamas and the continuing terrorist attacks mean that
the Palestinians are not interested in peace, but the converse is also
true. The strangulation of Gaza, the erection of a barrier
deep inside the green line and the consolidation of a patchwork of
settlements that chops the integrity of the west bank to pieces suggest
that Israel is not interested in peace, either. Those actions are
incompatible with any viable two-state solution&#151;I defy anybody

I visited Iraq, going to Basra and Baghdad. The visit was arranged by
the Foreign Office, and I met many groups, including local politicians
and women&#146;s groups in Basra and trade unionists and national
politicians in Baghdad. One thing was quite clear: they were pleased
that Saddam&#146;s regime had come to a head, but they were
desperately unhappy about the manner in which that came about. The
damage to infrastructure was immense: Basra had electricity only for a
couple of hours a day at that time and clean water was at a premium,
with open sewers posing a health hazard after their
destruction.</p><p><a name="stpa_o231"><a name="61122-0012.htm_para15"><a name="06112238000491">We also
visited training camps where the new security forces were put through
their paces. I was absolutely alarmed to be told by a senior member of
the Iraqi military that the life expectancy of the recruits, once their
occupation was known, could be counted in terms of weeks. That was
ominous and dreadful, and we were constantly told the official line by
the Government that in so many weeks there would

overestimates, they were hardly viable or reliable, given the number of
recruits being killed.</p><p><a name="stpa_o232"><a name="61122-0012.htm_para16"><a name="06112238000492">I was against the war, but I
went to Iraq with an open mind to see what was happening. I came back
believing sincerely that a troop withdrawal would have to be events
led, but in no doubt about the difficulties of putting those events in
train in light of the slaughter of these recruits and the obvious
inability to rebuild and repair the infrastructure in a situation where
security was bad. That tended to fuel a great deal of animosity, in
turn, among the people whom we met. Some even went as far as to say
that, in respect of everyday utilities and everyday life, things were
worse than they had been under the old regime.</p><p><a name="stpa_o233"><a name="61122-0012.htm_para17"><a name="06112238000493">When I look at the situation
today, I find that it is no better. Undoubtedly, the battle for hearts
and minds is not being won, with the presence of US and UK troops
universally seen as being part of the problem, not the solution. There
are on average 40 deaths in Iraq every day. The militias are fully
armed and, as we all know, the conflict rages. Perhaps it is little
wonder that many ordinary Iraqis are dependent on their own militias to
offer them real day-to-day protection, but the situation has
deteriorated substantially since my visit. US and British troops on the
ground are a catalyst for daily murder and mayhem. They should not have
to face that sort of danger day in, day out. That is why I believe that
the UK Government should now tell Parliament what their current policy
towards Iraq really is and what kind of exit strategy is being
developed. Merely trotting out the &#147;as long as it takes&#148;
policy is unsustainable when there are military deaths and casualties
almost daily and the presence of forces escalates into tribal rivalry
and conflicts.</p><p><a name="stpa_o234"><a name="61122-0012.htm_para18"><a name="06112238000494">The
Prime Minister acknowledged on 19 October that the continued presence
of the UK military could be a &#147;provocation&#148;, but went on
to say that he thought that the Iraqi security forces could be in
control within 16 months. Many believe that to be a hugely optimistic
assessment. General Sir Richard Dannatt took the view that withdrawal
should be sooner rather than later. While the Prime Minister is willing
to engage with a congressional committee on these matters, he does not
give the House an opportunity to discuss them. That is plainly wrong,
since the House, albeit misled, was given an opportunity to vote on the
Iraq war at the
time.</p><p><a name="stpa_o235"><a name="61122-0012.htm_para19"><a name="06112238000495">We now need to

that there is, but that is no reason to deny us a proper, legitimate
and informed debate about the issue.</p><p><a name="stpa_o237"><a name="61122-0012.htm_para21"><a name="06112238000501">The Prime Minister recently
told the Iraq Study Group, quite rightly, that a settlement of the
Palestinian question was central to sorting out the wider problems of
Iraq and Afghanistan. He described the issue as the biggest factor in
getting support from moderate Muslim countries as well. That is right.
We in my party believe&#151;as I believe do many others, in all parts
of the House&#151;that it is time to establish a full, proper peace
conference on the entire middle east question, which should address all
the questions in the region, with a view to securing a lasting peace.
Paragraph 14 of United Nations resolution 687, from 1991, refers
to</p><a name="61122-0012.htm_brev0"><a name="06112238000725"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;steps towards the

weapons&#148;.</p></ul><p><a name="stpa_o238"><a name="61122-0012.htm_para22"><a name="06112238000502">Part
of the scope of the peace conference should be to create a strong
regional security solution for Iraq, with contributions from
neighbouring states. Foremost among the issues would be a proper
examination of the Kurdish question, which has been intractable for
many years and is further complicated by the fact that the Kurdish
nation is spilt into four different regions. The problem has been
difficult for many years, but many believe that there will be no
lasting solution in the middle east without a solution to the Kurdish
question.</p><p><a name="stpa_o239"><a name="61122-0012.htm_para23"><a name="06112238000503">The
Palestinian question is of course important too. The situation in
Palestine is as bad today as it has ever been. There must be a
concentration on the issue, and I hope that the Prime Minister will be
part of that. However, politicians often pay lip service to the
problem, but then retreat and leave it alone, so I hope that we can all
sit down and discuss the
issue.</p><p><a name="stpa_o240"><a name="61122-0012.htm_para24"><a name="06112238000504">Much has been

with everything that he said. However, I remind the House of the damage
that was caused in that conflict last summer: 145 bridges were damaged,
and apart from the human cost, the cost of reconstruction is more than
$4 billion, with the Lebanese tourist industry being hit by a $2.5
billion slap in just one year.

continue to pour money into an area where such damage is inflicted time

express an opinion one way or the other, but it must be said that the
Israeli contribution to that conflict was well out of proportion and

to be made that Iran give up nuclear capability without demanding the
same of Israel. Sadly, a host of international conferences in the
middle east since the tabling of resolution 687 have achieved little

would appear, to asking those same regimes to help to stabilise the
situation in Iraq. In so far as it is not already happening, the
involvement of those countries in Iraq is probably inevitable. We are
naïve, however, if we do not recognise that that is likely to
lead to a strengthening of those countries&#146; positions, not just
in Iraq but in the region. It will also lead&#151;and I am

the condemnation across the House of the assassination yesterday of
Pierre Gemayel in Lebanon. Does not that very act of condemnation
reveal, however, how little leverage we now have on the situation in
Lebanon? We do not yet know, and may never know, who was responsible
for the assassination. Certainly, however, if there was any involvement
by the Syrian Government or their agents, and if we want to take action

the west&#146;s options, because of the weakness of our position in
Iraq as it has developed over recent years? In other parts of the

We need to restore that influence, because there are so many important
challenges to our security. I accept that there is a challenge from

of the priorities of his remaining time in office. I welcome his
commitment to working towards a just settlement&#151;a long-standing
commitment that is recognised in the House and more widely&#151;but
whoever leads British policy on Israel and Palestine, it is patently
clear that there must be a much tougher line on Israel if we are to
achieve any progress towards a real two-state solution. Of course there
must be pressure on all who would undermine the possibility of a
genuine settlement in Palestine and Israel, but it is Israel that is
the power in the land, and it is Israel which, in its daily policies,
is undermining the possibility of getting a viable two-state solution

that we take. That underlines why we need a common European foreign and
security policy which is coherent and effective, and why we need the
institutions and policies that will allow it to be pursued vigorously
and made effective. I do not say that because I believe that we can
establish some European superpower to challenge the United States of
America. That is not a real prospect. We must have good relations with
the United States as well as with our European partners, but we need a

a whole. Big moral ideas about democratisation on the one hand, and
placing faith in outdated cold war institutions such as the EU, NATO
and the UN on the other, were both denying reality. If nobody in Europe
can find even a few helicopters to help in Afghanistan, we begin to
question the very existence of NATO as it currently is, let alone the
purpose of an EU foreign and defence policy. Unless we all start to
accept the world as it is, we will continue to miss the real questions
that we must face in the short term or the long term.</p><p><a name="stpa_o263"><a name="61122-0013.htm_para12"><a name="06112238000529">Let us start by addressing the
consequences of Iraq. A relatively stable, albeit hostile, conglomerate
state has been smashed. Far from having created circumstances that cow
potential aggressors such as Iran, Syria and North Korea, they are
gloating with delight at the current situation. The war has proved to
be a classic pyrrhic victory: tactical victory has become strategic
defeat. Far from dividing al-Qaeda and other extremist groups from
mainstream Muslim opinion, the terrorists have become the heroes on the
Muslim street, and it is the moderates who are isolated. There can be
no wiping the slate clean of what we have done. I do not agree with my
right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Devizes (Mr.
Ancram). We must continue to support the United States in attempts to
bring the occupation in Iraq to some kind of stable conclusion. I pay
tribute to our servicemen and women, who are so bravely and gallantly
sustaining that
effort.</p><p><a name="stpa_o264"><a name="61122-0013.htm_para13"><a name="06112238000530">However, we
cannot base future policy on any kind of continuum with previous
discredited thinking. We must start again. In the short term, neither
Iraq nor the world can wait two years for a new US President and a
credible US foreign policy. That is why the Baker-Hamilton commission,
backed by George Bush senior and the newly elected Democrat Congress,
is in the process of seizing the reins of US foreign and defence policy
from the White House. It is testament to the clueless state of UK
policy that the British Prime Minister&#146;s role is reduced to
giving a few minutes&#146; evidence down a video link. In the short
term, policy in Iraq will be decided in Washington, and that is
that.</p><p><a name="stpa_o265"><a name="61122-0013.htm_para14"><a name="06112238000531">In the long
term, British foreign policy must return to first principles, based on
a proper analysis of the wider facts that we face. Europe&#146;s
population is ageing and her economy is in sharp relative decline. The
huge shift of economic power from west to east will lead to a similar
shift in political and military power. The rise of Asia is bringing 2
billion people into the global economy, with incalculable consequences.
We must also consider the crisis in the Doha trade talks, global
warming, energy security and Africa. We need to be realistic, moreover,
about the problem of Muslim extremism, which lies far deeper in history
than the establishment of Israel 60 years ago. The Muslim world has
been perplexed by its political decline in relation to the Christian
world since the failure of the second siege of Vienna in 1683. We must
face the fact that only Muslims themselves can win the argument against
the extremists in their midst.</p><br>

villages from their wells, and separating hospitals from their

hold back a tide of hate behind the wall, but the risks are growing. We

everyday lives. The majority of the members of Hamas who were elected
to Government are in prison, and the Israeli Government are chasing the
rest of them to try to put them in prison. That is a complete disaster.
Even those who oppose Hamas think that the policy being followed is a
disaster, because Hamas would otherwise not be delivering what it
promised before the election. However, the fact that the Israeli
Government are withholding $60 million to $65 million a month of
revenue means that every disaster that unfolds can be blamed on others.
Hamas is benefiting from the policies being followed by the Israeli

of a climate change Bill in the Queen&#146;s Speech, but we need
action. A couple of Members said that we give the terrorists too much
credibility. Terrorists thrive on publicity, but the greater threat to
future generations is climate change. There must be a financial
commitment from the Government. Less than &#163;1 billion is spent on
tackling climate change directly, but an estimated &#163;4
billion could cut 12 million tonnes of carbon from domestic output, and
&#163;10 billion to &#163;20 billion spent on renewable energy
investment could cut emissions from power generation by a further 50
per cent. Investment on a massive scale is required, but the resources

to international development and the work of the Secretary of State for
International Development. A number of Members in the Chamber have sat

building, and make the case for Britain being at the forefront of
building democratic capacity around the world in the way that I shall
define it, and certainly not trying to impose it. First, however, I
shall flag up two situations that concern me. We have not yet had any
reference to Belarus. It is a disgrace that there, on the edge of the
European Union, in the heart of geographic old Europe, there is still a
dictatorship. The UK and particularly the EU could be doing more to
focus our efforts to underpin the forces of opposition in Belarus, and
to broadcast to that country truth and media reflections of what is
going on in the real
world.</p><p><a name="stpa_o305"><a name="61122-0014.htm_para18"><a name="06112238000577">There has also
been much debate about North Korea, where the situation is desperately
grave. I am probably one of the few Opposition Members who has been
there&#151;it was three years ago&#151;and it was the grimmest,
bleakest experience of my life. Not only does the country have nuclear
plans, but 25 million people are cold, hungry and starving, so I hope
that those on the Opposition Front Bench and the Government will, in
the run-up to the six-party talks, use the European Union and other
world forums to urge the North Korean Government to allow
non-governmental organisations and international charities into the
country to help to meet the needs of their starving, cold and oppressed
people. Any contact is good and we certainly want more support for that
country and its
people.</p><p><a name="stpa_o306"><a name="61122-0014.htm_para19"><a name="06112238000578">I want to
develop the theme that democracy building should be a major plank of
British foreign policy. Let me first briefly explain what I mean by
democracy. I am certainly not talking about simply promoting the
Westminster model or saying that we are perfect even though we have
been at it a long time. I could produce a long list of things that we
could change in our democracy, not least the status of the second
Chamber, the role of the Whips in Parliament&#151;I hope that is
written down in the Government Whip&#146;s little blue
folder&#151;party funding and voter turnout. Many things should be
changed in our democracy and the constant evolution of the way we do
things is entirely healthy. We have been at it a long time and, as my

democracy will always look different wherever it is to be found, I
believe that four pillars must be present in every healthy democracy.
The first is the ability to elect and get rid of people we call
politicians&#151;those who are brave or perhaps stupid enough to put
themselves forward for election&#151;and to elect the Government we
want and then to remove them when they do things that we do not
like.</p><p><a name="st_o227"><a name="06112238000580"><b><a name="61122-0014.htm_spnew4"><a name="06112238001009">Mr.

Streeter:</b> I certainly support the election of a certain
percentage of the upper Chamber, although I am not sure that I entirely
agree with Opposition Front Benchers that the figure should be 80 per
cent. However, I agree that we should elect a significant
number.</p><p><a name="stpa_o308"><a name="61122-0014.htm_para21"><a name="06112238000582">It was a
striking disappointment for me to realise some years ago in my work on
democracy capacity building that we cannot really have democracy
without political parties. I am sorry about that; I wish that we could.
We certainly need politicians and they need to cohere around a set of
principles and, in the end, that means that they form parties. Party
politics is by no means perfect, but we need to support it and build
its capacity where it emerges in fledgling
democracies.</p><p><a name="stpa_o309"><a name="61122-0014.htm_para22"><a name="06112238000583">The
second pillar that needs to be found is the rule of law. No one is
above the law and we look on with interest at the sight of our Prime
Minister possibly being questioned by the police about certain things
that he may have done. I have no idea whether he has done anything
wrong, but I find it healthy that he is not above the law and that our
police force does not conduct itself with partiality. The rule of law
also involves independent judges who decide without fear or favour, a
commitment to the rights of the individual and a respect for human
rights.</p><p><a name="stpa_o310"><a name="61122-0014.htm_para23"><a name="06112238000584">The third
pillar found in a healthy democracy is freedom of speech and a free
media. Sometimes we pull our hair out at our irresponsible media, but I
am glad that we have our media rather than the one in Belarus or Burma.
This pillar also involves the freedom to criticise those in power, the
freedom to worship whichever God we choose, the freedom to assemble and
the freedom to travel. Freedom is an important pillar of
democracy.</p><p><a name="stpa_o311"><a name="61122-0014.htm_para24"><a name="06112238000585">The fourth
pillar is a strong civil society. A country is not just made of the
state and individuals. In between are all those little platoons of
charities, organisations, associations, unions, Churches and faith
groups that form the glue of that society and hold the whole thing
together. That is what I mean by the promotion of
democracy.</p><p><a name="stpa_o312"><a name="61122-0014.htm_para25"><a name="06112238000586">Churchill
described democracy as the worst form of government ever invented,
apart from all of the others, and I am sure that he was right. Every
democratic country will have its own home-grown version, with all its
quirks and idiosyncrasies, and that is how it should be. I am persuaded
that democracy cannot be imposed from the outside. If anyone
thought&#151;I am not sure that they did&#151;that we could simply
go to war in Iraq

because that has clearly been a non-successful policy. Democracy will
look different and it cannot be imposed, but the four pillars of free

civil society will be found in every healthy
democracy.</p><p><a name="stpa_o313"><a name="61122-0014.htm_para26"><a name="06112238000587">In the long
run that will mean that a country will enjoy better
governance&#151;good governance&#151;and that will lead to better
lives for its citizens. If I was to say the one thing that we could do
for any of the failing states where people live in such abject poverty
or suffer such human rights abuses, it would be to help those countries
to build a democratic framework so that they end up with good
governance.</p><p><a name="stpa_o314"><a name="61122-0014.htm_para27"><a name="06112238000588">Despite
what some may claim, Britain has much solid experience in all those
four pillars. In fact, we are rather good at them, warts and all, and
we have experience to share, albeit with patience and humility. If we
add that to our international heritage and our global networks, it soon
becomes clear that we should be at the forefront of offering help and
support in building capacity in all those nations that aspire to become
stronger democracies. We do that in three principal ways.</p><p><a name="stpa_o315"><a name="61122-0014.htm_para28"><a name="06112238000589">The Westminster Foundation for
Democracy has existed since 1994 and it provides a platform for both
party to party capacity building work, and institution to institution
work, both the political and the civil society streams. But its budget
is roughly &#163;4 million a year, which is peanuts compared with
what other countries, such as America and Germany, spend on democracy
building. The budgets of the National Democratic Institute and the
International Republican Institute are around $100 million each per
year, and the Germans also spend a lot of money.</p><p><a name="stpa_o316"><a name="61122-0014.htm_para29"><a name="06112238000590">Secondly, last year more than
&#163;200 million from the DFID budget went on support for democracy
and good governance. That is commendable and to be supported, but I
simply ask whether that was spent in a focused way, or whether it could
have been better spent on democracy building and good governance
projects through a specialist
organisation.</p><p><a name="stpa_o317"><a name="61122-0014.htm_para30"><a name="06112238000591">The
third way in which we build democracy is by the FCO&#151;through
various of its posts&#151;buying in specialist capacity building
services in a country, not least through the global opportunity fund,
and there have been successes. Bahrain was mentioned, and that was an
example where the global opportunities fund was put to good use in
supporting its fledgling

corruption is a sense of powerlessness to do anything about it. The
only real antidote to corruption in the long term is a robust
democratic framework that produces good governance; the ability to vote

thought that the situation was worse than it was on the previous
occasion. All hon. Members must learn the lessons from the mistakes
that have been made in Iraq. One of the mistakes was clear on my first
visit in May 2004, when the British military wanted to open Basra
airport. They were not allowed to do so because the matter was under
the ambit of the collective decision of the coalition provisional
authority, which took the view that it would be politically dangerous
to open up the situation in Basra in advance of that in Baghdad. In
retrospect, that was one of the most damaging decisions taken, because
Basra, which is a port and provides access to the rest of the world,
could achieve normal economic development for a society that
operated&#151;as it still does to a large extent&#151;as a
state-controlled system with almost no private enterprise. If Basra had
been opened up in that way, it might have led to other highly
beneficial economic developments.</p><p><a name="st_o232"><a name="06112238000605"><b><a name="61122-0015.htm_spnew1"><a name="06112238001014">Mr.

(Mr. Hague). The American Government must rethink their role
towards countries in the region, including Syria and, more importantly,
Iran, where it has not had a diplomatic presence since Jimmy Carter was
President, when diplomatic relations ended. The US does not have an
ambassador in Syria, but it has an embassy and a charg&#233;
d&#146;affaires. In Iran, however, it does not have anything. The
Americans fail to understand how the Iranians, who are a very proud
people, feel about their 3,000-year-old Persian history. The issue is
complex because we are dealing not just with the problem of perceptions
on the Arab street, but with the Sunni-Shi&#146;a conflict and the
fact that Iran is not an Arab country.</p><p><a name="stpa_o330"><a name="61122-0015.htm_para12"><a name="06112238000609">If developments in Iran go
badly, the country&#146;s Arab neighbours in the region may wish to
acquire nuclear weapons in a short time. That is destabilising and it
could be disastrous for the peace and security of the whole world. The
more countries that have nuclear weapons&#151;particularly countries
that lack democratic traditions and have a history of hosting jihadist
and Wahhabist groups&#151;the more danger there is that a terrorist
group will gain access to weapons of mass destruction and will be
prepared to use them. The debate about nuclear weapons and weapons of
mass destruction must therefore be raised to a much more sophisticated
level, so I hope that when the Government publish their White Paper on
Trident they will address those complex issues. When debating them we
should consider not just the costs of particular weapons systems, but
the international context. The world we live in today is, sadly, very
dangerous and very different to how we had hoped it would be at the end

From their earliest training, soldiers are taught not to disagree with

top general did just that. He made it clear that the presence of
British troops in some parts of Iraq is exacerbating the situation. He
also said that the Army was stretched to its limit and meeting
challenges on the hoof. The Government must tackle that. Why are troop
deployments allowed to continue when they exacerbate matters? Why did
the general feel that he had to air his concerns to the media?
Is there a lack of communication between the Army and the Government?

At a press conference last month, General George Casey and the US
ambassador in Iraq pushed for a national compact. Almost
simultaneously, our Foreign Secretary conceded in an interview at least
the possibility that Iraq could be broken up into three parts. Then,
President Bush stated that Iraqi forces could take over in a year.
Meanwhile, the Iraq study group is apparently seriously considering

strategy, which is currently lacking. Simply saying that we will stay
until the job is done or that we will not cut and run is not a
strategy. What exactly is the job? Clearly, the original US vision of a

major operation, on the scale of the 1991 Gulf war, or to undertake a
sustained lesser deployment, like the Bosnia operation in the

small operation&#151;say, a brigade-sized operation&#151;elsewhere.

seven years, the forces have been operating at levels higher than those
contained in planning assumptions, even when the assumptions were
revised. That causes overstretch and also means that some equipment
wears out more quickly than planned. Resources are allocated against

involved in conflicts in far-flung parts of the world where we have few
allies with the necessary airbase capacity. Those carriers will give us
the flexibility and capacity to respond to modern threats. They will
also allow us to respond in a targeted and responsible way. That cannot

interesting comment that there was a great deal in the Queen&#146;s
Speech about foreign policy and security, but nothing at all about
defence. How on earth are we to deliver the Government&#146;s great
ambitions, however, without some satisfactory reference to our defence
capabilities? The truth is that foreign policy should not drive
capabilities; capabilities should be available for whatever foreign
policy the Government lay down. We seem to be getting that the wrong
way round at the moment in saying that, were certain foreign policy
developments to occur, we would not be able to do anything about it. It
is interesting that both the Chief of the General Staff and the two
brigadiers who have been in charge in Afghanistan have made it plain
that they can barely do what they are asked at the moment and that,
were some new catastrophe to occur in the world, it is extremely
unlikely that the British Army would be able to respond to
it.</p><p><a name="stpa_o362"><a name="61122-0016.htm_para12"><a name="06112238000648">It was humiliating

the difficult subjects of Afghanistan and Iraq, which have been
mentioned so much this afternoon, let me say that I bitterly regret one
event in my parliamentary career so far. I resigned, or moved on, as
one of the shadow Defence Ministers at the time of the invasion of Iraq
because I felt so strongly that it was the wrong thing to do. The bit I
regret is that the Whips persuaded me not to vote against the war, but
to abstain. In retrospect, I strongly wish that I had had the power of
my own convictions, voted against the war and returned to the Back
Benches then rather than subsequently. The war was wrong, it has been
handled entirely wrongly, and now I find that virtually the whole House
supports my position on
it.</p><p><a name="stpa_o364"><a name="61122-0016.htm_para14"><a name="06112238000652">The important
question that we must consider this afternoon, however, is not just
whether what has been done in Iraq and Afghanistan is right, wrong or
indifferent&#151;the House has heard a great many thoughts on
that&#151;but whether we are able to carry out the tasks that we have
been asked to carry out, there and elsewhere. The truth is that we are
suffering from three very significant problems in our armed services,
and the Government are showing no inclination whatever to put them
right.</p><p><a name="stpa_o365"><a name="61122-0016.htm_para15"><a name="06112238000653">The first
problem involves numbers. With 102,000 soldiers, the British Army is
now the smallest army we have had since Waterloo. We are not able to
perform many of the tasks that we would like to perform.
Reserves&#151;the Territorial Army&#151;are being used for tasks
that we would never have contemplated when I served in the TA for seven
years. If I had been told &#147;You will almost certainly spend six
or 12 months in Iraq or Afghanistan, often fighting with bayonets
fixed&#148;, I would not have been too happy about the prospect,
although it is now the
norm.</p><p><a name="stpa_o366"><a name="61122-0016.htm_para16"><a name="06112238000654">The worrying
thing is that in the last two or three years, a quarter of the
reserves&#151;some 13,400 soldiers&#151;have left. The fact is that
our reserves are becoming smaller and smaller as the dependence of the
regular Army on them becomes bigger and bigger. We have problems with
both recruitment and retention. I think it right for us to spend some
time this afternoon asking ourselves why that should
be.</p><p><a name="stpa_o367"><a name="61122-0016.htm_para17"><a name="06112238000655">The first and most
obvious reason for disaffection in the armed services is, of course,
equipment. There were all kinds of causes c&#233;lèbres during
the Iraq crisis when proper equipment was not issued to our services:
they did not have the right body armour, or the right kind of
desertification for the tanks. That is quite wrong. We cannot ask our
boys&#151;and our girls&#151;to go off to dangerous parts of the
world and do things without giving them the equipment that they need,
including large equipment.</p><p><a name="stpa_o368"><a name="61122-0016.htm_para18"><a name="06112238000656">It was interesting to hear

the chiefs of staff committee to the Secretary of State for Defence.
But it will not necessarily be the same request as that which came from

have a fundamental review of the pay and conditions and living
conditions of our armed services personnel. If the Secretary of State
wants to tackle the problems and cut the leakage that we face in terms
of recruitment and retention, and if he wants to be certain that he can
deliver in the future, he must not only look at the total number of
soldiers, sailors and airmen that we have on our front lines and

campaigning for a considerable length of time to have foam suppressant
fitted to the wing tanks of the Hercules, and it has been fitted to two
planes. I entirely agree with the Secretary of State that we should not
do that to too many planes&#151;there are 50 of them in
total&#151;as that might not be cost-effective. However, I understand
that there are at least five planes currently operating in Afghanistan
and a number of others are in Iraq, and the foam suppressant should be
fitted to those planes. I appeal to the Secretary of State&#151;as I
have done on countless occasions in this Chamber&#151;to hurry-up the

position; in other words, it is an indication of the party in
power&#146;s vision of where this country is going. However, having
listened to the Foreign Secretary&#146;s contribution, we are all
very puzzled as to where this country is going. We would have learned
more about the UK&#146;s policy on Kazakhstan by watching the new

Secretary.</p><p><a name="stpa_o378"><a name="61122-0016.htm_para28"><a name="06112238000669">I begin,
as others have done, by paying tribute to our armed forces and their
activities around the world. We have commitments across the
globe&#151;from Northern Ireland, to Cyprus, Africa, the Falklands,
Hong Kong, Gibraltar, Germany and Sierra Leone, as well as in Iraq and
Afghanistan. I therefore find it somewhat ironic that the Chancellor
and the Prime Minister are telling the troops, &#147;You are doing a
good job&#151;well done.&#148; What they really want is to hear
that the Prime Minister and the Chancellor are doing a good job.
Instead, there are cuts in manpower, equipment and funding. Since 1997,
the Army has been reduced by 9,000, the Royal Navy by 10,000, and the
RAF by 16,000. As has been said time and again in the House today, we
are now experiencing overstretch. Soldiers in Afghanistan do not want a
pat on the back; they want the Government to do their job. Our soldiers
are rightly respected the world over, but it is increasingly hard for
them to do their job when they are constrained by the size of the force
and the nature of the equipment that they
receive.</p><p><a name="stpa_o379"><a name="61122-0016.htm_para29"><a name="06112238000670">The
Government&#146;s failure to support our armed forces is having an
impact, as my hon. Friend the Member for North Wiltshire
(Mr. Gray) said. There is a recruitment crisis and there are
problems with retention. As has been mentioned, the number of
Territorial Army reserves has reduced from the 1998 level of 56,000 to
36,000 today. Some 13,000 reservists have actually resigned because of
the consequences of current policy.</p><p><a name="stpa_o380"><a name="61122-0016.htm_para30"><a name="06112238000671">If that were not enough, people
are also demoralised by the procurement process. We have the most
complicated procurement process possible, and there are delays in
getting equipment to the front line. Let us consider the SA80 rifle. It
cost &#163;92 million to modify 200,000 SA80 rifles, which works out
at &#163;460 per weapon. However, they only cost &#163;400 each.
There are other such examples right across the military spectrum, one
of which is the Apache helicopter. This very important aircraft is
doing a fantastic job in Afghanistan, and we wanted to buy it. But
rather than purchasing it off the shelf, we decided to build a factory
in this country and to construct them here. The price went up from $12
million to $40 million per helicopter.</p><br>

two major areas of interest that have been covered in depth, the first

way of thinking, and I hope that the United Kingdom will be able to

basic the argument is in the United States. However, we could consider
another solution and I suspect that we will come to it in the end, one
way or another. We can carry on as we are, heading towards civil
war&#151;I do not wish to detract from the work the British and
American troops are doing, because removing them would cause chaos. The
only solution is to partition the country into three separate
areas.</p><p><a name="stpa_o385"><a name="61122-0017.htm_para4"><a name="06112238000676">Look at the
costs. Britain alone has spent &#163;4,500 million in Iraq since
2003. What have we got to show for that? There is very little
electricity, hardly any petrol for cars, no development of communities
and no jobs. The atmosphere is very scary. Add that to the billions of
dollars that the Americans have spent and we could have built housing
estates, hospitals and roads. We need some method of asking the Iraqis

no longer live or work together. We need seriously to consider some

opportunity of visiting Afghanistan again three weeks ago and I was
pleased to note that communities are developing in the north and roads
are being built. Unfortunately, the limited peace has exposed a huge
amount of corruption in the Karzai Government, which needs to be
corrected. It stems not from President Karzai himself, who is clearly
working hard, but from the failure of the G8 countries to fulfil their
commitments. The Attorney-General, for example, is very concerned that
the Italians have failed to sort out the judicial system, so
prosecutors are receiving backhanders all the time. The Germans have
also failed to fulfil their commitments on the police in Afghanistan
and Britain, I am sad to say, is failing to produce a strategy to deal
with narcotics. The London accord has been signed, but there is no
scrutiny and no body that can check whether the G8 commitments have
been fulfilled.</p><p><a name="stpa_o388"><a name="61122-0017.htm_para7"><a name="06112238000681">I am

he had requested more Warriors in Helmand province. He has told his
Canadian troops to upgrade from their Bisons, which are large armoured
vehicles, to Leopard 2s, which are main battle tanks. That shows the
seriousness of the threat in Helmand province. We should consider that
carefully. Whatever the score is with Brigadier John Lorimer&#151;he
probably did not expect to be mentioned so many times in this

issue of narcotics in Afghanistan. That is critical because it is a
British G8 responsibility, and it is getting out of control. The drugs
trade in Afghanistan has increased by 59 per cent. overall and by 168
per cent. in Helmand province, but the product could be turned into
something commercially useful, such as codeine or morphine. As my right
hon. Friend the Member for Richmond, Yorks (Mr. Hague) said
in his opening remarks, we have an opportunity here. Let us run pilot
schemes in Helmand province to see if we can work with the farmers and
prevent terrorists from benefiting from that product. We could put a
tax on it that would help President Karzai and the central
Administration. That would also wean the Afghans from their dependency
on the drug culture.</p><p><a name="stpa_o390"><a name="61122-0017.htm_para9"><a name="06112238000687">When I was in Afghanistan three

approach to ensure that Britain continues to punch above its
weight&#151;to use the famous phrase of the former Foreign Secretary,
Douglas Hurd&#151;with foreign policy. Our status as a world power
and a leading member of the UN will diminish unless we look more
towards the future. It is vital that we take a more proactive approach
in dealing with the newly emerging world powers. When thinking of the
future, we must not rely exclusively on our existing allies. We need to
expand our relationships beyond established, traditional links such as
those with the United States, the European Union and Japan. In short,
Britain must ensure that the Foreign and Commonwealth Office actively
cultivates good working relationships with the superpowers of the
future.</p><p><a name="stpa_o394"><a name="61122-0017.htm_para13"><a name="06112238000692">India and
China are already recognised as the next superpowers. India has the
world&#146;s second largest population and is a nuclear power. It has
the fourth largest economy in the world, and that economy is growing
fast. Of course, India has historic and valued ties with the United
Kingdom, but we must not take those links for granted. We must nurture
and develop those bonds even further, not least because our competitors
are certainly working hard to develop closer links in our place. China
has always been classed as a military power because of its military
might, but as a result of the startling growth of its economy, its
sphere of influence is growing to truly global proportions.
China&#146;s markets continue to expand, and it is forecast that, by
the end of 2006, its economy is will have grown by more than 10 per
cent. for the fourth year in a
row.</p><p><a name="stpa_o395"><a name="61122-0017.htm_para14"><a name="06112238000693">The whole world
is trying to cultivate closer links with India and China, and that
means that competition is fierce. Although we must continue to
strengthen our ties with those two countries, we must also identify and
cultivate the major global powers that will emerge after them. Brazil,
for example, has the world&#146;s fifth largest population and ninth
largest economy, and has a diverse industry base. Equally important is
the fact that it borders every south American country except Ecuador
and Chile, and so exerts considerable influence on all affairs on the
south American continent.</p><p><a name="stpa_o396"><a name="61122-0017.htm_para15"><a name="06112238000694">Indonesia and South Africa are
both developing as economic powerhouses. They are important countries
in their own regions, and have a great deal of influence on
neighbouring nations. Indonesia&#146;s massive population of 223
million people should not be underestimated, and the same can be said
of its economy, which is the 15th largest in the world. Moreover, it is
the only east Asian member of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting
Countries, and its natural energy reserves mean that it is well placed
to play a strong economic role in the region in the years ahead. South
Africa is a major economic and military power and it has the potential
to be a powerful force for good on the African continent. Our attention
must also focus on Mexico, South Korea, Argentina and Thailand, all of
which have growing economies and show all the signs of exerting greater
influence on the world stage in future.</p><p><a name="stpa_o397"><a name="61122-0017.htm_para16"><a name="06112238000695">As Lord Howell said, earlier

closer friendship for our own benefit without recognising the concerns
of our potential allies. An obvious example is the frustration
expressed by many countries about the United Nations. We must listen to
those concerns and, where possible, make the necessary changes. It is
in our interests to start taking that approach now, because when such
countries reach their full potential, both economically and
politically, it is to be hoped that they will remember who their
friends were before they became major players, and so include us in
their sphere of consideration. We must seize the moment and stay ahead,
or risk losing power and influence as the world rapidly changes around
us.</p><p><a name="stpa_o400"><a name="61122-0017.htm_para19"><a name="06112238000698">Building stronger
links with those countries has other advantages, such as co-operation
in trying to secure a safer world. Many of those nations have valuable
links with countries that are not on such friendly terms with the west
as we would like. India, for example, has close relationships with
Iran; indeed, during the period of Clive of India, Persian was one of
the main languages in that country. Those strong links continue to this
day, and that close relationship could be useful, particularly given
the present difficulties, and the west must not overlook it when
considering dealing with Iran.</p><p><a name="stpa_o401"><a name="61122-0017.htm_para20"><a name="06112238000699">In like manner, China is
expanding its sphere of influence and taking a much more active role on
the world stage. China is probably the only country that can have a
proper dialogue with North Korea and it claimed credit for helping to
ensure that North Korea did not repeat its recent nuclear tests by
cutting off oil supplies in September and reading the Riot Act to North
Korea before restarting and hosting
talks.</p><p><a name="stpa_o402"><a name="61122-0017.htm_para21"><a name="06112238000700">We should
welcome the pressure that China put on North Korea, but China can do
more and we should encourage her to do so. China has strong economic
links with Iran and should also be encouraged to use its influence in
that area. I echo the sentiments expressed earlier by the hon. Member
for Stroud (Mr. Drew), who is not in the Chamber at present.
He pointed out that China has close links with Zimbabwe and should be
persuaded to exert greater pressure on that troubled country. Indeed,
the destitute state of Zimbabwe was effectively and passionately

pursuit of a new era in which we seek collectively to have an

The harmony guidelines are all but disregarded, the Government are
regularly breaching their own planning assumptions, and there is now a
strong case to revisit them. When we listen to the contributions made
here today and when we visit our troops, wherever they happen to be
deployed, we realise that, intellectually, no conclusion can be arrived
at other than that our Army is now too small for the tasks being asked
of it.</p><p><a name="stpa_o421"><a name="61122-0018.htm_para7"><a name="06112245000018">The debate
began with a long section of the Foreign Secretary&#146;s speech, and
an emphasis by my right hon. Friend the shadow Foreign Secretary, on
the situation in the middle east, particularly in Israel and Palestine.
At a volatile time in a volatile area, there is a need to maintain a
balanced picture and a sense of proportion. Let us remember that Israel
is a democratic state with an independent judiciary and a healthy
market economy system. Its right to exist, to protect itself and to
maintain its borders is indisputable. So is the right of the
Palestinian people to determine their future. We all seem to know where
we want to end up in a two-state settlement; the question is how we get
there. As my hon. Friend the Member for Reigate (Mr. Blunt)
said, it is very important, on the way, not to make the problems more
difficult than they originally
were.</p><p><a name="stpa_o422"><a name="61122-0018.htm_para8"><a name="06112245000019">There has been
much talk in the debate about Hamas. However, it is worth the House
understanding why Hamas came to power. It did not come to power because
the citizens of Gaza were more anti-Israeli; it came to power because
of the corruption of the Palestinian Authority and the fact that Hamas
promised to deliver real changes on the ground in the things that
mattered to ordinary people. That must be properly
understood.</p><p><a name="stpa_o423"><a name="61122-0018.htm_para9"><a name="06112245000020">There has
been much talk about democracy, but if democracy were simply about the
exercise of electoral mechanics, Gaza and not Israel would be the
beacon state in the middle east. My hon. Friend the Member for
South-West Devon (Mr. Streeter) made a telling speech about
the need to see democracy in a wider sense. Democracy is not just
putting a cross on a ballot paper once every five years; Britain was
liberal long before it was democratic. We had 200 years between Adam
Smith and universal suffrage. Our liberal institutions and values, our
independent judiciary, our rule of law that applied equally to the
governing and the governed, our respect for human rights, our ability
to exercise our individual liberty in a market system and our ownership
of property all underpinned our democracy. Perhaps, now and again, we
might want to remember that it took us a long time to get to where we
are now, and that other countries will not make the transition
overnight. The more often we can make that point politically, the
easier it is for us to hold public opinion with us here, and to hold
public opinion in the countries where we are involved. Extending
democracy is a laudable and noble ambition, but it cannot be done
quickly.</p><p><a name="stpa_o424"><a name="61122-0018.htm_para10"><a name="06112245000021">That is the
message that the United Kingdom should have pressed and should continue
to press more and more with our allies in Washington. There is no doubt

the process could take place more quickly and that democracy could be

have to be give and take, and my hon. Friend the Member for
Bournemouth, East (Mr. Ellwood) made it clear in his
comments about the joint strike fighter that if we are to have a
meaningful strategic relationship in defence with the United States, it
will have to give as well as take. That means that on the software
issues, it will have to make sure that the intellectual property
transfer comes to a trusted ally. If not, the partnership will be
weaker for that.</p><p><a name="stpa_o426"><a name="61122-0018.htm_para12"><a name="06112245000023">There
was much talk about the wider middle east, including north Africa and
Turkey. Stability in north Africa is hugely important for security in
the Mediterranean, a region of huge strategic importance to the UK. It
is worth looking at the difference between NATO&#146;s approach and
the EU&#146;s approach to the problem. The NATO-Mediterranean
dialogue is producing some real results. It should be further up the
NATO agenda, and I would like to see it given greater emphasis at the
Riga summit, but it stands in stark contrast to a failure in the
Euro-Med process where the free trade area that was promised by 2010 as
part of the 2004 treaty of Agadir will not happen. If NATO can push
ahead to build relations with some of those north African states so
that they can look to the Mediterranean and northwards for their
prosperity and security, and not south to the Gulf, that will be of
enormous benefit to the United Kingdom and our wider
security.</p><p><a name="stpa_o427"><a name="61122-0018.htm_para13"><a name="06112245000024">That wider
security comes into great focus when we consider the question of
Turkey, which is a key NATO ally. It is a secular, westernising,
liberalising country, moving in all the right directions, sometimes too
slowly, but none the less moving in the direction that we would wish to
see. It is an important buffer zone between Europe and some of the more
militant Islamic states. We in Europe have a simple choice: either we
encourage Turkey to move towards us, holding out the hope of membership
of the EU, or we risk a Turkish backlash when those in Turkey believe
that no matter what changes they make they will never be allowed into
the EU, and instead of having a secular, modernising state on the
European borders, we find ourselves with a militant Islamic state on
the border of Greece. Those French and German politicians who think
that playing to their domestic audiences is smart had better start to
understand what the strategic consequences of alienating Turkey might
be in the longer
term.</p><p><a name="stpa_o428"><a name="61122-0018.htm_para14"><a name="06112245000025">Much of the
debate, reasonably and expectedly, focused on Afghanistan. From the
very outset, we have agreed the basic aims of the Government&#146;s
policy in Afghanistan: that to create a stable, democratic state that
does not allow the nurturing of terrorism is in our wider national
interest and failure would be strategically disastrous, for reasons
that we have often set out in the House. The cohesion and reputation of
NATO would be at stake and we would embolden our enemies&#151;and if
we abandon the people of Afghanistan half-way through, who would
believe us ever again when we said that we would help? We undoubtedly
have a moral commitment that must be seen right through to the
end.</p><br>

mission. This is a UN-sanctioned mission, carried out by NATO because
it is our common security that is being defended, and it is simply not
good enough for some of our NATO allies to fail to pull their weight in
this mission. They need to raise their defence expenditure and their
political commitment to the whole process. It is simply not good enough
to have German, Italian or Spanish troops already deployed, but which
cannot be used properly when they are needed by the force
commanders.</p><p><a name="stpa_o430"><a name="61122-0018.htm_para16"><a name="06112245000027">There
seems to be a difference in Afghanistan, where British troops
understand that they are a single force under NATO command while too
many of our European allies seem to believe that they are national

two, and the Government need to invest a great deal of diplomatic
effort in convincing them of the need to make some
changes.</p><p><a name="stpa_o431"><a name="61122-0018.htm_para17"><a name="06112245000028">There are two
matters that the Government need continually to undertake in
Afghanistan. The first is a realistic assessment of where we are and
the likely rate of progress that we can make, and the second is to
ensure that our troops have all that is necessary to maximise the
chance of success of the mission and minimise the risk to our troops
themselves.</p><p><a name="stpa_o432"><a name="61122-0018.htm_para18"><a name="06112245000029">The
realistic assessment goes right back to the beginning of the rhetoric
that the Government used at the beginning of the deployment in
Afghanistan. We were told that our mission was not war fighting but
reconstruction, then we sent 16th Air Assault Brigade to do the
business&#151;hardly a force for reconstruction and peacekeeping.
Only 10 per cent. of the promised reconstruction spending has ever
materialised, and we if we cannot produce the basic infrastructure
benefits for the ordinary Iraqi citizens that they believed we arrived
there to produce, run the risk of finding ourselves much less welcome
in the time ahead.</p><p><a name="stpa_o433"><a name="61122-0018.htm_para19"><a name="06112245000030">There is a problem here with
the Department for International Development, because it is not
possible to undertake that reconstruction, which is in itself vital to
the maintenance of the military mission, in a zero-risk environment,
and there seem to be too many in DFID who do not want anything to do
with conflict, and therefore do not want to be involved in any risk.
That culture is not acceptable, for the long-term potential success of
the mission.</p><p><a name="stpa_o434"><a name="61122-0018.htm_para20"><a name="06112245000031">Finally
on that point, there was an interesting intervention by the Secretary
of State for Defence on my right hon. Friend the shadow Foreign
Secretary on the issue of what Brigadier Lorimer might have asked or
may ask for. From the discussion on the Floor of the House I have
concluded that the Prime Minister has promised that what our commanders
on the ground want, they will get. The Secretary of State for Defence
has said that he has not yet been asked for some of the specifics that
were mentioned at the weekend. If requests are made for more troops,
artillery, armoured vehicles and tanks, I assume that the correct
understanding of what we have heard today is that those things will be
supplied.</p><p><a name="stpa_o435"><a name="61122-0018.htm_para21"><a name="06112245000032">If there is

although a number have been bandied around the Chamber today.
Withdrawal is not an easy solution. As several of my hon. Friends have
said, it is likely to lead to an increase in insurgency and loss of
life. Setting a timetable is not sensible, because it would invite
insurgents to try to disrupt it. Partition is not an easy solution,
because Turkey will not take kindly to a separate Kurdish state on its
southern border. If we were to adopt that solution, we would run the
risk of transferring the conflict from one part of the region to
another.</p><p><a name="stpa_o437"><a name="61122-0018.htm_para23"><a name="06112245000034">It would help
if we were to admit some of the mistakes that were made at the outset.
Disbanding the Iraqi army, the one institution which commanded public
respect, was a mistake; the under-deployment for the reconstruction
period was, in retrospect, a mistake; and the length of time taken to
give out the contracts for reconstruction was a mistake. That is not to
say that the basic decision was wrong, but we need to understand that
our mistakes have probably made our involvement in Iraq longer and more
difficult than it would otherwise have
been.</p><p><a name="stpa_o438"><a name="61122-0018.htm_para24"><a name="06112245000035">One strong point
coming out of today&#146;s debate has been the demand from the House
for accountability. As my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for
Rushcliffe (Mr. Clarke) has said, we have the right to
debate policy with the Prime Minister, whose policy this primarily is,
in a proper debate rather than in the context of a statement, where the
dynamic is very different, in front of this House and in front of the
country. My hon. Friend the Member for Billericay (Mr.
Baron) made that point very
powerfully.</p><p><a name="stpa_o439"><a name="61122-0018.htm_para25"><a name="06112245000036">My right
hon. and learned Friend the Member for Rushcliffe made another very
important point when he said that the Prime Minister no longer has an
influence on events. We need to consider whether we have a Prime
Minister who no longer has the political weight at home or the
longevity to see through some of the things that he is promising and
whether, far from being an asset for the country, he is now a strategic
liability.</p><p><a name="stpa_o440"><a name="61122-0018.htm_para26"><a name="06112245000037">My right
hon. and learned Friend the Member for Kensington and Chelsea (Sir
Malcolm Rifkind) said that the regional dominance that Iran is likely
to enjoy is the unintended consequence of policy in Iraq and
Afghanistan, and he discussed the need for a better carrot and a more
credible stick. There is no doubt that bringing Iran to the negotiating
table in support of a settlement in Iraq would be a desirable end in
the right circumstance, which is Iran understanding that it is
in its national interest for there not to be a civil war in Iraq that
destabilises the region. However, it is not in our national interest to
give anything to Iran, especially in relation to its nuclear programme,
to try to bring it to the negotiating table. The proliferation of
nuclear weapons, and in particular Iran&#146;s possession of nuclear
weapons, cannot be in our national interest, regional interest or
global interest, and we must do everything that we can to prevent what
happened in North Korea from happening in Iran. I am afraid that that
means that we cannot rule out at any point the use of force, if it is
ultimately required in some way.</p><br>

important question of the nuclear deterrent. In a world where

onus to make the case is not on those who want to keep the deterrent,

stands on the nuclear deterrent question, and we have never changed our

let me turn first to Iraq. I accept what is clearly the view of the
House, that we face a very challenging situation in Iraq. Every time I
have addressed the issue at the Dispatch Box I have recognised the
nature and scale of that challenge, and I have neither sought to play
down the nature of the violence in Iraq nor to be complacent about it
in any way. We must understand who is perpetrating that violence, why
they seek to prevent the democratically elected Government from
sustaining themselves, and why they have made it their life&#146;s
work to do so. That is the most significant reason for our standing by

would like to repeat that appreciation. I know how important it is to
our people, particularly in the military, to have broad support and
understanding back home for the difficult and dangerous work that they
do. At this juncture, I wish to break off to make a point about morale.
A number of speakers were wrong about the morale of our troops,
particularly troops deployed in theatre. I have visited the theatres in
Iraq and Afghanistan on a number of occasions, and I have spent a
significant amount of time talking not only to troops deployed in
theatre but to those who have returned to the UK. I can tell the House
without fear of contradiction that morale among our troops in both
theatres is of the highest order. I do not accept from those who
clearly have not had the opportunity to speak to our troops on the
ground, or to our diplomats and others who support them, suggestions
that they are disillusioned&#151;that disparages the work that they
do. They are not disillusioned; if anything, they are concerned about
the failure of others back here in the United Kingdom to appreciate
what they do.</p><p><a name="stpa_o446"><a name="61122-0018.htm_para32"><a name="06112245000044">Given
what I have said about the support that that we regularly receive from
the official Opposition on such matters, I was surprised by the
position that they adopted during the Opposition day debate three weeks
ago. Of course, there will come a time when it is right to learn the
lessons of the past three years&#151;in fact, at an operational
level, as many people know, we do that continuously&#151;but to have
an inquiry that focuses on the past when what matters most is the
future of Iraq and when our soldiers are there on the ground working
for the future seems at best unwise, and it is certainly opportunistic.
The Conservatives even admitted during the debate that they did not
agree with it. I hope that, as the right hon. Member for Richmond,
Yorks suggested, we can put that behind us and resume the mature and
responsible approach that has previously categorised our debates on the
subject and that I have always welcomed.</p>

Browne:</b> The investigation that was called for in the
debate in which the official Opposition were so equivocal was
distinctly dissimilar to the exercise that is being carried out by
Baker-Hamilton. It is not for me, as a Minister in this Government, to
express a view about whether or not it is right or otherwise for a
sovereign Government to carry out investigations as they choose. From
my point of view and that of the Government, the nature of the inquiry
that was being called for in that debate would have significantly
undermined the work that our troops were doing on the ground at the
time. That is why it was inappropriate to support the
inquiry.</p><p><a name="stpa_o448"><a name="61122-0019.htm_para1"><a name="06112245000050">As we build
up the Iraqi Government and hand over security to the Iraqi army and
police we will begin a phased withdrawal of our own forces. That
process is already under way. Two of the four provinces in the south,
al-Muthanna and Dhi Qar, were handed over during the summer. In a
third, Maysan, we have moved away from front-line security and from our
fixed base and towards a supporting role. As my right hon. Friend the
Foreign Secretary said earlier, we hope formally to hand over security
early next year. The fourth province, Basra, remains the most
difficult, but again, as my right hon. Friend told the House, last
month during the Opposition day debate and reiterated today, we hope
that the Iraqis will be in a position to take over in the spring, but
our approach will continue to be driven not by an arbitrary timetable
but by reality on the
ground.</p><p><a name="stpa_o449"><a name="61122-0019.htm_para2"><a name="06112245000051">This is a
stage in a process which in time will produce a draw-down of our
forces. There are important tasks left to do&#151;to support the
Iraqi army by training and standing by to re-intervene if necessary, to
protect the border with Iran, and to reinforce our efforts in Basra.
Together with the Iraqi army, we are working through Basra city area by
area, preparing for handover with a new push on security, backed by
renewed investment in basic services such as clean drinking water,
proper sewerage and cleaning up the streets.</p><p><a name="stpa_o450"><a name="61122-0019.htm_para3"><a name="06112245000052">In Basra and all 18 provinces
across Iraq we need to accept that progress depends on many factors,
not all of them directly under our control. The terrorists and foreign
fighters will continue to have a say and to grab the headlines with
their attacks on markets and

such as Prime Minister Maliki&#146;s efforts on
reconciliation&#151;although none of us, and certainly not those of
us in this House with experience in Northern Ireland and elsewhere,
will be under any illusion about how difficult and precarious such
reconciliation processes are.</p><p><a name="stpa_o451"><a name="61122-0019.htm_para4"><a name="06112245000053">The challenges are complex and
there are few, if any, quick fixes but we are making progress. The
people of Iraq need our support and continued commitment. Their
security and prosperity&#151;and that of the whole
region&#151;depend on
it.</p><p><a name="stpa_o452"><a name="61122-0019.htm_para5"><a name="06112245000054">The right hon.
Member for Richmond, Yorks reminded us earlier of one the most
important truths in foreign and defence policy&#151;one that I have
emphasised since I took up my current responsibilities. Diplomacy,
military force and development cannot, by themselves, solve the
challenges that we face. We need to bring together the different
strands to work closely across Government and international
institutions to produce a lasting effect. That is nowhere more true and
important than in the other theatre where our forces are serving in
large numbers: Afghanistan.</p><p><a name="stpa_o453"><a name="61122-0019.htm_para6"><a name="06112245000055">I have said previously that I
believe that Afghanistan is a noble cause and that I welcome the broad
support for the mission from Opposition parties, which mirrors the
broad support throughout the developed world, with forces from 37
countries serving alongside ours. However, as the debate shows, the
broad consensus on the mission disguises differences on many aspects,
including disagreement about tactics, criticism over whether we are
giving our forces the right support and pessimism about the likely
outcome. I shall deal briefly with those differences, since they were
raised in the
debate.</p><p><a name="stpa_o454"><a name="61122-0019.htm_para7"><a name="06112245000056">On tactics, I
shall say little except that it is easy to second-guess from this
distance. The few who loudly criticised the decisions of our commanders
earlier this year are conspicuously silent now. In general, there is
more discussion about tactics than we should feel comfortable about,
given the clear evidence that debates in Britain are played straight
back to communities in which our forces have to
work.</p><p><a name="stpa_o455"><a name="61122-0019.htm_para8"><a name="06112245000057">The second
criticism is about whether we are giving our forces the right support.
I believe that much of that is unjustified. I am far from complacent.
Together with the chiefs of staff and the Department, I am working
relentlessly to ensure that we recognise and respond to the needs of
our forces on operations in weeks or months rather than years. I hope
that I have demonstrated that commitment by coming to the House to
announce measures ranging from the introduction of a new tax-free bonus
for forces on operations to the new package for protected vehicles,
which the right hon. Member for North-East Hampshire (Mr.
Arbuthnot) raised earlier. Each of those measures was funded by more
than &#163;50 million of new money provided by the
Treasury.</p><p><a name="stpa_o456"><a name="61122-0019.htm_para9"><a name="06112245000058">Underneath
those measures, we have a programme, costing hundreds of millions of
pounds, less visible but equally important, of continuous upgrades to
our equipment to deal with the evolving threats and challenges in both
Afghanistan and Iraq.</p><br>

process for reviewing force numbers in both Afghanistan and Iraq, but,
as I made clear earlier&#151;indeed on numerous occasions in the
House&#151;it is neither appropriate nor helpful to discuss its
workings before they are complete. However, I remind the House that
each time it has been necessary to strengthen our forces&#151;in
Afghanistan in July and on a smaller scale in Iraq in
September&#151;the chiefs of staff and I have made sure that our
commanders on the ground have what they need.</p><p><a name="stpa_o458"><a name="61122-0019.htm_para11"><a name="06112245000060">Of course, the Government
acknowledge the burden placed on our armed forces by the current
operational commitment. Although I know that it suits the agenda of the

morale is low among our forces on operations, that is flatly untrue, as
I have seen repeatedly on my visits to

training and retention are fundamental. Those points were made
eloquently by my right hon. Friend the Member for Islwyn
(Mr. Touhig) and the right hon. Member for North-East
Hampshire. I am sure that both would acknowledge that the armed forces
and the Ministry of Defence take that seriously. We go to great lengths
to monitor and respond to trends in recruitment and
retention.</p><p><a name="stpa_o460"><a name="61122-0019.htm_para13"><a name="06112245000062">My right
hon. Friend the Member for Islwyn urged members to read the National
Audit Office report. I second that. If they do, they will see the
efforts that we have made and the encouraging signs in Army
recruitment, which is up by 10 per cent., with Army manning levels that
are now in balance.</p><p><a name="stpa_o461"><a name="61122-0019.htm_para14"><a name="06112245000063">We have always acknowledged the
burden of operations and what we have to do to respond to that. The
Conservative party acknowledges it, too, but is fond of saying that the
Government must choose between reducing commitments or increasing
resources. Today&#146;s debate shows why we believe that the two
major commitments&#151;in Iraq and Afghanistan&#151;are not
optional.</p><p><a name="stpa_o462"><a name="61122-0019.htm_para15"><a name="06112245000064">As for
resources, let me correct the misleading impression left by the right
hon. Member for North-East Hampshire, who referred to &#147;the
long-term decline of the defence budget&#148;. That is simply untrue.
In the past five years, the annual defence budget has risen on average
by &#163;1 billion a year&#151;well in excess of inflation and
comparing favourably with the period when he was a Defence Minister
during the last five years of the previous Conservative Government. The
defence budget then fell by more than &#163;500 million a
year.</p><p><a name="stpa_o463"><a name="61122-0019.htm_para16"><a name="06112245000065">Let me remind
the House that, despite frequent claims made by the hon. Members for
Woodspring and for North Devon (Nick Harvey) and repeated today by
other Members, the Army has not shrunk by 9,000 or 10,000&#151;or any
other figure&#151;since 1997. Some weeks ago, I wrote to the hon.

Christopher Fraser (South-West Norfolk) (Con):</b> I am
grateful for the opportunity to revisit the important matter of
prostate cancer. I firmly believe that most men, me included, pay
insufficient regard to our general health and well-being. We are much
less likely than we should be to go to the doctor when worried about
something, particularly on sensitive issues such as prostate problems
for which most men imagine the tests will be unpleasant and intrusive.
However, men are putting their health and their lives at risk by such
delay. For prostate cancer, as for all cancers, the key to recovery is
catching it early before it spreads. I hope that today&#146;s debate
will help to raise awareness of
it.</p><p><a name="stpa_o476"><a name="61122-0019.htm_para29"><a name="0611232000013">I last sponsored a
debate on this subject in 1998. On that occasion, I was most grateful
to receive the advice and guidance of Dr. James Dobbie. I am pleased to
be able to say that for today&#146;s debate I have received
immeasurable support from several prostate cancer charities, for which
I wish to express my sincere
thanks.</p><p><a name="stpa_o477"><a name="61122-0019.htm_para30"><a name="0611232000014">At the end of

to seeking to provide equal access to high-quality health

priority would be given to improving cancer services, including those
for prostate cancer. However, while significant improvements have been
made to cancer services in the eight years since that debate, I am
afraid it seems that some cancers are more equal than others and that
all too often prostate cancer has been regarded as the poor
relation.</p><p><a name="stpa_o479"><a name="61122-0019.htm_para32"><a name="0611232000016">Much has
changed since I last addressed the House on the subject. Almost 250,000
men have since been diagnosed with prostate cancer, and 75,000 men have
died from it. Prostate cancer is now the most common cancer in men. In
1998 alone, about 24,000 men were diagnosed with prostate cancer. By
2002, the annual figure had risen to 32,000. I am sure that the
Minister will tell the House that the increase is a reflection of wider
testing and diagnosis, rather than of an increase in incidence, and
that mortality rates have remained fairly stable. However, it has been
estimated that a third of men who develop prostate cancer will die from
it. It is responsible for almost as many deaths in men as breast cancer
is in women, yet it receives only a fraction of the funding. I am not
suggesting for one second that funding or resources should be diverted
from breast cancer research or treatment, but rather that breast cancer
should be regarded as a benchmark or example of best practice, and that
there is a powerful and compelling argument for prostate cancer
services being funded to the same level.</p><p><a name="stpa_o480"><a name="61122-0019.htm_para33"><a name="0611232000017">The inequality and inconsistency
that permeates the diagnosis and treatment of prostate cancer as
opposed to other cancers was starkly demonstrated in last year&#146;s
report by the National Audit Office. According to the NAO, prostate
cancer patients reported a generally poorer experience of care than
patients with other cancers. They are more likely to wait more than two

appointment cancelled. They are less likely to have more than 10
minutes with that specialist, and less likely to be informed about the
side-effects of the treatment. They are less likely to have the
opportunity to discuss how the treatment has gone, more likely to say
that they were not given enough help to deal with the post-treatment
pain, less likely to have a named or specialist nurse, and less likely
to understand the information they have been given. They are less
likely to have their home situation taken into account, and less likely
to be given information about support or self-help groups. It is
without question a bleak analysis of the widening gap in the level and
quality of cancer care in the United Kingdom
today.</p><p><a name="stpa_o481"><a name="61122-0019.htm_para34"><a name="0611232000018">I want to
examine one or two of these points in greater detail. First, it is
unacceptable that those with specialist prostate cancer should have to
wait longer than those with other cancers to see a specialist. Last
year, a Minister in the Department of Health said that 98 per cent. of
patients with suspected prostate cancer who were urgently referred by
their GP were seen within two weeks. Does that mean that the medical
profession is less likely to make an urgent referral, rather than a
normal one, for a man who could have prostate cancer than they are for
a woman who might have breast cancer? Will the Minister tell the House
what percentage of prostate cancer patients are referred to a
specialist on a non-urgent basis, and how does that compare with other
major cancers? What assessment have the Government made of the reasons
prostate cancer patients are not fast-tracked in this way? Delays are
also occurring in pathology and radiology departments. Is the system
overstretched? I should be most grateful for the Minister&#146;s
views and comments on those points.</p><p><a name="stpa_o482"><a name="61122-0019.htm_para35"><a name="0611232000019">Secondly, given the often
serious and long-term side-effects of prostate cancer treatments, it is
inexcusable that prostate cancer patients are twice as likely as
patients with other forms of cancer not to have been informed of the
possible side-effects. A recent survey by the Prostate Cancer Charity
suggests that when one includes those who did not understand the
information that they were given about side-effects, that figure
doubles. Therefore, one in five men were not properly informed of the
side-effects and risks of treatment.</p><p><a name="stpa_o483"><a name="61122-0019.htm_para36"><a name="0611232000020">It is particularly important
with prostate cancer&#151;where a choice of treatment or, indeed, the
choice of whether to treat exists&#151;that patients remain in
control of their care. That requires adequate information both in
primary care, where initial discussions take place, and later in
hospital, at the time of diagnosis. It seems that there is a serious
information shortfall that has not been addressed by the prostate
cancer risk management programme set up by the Government, which is
aimed at GPs, or by the NHS as a whole. Consequently, there is an
urgent need to revise and update the arrangements for the delivery of
information.</p>

the hospital setting. Despite the wealth of comprehensive,
authoritative and independent literature on the treatment and diagnosis
of prostate cancer produced by voluntary and charitable organisations,
little of it seems to filter through primary care trusts and NHS trusts
to patients. That must change. Will the Minister give me a commitment
both to update the prostate cancer risk management programme, in
consultation with the voluntary sector, and to commission standardised
and impartial information from the voluntary sector, which NHS
providers can pass on to
patients?</p><p><a name="stpa_o486"><a name="61122-0020.htm_para2"><a name="0611232000023">Many issues
associated with the availability of information for prostate cancer
patients could be resolved if there were more specialist nurses. In
2001, it was reported in the national press that there were 3,000
specialist breast cancer nurses across the country in the NHS, but only
one NHS-funded nurse for prostate cancer. I am given to understand that
the situation may have improved, not least because charitable
organisations have, recognising the vital role that they play, begun
sponsoring specialist prostate and uro-oncology nursing. However, there
is a fear that specialist nurses are being lost or reassigned to
general duties.</p><p><a name="stpa_o487"><a name="61122-0020.htm_para3"><a name="0611232000024">The
prostate cancer charter for action, a collaboration between 24
charities and voluntary organisations with an interest in tackling
prostate cancer, found worrying inequalities in the number of
specialist nurses across the country, following a survey of cancer
networks. Despite NICE&#146;s recommendations that specialist nurses
should play a central role in the treatment of prostate cancer, there
are wide and unacceptable variations in both the number of prostate
cancer specialist nurses available in cancer networks and in the number
of urological
nurses.</p><p><a name="stpa_o488"><a name="61122-0020.htm_para4"><a name="0611232000025">Cancer networks
are also confused about what constitutes a specialist nurse, making an
accurate assessment difficult. There is an urgent need for the
Government to recognise the importance of, and properly fund,
specialist nurses as part of the multidisciplinary teams to care for
and advise patients on the treatment paths open to them. Again, I would
welcome the Minister&#146;s assessment of the situation and the steps
that the Government are taking to increase the number of specialist

the national position is far from clear. Will the Minister give the

cancer care in the
UK?</p><p><a name="stpa_o491"><a name="61122-0020.htm_para7"><a name="0611232000028">There is pressing
need for national data to be collected and used to explore variations,
especially in service standards. There is a clear and growing divide
between affluent home counties, where uptake of prostate specific
antigen testing is highest&#151;as are survival rates&#151;and the
more deprived areas, such as Yorkshire and the Trent area, where men
are less likely to be tested frequently and diagnosed earlier, with the
consequence that mortality rates in those areas are significantly
higher than in London and the Thames valley. That wide geographic
variation is no doubt affected by the regional differences in access to
NICE-approved treatments, an issue to which I shall return later in my
speech. However, it must also&#151;even in some small part, as the
NAO has said&#151;be a reflection of the north-south divide in
testing rates and the lower detection rates of early-stage prostate
cancer because of the lower uptake of PSA testing. I would be most
interested to know what assessment the Minister makes of the causes of
that disparity.</p><p><a name="stpa_o492"><a name="61122-0020.htm_para8"><a name="0611232000029">I am
keenly aware of the shortcomings of, and controversy surrounding, the
PSA test and the false assurances and unnecessary anxieties that it may
bring. I understand therefore the Government&#146;s reluctance to
introduce a national screening programme based on current evidence. The
Government have declared their intention of introducing a national
prostate cancer screening programme when the evidence supports it. I
suggest that that is an unacceptably passive
response.</p><p><a name="stpa_o493"><a name="61122-0020.htm_para9"><a name="0611232000030">Hon. Members
will be aware that work is under way in many academic centres around
the world to identify potential markers of prostate cancer and to
develop potential new and more reliable tests. Will the Minister please
say what pro-active steps the Government are taking to accelerate
global development in that area and to ensure that the UK is
contributing effectively to that
effort?</p><p><a name="stpa_o494"><a name="61122-0020.htm_para10"><a name="0611232000031">The UK has a
large pool of men with prostate cancer who have not had radical surgery
or radiotherapy&#151;as they might have had if they lived in
countries such as the United States&#151;but who have followed a
regime of so-called active surveillance. Consequently, we surely have a
unique contribution to make in testing potential biomarkers of prostate
cancer behaviours in men untouched by radical treatment
interventions.</p><p><a name="stpa_o495"><a name="61122-0020.htm_para11"><a name="0611232000032">Prompt
access to treatments approved by NICE is vital to survival rates of any
cancer. Once again, however, there are two tiers of both cancer and
treatment. When a handful of PCTs refused to sanction the use of
Herceptin for women with breast cancer, there was a national outcry,
but men with prostate cancer are frequently denied access to
brachytherapy, a form of radiotherapy that can dramatically reduce
damage to surrounding organs and the resulting
side-effects.</p><p><a name="stpa_o496"><a name="61122-0020.htm_para12"><a name="0611232000033">Similarly,

out fewer than 40 prostatectomies a year than it was in those carrying
out 140 a year. NICE also recommends that the surgery should be carried
out by specialist teams, and that those teams should perform at least
50 radical operations a year.</p><p><a name="stpa_o497"><a name="61122-0020.htm_para13"><a name="0611232000034">For the most prevalent cancers,
such as breast cancer, specialisation in surgery is becoming the norm,
but the situation is not so satisfactory for prostate cancer. Out of
the 133 trusts where prostatectomies were carried out in 2002-03, only
12 performed more than 50 operations. As the National Audit Office

changed? The Government have produced the NHS cancer plan, the report
&#147;Making Progress on Prostate Cancer&#148;, the NHS prostate
cancer programme and the prostate cancer risk management programme.
Moreover, NICE has finally published guidelines on the optimum
treatment for urological cancers, six years after details of best
practice in breast cancer treatment were announced, and both the NAO
and the PAC have issued a plethora of reports. Direct Government
funding of research has increased from &#163;200,000 in 1999-2000 to
&#163;4.2 million in 2003-04, but prostate cancer lacks the
historical investment from which other cancers have benefited
significantly.</p><p><a name="stpa_o502"><a name="61122-0020.htm_para18"><a name="0611232000039">Some
progress has been made, but further advances depend largely on strong
political leadership from the Government. If we are to have the same
success in identifying and treating prostate cancer as we have achieved
with breast cancer, the level of political support must also be
equal.</p><p><a name="stpa_o503"><a name="61122-0020.htm_para19"><a name="0611232000040">I implore the

the Government published the prostate cancer programme, which set out
the action that the we proposed to take to tackle the disease. In
addition, the report &#147;Making Progress on Prostate Cancer&#148;
was published in November 2004, outlining some of the good progress
that had been made to that date. The momentum has been maintained. Now

guidance for urological cancers on how best to organise services to

that guidance, and we expect full implementation in all networks by
December 2007. The number of consultant urologists has increased by
nearly 46 per cent. since 1997. We are also looking at how we can

forms of cancer obviously continues to be a key priority for the
Government, and the NHS is spending about &#163;4 billion on cancer
services every year. I can also assure him that gender is not an issue
in any of the Government&#146;s decisions on cancer funding. We make
funding decisions using the best available clinical evidence. In fact,
prostate cancer is the only cancer with a Department of Health spending
target for research of &#163;4.2 million a year, which is a
20-fold increase in funding compared to 1999. That target was met in
2003, as promised. It rose to &#163;4.3 million in 2004 and
I can assure the hon. Gentleman that that level of funding will be
maintained in future years, but some of it will, of course, be subject

received.</p><p><a name="stpa_o507"><a name="61122-0020.htm_para23"><a name="0611232000045">The hon.
Gentleman is right to say that we always need to do more. I want
particularly to draw attention to the work that we have been able to do
with some of the key stakeholders. We supported the prostate charter
for action, launched in 2003. To ensure collaboration between the
stakeholders who signed the charter and the Government we set up the
prostate cancer advisory group, chaired by Professor Mike Richards, our
national cancer director. The group includes representatives from the

Gentleman&#146;s point about giving patients information is extremely

looking at the information patients need, but it is important that we
work with patient groups to find out what will enable patients to make

were doing to find better a diagnostic test for prostate cancer. The
Department of Health has been supporting the development of screening
technology for prostate cancer by a comprehensive research strategy for
all aspects of prostate cancer. Together with partners at the National
Cancer Research Institute, we are funding two cancer collaboratives on
prostate cancer. That has already generated the groundbreaking
discovery of the overactive E2F3 gene in prostate cancer tumours. The
discovery has not only provided the opportunity to identify those at
risk of developing the disease, but has allowed for the first time a
prediction to be made of how aggressive the cancer will be. As I am
sure the hon. Gentleman knows, that is extremely important, especially
with regard to the decisions that people might want to make about the
treatment that they need. We have also funded a &#163;20 million
trial of treatments for prostate-specific
antigen&#151;PSA&#151;screen-detected early prostate
cancer.</p><p><a name="stpa_o511"><a name="61122-0020.htm_para27"><a name="0611232000049">The hon.
Gentleman rightly raised the important issue of public awareness of
prostate cancer. We jointly funded a pilot public awareness programme
on prostate cancer with our partners in the prostate cancer charter for
action. The pilot took place in Coventry in October and it is being
independently evaluated so that we can learn from it and determine the
best way forward to raise public awareness of prostate cancer. We have
also examined how we can raise public awareness through our section 64
grants. Some of the money has gone to the Prostate Cancer Charity to
increase the amount of information available about prostate cancer, and
especially, to improve awareness among men from African and
Afro-Caribbean communities, who are at increased risk of prostate
cancer.</p><p><a name="stpa_o512"><a name="61122-0020.htm_para28"><a name="0611232000050">The hon.

programme. As he said, the programme was put in place to help general
practitioners to advise men who wanted a PSA test and to allow them to
point out the pros and cons of having the test. As he said, this is
about enabling men to make an informed choice. The packs that we
initially sent out have been evaluated. We are considering reviewing

an important aspect of ensuring that we can raise awareness. We are

services for people with prostate cancer. We do not collect data on the
number of prostate cancer nurse specialists. However, the overall
increase in the number of nurses working in the NHS has assisted the
recruitment of additional cancer-site specific nurse specialists. NICE
guidance on improving outcomes in urological cancer reinforces the role
of nurse specialists. As the hon. Gentleman said, the guidance
identifies them specifically as members of the multidisciplinary team

these treatments are safe for use in the NHS. However, I am sure the
hon. Gentleman will recognise that there is no clinical consensus on
the best form of treatment for early prostate cancer. As I said, we
have asked NICE to produce clinical guidance on the diagnosis and
treatment of prostate cancer. That will consider the main types of

necessarily always local, which offer such brachytherapy. Advice is
