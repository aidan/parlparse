 That certainly must be a serious problem for a child with eczema. Since the phase-out of domestic high-energy light bulbs was announced and has become better known, we have received anecdotal evidence that some people with certain skin conditions may be affected by low-energy bulbs. Working with the Department of Health, we are looking seriously at the matter. I have agreed a meeting with Lupus UK, and if others wish to join us at that meeting, I would be pleased to see them. There is a difference between domestic lighting and some other forms of fluorescent lighting still used in shops and offices. Domestic lighting has improved so much that we anticipate that the problem will be overcome.</p>

 Is the Minister aware that if one accidentally breaks a low-energy light bulb, the dust inside is mercury? Inhaling mercury can be very dangerous. In the Budget, the Chancellor of the Exchequer mentioned additional funds being made available to encourage people to make their homes energy-efficient. Will that budget extend to clear guidance and better packaging to ensure that such bulbs are not broken, and clear instructions about what to do if they are?</p>

 I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman, because that issue has been mentioned a lot in the press, and we need to make it clear what the problem is. Low-energy bulbs contain about 5 mg of mercury now, compared with 100 mg when they first came out. The amount is constantly being reduced, and low-mercury bulbs are now available. If a bulb should be broken&#151;although the chances of one breaking are extremely low, lower than for the old-fashioned incandescent bulbs&#151;</p>

 If it were to be dropped it might not break, but if it did, the amount of mercury in a new bulb is perhaps enough to cover the tip of a ballpoint pen. However, mercury is dangerous and care must therefore be taken. The simple thing to do is what any sensible person would do with a dangerous chemical: open the window, leave the room for 10 to 15 minutes and then sweep up the broken bulb, seal it in a bag and dispose of it in the way that I described. However, people should not be nervous of the bulbs; no mercury escapes when they are in use.</p>

 There has been a series of schemes throughout the country whereby councils have tried to educate the local community.

It is the case that we need to increase the clean-up capability, and councils are doing their level best, and it costs a fortune. Also, as my hon.

The problem of chewing gum plagues every shopping precinct up and down the land. Councils are doing their best, but the key thing&#151;if the hon.

 My hon. Friend raises a really important point about the impact of the changing climate on the farming industry. First, on our capacity as a world to feed ourselves, the Food and Agriculture Organisation has said that world food production is still rising more quickly than the global population. There will, however, be between 9 billion and 9.5 billion of us on this planet by 2050, compared with 6.2 billion now.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o7"><a name="80131-0002.htm_para4"><a name="08013153000099">Secondly, although the UK&#146;s self-sufficiency has declined a bit in recent years, it is still higher than it was in the 1930s, before the second world war, and higher than it was after the second world war.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o8"><a name="80131-0002.htm_para5"><a name="08013153000100">Thirdly, a change in climate might mean that some crops that are currently grown will be more difficult to grow, but it could also open up new possibilities. One of the practical steps that we are taking is to fund research at the Agriculture Development Advisory Service and at Warwick into the potential impact of more extreme weather events on the farming community. The truth is that this is an issue for all of us to think about. We need to try to anticipate what might be coming, so that the farming industry will be able to respond.</p>

 Does the Secretary of State accept that the UK livestock industry makes a huge contribution to not only the quality but the security of the food supply in this country? It is also true that cattle are a major generator of methane gas. Is it not important, however, to keep this matter in balance, and to say to anyone who criticises the farming industry that the value of the livestock industry far outweighs any contribution that it might make to climate change?</p>

 I am happy to say to the hon. Gentleman that I agree with him, with one proviso. The livestock industry does all the things that he has described, as well as contributing to our landscape, as has been said. We are strong supporters of the industry and we want it to thrive. Like all parts of the economy, however, it is going to have to make a contribution to the fight against climate change. I am glad to be able to say that emissions of methane have declined, largely as a result of reducing livestock numbers, but that will remain an issue because all parts of the economy, including farming, are going to have to make a contribution.

 The issue of the use of gamma interferon goes further than the Secretary of State suggests. The gamma interferon test has a sensitivity of about 97 per cent., yet we have found that in some herds up to 28 times the number of cattle are reacting to it as to the skin test. His officials are flatly refusing farmers the opportunity of re-testing and insisting on culling all those animals. That is the reason for the court hearings to which he referred.</p>

Something is wrong somewhere, and putting farmers to the expense of going to court&#151;risking the Secretary of State&#146;s money on extra compensatory costs, as well as defending the case&#151;is helping nobody at all.</p>

It is not possible to increase the budget, as we have, from &#163;300 million to &#163;600 million over a decade, and to be committed to increasing it to &#163;800 million by 2010-11, without the trend line rising.

 I do not agree with the hon. Gentleman about the decommissioning authority. It has a very important task, and I have confidence in the work that it is doing. As for nuclear, the choice is very plain. A number of people&#146;s views on nuclear have changed because of the threat of climate change. The one thing that is absolutely clear about it is that it is a low-carbon technology, producing&#151;I speak from memory&#151;7 g to 22 g of carbon per kWh. Gas produces about 380 g per kWh, and coal about 755 g. There really is no contest. Waste is an issue, but, as the hon.

 The right hon. Lady mentioned pension liabilities, but failed to make a point about pension fund assets. The most important issue for pension funds is the strength of the economy.

Those measures are part of our determination to increase the quality of maternity services.</p>

She is right, of course, that we need to do everything we can to encourage more women in commerce. Further work is coming out of the Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform to support women. If we compare our economy with the American economy, we see that our competitiveness gap is accounted for by the fact that we have fewer women who start and run their own businesses. We must make progress on that, but I find it a bit much that the shadow Leader of the House&#151;one of only 17 Tory women Members of Parliament who have never done anything to champion women&#146;s rights&#151;should try to tell us what to do, when we have championed women&#146;s rights over the years.</p>

 My hon. Friend makes a very important point. We need to make sure that the police have the power to stop and search so that people on the streets of London and our other towns and cities can be kept safe. However, we must also make absolutely certain that we have the right accountability so that we can be sure that the police act fairly, as both we and they intend. She is right to remind the House that the police are able to carry out their work because of the extra investment that has been made to increase their numbers and pay. Those who would prefer the Metropolitan police budget to be cut, as the hon. Member for Henley (Mr. Johnson) does, would put all of that at risk.</p>

Whatever view we take on those subjects, we have learned from experience that the House does not have a proper procedure for dealing with and scrutinising treaties. Will the Leader of the House undertake to talk to colleagues and come back as soon as possible with some proposals for a better mechanism for looking at any treaties that the Government are considering entering into? By definition, it is too late by the time a treaty is signed to do anything about it and, as a result, the House&#146;s only option is to take it or leave it.</p>

I should be grateful if she confirmed, before the House breaks for half-term, that that will be possible. I am sure that it would be welcomed, not least given events in places such as Kenya.</p>

I received a letter from Richard Lynds, who is the network development manager for the Post Office. When I tried to contact him about the changes, I was given a call centre. No one knew who he was. When I contacted the chairman's office, I found that he had gone on holiday during the consultation period. It is not good enough. The nearest post office to Nether Kellet, one of the post offices in my constituency, is two miles away. It is on a road where there is no footpath. Pensioners could not even walk to it.

It is guillotined so savagely that the borders, visas, asylum and immigration parts of the home affairs provisions that the Government graciously gave to the House were not debated.</p>

I thank the former commissioner, Sir Philip Mawer, for his work and commitment to this, his last inquiry. I also thank the right hon.

 My Committee&#146;s report, which forms the basis for this debate, was published at 11 o&#146;clock on Monday. The hon. Member for Old Bexley and Sidcup (Derek Conway), the subject of the report, came to the House that afternoon to make his personal statement. He said that he accepted our criticisms in full and unreservedly apologised. That prompt admission, which I welcome, will hopefully enable the House to agree to the three-paragraph motion on the Order Paper.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o70"><a name="80131-0006.htm_para0"><a name="08013153000261">This report on the hon. Gentleman&#146;s conduct has evoked considerable interest and comment both inside and outside the House. Some of the comment has related to the fact that the hon. Gentleman had previously employed his elder son as a research assistant. The complaint from Mr. Barnbrook related to the employment of the hon. Gentleman&#146;s younger  <br>


<meta name="Date" content="31 Jan 2008">

son, and the commissioner&#146;s investigation focused solely on that. Complaints have now been made to the commissioner about the employment of his elder son; under our rules, those complaints fall to the commissioner to consider.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o71"><a name="80131-0006.htm_para1"><a name="08013153000262">In the past few days, my Committee has been accused of being both a kangaroo court and a gentleman&#146;s club. In my view, both accusations are wide of the mark. At the heart of our system for dealing with complaints such as this one is the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards&#151;an independent officer, appointed by the House, who investigates specific complaints about Members&#146; conduct. Before submitting a report to the Committee, the commissioner shares the factual sections of that report with the Member who is the subject of the complaint and makes any mutually agreed factual corrections. Having received the commissioner&#146;s report, the Committee shares it in its entirety, including the commissioner&#146;s conclusions, with the Member concerned, and invites his or her observations&#151;written, oral or both. It does so before it enters into any consideration of the commissioner&#146;s report. Before the Committee reaches its conclusions, any evidence that the Member gives is carefully weighed alongside the commissioner&#146;s report and any other evidence.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o72"><a name="80131-0006.htm_para2"><a name="08013153000263">Having chaired the Committee since 2001, I can testify to the fact that the Committee approaches the task of judging colleagues conscientiously and in an entirely non-partisan way. We strive to be fair to the House, which has asked us to enforce its rules, and we strive to be fair to the Member before us and to the public interest. In this case, as in all the others that I have brought to the House, our recommendations were unanimous. All 10 members of the Committee took part in the proceedings, and I am grateful to them for the way in which they handled this case.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o73"><a name="80131-0006.htm_para3"><a name="08013153000264">As the record shows, the Committee has made tough recommendations to the House when, as in this case, they are justified. To those who say that the punishments that the House imposes on those who break its rules are disproportionately light, I would only add that, as this case and others before it have demonstrated, the reputational consequences of our reports can be fatal. I therefore reject any suggestion that the Committee is either a kangaroo court or a gentleman&#146;s club. Our procedures are fair and transparent, and our judgments can have serious and far-reaching consequences for those who have breached the rules. Both the commissioner and the Committee approached this case just as they would any other. The hon. Gentleman has acknowledged the courtesy with which the commissioner treated him and has acknowledged that the Committee offered him every opportunity to explain his position.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o74"><a name="80131-0006.htm_para4"><a name="08013153000265">As the Leader of the House said, this was the last case reported on by the previous commissioner, Sir Philip Mawer, and I thank him once again for his characteristically thorough examination of this matter and clear recommendations to the Committee. His report speaks for itself.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o75"><a name="80131-0006.htm_para5"><a name="08013153000266">At the heart of this case was whether Freddie Conway was appropriately remunerated for the tasks that he was required to perform, and whether the work was actually carried out. The commissioner concluded that Freddie&#146;s rate of pay was unjustifiably high given his qualifications and experience, and that, on the  <br>


<meta name="Date" content="31 Jan 2008">

balance of probabilities, he did not need consistently to work his full contracted hours to complete his work. The commissioner also found that bonus payments had been made in excess of the permitted levels. My Committee endorsed those conclusions. Given some of the press comment, however, I should stress that neither the commissioner nor the Committee asserts that Freddie Conway did no work for his father.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o76"><a name="80131-0006.htm_para6"><a name="08013153000267">A difficulty for the commissioner and my Committee in this case has been the virtually complete absence of evidence of the work that Freddie Conway actually performed, not least when he was at university in Newcastle. The Committee made it clear that it was not for the hon. Gentleman to establish his innocence, but frankly we were astonished that after three years and a substantial amount of expenditure, there was no independent evidence of Freddie&#146;s output&#151;nor, apparently, could anyone outside the family be found who had seen him working. As the Committee commented on a case in 2004:</p>
<a name="80131-0006.htm_brev0"><a name="08013153001538"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;It is...Members&#146; responsibility to ensure that, if requested, they can properly justify any use of voted money, in the same way as any other recipient.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o77"><a name="80131-0006.htm_para7"><a name="08013153000269">The hon. Gentleman has admitted that he failed to keep adequate records, and has apologised for his failure to do so. It is also common ground that bonus payments were made that exceeded the authorised ceiling.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o78"><a name="80131-0006.htm_para8"><a name="08013153000270">What was the hon. Gentleman&#146;s defence to the commissioner&#146;s conclusions about the level of his son&#146;s salary? In essence, he consistently maintained that, as his son&#146;s salary was within the Department of Resources&#146; approved scale, he was entitled to set it at his discretion. The Committee rejected that argument. The salary scale, at the time of the original appointment, ranged from &#163;12,184 to &#163;29,353. Given the extent of that range, the Committee did not believe, as a matter of principle, that Members&#146; discretion could be regarded as completely unfettered. A judgment is clearly called for.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o79"><a name="80131-0006.htm_para9"><a name="08013153000271">The question that we had to address was whether the hon. Gentleman had exercised his judgment sufficiently unreasonably for the payments to constitute improper use of the staffing allowance. The Committee concluded that it did. Freddie Conway was just 19, had just left school following his A-levels and had no experience. Department of Finance and Administration guidance would have suggested a salary at, or close to, the recommended London entry point of &#163;16,614 full-time. Yet Freddie&#146;s father, by his own admission, took no account of that, and paid him the full-time equivalent of &#163;25,970. The Committee took the view that that was an improper use of the allowance.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o80"><a name="80131-0006.htm_para10"><a name="08013153000272">Taking all this together, the Committee has made three recommendations that it is asking the House to approve today. The first is that the hon. Gentleman reimburse the House for the sums overpaid to his son by way of bonus. That is the recommendation in paragraph 33 of the report. The second, set out in paragraph 34, is that the hon. Gentleman reimburse the House &#163;6,000 in recognition of the over-generous salary paid to his son. The Committee considered that, whatever other action the House took, some recompense for the sum improperly paid out would be appropriate. For the reasons set out in paragraph 34 of the report, it proposes a payment of &#163;6,000 by the hon. Gentleman in recognition  <br>


<meta name="Date" content="31 Jan 2008">

<notus-date day="31" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><b>31 Jan 2008 : Column 484</b><br>
of that. Finally, in recognition of the overall seriousness of this case, the Committee recommends that the hon. Gentleman be suspended from the service of the House for 10 sitting days.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o81"><a name="80131-0006.htm_para11"><a name="08013153000273">There are two other matters on which I wish to touch briefly before I conclude. The first is the speculation that the Committee or the House should refer this matter to the police for investigation. As the House will know, Members of Parliament enjoy no general immunity from the criminal law; anyone can refer a matter to the police for investigation at any time, if they have evidence to suggest that a criminal offence has been committed. Both the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards and my Committee consider, if necessary after taking legal advice, whether there is sufficient evidence to justify our doing so in any particular case in the light of all the relevant facts. On the other hand, there is no reason, as I am sure the House will agree, for either the Committee or the commissioner to adopt automatically a presumption that a Member who is the subject of a complaint may have committed a criminal offence. The Committee was satisfied on all the evidence before it that reporting to the House, rather than referral to the police, was the right way forward in this case.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o82"><a name="80131-0006.htm_para12"><a name="08013153000274">The second matter is whether Members should continue to be permitted to employ relatives, or others with whom they have other than an arm&#146;s length relationship. At this point, I say to the House&#151;and, indeed, to all the newspapers who have been ringing up since Monday&#151;that I employ a member of my family, who is remunerated out of my parliamentary allowance. That is a debate for another day, along with a debate about what steps the House needs to take to address the reputational damage that this case has done.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o83"><a name="80131-0006.htm_para13"><a name="08013153000275">In the meantime, I just say to the House that Members&#146; use of allowances is a perennially sensitive issue and that allegations of real or perceived misuse are damaging. This is money that our constituents have paid for through their taxes. It is important that Members can demonstrate robustly, if challenged, that their use of allowances is above reproach, particularly where they have a relationship with the employee that might suggest an element of personal benefit. We should set ourselves similar requirements to those that we would expect of others responsible for the expenditure of public money, as a predecessor Committee suggested in 2003. The hon. Member for Old Bexley and Sidcup has paid the price for overlooking that principle. I commend the motion to the House.</p>

<p><a name="st_o145"><a name="08013153000276"><a name="80131-0006.htm_spnew0"><a name="08013153001765"><b>Mr. Frank Field (Birkenhead) (Lab):</b>
 I should like to support the Chairman of the Committee on Standards and Privileges in respect of the motion and to draw some general points from his report, as he did. I do so knowing that while we may individually be held in very high esteem by our constituents, collectively that is not so; it is difficult to think how much lower our collective reputation might sink among voters generally.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o84"><a name="80131-0006.htm_para14"><a name="08013153000277">There are at least four lessons to draw from this report. The first concerns the punishment. The right hon. Member for North-West Hampshire (Sir George   <br>


<meta name="Date" content="31 Jan 2008">

Young) said that other events had come into play and that it was difficult to think of a more severe punishment, but the Committee has been more severe on other Members in other reports, and those Members go around this place as happy as Larry. One of the lessons that I hope that the Committee will think about, not as regards specific cases but generally as regards its policy, is whether our series of punishments is adequate. If this example of what I would see as embezzlement had occurred on this scale in, say, the Refreshment Department, we would expect the person involved to leave the employment of this establishment on the day it was discovered. I believe that we should treat ourselves in a similar manner to how other people employed by this House would be treated.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o85"><a name="80131-0006.htm_para15"><a name="08013153000278">Secondly, I want to make a plea about the employment of family members. I do so as somebody with no immediate family and so with no vested interest. The circumstances of Members of Parliament and those whom they employ are unique. We work on at least two sites over peculiar hours. I hope that there will be no rush by Members of this House to change the arrangements whereby family members can be employed if they are employed properly. It is proper for us to be clear about expenditure, as the right hon. Member for North-West Hampshire said, and it is not improper for us to agree that if family members are employed we can at least present to the Fees Office evidence that they have the qualifications for those jobs. However, given the arguments that I have heard, I would be against changing the rules about Members employing members of their families.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o86"><a name="80131-0006.htm_para16"><a name="08013153000279">The third lesson concerns audit. I am amazed that the only case that has been put up against audit is based on the sovereignty of Parliament. Our constituents must give a hollow laugh at that when they witness how we have conceded our powers to check&#151;not defeat, but check&#151;the Executive and how we have allowed powers to go willy-nilly from this place to Brussels. There is no comparison between that movement of sovereignty out of this Chamber and the wish that our expenses should be properly audited. It is proper that as events change we should be prepared to consider the case put to us that our expenses should be properly audited.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o87"><a name="80131-0006.htm_para17"><a name="08013153000280">My last point is about the balance between our salaries and expenses. I have been in the House for long enough to know Members who were here under the Wilson Government. At that time there was wage restraint for the population as a whole, which was applied to us. Members reported to me that the then Chief Whip went round the Tea Room saying to people, &#147;You can vote for the wage restriction on your pay because we&#146;re adjusting allowances&#151;you get the message, don&#146;t you?&#148; The balance between our allowances and our salary is out of kilter. I do not think that our allowances are improper given the job that we are expected to do, but when we ask an outside body to look at our pay, we should be mindful of the fact that although we are overpaid in the eyes of many of our constituents, given their wages, we are certainly not overpaid compared with the responsibilities that we hold and the pay of people with comparable responsibilities elsewhere.</p>

Secondly, I make a plea for the employment of family members. If we did not abide by that, how would we treat partners differently? Would we have some sort of co-habitation rules&#151;and if so, who would we ask to enforce them? The situation would become absurd. I hope that we will consider carefully how we shall audit our expenses. Behind all this&#151;the tension that the right hon. Member for North-West Hampshire alluded to&#151;is the extraordinary position that we now find ourselves in whereby our allowances are considerably greater than our basic pay.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o92"><a name="80131-0006.htm_para22"><a name="08013153000287">This case understandably gives rise to concerns about how our expenses are claimed. Perhaps some hon. Members will feel that the criticism being voiced in the press is without any reason or justification, and that the media misunderstand all about our expenses. We are not crooks; we are honest, and when someone makes claims unfairly and breaks the rules, we see what happens. Indeed, we would not want to go through what the hon. Member for Old Bexley and Sidcup (Derek Conway) rightly went through on Monday. Whether there should be a more severe punishment, as my right hon. Friend the Member for Birkenhead (Mr. Field) said, is a matter of opinion.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o93"><a name="80131-0006.htm_para23"><a name="08013153000288">The process is lacking at the moment, in that there is insufficient transparency. Yes, money is claimed for perfectly legitimate reasons; I have no doubts about that. But that is not the view of the public. It may be that there is a lack of understanding on the part of the public about what expenses are for. I have said previously that I do not pay expenses to my secretary; I pay her a salary, and I do the same for my assistant in the constituency office. Nevertheless, the question arises whether there is a better way of ensuring that the public can to some extent be satisfied that the money that can be claimed, which is a very large sum&#151;more than &#163;144,000 excluding travel expenses&#151;is spent in the manner that we would expect of other organisations.

I do not know whether everyone does, but I welcome the fact that each year the amount claimed is published&#151;a state of affairs that arises from the Freedom of Information Act 2000. It would be appalling if we did otherwise.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o95"><a name="80131-0006.htm_para25"><a name="08013153000290">However, questions have been raised. For example, the Senior Salaries Review Body has suggested that the National Audit Office should take a random sample of a number of claims. I know that that idea is being looked into, but why should that not happen? What possible criticism could we have of that idea if we are claiming money properly and legitimately according to the rules, as we say we are? Why should the NAO not be involved? I do not understand why there should be any reluctance on our part about that.</p>

I am against such a ban, but would it not be right, without going to extremes, to say that any partner or relative employed should be listed in the Register of Members&#146; Interests? If the arrangement is above board, it is nothing to be ashamed about. If X employs his or her partner, it would be revealed in the register. I do not see why that should be a problem.</p>

bottom. That could have been said for centuries. Much of the criticism of our work is wrong and misplaced. However, it is in our own interest and for the good of our reputation that the manner in which we claim public money be shown to be transparent and justified, and the necessary controls be in place. I am not satisfied that they currently are, and I hope that this case means that changes and reforms that help the reputation of the House of Commons will take place.</p>

 As the Leader of the House said, these are always difficult moments for us as a House. That is right, and we should be careful in our response to such matters.</p>

I join her and the right hon. Member for Maidenhead (Mrs. May) in thanking and paying tribute to the right hon. Member for North-West Hampshire (Sir George Young) and his Committee, who do a very difficult job exceptionally well, with discretion, courtesy and the proper propriety. That is important.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o99"><a name="80131-0006.htm_para29"><a name="08013153000295">You will remember, Mr. Speaker, that last week we debated the Senior Salaries Review Body report. Apart from colleagues who served on the Standards and Privileges Committee, none of us had knowledge at that point of what was to be published this week. That demonstrates the proper way in which such matters should be handled. The work was done by the Committee, it was published when the Committee was ready, and only then did it receive publicity. I too give thanks to the previous commissioner for his work, and I welcome his successor. Such jobs are very important, and the procedure works well. There is no criticism of the procedure involved, and if it errs on the side of caution, that is right. It should always presume people to be innocent unless the evidence proves otherwise.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o103"><a name="80131-0007.htm_para1"><a name="08013153000299">Thirdly, we asked the authorities to consider recognising partners who are sole beneficiaries as having the same rights for pension purposes as spouses and civil partners. In other words, people who are recognised as partners should have recognised status.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o104"><a name="80131-0007.htm_para2"><a name="08013153000300">Arising from that, I would like to make two points about families. There seems to be a perfectly legitimate case for allowing colleagues who are married or have recognised partners to work with their partners. I speak as someone who is not in that position, so I am not speaking from self-interest. The job that someone does, working with a person to serve their constituents, can often best be done in a similar way to how things operate in a small business, for example.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o105"><a name="80131-0007.htm_para3"><a name="08013153000301">However, if there is to be continuing acceptance of family members working for colleagues, there is not a strong case for more than one member of the family doing that, or for their being paid more than the going rate for the job, as recommended in the rules we set ourselves&#151;within the parameters referred to by the right hon. Member for North-West Hampshire, such as competence, age and experience. We clearly cannot make current or past arrangements suddenly illegal if people have made a commitment through a contract to a member of their family. Provided that they follow the rules properly, that situation must be allowed to continue. For the future, however, there seems be a case for allowing only one family member to be employed, and at the right rate for the job.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o106"><a name="80131-0007.htm_para4"><a name="08013153000302">Confidentiality for the people whom we employ concerns many hon. Members. Until the previous Parliament, my friend Nigel Jones&#151;now Lord Jones of Cheltenham&#151;sat on the Liberal Democrat Benches in the House of Commons. He suffered a terrible injury and witnessed the death in his constituency office of a person whom he employed, and who was working at the time on constituency matters. I know of other colleagues and their staff who are currently under threat from members of the public, and who are being supported by the police. Indeed, in the past the Leader of the House has been in that position, as have I.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o107"><a name="80131-0007.htm_para5"><a name="08013153000303">We must therefore be careful about separating the proper accountability of Members of Parliament for public money and the way in which it is spent&#151;for example, by declaring that we use our &#163;90,000 to pay the wages of two, three or four members of staff&#151;from putting the names of all those people in the public domain and identifying them as working for us. Doing the latter would mean that their addresses and their families could also be in the public domain. Members&#146; staff are not in the same position as others who are paid from the public purse, because they are especially exposed. I have been in my surgery with people working for me, some paid and some volunteering, who have been put in difficult positions, with angry, aggressive and unstable constituents. Many colleagues from all parties have been in the same position.</p>

If we do not, we shall be reinforcing the traditional white male-dominated society that pertains here, because there are more white men than other colleagues in this place. I hope that modern employment law will work, and that people whom the taxpayer and Members of Parliament employ will be recruited openly. I also hope that they will be employed in a way that employment law will ensure is entirely justified in future.</p>

 I believe that the first part of the speech of the hon. Member for North Southwark and Bermondsey (Simon Hughes) will meet with more cross-party agreement than the latter part.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o110"><a name="80131-0007.htm_para8"><a name="08013153000307">I want to make three points. First, when I became a Member of Parliament, I tried to follow the advice of always applying the local newspaper test, which is: am I doing something that I would not want to read in my local newspaper? If the answer is yes, I should either admit to it or not do it. That does not mean that one cannot do unpopular or unwise things, but at least they should not be done secretly.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o111"><a name="80131-0007.htm_para9"><a name="08013153000308">Secondly, I believe that if Ministers&#146; names and private offices are published in directories and people know who our children are when they are at school or college, we should not be too prissy about including the names of those who work for us on letterheads. If they work with us and engage with the outside world, they should not hide their names. I therefore do not go along with the final remarks of the hon.

<p><a name="stpa_o112"><a name="80131-0007.htm_para10"><a name="08013153000309">Thirdly, the view of some outside that we should not employ members of our families or household is wrong. When I first stood for election in 1974, it was against a Labour Member of Parliament who was over 60 and had moved in with his competent secretary as her spouse. The idea that she would have to find some other Member of Parliament for whom to work because they had got together and lived in the same place is absurd.</p>

My Department, the Department for Communities and Local Government, provides &#163;500,000 of annual core funding for the Holocaust Memorial Day Trust. This supports not only the holding of an annual national commemoration, but many of the local community activities. Five hundred local events have been held, and 23,000 people have already lit the virtual candle on the trust&#146;s website. Many hundreds of us, if not more, were in Hope street in Liverpool to light a candle on Sunday as well. The importance of actively engaging young people has already been pointed out, and as I have said, the Government provide &#163;1.5 million of annual funding for the Holocaust Educational Trust to support the participation of two pupils from every school and college in visits to Auschwitz-Birkenau.</p>

In addition to the national commemoration, the Liverpool organisers also succeeded in running an important series of events during the preceding fortnight. Those activities were hosted by local communities originating from as far afield as Chad, the Czech Republic, Darfur, Kosovo and Rwanda. I am sure that I have the backing of the whole House in commending Liverpool&#151;the European city of culture&#151;and, indeed, all the other cities and towns across the UK for their commitment to actively engaging their local communities and schools in marking this year&#146;s Holocaust memorial day.

His name was Martin Stern, and he had an extraordinary story to tell. He was born in the Netherlands in 1938. His father was a Jewish architect, whom his non-Jewish mother had married despite the Nazi Nuremberg laws. During the Nazi occupation of Holland, his father had hidden with the Dutch resistance. His father was captured, however, and sent first to Auschwitz and then to Buchenwald, where he was killed. By this time, Martin was about five years old. He had a younger sister, but after she was born, his mother died from a hospital infection.</p>

As a result, he was sent to the transit camp at Westerbork in the Netherlands and, later, with his one-year-old sister, to the Theresienstadt concentration camp in Czechoslovakia. He and his sister&#151;a five-year-old and a one-year-old&#151;were among the 150 children at the camp. I learned from Martin at the weekend that about 15,000 children entered concentration camps during the second world war. He is one of about 100 who survived that experience.</p>

She became like a mother to them, although when they were released, she was not allowed to look after them. He was reunited with her in the 1980s, and saw her before she passed away.</p>

His story, and those of others like him, must never be forgotten.</p>

 My right hon. Friend makes an exceedingly good point. I join him in paying tribute to the Holocaust Educational Trust, as well as to the Holocaust Memorial Day Trust. They are doing a great deal of work in collecting information and stories. The day itself provided a great opportunity, and those of us who were in Liverpool learned a great deal from some of those personal testimonies. There must be opportunities for young people to visit not only Auschwitz but places such as Srebrenica, as some have as part of these trips, and to see the historical context and the stories associated with it. I hope that such visits will provide lasting memories that can be passed down the generations, because we must never forget the lessons of man&#146;s inhumanity to man.</p>

I have been to Auschwitz-Birkenau and I have read some of the standard works on the holocaust.

state terrorism that has ever taken place in western Europe. It is also hard to grasp that this act took place in Europe. Those of us who are Europeans&#151;all of us present today are Europeans&#151;find it extremely difficult to grasp that this happened in our continent, which we like to think of as one of the centres of civilisation.

 I am also very moved by what the hon. Gentleman has been saying. Is it not precisely because of the point he makes that we must encourage organisations such as the Holocaust Educational Trust to continue their work? It was only when I went to Auschwitz that I started to comprehend the industrial nature of what happened. The young people I was with were silent for virtually the whole trip home, as they sought to comprehend what they had seen. That is exactly why we must encourage the Government to support the Holocaust Educational Trust.</p>

 The hon. Lady makes an absolutely key point. She is now the third Member in the debate to highlight some of the difficulties of educating young people who are growing up today about what happened in Europe on such a vast scale 50 and more years ago.

 If I understood the hon. Gentleman correctly, he said that it is difficult to comprehend how these events could have happened in Europe. He was not speaking about this particular period, but would he accept that sustained anti-Semitism has been dominant in Europe for centuries and that it would have been virtually impossible for the Nazis to do what they did if the Jews had not been attacked and persecuted over such a long period? Although Jews have perhaps had more security in this country than in most others since the 17th century, we need to remember that this country was the first in Europe to expel Jews. As the hon. Gentleman will be aware, the proclamation was made in July 1290, and the actual expulsion was in November&#151;it was much the same as the expulsion of Asians from Uganda in 1972.</p>

 I agree with the hon. Gentleman. My point was that, as Europeans, we need to remember our common history and understand the roots of what happened. It is significant than in the 50 and more years since the war, the Churches&#151;I am thinking particularly of the Roman Catholic Church&#151;have changed key parts of their teaching and message to repudiate some of the inheritance of anti-Semitism that was present in that and other similar institutions.

 I join other hon. Members in paying tribute to the Holocaust Educational Trust. It has already been mentioned that two people from each constituency are invited to go on a trip to Auschwitz each year. What has not been mentioned is that MPs are also invited, and I would hope that every Member would encourage as many other Members as possible to participate in that trip. I was fortunate enough to go in October last year with more than 200 Scottish school pupils. It was a most memorable trip, and I would like to pay particular tribute to Rebecca Clark of Lawside academy in Dundee who recorded everyone&#146;s views about it for the academy&#146;s radio programme.

The neo-Nazi groups are still there, but there are others who express extreme views and who believe, for example, that Jews are the enemy of Islam. That is a subject of some interest to me as the Conservative MP with the largest number of Muslim constituents. I always find that view puzzling. My constituents are often keen to point out to me that Jews and Christians are &#147;Ahl al-Kitab&#148;&#151;people of the book&#151;who are recognised in Islam as fellow believers in one God. The extremist views that I referred to are certainly not those of mainstream Muslims.</p>

circulating that holocaust teaching is not permitted and is being reduced in certain schools with large numbers of Muslim pupils? Speaking as a Member who represents a constituency with many such schools, may I absolutely reassure him that that is not the case? Indeed, schools in my constituency have participated in the Holocaust Educational Trust activities and I have sometimes joined them. There is a strong emphasis on holocaust teaching, which crosses all the faith communities. I would like to see all-party condemnation of that rumour.</p>

 I am sure that the hon. Lady is right. I was going to ask the Minister about that. According to my research, a document produced by the Department for Children, Schools and Families referred to one teacher in a school in northern England who had allegedly backed off from teaching the holocaust because of the reaction that, rightly or wrongly, they thought they would get from Muslim pupils. Perhaps the Minister can clear that up later.</p>

It is a sobering thought that the Government are paying capital costs for school security in, I believe, 12 local authority areas.

<p><a name="stpa_o135"><a name="80131-0008.htm_para6"><a name="08013153000357">I want to ask the Minister three questions. First, the Home Office and the Department for Communities and Local Government have a hate crime taskforce, which is reviewing evidence of campus anti-Semitism. Has that taskforce had an opportunity to report? If not, when will it do so? Secondly, there is a long-standing difficulty about British citizens, or at least people living in Britain, contributing to USA-based anti-Semitic websites. I understand that a prosecution may be due. If the Minister can give any news on that, I think the House would be grateful.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o136"><a name="80131-0008.htm_para7"><a name="08013153000358">Thirdly, the Government are committed to recording different hate crimes. In a Westminster Hall debate&#151;initiated, I think, by the all-party group&#151;a Minister gave that commitment, but apparently only one in 10 recent anti-Semitic hate crimes has led to prosecution. That is a low proportion. Will the Minister comment on what the Government can do to raise the success rate?</p>

 Although I am not Jewish, my family&#146;s history was changed for ever by the momentous and destructive events that engulfed the continent of Europe 65 years ago. The imperative for my parents to flee Estonia under threat of persecution and probable death is the reason I am here. The United Kingdom&#146;s generosity and compassion at the time saved my family, and for that I, like so many others, am for ever in this country&#146;s debt.</p>

Most participants return not just with a deeper understanding of the past, but with a real sense of mission to ensure that such events are never allowed to happen again.</p>

generous contribution, which has enabled it to expand the project dramatically and take it nationwide. The aim is to make it available to sixth-formers at every secondary school and further education college in the United Kingdom. I hope that this year representatives of all six secondary schools in my constituency will be able to act as ambassadors, and will report their findings to their schools.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o164"><a name="80131-0009.htm_para3"><a name="08013153000390">One of the primary aims of the visits is to enhance participants&#146; sense of civic responsibility and encourage them to be active in standing up to all forms of racism and discrimination, not just anti-Semitism. It is mandatory for them to share their experiences and disseminate the lessons that they have learned in their schools and communities on their return. Many of the students who went last year chose to make it a Holocaust memorial day commemorative event, and as a result there has been a considerable increase in the number of young people participating on the day.</p>

 I took part in a memorial event at the Soviet war memorial in Geraldine Mary Harmsworth Park, just over the bridge. One of the benefits of such events is that people come from all sorts of backgrounds. We saw not only diplomats from the Russian and other former Soviet embassies, but holocaust survivors and young people of, probably, 30 nationalities. They were able to meet and to realise that we are all part of the same human race, with the same rights and the same dignity.</p>

 My hon. Friend is right. Such events serve to remind us that the holocaust is not the only example of mass murder committed by the human race since 1945. Millions have died in circumstances comparable to what happened during world war two.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o166"><a name="80131-0009.htm_para5"><a name="08013153000394">Auschwitz is a lesson in what went wrong in the past because human beings allowed it to occur. We should remember that those things went wrong in a highly educated, civilised, first-world country, which was not so different from the United Kingdom before it descended into the barbarism that is commemorated on Holocaust memorial day. Although we should recognise that other events have taken place around the world, the holocaust in Germany stands ignominiously as the worst of them all. I hope that all of us, including our colleagues who are not present today, will agree that the only thing that we really must regard as intolerable is intolerance itself. That, in my judgment, is the strongest insurance: the best way in which to make certain that human history&#146;s darkest hour is never repeated.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o168"><a name="80131-0009.htm_para7"><a name="08013153000397">This year&#146;s Holocaust memorial day theme was &#147;Imagine, remember, reflect and react&#148;. On Sunday I attended a local memorial service in Brigg, organised by Brigg town council. The council has an annual ceremony and a permanent memorial in the Angel courtyard, in the council buildings in the market place. This year&#146;s event was led by our first-class mayor Mike Doherty and his wife Pat, and was organised by our excellent town clerk, Jeanette Woollard. The ceremony was short, moving and effective, involving people of all ages and different religions. It was an honour and a privilege to participate in it. Along with the mayor and eight schoolchildren, I placed 10 stones around the permanent memorial to commemorate the 10 million people who died at the hands of the Nazis.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o169"><a name="80131-0009.htm_para8"><a name="08013153000398">Keeping the memory alive is important, hence the work of the Holocaust Memorial Day Trust and the Holocaust Educational Trust, which is 20 years old this year. They have championed holocaust education in schools, and it has been on the curriculum since 1991. It has been claimed that it will be diminished or removed from the curriculum, and I have seen&#151;as, I am sure, have many Members&#151;some of the e-mails that were sent as part of a campaign to prevent any such move. Their purpose seemed to be to send an anti-Muslim message, attacking Muslims for being somehow responsible.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o170"><a name="80131-0009.htm_para9"><a name="08013153000399">Those e-mails, which served as a chilling reminder of how quickly prejudice can spread, ended up in America, in a world so insular that people thought &#147;UK&#148; stood for &#147;University of Kentucky&#148;. Representatives of the university had to issue a press statement making it clear that it was nothing to do with them. Indeed, as far as I can see it was nothing to do with anything at all, but it would be good if the Minister reiterated that holocaust education will remain on the curriculum.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o171"><a name="80131-0009.htm_para10"><a name="08013153000400">The hon. Member for Montgomeryshire (Lembit &#214;pik) mentioned the Lessons from Auschwitz project and the &#163;1.5 million grant that the Government provided last year, which has allowed the project to expand so that all schools can participate. I hope the Minister will also confirm that such funding will continue.</p>

In the morning, we visited Auschwitz, which was bizarre as it looked like a film set. It is a former barracks, and it was quite smart and well built, and I could imagine a film being made there. It was the afternoon visit to Birkenau that really hit home. Birkenau is on a different scale and it is purpose-built: it is enormous and it is designed to kill efficiently&#151;to kill as many people as possible as quickly as possible. It is a chilling experience, and I believe that the memory of Birkenau will live with anybody who visits it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o173"><a name="80131-0009.htm_para12"><a name="08013153000402">I remember standing on the platform by the railway track, where there is a large photograph of literally thousands of Jewish people going through the infamous separation, with a doctor holding his arm out to direct those who have to go the way that leads straight to death.

 The hon. Gentleman is speaking very movingly about his visit, and it is important that people see this terrible place. It is also important to hear from people who actually experienced the holocaust&#151;the survivors. As those survivors are growing older and increasingly frail, does the hon. Gentleman agree that it is important to keep alive their testimony through DVDs and other recordings and that every effort should be made to circulate such recordings to future generations?</p>

 I entirely agree. In fact, the Holocaust Educational Trust made a DVD on such recollections and won a BAFTA for it. That is another of its great achievements, and I am sure it will help in future holocaust education.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o174"><a name="80131-0009.htm_para13"><a name="08013153000405">It takes hours to tour all of Birkenau, and we finished with a memorial service around the ruins of one of the crematoriums. Afterwards, it was dark and we walked along what is probably the most infamous railway track in the world. It is impossible not to be affected. On the coach journey back to the airport, I spoke to some young people, and what they said was revealing. They had done holocaust education at school&#151;in fact, they had done extra holocaust education as they had attended a seminar prior to the visit&#151;but nothing had hit home as much as the visit itself. That is why I hope that the Government will ensure that that is funded in future.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o175"><a name="80131-0009.htm_para14"><a name="08013153000406">Some people ask me, &#147;Why the holocaust? There have been many other atrocities, both before and since.&#148; Indeed, there have, but the holocaust was so awful and so huge. Two out of three European Jews, and millions from other minority groups, were killed. It happened during a conflict we were involved in, it happened in countries not far away and, in historical terms, it happened not long ago.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o176"><a name="80131-0009.htm_para15"><a name="08013153000407">I believe that if we are not vigilant it could happen again.

If we do, the chances of there being another holocaust will be greatly diminished and the world will be a better place.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o178"><a name="80131-0009.htm_para17"><a name="08013153000410">I am glad that this debate is being held because, as all Members have said, we must never forget, and I echo the tributes that have been paid to the Holocaust Educational Trust and the Holocaust Memorial Day Trust for their excellent work. We must also never forget that Jews were not the only group who were devastated by this unprecedented and unique horror.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o179"><a name="80131-0009.htm_para18"><a name="08013153000411">I do not propose to attempt to describe the horrors that occurred on our continent just over 60 years ago; they are well documented. I want to make a different point. The holocaust saw the deepest degradation of the human spirit that we have ever witnessed, but it also gave rise to some outstanding acts of heroism both by Jews, such as those that occurred in the Warsaw ghetto uprising, and by non-Jews. Many of those acts have been researched and recognised by the Yad Vashem UK Foundation, which also does much to keep memories of the holocaust alive, and I would like to cite just one example.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o180"><a name="80131-0009.htm_para19"><a name="08013153000412">On the eve of the German occupation of Warsaw, the director of the Warsaw zoo was a man called Dr. Zabinski. The Germans appointed him superintendent of the city&#146;s public parks as well. Availing himself of the opportunity to visit the Warsaw ghetto, ostensibly to inspect the state of the flora within the ghetto walls, Dr. Zabinski maintained contact with pre-war Jewish colleagues and friends and helped them escape to, and find shelter on, the so-called &#147;Aryan&#148; side of the city. Many cages in the zoo had been emptied of animals during the September 1939 air assault on Warsaw, and Dr. Zabinski decided to use them as hiding places for fleeing Jews. Over the course of three years, hundreds of Jews found temporary shelter in those abandoned animal cells, located on the western bank of the River Vistula, until they were able to relocate to permanent places of refuge elsewhere. In addition, close to a dozen Jews were sheltered in Dr. Zabinski&#146;s two-storey private home in the zoo&#146;s grounds. In this extraordinarily dangerous undertaking, he was assisted by his wife, Antonina, a recognised author, and their young son, Ryszard, who nourished, and looked after the needs of, the many distraught Jews in their care.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o181"><a name="80131-0009.htm_para20"><a name="08013153000413">At first, Dr. Zabinski paid from his own funds to subsidise the maintenance costs, and later money was received through the Jewish Committee. He was an active member of the Polish underground army, and he took part in the Warsaw uprising of August and September 1944. When it was suppressed, he was taken as a prisoner to Germany, but his wife continued his work, looking after the needs of some of the Jews left behind in the ruins of the city.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o182"><a name="80131-0009.htm_para21"><a name="08013153000414">I believe that that is a truly extraordinary story, and it illustrates, as do so many other stories, that while the holocaust saw the human spirit sink to depths of degradation previously unplumbed, it also saw the human spirit soar to extraordinary heights of heroism and self-sacrifice.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o183"><a name="80131-0009.htm_para22"><a name="08013153000415">Perhaps&#151;this point might be a little more controversial&#151;there is a lesson here for us Members. We are legislators. We make laws that seek to frame, to regulate and to modify the conduct of our fellow citizens, but the extremes of human conduct&#151;for bad and for good&#151;that we saw during the holocaust, and that we continue to see on a smaller scale today, are in many ways beyond our reach, and the ability we have to influence them by passing laws is limited.</p>

 It is a privilege to follow such a moving speech from the right hon. and learned Member for Folkestone and Hythe (Mr. Howard). Ten years ago, as a new Member of Parliament, I visited Auschwitz-Birkenau with the Holocaust Educational Trust. I pay tribute to Rabbi Barry Marcus, who was a stalwart of that visit and has been one ever since. As all hon. Members have mentioned, it was a moving experience. We all bring back our own memories. The trigger, for me, was seeing a great mound of shoes. None of the shoes had laces&#151;that was what brought home to me the industrial nature of the holocaust; some poor slave labourers had had to go round taking all the laces out. </p>

<p><a name="stpa_o185"><a name="80131-0009.htm_para24"><a name="08013153000419">Like everyone else, I was moved. On the plane home I asked myself what I could do, as an individual, to ensure that the holocaust never happens again. In those days, there was no Holocaust memorial day. The idea of one had been floating around, but nobody had done much to bring it about. I thought I would make it my big campaign in Parliament to achieve that, so I introduced a ten-minute Bill, raised the matter with the then Prime Minister and enlisted his support. I am pleased to say that that ultimately led to the first Holocaust memorial day in January 2001. I am pleased about the great consensus in the country as a whole that it was a good idea, but I must point out that it was controversial at the time.

I was going around advocating the cause in synagogues and debating it with Jewish people. I spoke before the Board of Deputies of British Jews, where there was even one vote against; one can never get unanimity in the Board of Deputies. Ultimately, there was great support for my proposal, because the purpose of a Holocaust memorial day, as I, and I believe everybody else, envisaged it by the time that the debate had finished, was that it was different from Yom Ha-Shoah, when Jewish people remember their own loss. The purpose of the Holocaust memorial day was to engage the wider community in the debates, arguments and discussions that the Jewish people had had among themselves for a long time, to try to spread the word about what had happened and to ensure that as a result it never happened again. Of course, it is not only Holocaust memorial day itself that arose from this process. Holocaust memorial day is a focus for events  <br>

Friend the Member for Rotherham (Mr. MacShane) for the 60th anniversary commemorations of the liberation. The Duke of York, the Lord Chancellor and Lord Janner, who is a huge advocate for the cause, were also present. If anything brought home to me the experience, it was that occasion. It was not just the fact that so many people were gathered, or that so many survivors were still able to return, but the intense, freezing cold. We were wrapped up in I do not know how many layers, with big boots and hats on&#151;the works&#151;and chilled to the marrow, yet they were the conditions that the people who were liberated from Auschwitz had been able to survive in those thin striped prison uniforms.</p>

Under the scheme, each will be remembered by a living person, whose commitment is to light a candle once a year on their behalf and to wear the Yad Vashem emblem while doing so. I asked Yad Vashem whether it could identify victims by occupation, and it went out of its way to do so. We identified 12 Members of Parliament&#151;people like us here today&#151;who had been killed in the holocaust. I asked 12 Members of Parliament, on a cross-party basis, to adopt their memory for the future. I think it is a wonderful scheme, and it has cross-party support.</p>

Mr. Speaker has given me permission to tell the House that he, too, is participating by remembering the memory of Shaklina Shapiro, a metalworker from Poland. Mr. Speaker was keen to have somebody more akin to his trade union roots. The Foreign Secretary is participating, as is the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government, who has adopted the memory of Sabina Shpilrein, a psychoanalyst whose rather colourful history was cut short in 1942.

I was pleased that the Armenian ambassador came to speak to our local commemoration in Barnet last Sunday, which was the biggest outside the national commemoration. It is a disgrace that on last Sunday&#146;s Holocaust memorial day, the Armenian genocide memorial in Wales was desecrated, and I urge hon.

Holocaust memorial day is about the holocaust, that defining event of the 20th century, and subsequent genocides. However, it is incumbent on us, if we are serious about examining the issues of genocide, to recognise officially what happened to the Armenians, as has been done in France, Germany and elsewhere.</p>

Many more people are aware of what happened and why. The discussions and the debate are healthy in exploring the issues and making it far less likely that the holocaust would ever happen again in Europe. The very controversy over Holocaust memorial day, whether through the Muslims or over the Armenians, helps to raise those very important issues. On the fundamental question of whether it has prevented genocide, the answer is, regrettably, no. One has only to look at Darfur to see that. We still have a long way to go to achieve the humanity that Holocaust memorial day aims to achieve.</p>

 I welcome the opportunity to make a short contribution to this debate. I am not Jewish. I am making this contribution as a consequence of once having been an historian. About 30 years ago, I was asked to write a book on the Waffen SS, the military wing of the SS. That involved a considerable amount of research, at the centre of which was the aim of trying to understand the racial motivation. It is frequently sidelined in many histories of the Nazi party and of Nazi Germany, but is the core element of the holocaust, which the national socialist state eventually referred to as the &#147;final solution&#148;&#151;it meant just that. Many people suffered in the second world war at the hands of the Nazis and their collaborator&#151;national groups such as the Poles and the Greeks; political parties, such as the communists, social democrats and Christian democrats; resisters; and members of the Special Operations Executive&#151;but if one seriously wanted to get killed, one was Jewish. One was at the bottom of the pit. In a concentration camp someone might just have survived in any other category, but it was almost impossible for a Jewish person to do so. We saw that such camps became industrial complexes.</p>

Rotherham (Mr. MacShane) touched on my first point. Amazingly, we still live in an age of holocaust denial, although the evidence about what happened is overwhelming. I am talking not only about the physical remains, the contemporary sources and the war crime trials, but, not least, the scholarship. It ranges from some of the earlier scholars such as Raul Hilberg, who wrote &#147;The Destruction of the European Jews&#148;, to the more recent, outstanding and, in many ways, depressing work of Saul Friedländer, who has managed to pull together so much. The scholarship completely and utterly refutes what has been written by people such as David Irving.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o196"><a name="80131-0010.htm_para4"><a name="08013153000433">The victims were Jews of all classes, backgrounds, ages and nationalities&#151;assimilated and non-assimilated. They were, on the whole, innocent people. They were killed because of their race, not because of their politics, their religion or their social behaviour. That was what absolutely and totally motivated the perpetrators. We hear a great deal about functionaries of one kind or another, but there is no doubt that Hitler and the leading Nazis believed that there was a world Jewish conspiracy. They wound up the German war effort and made that policy its centre.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o197"><a name="80131-0010.htm_para5"><a name="08013153000434">The sad thing is that without hundreds of thousands of people, not just in Germany but elsewhere in Europe&#151;civil servants, soldiers, policemen, lawyers, doctors, academics, scientists and industrialists&#151;it could not have happened. And, on the whole, those people were not reluctant functionaries. Then there were the collaborators, the European Nazis and anti-Semites. Again, the efficient removal of Jews from many countries would not have been achieved without the highly efficient civil servants and police in Holland, Vichy France and elsewhere.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o198"><a name="80131-0010.htm_para6"><a name="08013153000435">Then we have the bystanders&#151;the public, the neighbours, the democratic political parties, the Churches and, of course, the allies and the neutrals. I have often wondered what we would have done in the circumstances. I look at how many of us would behave at the prospect of our name appearing in the <i> News of the World</i>, if it were to e-mail us threatening to put us in one of its columns&#151;<i> [</i><i> Interruption.</i><i> ]</i> I am not making a flippant point: it was literally life and death for many Jewish people in the 1930s. If their neighbours helped them, they risked death too, as my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Folkestone and Hythe (Mr. Howard) said. Many people passed by on the other side.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o199"><a name="80131-0010.htm_para7"><a name="08013153000436">Then there were the resisters&#151;individuals and groups, from many nations and motivated by moral repugnance, neighbourly behaviour, resistance to the Nazis and courage. Many of them were ambivalent. The life of Oskar Schindler, made famous by the film, is an obvious example.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o200"><a name="80131-0010.htm_para8"><a name="08013153000437">Whom do we usually remember? We remember the victims and the perpetrators, but we politicians in a democratic Parliament should take note of the collaborators and the bystanders. There was no inevitability to the final solution and the holocaust. It was incremental, and incremental in a way that could happen again. It is not enough that good men and women do nothing.</p>

 I wish to pay tribute to the Smith brothers of north Nottinghamshire who have been crucial in the running and advancement of Holocaust memorial day over the years.

Among his many other major works on the issue, he has taken on the task of marking mass graves in the Baltic states, and I have had the privilege of assisting with that recently. It is a salutary lesson in history and in current events, because not every country in Europe&#151;never mind in the world&#151;marks Holocaust memorial day.

He is a Member of the European Parliament and a historian. His book is an attempt to rewrite history in relation to the holocaust. His basic theory is best described as, &#147;The Jews had it coming, because they were all communists.&#148; He suggests that a balancing of history is required. Of course, Grutups&#151;who is, let us not forget, a political leader&#151;has a track record. He has published books on the blood libel and on the Dreyfus case, which were also from a strange historical perspective&#151;not unique, but one which would not be shared by the vast majority of historians or, indeed, any reasonable person.</p>

It has the same theme&#151;the need for an equal evaluation of history. It is just a traditional form of prejudice, rewritten in a modern context.

 When the allies overran the concentration camps at the end of the second world war, a parliamentary delegation was sent to visit Buchenwald. So distressing were the sights that those MPs saw that one of them, a lady called Mavis Tate, subsequently committed suicide. The very idea, at that time or in the years immediately following the war, that there could arise a school of thought that could seriously attempt to deny what had happened in places such as Buchenwald would have seemed patently absurd.</p>

Everyone has heard of it, and organisations such as the Oxford union debating society think it appropriate to offer the privilege of a platform to its most notorious advocate, David Irving.</p>

I must have put my case across poorly, because time after time I was told that it was an issue of free speech&#151;as though anyone had suggested that Irving and Griffin should not have the right to say what they wanted, as long as they did not break the law. In fact, the question was about who should have one or two of the limited opportunities to speak at the Union that are available every term.

cousin&#146;s family moved to Canada and used to send parcels back to the Krynskis and do the best they could to support them in Poland. Later, they suggested that Mr. Krynski should go to Israel to be honoured for what he had done.

That is why the work of the Holocaust Education Trust and the DVD, which has won a BAFTA, will be so important for the next generation, as they will ensure that we do not lose those crucial lessons from the past.</p>

Member for Montgomeryshire talked about the impact that visits to Auschwitz have had on young people&#151;and older ones too, I dare say&#151;in his constituency. I was lucky enough to meet a group of young people from Oldham who had visited Auschwitz and Srebrenica. They were a real mixture of Jewish, Christian and Muslim, and it was obvious that their lives had been changed forever. The opportunity to go together, as a group, has changed their perceptions of other people, cultures, religions and races. That is an immensely powerful thing.</p>

He asked about the &#163;1.5 million set aside for the Holocaust Educational Trust, and whether that commitment would be continued. I cannot make announcements of behalf of other Departments, but I can say that strong and effective representations have been made in the debate, and I am sure that my colleagues in the Department for Children, Schools and Families will take them into account when making decisions in the future.</p>

In this House we can pass legislation on religious and racial hatred, but the right hon. and learned Gentleman was right to remind us that the law is not always enough when it comes to the extremes of humanity and people who do the most extraordinary and devastating things. We must do a lot more, and that is why this debate has celebrated the good works of the Holocaust Educational Trust and all those involved in Holocaust memorial day.</p>

 These amendments offer alternative ways to deal with what we perceive to be a significant problem with the Bill. I shall set out in detail how they would work, but before I do so I shall put the problem in context.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o228"><a name="80131-0011.htm_para3"><a name="08013153000474">All hon. Members are aware of how important taxation is as a constitutional matter, and the House guards very jealously its right to raise revenue. In the broad historical sweep, for instance, the English civil war and the American revolution could be considered relevant to this discussion, although I shall not refer to them in detail. All parties in this House consider the proper scrutiny of revenue-raising measures to be very important.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o229"><a name="80131-0011.htm_para4"><a name="08013153000475">This country has two forms of taxation on income&#151;income tax and national insurance&#151;and it is worth taking a moment to look at the different ways in which they are dealt with in this House. Income tax was introduced as a temporary measure in 1798; it was abolished five years later and then reintroduced on a permanent basis in 1842. Partly as an historical overhang, since 1860 we have renewed income tax every year, although previously it had been renewed over groups of three or seven years on a number of occasions. However, the review of income tax is also part of Parliament&#146;s power over the Executive, as the Crown cannot raise revenue if Parliament is dissolved. Corporation tax is subject to the same restriction.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o230"><a name="80131-0011.htm_para5"><a name="08013153000476">In essence, this debate is about thresholds. Since the introduction of the Finance Act 1977, when the Rooker-Wise amendment was implemented, thresholds and personal allowances have increased in line with inflation; they do so unless Parliament expressly states otherwise. The clear intention was to prevent stealth taxation, as thresholds and allowances are both diminished by inflation. Of course, inflation in 1977 was somewhat higher than it has been for some few years now. We still have fiscal drag within a year, but not from year to year.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o231"><a name="80131-0011.htm_para6"><a name="08013153000477">Parliament retains the ability not to uprate allowances and thresholds in line with inflation. Indeed, it exercised that power as recently as 2003-04, but it must do so explicitly. It does so through a Finance Bill. This is where I would like to make a comparison with national insurance contributions. With income tax, from the point of view of the taxpayer, the concern is that thresholds will not increase in line with inflation. Our practical concern with national insurance contributions is with the upper earnings limit increasing faster than the rate of inflation. There is also a concern&#151;it is probably more theoretical than practical&#151;that the lower earnings level or primary threshold could fall, but at a practical level the political debate over many years has been about whether the upper earnings limit might increase more rapidly.</p>

legislation or a formula that can be amended through such legislation. Section 1 of the Social Security Pensions Act 1975 provides a safeguard, however. The upper earnings limit cannot be increased by more than seven and a half times the lower earnings limit, or by less than six and a half times the lower earnings limit. Why? Such an arrangement prevents abrupt changes in the scope of national insurance contributions without proper parliamentary scrutiny.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o233"><a name="80131-0011.htm_para8"><a name="08013153000479">On looking at the debate on Second Reading and in Committee on that legislation, I noted that the concern expressed in Committee was that the provisions were unduly flexible and that six and a half to seven and a half was too wide a band to permit the Government to vary the national insurance contributions upper earnings limit. I also noted that representing the Opposition on that occasion in 1975 was my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Rushcliffe (Mr. Clarke), who raised some important points about flexibility. It shows that things do not necessarily change as much as they might do. The concern in 1975 was that the provisions were too flexible. Clearly, Parliament was provided with an opportunity to restrict the power of the Executive to vary the upper earnings limit unduly and rapidly to increase the upper earnings limit to make a substantial increase in the tax on income that people in the United Kingdom would face.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o234"><a name="80131-0011.htm_para9"><a name="08013153000480">That brings me to one of the major problems that we have with this Bill. Clause 1(1) abolishes the ratio and the protection that mean that only so much can be done by regulation.</p>

 My hon. Friend asks a good question. We raised that issue in Committee. Under the new procedure for Public Bills, we were able to ask both the Financial Secretary and her officials that question at the evidence session. The answer was somewhat limited. All we heard was, &#147;It gives us greater flexibility.&#148; Let me quote the Financial Secretary:</p>

cannot be the view of the Government, and I would imagine that it is not the view of Opposition Members, that the notion of a ratio itself is defunct.</p>

<p><a name="st_o201"><a name="08013153000485"><a name="80131-0011.htm_spnew6"><a name="08013153001821"><b>Mr. Gauke:</b>
 I do not think that the argument for abolishing the ratio has been made; at least, not terribly persuasively. I shall come in a moment to the detail of our amendments, in which we have attempted to outline alternative ways to address that concern. I am not saying that I am necessarily wedded to the idea of a ratio, but that is how Parliament&#146;s position has been protected for the past 33 years, and it may be the best way to protect it in future. We can examine other ways. My hon. Friend will recall that we considered the ratio argument in Committee.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o236"><a name="80131-0011.htm_para11"><a name="08013153000486">I understand that the Government are trying to align national insurance contribution rates and bands with those for income tax. Although I am concerned that their way of doing it is motivated principally by the aim of raising revenue, the objective of aligning the two is a perfectly respectable and honourable one to which we have no particular objection. It is fair to say that publications such as the Forsyth report were instrumental in encouraging the Government to go down that route or at least to place greater emphasis on simplification. We do not have any problem with that, so we are keen to be helpful to the Government, notwithstanding our concerns about the revenue-raising element. We are willing to help the Government achieve their objective while providing some protection for Parliament; that is the basis of the amendments that we have tabled in Committee and today.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o237"><a name="80131-0011.htm_para12"><a name="08013153000487">Various calculations were done on widening the bands. For the first time in some while, I got out my calculator and tried to work out what ratio would be needed, given that the upper point is seven and a half times what is now the primary threshold. It is a difficult sum to calculate in some respects, because one must look at future years and so on, but it is clear that if the existing ratio is breached, it will be breached by only a relatively small amount. One idea, which I think the hon. Member for Taunton (Mr. Browne) proposed, was that the primary threshold could always be increased a little if the ratio would be breached only by a small margin.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o238"><a name="80131-0011.htm_para13"><a name="08013153000488">One of our proposals in Committee was to widen the bands, as my hon. Friend the Member for Cities of London and Westminster (Mr. Field) mentioned, so that eight would be the top point rather than seven and a half. Quite possibly Treasury officials have done the calculations&#151;if so, I should be interested to hear what the Minister says about it&#151;but I do not think that there is any doubt that a ratio of eight times the primary threshold as the maximum point would cause the Government any difficulties in achieving their stated objective. One approach would be to consider that ratio. We debated and voted on that proposal in Committee, so it could not be brought back on Report, but it is an idea to which we are sympathetic.</p>

no say on whether to hold back from an arbitrary correction&#151;from the Government&#146;s perspective&#151;of national insurance thresholds, particularly at the higher end?</p>

<p><a name="st_o203"><a name="08013153000490"><a name="80131-0011.htm_spnew8"><a name="08013153001823"><b>Mr. Gauke:</b>
 My hon. Friend sums up the position well. For the sake of completeness, let me add that there is the matter of regulation, which would be introduced through the affirmative procedure. No doubt the Minister will make that point.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o239"><a name="80131-0011.htm_para14"><a name="08013153000491">It might be helpful to compare two very similar tax changes&#151;a failure to uprate the threshold for income tax in line with inflation and an increase in the upper earnings limit. A failure to uprate a threshold for income tax would be announced in the Budget. Under the previous Chancellor it was unlikely that it would be announced in the Budget speech, but it would appear in the Red Book. There would then be four days of debate on the Budget, followed by a vote on a Budget resolution that, as I understand it, would include the income tax element. The resolution would be implemented through a Finance Bill. There would be a Second Reading debate on the Bill, and the income tax element would be a major part of the Bill. One can imagine an Opposition opposing a Finance Bill on the grounds of a failure to uprate income tax.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o240"><a name="80131-0011.htm_para15"><a name="08013153000492">That would almost certainly be one of the issues debated by a Committee of the whole House considering such a Finance Bill. The issue would presumably not be debated in Committee, but would certainly come back on Report and Third Reading. So by my reckoning, in the circumstances that I set out, a failure to increase the threshold for income tax would be the subject of up to seven days&#146; debate on the Floor of the House and at least four votes of the House&#151;not of the Committee, but of the House.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o241"><a name="80131-0011.htm_para16"><a name="08013153000493">By contrast, a tax increase on income, which is in many respects similar to the case that I described, such as raising the upper earnings limit, would be the subject of one debate in Committee, lasting perhaps two and a half hours, followed by one vote in Committee. In one case there would be a much superior method of parliamentary scrutiny. There is hardly any comparison between the two cases, and that is difficult to justify.</p>

<p><a name="st_o204"><a name="08013153000494"><a name="80131-0011.htm_spnew9"><a name="08013153001824"><b>Mr. Field:</b>
 Is not one of the biggest concerns the fact that the change is pretty high profile in people&#146;s minds and affects everyone in the workplace? Whatever their level of earnings, they pay national insurance. As a result, if the Government had their way on the matter and did not allow full scrutiny, the measure would go through on the nod and would not be scrutinised as it should be, not just on the business pages, but beyond. It would not be treated like other matters following a Budget. I do not believe that the Government are being dishonourable or disrespectful, but the change goes to the heart of what many of our constituents feel about paying tax in the broader sense&#151;income tax or national insurance. These issues should therefore be at the forefront of a readily understandable Finance Bill debate, rather than discussed in a Committee Room.</p>

Members remember better than others and some remember more fondly than others. The Labour party, which was in opposition at the time, was proposing the abolition of the upper earnings limit. Clearly, the Government&#146;s position has changed. I regret that amendments tabled by the hon. Member for Hayes and Harlington (John McDonnell), which would have had the effect of reverting to the 1992 position by abolishing the upper earnings limit, were not selected. The proposal may well return. I would argue against the abolition of the upper earnings limit for reasons of concern about tax burden, but it is a perfectly respectable position to take.</p>

Clearly, that Government would be entitled to abolish the limit, but they should be able to do so only if there were proper parliamentary scrutiny and if all the expected procedures were gone through. The Bill does not provide that protection.</p>

Does my hon. Friend agree that if the safeguard is removed, that can only lead to the conclusion that the Government are preparing, and intending one day, to use the changes in respect of the removal of the safeguard? Perhaps they will come back with a proposal under the negative procedure, which does not require any debate on the Floor of the House. Having been bitten once, we should fear being bitten again.</p>

 I am grateful to my hon. Friend, who raises a concern that many have.

Four or five years ago the decision was made to invest in the national health service and it was decided that there should therefore be an increase of 1 per cent. right the way through national insurance, effectively abolishing the upper earnings limit in respect of that 1 per cent. additional element.

 My hon. Friend makes an interesting point, which leads me to this observation. I will not dwell on the point, but a certain Labour Government had been elected on a pledge that they would not increase the rates of income tax. They then increased national insurance contributions and said, &#147;Well, that&#146;s not income tax.&#148; Given that precedent, if at a future election a party&#151;it could be either party&#151;made a pledge not to increase income tax, could anything stop it increasing national insurance contributions above the upper earnings limit or abolishing the limit? That is an interesting point, which relates back to what my hon. Friend the Member for Gosport (Peter Viggers) said. There is a suspicion that a door is being left open. We know from yesterday&#146;s Institute for Fiscal Studies report that the Government&#146;s public finances are in a mess; there is an &#163;8 billion black hole.</p>

 My hon. Friend is being very helpful. That is exactly the issue. I do not particularly want to debate the rights and wrongs of abolishing the upper earnings limit&#151;nor, I suspect, is it in order to do so&#151;but if that were to happen, or even if it were merely to be increased substantially, would the House have the opportunity to scrutinise it properly? We have such an opportunity under the existing legislative framework, but we will not if the Bill is passed in its current form. That is an important point. I stress that we object not to Parliament&#146;s ability to change the upper earnings limit&#151;of course Parliament should have the right to do that&#151;but to its not being able to do so by regulation, even by the affirmative procedure.</p>

In amendment No. 8&#151;which is mirrored by amendment No. 9 because we need to change two Acts in this process, one relating to England, Scotland and Wales and one relating to Northern Ireland&#151;we suggest that there should be no increase in the upper earnings limit in excess of the retail prices index in September of the previous year. When we tabled a similar amendment in Committee, the Financial Secretary said that the reference date for national insurance contributions is December, not September, so we have rectified that error. She also said that December was not feasible because it would cause various IT costs and so on. That was essentially her argument against the link with the RPI. This is similar to the Rooker-Wise approach whereby thresholds for income tax increase in line with the RPI for September in the previous year. If the higher rate income tax threshold rises along with inflation, based on the RPI in September, and the upper earnings limit rises along with inflation using the same measure, they should continue to go hand in hand, which would enable the Government to fulfil their objectives.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o248"><a name="80131-0012.htm_para3"><a name="08013153000510">Neither of our sets of amendments aims to prevent the Government from achieving their stated policy objective of aligning the point at which the upper earnings limit exists and the point at which one starts paying higher rate income tax. The Financial Secretary might argue that they do not quite reflect the provisions that relate to income tax and the Rooker-Wise amendment. If so, would she object to the principle of the amendments, given that her objection to the equivalent amendment in Committee was essentially that December was the wrong date and that it should be September? Now that we have rectified that problem, does she have any objections to the amendment?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o250"><a name="80131-0012.htm_para5"><a name="08013153000512">Amendment No. 10 is a development of an amendment that we tabled in Committee to probe the Government.

The first was that national insurance contributions are calculated weekly whereas income tax is calculated annually. She construed our amendment&#151;possibly a little harshly, but I concede that there was an ambiguity in it&#151;as meaning that the relevant income tax level of, for example, &#163;43,000 a year would be treated as a weekly limit.

Finance Bill is enacted. Our proposal in Committee that the national insurance contribution upper earnings limit should not be raised above the point at which higher rate income tax becomes payable did not work because at the point where a regulation would have to be passed the Finance Bill would not have already gone through, even though an announcement would have been made in the Budget and there may be Budget resolutions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o253"><a name="80131-0012.htm_para8"><a name="08013153000515">We accept that argument, which is why we have come back with a different solution. It is not the most elegant piece of drafting that has ever come before the House, but it attempts to address in good faith an entirely legitimate concern. We propose that within six months of the regulation setting the upper earnings limit&#151;in other words, six months into the financial year&#151;the Treasury will be required to review whether the upper earnings limit is above the level at which higher rate income tax is payable. If it is, we would then require the Treasury to bring forward regulations to reduce the upper earnings limit below the higher rate of income tax as existed at that time for the following year.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o254"><a name="80131-0012.htm_para9"><a name="08013153000516">That proposal would cause considerable inconvenience to the Treasury, and I make no apologies for that. The purpose of the amendment is to provide a deterrent to prevent any Government from activating the mischief to which I referred earlier. A Government would be able to raise the upper earnings limit through primary legislation, but if the limit were increased by regulation higher than the Government said that they intended, they would have to go through the embarrassment of producing a further order stating that they were wrong and that the upper earnings limit would be brought down the following year.</p>

 I accept that a review takes place. However, amendments Nos. 10 and 11 deal with circumstances in which a Government raise the upper earnings limit with intent, not accidentally. One can imagine a meeting in the Treasury around this time of year in which the view is expressed. &#147;We need to raise a bit more revenue&#151;how are we going to do it?&#148; Someone then comes up with the bright idea of increasing the upper earnings limit.

As I have said, they would not be binding for ever, but they would cause some inconvenience that should dissuade a Government from taking a path that hon. Members of all parties do not believe any Government should follow. That is the essence of our case. I stress again that it would not prevent the upper earnings limit from being changed, but it stops that happening by regulation and inadequately.</p>

We know from the evidence-taking session that the Government have no proposals to merge them. We all acknowledge that there are great similarities between them, but a comparison of the parliamentary scrutiny that both get shows that national insurance contributions already get substantially less consideration. That will be reinforced if the Bill is passed in its current form. Our amendments attempt to rectify the problem to some extent and without jeopardising the Government&#146;s stated objectives.</p>

We regret, however, that the simplification has been given something of a bad name by the proposals before us, because it has been achieved as a by-product of an increase in overall tax revenue of about &#163;1.5 billion. The public respond well to the idea of being better able to understand the tax burden that is placed on them, but not when a degree of sleight of hand is deployed to relieve them of some of their income in the process. The Budget left millions of losers: more than 5 million people were net losers. I always object when people talk about the abolition of the 10p rate of income tax. In my view, the 10p rate was not abolished; it was doubled in the budgetary proposals. That is the context in which we are having this conversation today.</p>

of hand&#151;or, to go a bit further, potential abuses&#151;that might otherwise take place. The view that I took in Committee, and continue to take today, is that removing that multiplier at the upper limit&#151;the 6.5 to 7.5 per cent. band&#151;will present certain hazards of which we should be mindful.

<p><a name="stpa_o262"><a name="80131-0012.htm_para17"><a name="08013153000527">The hon. Gentleman has effectively tabled two amendments on this matter. Amendment No. 8, which links the increases to the rate of inflation, is the better of the two, and my party would be minded to support it for the reasons that he gave, and because we wish to see proper scrutiny and some restraint placed on this Government and future Governments in this regard. I understand the motivation behind amendment No. 10, but I am perhaps slightly less optimistic than he is about the effectiveness of a process that would involve the Treasury conducting a review of itself before taking any action. My inclination is to believe that such a review would conclude what those who had set up the review wished it to conclude, at its inception.</p>

 I should like to make a point in defence of amendment No. 10. Does the hon. Gentleman agree that it is a question of fact&#151;I believe that there is sufficient certainty for this to be practical&#151;whether the upper earnings limit exceeds the point at which higher rate income tax becomes payable? If that were simply a question of fact, and not one of interpretation, it would be unfair to suggest that the Treasury would not look at the matter with complete integrity. This is therefore a test that has sufficient certainty at the very least. This is not a complicated matter; it is a question of doing some sums. Given that we should set the requirement that the Treasury do the sums, I am confident that it would come back with the correct answer.</p>

I regret that the Government are seeking extra leeway in regard to placing a tax burden on people earning about &#163;40,000, but not seeking to establish a corresponding loosening of the tax burden on those at the lower end of the scale who would benefit the most from being able to spend a greater proportion of their own money as they saw fit.</p>

 The attitude of the hon. Member for Taunton (Mr. Browne) to the Bill is fairly friendly, but mine is not.

It was introduced as an afterthought&#151;or rather to give the appearance of being an afterthought&#151;to the Budget. The amendments so ably spoken to by my hon.

 To clarify my earlier point, one may or may not believe that the changes in taxation are objectionable&#151;I happen to think that there is some sense in not having a huge dip in the marginal rates of someone earning &#163;38,000; the rates are more advantageous than for someone earning &#163;28,000&#151;as one can legitimately debate them.

Friend the Member for South-West Hertfordshire pointed out, in the transition from national insurance contributions to an earnings-related contributory system in the mid-1970s. When national insurance contributions were first introduced in 1911, they were flat rate and continued to be so until world war two, although they were varied by age and sex. Partially earnings-linked graduated contributions were added to the structure in 1961, but it was not until 1975, as my hon. Friend said, that national insurance contributions became fully related to earnings. As part of that reform, lower and upper earnings limits for contributions liability were introduced.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o266"><a name="80131-0012.htm_para21"><a name="08013153000536">A lower limit was required for practical and administrative reasons and to concentrate contributions and benefits on people who depended substantially on income from work. The lower limit was linked to the level of the basic retirement pension and an upper limit was required to prevent excessive burdens and the acquisition of very high benefit entitlements. Those limits had been set in statute and considerable thought was given to them, as my hon. Friend noted, in the 1975 legislation. At that time, the Government deliberately set themselves a longer-term framework within which national insurance contributions were to be levied.</p>

 I thank the hon. Member for South-West Hertfordshire (Mr. Gauke) for tabling the amendments. I also compliment the House business managers, who arranged for this debate to take place after the debate on Holocaust memorial day. That allowed me to come and listen to one of the best debates I have heard for a long time&#151;after this one, of course.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o272"><a name="80131-0013.htm_para2"><a name="08013153000543">The amendments are prompted by concern that the Bill will somehow reduce parliamentary scrutiny of secondary legislation setting the upper earnings limit, by abolishing the restriction. As Opposition Members described, that restriction limits the raising of the upper earnings limit to seven and a half times the primary threshold. The hon. Gentleman advanced his case in a spirit of helpfulness, for which I am grateful, and broadly based his arguments around the premise that Britain should be protected from a Government who might be motivated to use the upper earnings limit as a tax-raising opportunity, if it were not tied in some way to the lower limit.</p>

Government &#163;1 billion at 1985 prices. It is also worth noting that that proposal was not in their manifesto. I make those remarks gently.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o274"><a name="80131-0013.htm_para4"><a name="08013153000545">The point that the hon. Gentleman made and the principle that he put forward are valid for debate, and I am sure that we would be advancing those arguments were I in his post, but we should take a moment to describe what happened. Historically, the lower earnings limit was set at a quarter of average earnings, whereas the upper earnings limit was set at one and a half times average earnings. That ratio was broadly maintained, but greater flexibility was introduced when the lower earnings limit was statutorily linked to the basic category A state pension. Its uprating then followed the switch from the link with earnings to that with prices.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o275"><a name="80131-0013.htm_para5"><a name="08013153000546">Treasury Ministers announce the NICs rates and thresholds for the forthcoming year at or around the pre-Budget report. The Government Actuary&#146;s Department then produces a report on the impact on the national insurance fund of the changes announced, particularly whether the balance of the fund will be 17 per cent. of benefit expenditure, because the fund cannot borrow.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o276"><a name="80131-0013.htm_para6"><a name="08013153000547">The report is then laid before Parliament, and a set of regulations and an order, which make the changes to national insurance rates and thresholds, are laid in January, or thereabouts. I think the next measure to be debated will be dealt with in February. The Department for Work and Pensions then lays regulations, which change the contributory benefit rates at the same time. Decisions made in this context are often scrutinised not just publicly but in the House. The timing of the regulations gives employers and payroll providers time to prepare for 6 April. I made that point in Committee, and I note that the hon. Member for South-West Hertfordshire has accepted some of the case that I made then. Like the hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster (Mr. Field), who is not in the Chamber&#151;no doubt he has been called away&#151;he was keen to ensure that proper scrutiny took place.</p>

If on occasion they do not last as long as they might, that may be because the issues are not as controversial as people fear that they might be if the Government abused the process.</p>

similar problems with this amendment. We would not be able to align the upper earnings limit for 2009-10 with the point at which higher rate income tax becomes payable, which we announced that we would do in the 2007 Budget. The limit could not be raised by &#163;800 plus the retail prices index. That would remove the main purpose of our Bill, and a significant simplification of the tax and national insurance contributions system would be lost.</p>

 I think the Financial Secretary said that no one would be worse off, but the statistics show that 5.3 million people will be worse off. She told the Committee that 3.5 million people would be worse off by less than &#163;3 a week, which means&#151;if my arithmetic is correct&#151;that 1.8 million people will be worse off by more than &#163;3 a week. Is that correct?</p>

 I did not seek to imply that nobody would be worse off, but the vast majority of taxpayers and pensioners will be better off as a result of the reforms in the 2007 Budget. Most employees earning at the upper earnings limit or above will be better off, using the 2008-09 tax year as an example. The loss of the starting rate band means that they are better off by &#163;232 per annum. The raising of the upper earnings limit to &#163;770 means that they are better off to the tune of &#163;390 a year. The reduction of the basic rate to 20 per cent. means that they are &#163;673 worse off. So overall they are &#163;51.60 a year better off.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o282"><a name="80131-0013.htm_para12"><a name="08013153000555">There are groups that are worse off&#151;about 300,000 taxpayers at the upper earnings limit&#151;and I have answered questions recently that make that clear. We anticipate, however, that the vast majority would be better off or no worse off as a result. Our intention in making the changes was to introduce a much simpler personal tax system&#151;one of the simplest in Europe and the developed world.</p>

However, it would then introduce the review, which we have had exchanges about. Under the amendment, after the regulations came into force the review would examine whether the upper earnings limit calculated on an annual basis exceeds the level of earnings at which higher rate tax becomes payable.

<p><a name="stpa_o284"><a name="80131-0013.htm_para14"><a name="08013153000557">In principle, I have no objection to the Treasury&#146;s reviewing its work. It conducts such work thoroughly and there should be no reason for anybody to doubt the integrity of any review, but the amendment is unnecessary. The upper earnings limit and the level of the higher rate tax threshold will be announced at the time of the pre-Budget report. Announcing the levels then is necessary in order for changes to national insurance contributions legislation, guidance and software changes to payroll systems to be put in place for the next tax year. The regulations that set the level of the upper earnings limit will already be subject to affirmative resolution. I have argued that that is a perfectly proper means of parliamentary scrutiny.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o285"><a name="80131-0013.htm_para15"><a name="08013153000558">The change suggested by the amendment would be inconsistent with the Bill&#146;s objective, which is to allow alignment of the upper earnings limit with the level at which higher rate tax is paid. The change proposed in the Bill should not give any cause for concern in terms of parliamentary scrutiny. We have the necessary parliamentary controls in place because the regulations will be subject to careful scrutiny under the affirmative procedure. The Bill provides the correct balance between allowing appropriate scrutiny and not putting pressure on limited parliamentary time for other legislative objectives. I therefore hope that the hon. Member for South-West Hertfordshire will withdraw the amendment.</p>

 I am grateful to the Financial Secretary for her thoughtful response. That has been characteristic of the tone throughout the progress of the Bill; we have managed to maintain a reasonably cordial and thoughtful approach. However, I must respond to one or two points. On her comment that the employers&#146; upper earnings limit was abolished in 1985, I am running the risk of asking a question when not knowing the answer, but I do not know what the process was and whether it was done through primary legislation. The essence of my argument is that if steps such as those we are discussing are to be taken, that must be done through primary legislation. I should add that I was probably 13 at the time, so I do not feel too responsible for what was done then. If my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Rushcliffe (Mr. Clarke) were present, he might be able to tell us more.</p>

it was inconsistent with the objective of aligning the national insurance contributions upper earnings limit with the point at which one starts paying higher rate income tax. The purpose of amendment No. 10 is to ensure that they are aligned.

There is no need for legislation for 2008-09, because the ratio would still apply. I do not find her arguments on amendment No. 8 convincing. Given the mood of the House and the comments of my hon.

 I beg to move, That the Bill be now read the Third time.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o293"><a name="80131-0014.htm_para0"><a name="08013153000986">We have reached the final stage of this House&#146;s deliberations on the National Insurance Contributions Bill, which will ensure that the personal tax package can be fully operative. I think that it will be helpful if I outline the details of the package again, as some hon. Members have focused on only a few aspects of it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o294"><a name="80131-0014.htm_para1"><a name="08013153000987">Since 1997, the Government have delivered a comprehensive programme of reforms to the tax and benefit system. Their aim has been to simplify the system, to tackle child and pensioner poverty and to make work pay. Budget 2007 announced the next stage of the reforms as part of a rebalancing of the tax system to offer more support for work, families and pensioners.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o295"><a name="80131-0014.htm_para2"><a name="08013153000988">The package simplified income tax and national insurance contributions. It increased the personal allowances for those aged 65 and over, and it changed the rates and threshold for child tax credit and working tax credit. It was carefully balanced, so that the tax credit changes focus on those whose need is greatest,  <br>


<meta name="Date" content="31 Jan 2008">

<notus-date day="31" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><b>31 Jan 2008 : Column 534</b><br>
including low-income families with children. The personal tax changes provide a simpler system with a modest impact on most sectors, and increased support to pensioners over 65. Each change should not be looked at in isolation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o296"><a name="80131-0014.htm_para3"><a name="08013153000989">Alongside producing the lowest basic rate of tax for over 75 years and one of the simplest personal structures in the developed world, that package results in four out of five households being better or no worse off, with the average household gaining &#163;100 per year. A lone parent with one child will see their annual gain from returning to work rise by up to &#163;350, and 200,000 children have been removed from poverty. Households with children in the poorest fifth of the population will be on average &#163;340 per year better off, and around 600,000 fewer pensioners will pay income tax than would otherwise be the case, so that in total only 43 per cent. of pensioners will be taxpayers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o297"><a name="80131-0014.htm_para4"><a name="08013153000990">In helping to deliver that package, the Bill first allows the upper earnings limit to be aligned with the point at which higher-rate tax starts to be paid, significantly simplifying the United Kingdom&#146;s tax and national insurance contribution systems. From April 2009 there will be just two main rates of income tax, and they will apply to the same bands of income as the two rates of national insurance contributions, creating one of the simplest personal tax structures of any developed country.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o298"><a name="80131-0014.htm_para5"><a name="08013153000991">Secondly, the proposals in the Bill are central to the Government&#146;s commitment to provide a solid and simpler state pension. By bringing forward the introduction of the upper accrual point, the Bill returns the timetable for the removal of earnings-related state second pension to that recommended by the Pensions Commission. That will mean that by around 2030 the complex earnings-related structure of the state second pension will be withdrawn, leaving a flat-rate scheme that will be simple to administer and to understand for both contributors and pensioners.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o299"><a name="80131-0014.htm_para6"><a name="08013153000992">I got a little carried away during my earlier contribution; I blame it on the flu. In trying to reassure the hon. Member for Gosport (Peter Viggers), which I patently failed to do, on winners and losers in respect of the upper earnings limit, I got the figures the wrong way round. The loss of the starting rate band and the upper earnings limit being raised mean that those people are worse off by the amounts that I gave. However, they are better off as a result of the basic rate being introduced at 20 per cent. I know that he knew that; he just did not want to cause me embarrassment in the debate. However, I was right to say that, overall, they will be &#163;51.60 better off.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o300"><a name="80131-0014.htm_para7"><a name="08013153000993">I am grateful to hon. Members for the way in which this Bill has been debated. It is a short Bill. It makes the two changes that I have described, for the reasons we have debated. I am pleased to be able to conclude that the Bill has had thorough scrutiny. As I have said, I have been impressed by the constructive contributions. I thank hon. Members on both sides of the House for their contributions to the debate.</p>

 As the Financial Secretary said, we have had some good scrutiny of the Bill, but Opposition Members remain concerned about what the Bill seeks  <br>


<meta name="Date" content="31 Jan 2008">

to achieve and the manner in which that is being done. As the right hon. Lady also said, there are two elements to the Bill. The first relates to taxation, in the sense of the change to the provisions on the upper earnings limit. The second relates to changes to pensions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o301"><a name="80131-0014.htm_para8"><a name="08013153000995">On the first point, we have already debated at some length&#151;I do not intend to repeat the points that were made&#151;our concerns about the lack of proper scrutiny that may occur should there be other increases in the upper earnings limit, and the fact that the restrictions in existing legislation provide some protection to ensure that there is an opportunity in this House, and particularly within this Chamber, to examine any changes to the upper earnings limit. There is no doubt that the Bill will weaken that ability, and we are considerably concerned about it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o302"><a name="80131-0014.htm_para9"><a name="08013153000996">It has not been an entirely happy week for the House of Commons, to put it mildly. I do not want to be hyperbolic, as there have been other issues of even greater concern, but we are unhappy about the effect of these provisions on future scrutiny. There is a broader point about the increase in the upper earnings limit: it is a stealth tax increase, part of what turned out to be the Prime Minister&#146;s final Budget as Chancellor, in which he produced a rabbit out of a hat for political effect, and &#163;1.5 billion a year will be raised from middle earners as a result.</p>

<p><a name="st_o229"><a name="08013153000997"><a name="80131-0014.htm_spnew2"><a name="08013153002261"><b>Mr. Adam Holloway (Gravesham) (Con):</b>
 Does my hon. Friend agree that we are in effect legislating for a &#163;1.5 billion tax rise? We were told that the Bill would simplify the tax system, end child poverty, address inequalities in our society and so on, but it is a tax increase, not for the super-rich but, yet again, for middle-income families.</p>

<p><a name="st_o230"><a name="08013153000998"><a name="80131-0014.htm_spnew3"><a name="08013153002262"><b>Mr. Gauke:</b>
 My hon. Friend makes a good point. We have been rather consensual this afternoon, as we were in Committee, when discussing areas of disagreement between us and the Government, but some of the debate on Second Reading was slightly more feisty, and the accusation was made that the Conservatives, in raising concerns, were on the side of the wealthy. Actually, as my hon. Friend points out, the people who will lose out as a consequence of both the package as a whole and the measures dealing with national insurance contributions are those who earn about &#163;39,000 to &#163;40,000 a year. That is certainly what the Institute for Fiscal Studies concluded. So we are talking about police officers&#151;they are not receiving a full pay increase as it is&#151;senior nurses and teachers, not the very wealthy. It is middle England, to some extent, that will suffer as a consequence of the increase. </p>

<p><a name="stpa_o303"><a name="80131-0014.htm_para10"><a name="08013153000999">I want to make it clear that we do not object to aligning national insurance contributions with higher rate income tax. The idea seems sensible, and I made the point earlier that debate on the matter has been led by my hon. Friend the Member for Tatton (Mr. Osborne), the shadow Chancellor. The Forsyth report, which advocated something similar, has been influential, but those proposals were based on the use of fiscally neutral measures. As my hon. Friend the Member for Gravesham (Mr. Holloway) made clear, the measures in the Bill are not fiscally neutral. They are intended to raise more tax revenue, which we know the Government need to do. I shall not stray too far  <br>


<meta name="Date" content="31 Jan 2008">

<notus-date day="31" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><b>31 Jan 2008 : Column 536</b><br>
into yesterday&#146;s Institute for Fiscal Studies report, which showed that there is an &#163;8 billion black hole in the Government&#146;s finances, and that taxes will need to increase to ensure that the Prime Minister&#146;s fiscal rules are met; the point is that the measures are primarily a tax increase, and not one that will be paid by the wealthy. Looking more broadly at the Budget 2007 package&#151;I shall not dwell on this point&#151;we see that it is the low earners who make up the majority of those who will lose out.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o304"><a name="80131-0014.htm_para11"><a name="08013153001000">We know that 5 million households will lose as a consequence of the measures. I do not think that we ever got an answer to the question asked at a Committee evidence session about how many of those 5 million households would be in the &#163;39,000 to &#163;40,000 income range. I do not know whether the Financial Secretary has an answer, but it would be interesting to know how many households within that band will lose out. Of course, it is the way in which national insurance contributions are being aligned with higher rate income tax that will cause that loss.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o305"><a name="80131-0014.htm_para12"><a name="08013153001001">The second element of the Bill is the separation of the upper accruals point from the upper earnings limit. We all speak of the consensus on all sides about the Turner package of pensions reform, and there is a fundamental consensus on the thrust of what we need to do. The reason why we have expressed concern about what the Government propose in the Bill is not because of any abandonment of the consensus, as was alleged on Second Reading. We believe that there should be a restoration of the earnings link to pensions, and have advocated that idea for some time. We have also accepted the principle of separating the upper earnings limit from the upper accruals point as part of a package&#151;as part of a set of proposals that would enable us to finance the restoration of the earnings link.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o306"><a name="80131-0014.htm_para13"><a name="08013153001002">However, what we see in the Bill is the breaking up of that package, and we are legislating now on separating the upper accruals point from the upper earnings limit at least four years before the implementation of the restoration of that link. That will not happen until 2012, the date that the Government are working on. The Financial Secretary reiterated in Committee that it remains the intention and expectation of the Government that the link will be restored in 2012. The caveat on which the former Chancellor, now the Prime Minister, insisted was that the Government could not restore the link unless economic conditions allowed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o307"><a name="80131-0014.htm_para14"><a name="08013153001003">Given the green budget produced by the Institute for Fiscal Studies, one must seriously question whether those economic conditions will permit that in 2012. If not, it could be another seven years before the link is restored, yet we will already be paying the cost&#151;people will be paying contributions to a contributory system, and their contributions will count for nothing. Those will no longer be contributions, but tax payments.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o308"><a name="80131-0014.htm_para15"><a name="08013153001004">The Pensions Policy Institute raised the issue following the 2007 Budget when national insurance contributions were increased by the increase in the upper earnings limit, and made it clear that as a consequence, unless something was done, the flat-rating would be delayed until 2035. On Second Reading and in Committee we explored in some detail whether the Treasury was fully aware that that would happen. We were told explicitly that the Treasury was aware. In  <br>


<meta name="Date" content="31 Jan 2008">

the Red Book showing the financial implications of every policy announced in the Budget, the additional costs of the increase in the upper earnings limit&#151;in other words, the additional rebates that would be paid to funds for those who had opted out of the second state pension&#151;were scored.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o309"><a name="80131-0014.htm_para16"><a name="08013153001005">That being the case, it is surprising that the Treasury, which with the left hand had identified that there was an issue, had not done more with the right hand to address it. It was conceded by the Treasury officials&#151;whom I take this opportunity to thank for their clear evidence and their help to the Committee&#151;that the Red Book made no explicit reference to the problem. We know that the Treasury was aware of it, yet no proposals were made at the time of the 2007 Budget. One cannot help concluding that the 2007 Budget package was somewhat rushed, and that not all the implications were appreciated or, if they were, not all the necessary mitigating steps were taken to address those consequences. That Budget looks increasingly flawed&#151;</p>

<p><a name="st_o231"><a name="08013153001006"><a name="80131-0014.htm_spnew4"><a name="08013153002263"><b>Madam Deputy Speaker:</b>
 Order. I remind the hon. Gentleman that we are discussing the Third Reading of the Bill, not the 2007 Budget.</p>

<p><a name="st_o232"><a name="08013153001007"><a name="80131-0014.htm_spnew5"><a name="08013153002264"><b>Mr. Gauke:</b>
 I take your guidance, Madam Deputy Speaker.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o310"><a name="80131-0014.htm_para17"><a name="08013153001008">I move swiftly on to our essential concern about that second element of the Bill. A number of people&#151;not the very wealthy&#151;will be paying more in contributions but not receiving the benefit, because they will reach the upper accruals point. We have asked one question throughout. The Government&#146;s explanation is that we need to ensure that we revert to 2030-31 as the point at which flat-rating comes in. What has never been satisfactorily explained is why that 2030-31 date is so important. I appreciate that it was part of the original Turner package, but that was based on the assumption that the national insurance contributions upper earnings limit was not going to be increased as it subsequently was. Why was 2030-31 so sacrosanct that it had to be maintained?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o311"><a name="80131-0014.htm_para18"><a name="08013153001009">My hon. Friend the Member for Ludlow (Mr. Dunne), who is detained on important constituency business today, raised that very question in Committee. The Minister answered that it would have led to higher earners receiving a greater than intended benefit for the state second pension. That is absolutely right, but those higher earners, as she describes them, were contributing more in national insurance contributions than had been anticipated. Why should they not also receive additional benefits? I hope that that point will be explored further in another place.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o312"><a name="80131-0014.htm_para19"><a name="08013153001010">The Bill will raise additional revenue from national insurance contributions. It will weaken Parliament&#146;s ability to scrutinise further tax increases in this area, and it means that&#151;in a manner not anticipated by the Turner report and the consensus that arose from it&#151;people will pay more in national insurance contributions but not receive additional benefits as a consequence. For those reasons we remain concerned that the Bill is flawed, and we will oppose Third Reading.</p>

 I shall give way to any Member who has taken an interest in the Bill for the past few hours; otherwise, I shall make progress.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o313"><a name="80131-0014.htm_para20"><a name="08013153001014">A criticism that can be made of the Government in respect of the past 11 years or so is that a lot of additional complication has been added to the system; if some of that is now being reversed, that is welcome. I suppose I can boil our criticisms down to four succinct points. First, the simplification has come with a large sleight of hand; as has been pointed out, the Bill is part of a process that enables the Government to raise something in the order of &#163;1.5 billion of additional revenue.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o314"><a name="80131-0014.htm_para21"><a name="08013153001015">The situation was fairly anomalous before, when the marginal rate of tax being paid by people earning in the region of &#163;38,000 or &#163;39,000 was considerably higher than that paid by those earning in the region of &#163;28,000 or &#163;29,000. That dip in the graph in that income area could have been seen by many on lower incomes as being unfair on them if they took the view, as I do, that national insurance contributions are, to all intents and purposes, income tax under a different guise. I understand the argument that they are not the same because they are calculated and levied on a different basis. However, many people looking at their payslips at the end of the month will find it anomalous that some people on higher incomes pay lower marginal rates than some of those on lower incomes. I understand the logic of that aspect of the changes, but had the simplification been revenue-neutral, it would have been more widely welcomed than this measure, which combines it with a large additional tax take.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o315"><a name="80131-0014.htm_para22"><a name="08013153001016">Our second objection is that abandoning the multiplier of 7.5 per cent., which Members who have been consistently interested in the Bill have discussed at length, represents a loss of discipline. It is always easier to loosen one&#146;s belt than to regulate one&#146;s diet. The Government would have been better advised, having raised the level of tax take beyond what would have been considered conceivable by Chancellors prior to this Government&#146;s coming to office, to look more often at how they can maintain and impose greater discipline on themselves instead of looking at ways to raise the tax take further.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o316"><a name="80131-0014.htm_para23"><a name="08013153001017">My third point has been discussed at length by the hon. Member for South-West Hertfordshire (Mr. Gauke)&#151;the ability of this House to scrutinise changes that may take place in future. We share the concerns that Conservative Members have expressed in that regard. Even if one takes the view that the current Government are benign and benevolent in all their intentions&#151;certainly, most people take that view of the Financial Secretary, if not of the Government&#151;one can see that it is nevertheless desirable that safeguards  <br>

should be put in place to prevent future abuses. I think that most people would agree that those safeguards are now less onerous than would otherwise have been the case.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o317"><a name="80131-0014.htm_para24"><a name="08013153001018">My fourth point is about part 2, which we have not discussed at such length. As the Conservative spokesman said, as regards the state pension we are getting the pain at least four years before we get the gain. He did not say, of course, because Conservatives never do, that the need to reconnect the link with earnings and price increases has come about because the Conservative party broke it in the first place. Passing over that for the time being, it remains the case that these provisions are being coupled together in the minds of the public, yet we cannot expect the state pension to have that link restored until 2012 at the earliest. My party does not think that the provisions in the Bill are sufficient for pensioners, particularly poorer pensioners and women pensioners.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o318"><a name="80131-0014.htm_para25"><a name="08013153001019">The Bill is not the most controversial measure, principally because it is a means to an end rather than an end in itself. Those who object to the Chancellor&#146;s Budget and to the Government&#146;s overall tax policy, and have rushed into the Chamber to make those objections, have good reasons to do so in many cases, and those are legitimate debates. However, the Bill is about enabling these changes to take place, and that is a separate argument from whether the changes have merit in themselves. I have plenty of views about the merits of the Government&#146;s policies and their last Budget. I also have reservations about aspects of the Bill that I feel less strongly about. The Bill is not particularly controversial, but it does have limitations that give us cause for concern; that is why we will not support it.</p>

The evidence session that we had was an excellent innovation. It was the first time I had dealt with a Bill where there was quite that level of interplay between Ministers, officials and Members of Parliament. Such sessions are considerably more revealing than the stylised debate form, even within the relatively informal surroundings of a Public Bill Committee. The session that we had allowed some deeper questioning, and far more clarity. That ensured that the process was rather more revealing and, I suspect, more straightforward than it would have been if we had to constrain comments within the confines of stylised amendments. It was a useful process, and I thank the Minister and her officials for ensuring that we had that sort of debate.</p>

Friend the Member for South-West Hertfordshire (Mr. Gauke) made some important points in his contribution today, and in Committee. He repeatedly pressed the Minister on the changes made in the 2007 Budget, and on the fact that there were clearly winners and losers thanks to the changes. It seemed to me that the Financial Secretary accepted that there would be as many as 5.3 million losers due to the budgetary changes, as stated by a senior civil servant to the Treasury Committee. It was interesting, however, that the Prime Minister refuted that figure. We will see how matters pan out.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o321"><a name="80131-0015.htm_para1"><a name="08013153001023">The debate on national insurance and pensions is important. It will go on for many years and decades to come, so it is perhaps a little perverse that the Government have rather hysterically held on to this idea that we must have everything sorted out by 2031. I respect the idea, and very much agree with it, that we need long-term thinking in this area, but the world of work, pensions, national insurance and taxation will be very different in 23 years&#146; time. If we consider the situation almost a quarter of a century ago, we find that the accepted norms of tax rates were higher, and that we were living in a less globalised world. One thing of which we can be sure is that the next 23 years will bring even greater change, with the emergence of China and India as great economic superpowers&#151;</p>

 Thank you, Madam Deputy Speaker. I stand duly admonished by you. With that in mind, the concept of simplification is very much to be admired, whether in speaking style or in relation to the Third Reading of the Bill.</p>

Friend the Member for South-West Hertfordshire that we vote against the Bill because there is a sneaking doubt on the part of myself and my colleagues that it is driven by a desire to raise revenue more than anything else. As the hon. Member for Taunton pointed out, a mechanism could have been put in place to ensure that the process was revenue-neutral, instead of raising &#163;1.5 billion or more as a back-door tax increase.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o323"><a name="80131-0015.htm_para3"><a name="08013153001027">The Bill is very useful, but I hope that it is a starting point for a broader debate that needs to take place on fiscal drag. There are now almost 4 million people who pay higher-rate tax, compared with just 2 million just 10 years ago. I am probably taking words out of the Minister&#146;s mouth, but she may suggest that that is a sign of great affluence, and there is an element of truth in that. However, it seems to me that the lowest-paid in our society pay far too much tax as it is. It is not just an issue for higher-rate tax payers, but for those at the lower end of the band. Detailed thought is required, through this sort of legislation and in Finance Bills in years to come, to ensure that the lowest-paid pay far less tax. Certainly in my constituency in central London, taxation is a massive disincentive to the lowest-paid, especially those in social housing, to get any job, notwithstanding benefits such as tax credits and the minimum wage.</p>

 I do not look forward to the Bill reaching the statute book. It is a nasty little measure. The Exchequer Secretary described it as a technical measure and, although it is short, it is complicated. A website on the subject begins: &#147;Prepare to be baffled&#148;. It says that the state second pension is the most ridiculously complicated benefit on the face of the planet.</p>

The Bill will especially disadvantage those who earn between &#163;37,000 and &#163;43,000. As has been said, the overall measures in the Budget, including the Bill, will involve raising a tax of some &#163;1.5 billion and creating 5.3 million losers. The Financial Secretary has pointed out that 3.5 million of those losers will lose less than &#163;3 a week, but it follows that 1.8 million people will lose more than &#163;3 a week.</p>

 I am grateful to you, Madam Deputy Speaker. The then Chancellor of the Exchequer also said&#151;this is the key point, leading to the introduction of this Bill&#151;that the upper earnings limit for national insurance contributions would be aligned with the higher rate threshold. It is those words alone that led to the Bill. My quote showed the then Chancellor&#146;s typically glutinous preening, which contrasted with the comments that are behind the Bill.</p>

He made a great pitch for presenting the whole picture to the House. He made a great point about simplifying. He said that the upper earnings limit for national insurance would be aligned with the higher rate threshold for tax. However, he was not genuinely simplifying. He is simply bringing the rates together&#151;aligning the rates but not the systems. Two systems remain&#151;an annual taxation system and a weekly system for national insurance.

We have been told many times, including today by the Financial Secretary, that we must look at the relief of child poverty and at lifting pensioners out of poverty. &#147;Child poverty&#148; is rather a misleading expression. A child might ask his father, &#147;Daddy, are we quite rich?&#148;, to which the reply might be, &#147;Well, I&#146;m quite rich, but you, like all children, are incredibly poor.&#148; We are not talking about child poverty; we are talking about family poverty, which includes children.

Simplification of the tax system is, of course, important, but we see this as a clever way of introducing a stealth tax that will give the Government a revenue increase of about &#163;1.5 billion, which will be taken directly from middle-income earners.

That is not an insignificant amount of money for a Government who say that they want to help those groups of people.</p>

 Once again, my hon. Friend gives us pearls of wisdom. This is a day on which we should be returning our tax forms, and it seems that that is exactly what the Liberal Democrats, who appear to be absent, are doing. It is also a day on which a green budget has been produced by the Institute for Fiscal Studies, saying that there is a black hole in the nation&#146;s finances of &#163;8 billion&#151;</p>

 The petition is from the regular customers of the Swan hotel in Bacup, Rossendale, in my constituency. It has been signed by 93 of them and it expresses concern about the effect on their daily lives of the smoking ban. </p>

The Swan hotel regulars tell me that since the ban was introduced at least a good third of their social friends have stopped coming as a direct result, and the social atmosphere in the pub has drastically diminished. Smokers and non-smokers alike are finding that the ban serves no purpose whatever, other than nibbling away at the social cohesion that has taken many years to evolve.</p>

It was chopped when it ran out of time under our favourite procedure&#151;the guillotine. I therefore hoped that a Minister from the Ministry of Justice would respond today, but I welcome this Minister because he understands the problem.

The photos used to be in the form of hard copies&#151;taken by box Brownies and so on&#151;but things moved on to videos and now to digital. Such images are now kept on computers, CD-ROM, DVDs and other form of digital storage. Digital is used as an opportunity to download information&#151;pictures and so on&#151;from websites. Paedophiles swap their pictures over the internet, and take their own photos. Many such images are acquired by the website groups that these individuals join to produce new photographs. One must remember that every single photograph is of a child being abused, and there are millions of these photographs.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o355"><a name="80131-0016.htm_para11"><a name="08013153001495">Several things have changed over recent years. First, demand has increased, and that includes the demand of these individuals for new material. I understand from talking to the police that the other thing that has changed is the level of the photographs&#146; depravity&#151;the depths being plumbed are getting lower and lower. Every so many weeks the police will say, &#147;I have never seen anything as bad as this.&#148; When TV programmes talk about protecting children, they mean teenage children, but demand is increasing for younger and younger children, even down to infants and babies.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o356"><a name="80131-0016.htm_para12"><a name="08013153001496">The point that I want to emphasise tonight is the introduction of encryption. I have discussed the issue with police experts and even with the National Technical Assistance Centre&#151;NTAC&#151;whose job is to act on behalf of the police and the security forces to break encryption. I understand from one of NTAC&#146;s directors that the proportion of child abuse material that has been encrypted is increasing. One of the points made is that as the demand on NTAC is increasing, its budget seems to be decreasing&#151;but then one would expect the head of such a department to say that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o357"><a name="80131-0016.htm_para13"><a name="08013153001497">Encryption used to be difficult, but over the past few years it has been possible to download 128 and then 256-bit encryption freely on the net. What is making the situation worse is the fact that the previously complicated procedures required are becoming simpler.  <br>

Perhaps even more striking is the fact that the new Windows Vista Professional contains a system that means that the moment one turns one&#146;s computer off, everything on it is encrypted. So if the police are to have any hope of getting much data from these computers, CD-ROMs and so on, they must get their hands on the computers when they are still running. Otherwise, they are sent off to NTAC to try to break the code.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o358"><a name="80131-0016.htm_para14"><a name="08013153001498">The Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000 gave us some hope. It introduced a penalty of two years&#146; imprisonment for failure to provide the key. Sadly, the relevant part of the Act has only just been enacted, and I am aware of that because I was so concerned that I helped with the consultation. With a bit of encouragement from me&#151;to put it mildly&#151;the consultation included a suggestion that a higher penalty should be imposed when the failure to provide the key to encrypted material concerned child abuse material. I enjoined some of the officials at a meeting to try to help to persuade concerned representatives from the City who, on understanding the point that I was making, accepted it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o359"><a name="80131-0016.htm_para15"><a name="08013153001499">On Second Reading of the Criminal Justice and Immigration Bill, I raised my idea as a possibility, and I received a written response. In essence, it said, &#147;Wait and see, we want to see how the change is working.&#148; Well, it is not working, and it is blindingly obvious why it is not working. The police can say to offenders, &#147;If you do not produce the key, you could go to prison for up to two years.&#148; But most of the material being hidden would put offenders away for five years or more and put them on the sex offenders list. It is an obvious choice to make, and they do not produce the key.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o360"><a name="80131-0016.htm_para16"><a name="08013153001500">I shall give the Minister a current example. An individual is going to court next month. He was arrested in mid-2006. He and a colleague were going to go to France, and they had written out a plan of how they would attack, grab, seduce or abuse French children. Fortunately, for French and English children, the man and his colleague were caught. The police went to the man&#146;s home and found some abuse files, not many, but his computer contained another 150GB of encrypted material. I asked a friend of mine who works at IBM what that would mean if the files were all single photographs taken by a straightforward camera of the sort that many of these people use. He said that it could be as many as 750,000 single photographs. I was staggered, but my police colleagues said that it was not unusual.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o361"><a name="80131-0016.htm_para17"><a name="08013153001501">In this particular case, the need is more urgent. This individual has babysat a little girl, aged three. The police know, from a physical examination, that the girl has been abused. By a process of elimination, the individual is almost certainly the abuser. The little girl will be no use in court as a witness. The only way to catch him would be to break the code on the 150GB of material. He has been approached with the warning about two years, and it would be excessively polite to render his response as &#147;No.&#148; He would rather serve two years and not reveal the data. The police want the data, partly because of the three-year-old girl, but also because if there are other children&#146;s faces in there, they might be able to find them and help them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o362"><a name="80131-0016.htm_para18"><a name="08013153001502">I then decided to propose the new clause. It is straightforward, and would increase the penalty from two years to five years. The new penalty would apply in  <br>

any one of three circumstances. First, it would apply if the offender had been convicted of an offence under the Protection of Children Act 1978 or the Sexual Offences Act 2003. Secondly, it would apply if the offender&#146;s computer or a similar source of data was being examined and it was apparent that it contained at least some images of the abuse of a child. Thirdly, it would apply if the court was satisfied, according to the civil standard, that the protected data were likely to include an indecent photograph of a child&#151;I shall not go through all the details of that. We did not reach my new clause during our discussions in this place, but I have received the agreement of those on my Front Bench that it will be tabled in another place when the Criminal Justice and Immigration Bill reaches the appropriate stage of its consideration.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o363"><a name="80131-0016.htm_para19"><a name="08013153001503">I want the penalty to be increased to five years. In fact, even though such an aspiration is probably unrealistic, I want it to be increased to 10 years. Men and women who do such things to children need to be put away out of the reach of children for as long as possible. I do not know the legal ramifications, but such cases often come up when the individual appears before a court for other child abuse problems. On conviction, it would be very nice if the penalty in such cases was consecutive and not concurrent.</p>

 I pay tribute to my hon. Friend for the enormous amount of work he has done on the subject in collaboration with the Minister and the Government. I entirely agree that in relation to the vile crimes to which he is referring, the punishment in cases that involve this technicality should be increased. I have visited the paedophile unit at Scotland Yard, as well as its equivalent in my local police force in Sussex. The complaint was that such people have a technological know-how that is one step ahead of that of the police. Applying the necessary resources&#151;from the expertise of the personnel who try to crack into the computers to the cost of the hardware and software that is required&#151;is putting serious pressure on the police&#146;s resources. I agree with the need for a change in the law, but the police also need to reprioritise some of the resources so that the responsible departments have the wherewithal to ensure that people are brought to justice and that the penalty can be applied.

 I begin by extending to the hon. Member for Mole Valley (Sir Paul Beresford) my genuine thanks for the way in which he conducts himself with regard to these matters. I have had ministerial responsibility for this area for just over 18 months, and in that time he has worked very hard to bring various issues and facts to my attention. That has contributed greatly to the work that we are trying to do, and I am extremely grateful to him.</p>

He is committed and dedicated, in both a professional sense&#151;if that is the correct expression&#151;and in a personal sense, and I compliment him on that. The hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham (Tim Loughton) has also made a significant contribution to our work on these matters, and I am grateful to him for attending this debate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o369"><a name="80131-0016.htm_para25"><a name="08013153001512">At the outset, I should like to put various matters on record. Those of us attending the debate know the background to it, but we must remember that people outside the House read our proceedings too. Therefore, as well as responding to the questions that have been raised, it is important to lay out for them the processes that we have gone through.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o370"><a name="80131-0016.htm_para26"><a name="08013153001513">At this stage, though, I should like to extend to the hon. Member for Mole Valley, and any other hon. Member who is interested, an invitation to a meeting at which we can discuss some of the issues in more detail. A debate like this is important as a way to set out all the relevant information in cases such as the one that we are considering this evening, but hon. Members of all parties have a common interest in finding a way forward. We are all disgusted by the images that we know are accessed by paedophiles; we all want to protect children and to do as much as possible to prosecute paedophiles and bring them to justice. If we can learn from each other and discuss our common goals, we will be able to make progress.</p>

In addition, if he is aware of other people, over and above the ones I would suggest, whom he would like to invite, I should be very happy to consider including them in the invitation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o372"><a name="80131-0016.htm_para28"><a name="08013153001515">The Government have encouraged the growth of access to the internet, and firmly believe that the facilities available on it, from research information to online shopping, have helped to enhance the lives of our citizens. We are also keen to encourage the development of security on the internet, and to give our citizens the tools to ensure that any information that they send by that means remains secure.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o373"><a name="80131-0016.htm_para29"><a name="08013153001516">However, the Government recognise that the internet and associated technologies are used for unlawful&#151;and sometimes frankly disgusting&#151;purposes. The same information security technologies that provide security and confidentiality for legitimate business and financial transactions can be misused to secure and conceal images of children being sexually abused, so as to evade detection and prosecution.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o374"><a name="80131-0016.htm_para30"><a name="08013153001517">Nine years ago, in a report on law enforcement and encryption from the Cabinet Office performance and innovation unit, the Government acknowledged that the misuse of security tools was a potential threat. Following that report, the Government established in 2000 the National Technical Assistance Centre to provide law enforcement with a national resource for the complex processing of lawfully obtained protected electronic information.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o375"><a name="80131-0016.htm_para31"><a name="08013153001518">Over seven years, NTAC has built up considerable expertise, which it has made available to law enforcement investigators. Complementing the development of NTAC, the Government provided resources to police forces to enable them to appoint and train dedicated forensic computing analysts and investigators who are better able to understand and identify digital evidence. In that regard, I agree with the hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham that some people display a kind of evil genius when it comes to hiding what they do and that, as a result, law enforcement officers must have the same level of expertise. I know of the quality and standard of the people who work at NTAC. Their ability is astonishing. </p>

<p><a name="stpa_o376"><a name="80131-0016.htm_para32"><a name="08013153001519">Similarly, I have visited the Serious Organised Crime Agency high-tech unit that deals with e-crime and seen the work that it does to break some of the computer codes, if that is the right way of putting it. It is astonishing. In this cyber-world, this internet world, this virtual world, it is about trying to develop that capacity. It may not involve a police officer, but we all need to look at the ability to develop law enforcement capacity to deal with that.</p>

I know that the hon.

As far as those individuals who seek to use information technology to conceal evidence of their crimes are concerned, we should, necessarily, do as much as we can to leave them guessing.</p>

form, or to require disclosure of the means to access protected information or to make it intelligible, such as a key or a pass phrase.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o379"><a name="80131-0017.htm_para1"><a name="08013153001522">Parliament decided in 2000 that a penalty for failing to disclose information when required to do so should attract a maximum of two years&#146; imprisonment. In the Terrorism Act 2006, Parliament agreed that, where the disclosure requirement was necessary in the interests of national security, it was appropriate that the maximum penalty should be five years&#146; imprisonment. However, when the House debated the provisions of RIPA in 2000, the anticipation was that most individuals would routinely be encrypting data within four years. I am told that that did not happen. It is not necessarily happening in all cases yet.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o380"><a name="80131-0017.htm_para2"><a name="08013153001523">For the individual who wants to manage their own information security, rather than rely on professional help, many encryption products have remained awkward and cumbersome to use properly. Because of those difficulties, initially, the market take-up was limited. Correspondingly it was rare for investigators to come across suspects using encryption, whether properly or not. However, as the hon. Members for Mole Valley and for East Worthing and Shoreham have pointed out, the market has addressed those issues. There is a growing availability of easier-to-use encryption products. As the hon. Member for Mole Valley pointed out, that includes the advent of encryption products as integrated security features in standard operating systems aimed at home and small business users. That mass market adoption means, almost inevitably, that the use of information security technology by criminals to facilitate and conceal evidence of their unlawful conduct, so as to evade detection or prosecution, will increase.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o381"><a name="80131-0017.htm_para3"><a name="08013153001524">That is why the Government decided last year that the time had come to implement part 3 of RIPA. We undertook a consultation exercise on a code of practice for it, in which we explained that part 3 was not designed to undermine the security of financial institutions or the business of information security providers, or to criminalise people with bad memories who forget the passwords to their protected data. The same consultation also invited comments on amending section 53 of RIPA to extend the penalty for failing to comply with a disclosure requirement in cases related to offences involving indecent images of children.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o382"><a name="80131-0017.htm_para4"><a name="08013153001525">Only some respondents addressed that issue. Most respondents focused on the detail of the code of practice. There was support for amending section 53 and there were responses urging the Government to implement the provisions first and consider any evidence for amending them in the light of experience.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o383"><a name="80131-0017.htm_para5"><a name="08013153001526">The Government understand, and have always understood, the concern, clearly and frequently articulated by the hon. Gentleman, that a child sex abuser guilty of storing images of abuse, which they were responsible for creating or distributing, might refuse to comply with a disclosure requirement under part 3 of RIPA and readily accept a maximum two-year penalty, rather than comply with the requirement, disclose the images and render themselves liable to a maximum penalty of 10 years&#146; imprisonment. I understand the point made by the hon. Members for Mole Valley and for East Worthing   <br>

and Shoreham. I remain sympathetic to their concern, but before making any amendments, we want to assess how the provisions operate in practice. That is now taking place: the first disclosure notices are being prepared and served, and the first prosecutions for refusing to comply with a notice are being taken forward. However, before any prosecution takes place under existing penalties, complex issues of how to present evidence and explain how encryption technologies work will have to be addressed in court.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o384"><a name="80131-0017.htm_para6"><a name="08013153001527">The Government will consider amending the maximum penalty in criminal cases if there is evidence that the two-year penalty is not effective in cases that involve or are believed to involve indecent images of children. Such an amendment might include measures whereby a person guilty of failing to comply with a disclosure requirement would be liable to a term of imprisonment of more than two years if they had a previous conviction for an offence under section 1 of the Protection of Children Act 1978 or section 160 of the Criminal Justice Act 1988, or if the relevant protected information was contained in or with media containing indecent images.</p>

The three-year-old he mentioned requires the protection of the state and of the legislation for which we in Parliament are responsible. If we have a meeting to bring the relevant people together, we can discuss how to consider the legislation more effectively to see whether it requires amendment, and how best to take the issue forward. The hon.
