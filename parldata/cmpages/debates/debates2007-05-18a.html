 On a point of order, Madam Deputy Speaker. At this point in the day, is it in order to move a motion that the House do sit in private? It has been almost customary for an hon. Member to do so. Today, however, a large number of petitions are before the House. Will you rule on whether it is in order to move a motion that the House do sit in private when the next business is the presentation of petitions? It seems to me that the whole purpose of presenting a petition is that it is done in public, so the two Standing Orders are in conflict&#151;</p>

 On a point of order, Madam Deputy Speaker. On Wednesday, in response to a point of order from me regarding today&#146;s debate, Mr. Speaker said that everyone will get a voice in this Chamber, which is of course to be expected. Will there be a proper opportunity to debate fully the important issues addressed by the private Member&#146;s Bill that we are about to discuss, and which is of crucial importance to the standing of Parliament? You will have noticed, Madam Deputy Speaker, that a number of Ministers and Whips are present. That places us ordinary Back Benchers at a disadvantage&#151;</p>

That these hospitals provide excellent local healthcare for the very young to the very old and provide facilities for visiting specialists to deliver outpatient treatments and consultations. That the hospitals work well with the local general practitioners to provide an integrated healthcare service. That excellent care is provided for people suffering such illnesses as strokes at these locations which are accessible to the general public, and that local people look towards developing and expanding these centres or excellence, rather than their closure.</p>

 To finish the point about Deepcut, does my hon.

 I must not go too far along that line, Madam Deputy Speaker, or you will tell me off. Suffice it to say that the Freedom of Information Act is a flickering candle and I fear that if the Bill goes through it could be extinguished.</p>

 Before my hon. Friend moves on, may I express some concern about amendment No. 2? By deleting subsection (3), while retaining subsection (2), Parliament is made not to be a public body&#151;absurdly&#151;yet the converse does not apply for bodies that have a conversation, dialogue or correspondence with a Member of Parliament. The situation will be one-sided: a Member who writes to a body may be protected but the reverse would not be the case. If the amendment were accepted, would not that imbalance occur?</p>

 I have some sympathy for my hon. Friend&#146;s viewpoint. Let me make it plain: the best solution entirely would be that the Bill does not go through, because the current arrangements are working quite well and there is no need to change them. However, my hon. Friend and I, with others, are trying to find a way to accommodate the concerns that have been expressed. I have taken those concerns at face value and as genuine, and tried to find an amendment that would deal with them, but I re-emphasise that the best solution is not to have the Bill at all.</p>

 I will comment briefly on the group of amendments to which the hon. Member for Lewes (Norman Baker) spoke. I will be brief for a simple reason: the hon. Gentleman and several of his hon. Friends are quoted in the <i> Press Gazette </i>and other press reports as going all out to wreck the Bill. It is said that they intend to stop it and do not wish it to reach the other place.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o47"><a name="70518-0004.htm_para1"><a name="07051822000395">The hon. Gentleman takes the high-minded view, as is entirely his privilege, that if the Bill was passed, it would somehow strike a general blow to the Freedom of Information Act 2000, but I do not accept that argument. The amendments are deliberately intended not to improve the Bill, to make a few tweaks to it or to make it operate better, but to wreck and stop it. The delay in the No Lobby was further evidence of that. I think that the House will thus understand why I will not go into detail on any of the amendments, which I consider to be bogus.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o48"><a name="70518-0004.htm_para2"><a name="07051822000396">If we get to Third Reading, as I hope that we will, I will set out in slightly greater detail the reasons behind the Bill. However, at this stage it is suffice to say that I did not wake up one morning and suddenly decide that I must change the Freedom of Information Act. I have the honour and privilege of serving on the House of Commons Commission, along with senior colleagues from both sides of the House. I am aware of the growing problem of correspondence being released.</p>

Theoretically, it could be protected under data protection&#151;[Hon. Members: &#147;Legally!&#148;] But it has not been. An officer of a local authority&#151;inadvertently, by mistake or by design&#151;released correspondence that the hon. Member to whom I referred thought was confidential. That is damaging.

 The Minister says that the Government have taken a neutral stance on the Bill. Later, there will be opportunities to vote for amendments to the Bill. The amendment moved by the hon. Member for Lewes (Norman Baker) would remove the reference to the entirety of Members&#146; correspondence, not only the type of correspondence that has been the subject of debate&#151;correspondence about individual constituents. Alternative amendments offer an opportunity to exclude that type of private correspondence. Will the Minister enable the House to understand whether the Government might take the opportunity to support one of those alternative amendments, so that Members can be confident that confidential matters relating to their constituents will be protected, but that material on matters of public policy on which they correspond with public authorities will be available to be revealed in public&#151;something that all of us as Members of Parliament should be prepared to allow?</p>

 Is it not of some interest that the Information Commissioner&#146;s office stated that in nearly two and a half years since the Freedom of Information Act came into force, it had not received a single complaint from a Member of Parliament or from a constituent concerning the improper disclosure of such correspondence&#151;not a single complaint?

I cannot speak on behalf of other Members and say why they have not raised issues with the Information Commissioner. I know that some hon.

There is a tragic case in my constituency that I heard about only yesterday, in which information was disclosed to a husband who, it is alleged, commits domestic violence. I corresponded with a public authority on behalf of my constituent, and information in that correspondence was released to that husband. I now fear very much for my constituent&#146;s safety, and indeed for the safety of my constituency staff, as the husband has been to my constituency office. Hon.

of making it easier for public authorities to refuse requests for Members&#146; correspondence. In Committee, hon. Members agreed that there are occasions when it is right that such correspondence should enter the public domain&#151;I think that my hon.

It is important that the House is aware of that. Any request for information received by a public authority prior to the commencement of the Act, should the Bill ever become an Act, will be treated as though the Act were not in force. It would be for both Houses of Parliament to comply with freedom of information requests received up to the date of commencement. Amendment No. 26 would put a limit on the exemption, and that is inconsistent with the rest of the Freedom of Information Act 2000. It would unnecessarily complicate the operation of that Act.</p>

He did indeed serve on the Committee, and he made a valuable contribution to it. I feel a degree of proprietorship over the provisions of the 2000 Act. In many ways, it was not perfect, and we tried hard to make it stronger. Nevertheless, it fulfilled some of its objectives.

 Let us take the charitable view and suggest that the cases involved a properly constructed freedom of information request to a public authority, and that, for some reason, the bureaucrats involved had no idea what the law says, and were therefore prepared to provide information that they should not have provided, in contradiction to the laws that are already in place to give protection. Let us say that the information was put into the public domain in that way. If that is the case, it raises two important questions. First, was any action taken subsequent to the release of that material? Was it referred to the Information Commissioner? Was the public authority involved reminded of its duties under law? Was there any subsequent action? <i> [Interruption.]</i> The right hon. Member for Penrith and The Border says from a sedentary position, &#147;They just did it&#148;. Yes, and they will continue to just do it if his Bill is enacted, because somebody who is ignorant of the provisions of the Data Protection Act 1998 and of the Freedom of Information Act 2000 as it is currently constituted is just as likely to be ignorant of the provisions of his law.</p>

Subsection (2) has already been discussed, so we cannot revisit it. It removes the House of Commons and the House of Lords from schedule 1 of the Freedom of Information Act 2000. Schedule 1, which is the list of public authorities to which the Bill would apply, would be minus the House of Commons and the House of Lords which, as I said earlier, are an absurdity if they are not public authorities.</p>

perhaps he can return to it on Third Reading. For some reason, under subsection (2) the House of Lords would no longer be a public authority. It is arguable whether the House of Lords as currently constructed is a public authority, but it is the upper House of Parliament until it is reformed, and I would say that it is a public authority. It is exempted in subsection (2) but not mentioned in subsection (3), which relates only to communications with the House of Commons. Were one to accept the difficulties that the right hon. Gentleman raises, which I do not, one could argue for that difference on the basis that Members of the House of Commons have constituents and Members of the House of Lords do not, although they often take up cases on behalf of individuals.</p>

I was a county councillor for 12 years, and I used regularly to write to public authorities on behalf of my constituents. There is no difference in kind between a Member of the House of Commons and a county councillor, a district councillor, a parish councillor, a member of a community council or a member of a unitary authority.

Madam Deputy Speaker, I am happy to expand on the point. The Bill as it is currently drafted refers to what Members of Parliament do in that capacity. The meaning of those words is unclear.

 That is a cogent point, which we tackled in the Standing Committee that considered the original measure. Some of us argued that there should be a more objective test of the exempt material. However, Ministers told us that it had to be subjective and at the discretion of the public authority and, subsequently, of the Information Commissioner. That is why the Under-Secretary&#146;s response to the amendments is so perplexing because she turned that argument on its head and said that the position that I described is no longer the Government&#146;s. She said that they no longer expect that extent of subjectivity, which was prayed in aid by the Solicitor-General, who was then Minister of State at the Home Office, and Mr. David Lock, who was then Solicitor-General.</p>

Of course, the House of Commons Library might not have details of some of the problems that Members have experienced, but I am aware of many of them and I referred to one today. I have also been informed by other Members of problems that they have encountered when correspondence that they have written in confidence on behalf of a constituent to a public authority has been released on the say-so of someone else. Theoretically, if the law is to work properly, when a third party attempts to access a file containing a letter from a Member of Parliament to a public authority, an officer of the public authority should consult the Member and should look at the file, and then should make a decision on whether it should be released. If it contains personal information, the officer of the authority should invoke the Data Protection Act 1998 and should not release it. There are an awful lot of &#147;shoulds&#148;&#151;there are a lot of things that should happen&#151;but unfortunately I have come across cases when they have not happened.</p>

It is not good enough to say, &#147;Well, if the current law is not working, how will this one improve it?&#148; If my Bill is scrutinised in the other place and is enacted, I hope that we will be able to circulate the news to all public authorities that correspondence with a Member of Parliament relating to a constituency matter is now sacrosanct. Therefore, if Members wish to release correspondence, we make that decision. I am perfectly content for Members of Parliament to decide to press  <br>

 Let me conclude this point. Such concerns were stated in Committee, not by me or other Conservatives but by Labour Members and also by the Liberal Democrat Committee member. Let me say this about that Member: he is a very honourable Member and he is also a member of the House of Commons Commission. As the Liberal Democrat Member who served on the Committee&#151;which was unanimous in its opinion on the Bill&#151;is also a member of the House of Commons Commission, I say to his Liberal Democrat colleagues that it is clear that he has information that most Members of this House are not party to. I consider his opinions and views on the matter under discussion to be decisive.</p>

 Let me make a final point before taking any interventions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o85"><a name="70518-0007.htm_para9"><a name="07051822001064">We must make decisions about the sanctity of our correspondence on behalf of constituents with public authorities. We have to be able to look constituents in the eye when they come to us about tax credit cases, Child Support Agency cases or their dealings with the police or the council. We must be able to say to them, &#147;I will take up that case on your behalf and pass on your letter or write on your behalf and I guarantee that that will not be released.&#148; We cannot at present give that guarantee. The procedures in place allow someone else to make that judgment. If they make an erroneous judgment, that damages us. I shall now give way to the hon. Member for Slough (Fiona Mactaggart).</p>

<p><a name="st_o232"><a name="07051822001065"><a name="70518-0007.htm_spnew12"><a name="07051822002638"><b>Fiona Mactaggart:</b>
 The point I wished to intervene on was that the right hon. Gentleman referred to the amount of amendments that had been tabled and said that that was part of a movement to oppose the entire Bill. Does he accept that one of the reasons for that is his failure to justify his Bill? He has not spoken in favour of it until now.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o86"><a name="70518-0007.htm_para10"><a name="07051822001066">Also, the point that the right hon. Gentleman is now making would have been covered by an amendment which he has voted against. The issue on which he is depending is that the Bill is required in order to protect correspondence about individual constituents, but he voted against an amendment which narrowed the protection precisely to that point, and which stopped the protection in his Bill in respect of much wider areas of correspondence. Will he use the opportunity of this Third Reading speech to justify that?</p>

 We all know that Third Reading debates are narrowly curtailed, and I cannot return to amendments that were dealt with hours ago. I point out to the hon.

I suspect that there are some colleagues in the House today with a guilty conscience who are trying to pad out the Bill because they were negligent in not opposing it on Second Reading. It could easily have been stopped on Second Reading if any Member had wanted to do so, but it got an unopposed Second Reading and unanimous support in Committee upstairs.

 Not yet. Please let me finish my sentence, because this is a very important point. The main, ill-informed criticism that I have received from outside, including from the media&#151;egged on by some hon. Members&#151;has been about expenses. Mr. Speaker, as Chairman of the Members Estimate Committee, has made it crystal clear that we will continue to publishin October or thereabouts the totals for modes of transport such as bicycles, cars, planes and trains;that we will continue to publish the totals for the incidental expenses allowance, the new communications allowance, allowances for secretarial matters and administration, and the additional costs allowance. I do not wish to cast aspersions on the hon.

Through his Bill, he would be changing the Freedom of Information Act 2000 so that we are exempt and do not in law have to publish such things. The fact that we have an assurance from the current Speaker that he will continue with publication is irrelevant. It is not right that we should set ourselves above the law, saying that out of courtesy we publish such things, but the law does not require us to do so. The right hon.

<p><a name="stpa_o96"><a name="70518-0008.htm_para2"><a name="07051822001102">There were years of thinking behind the Freedom of Information Act. We were one of the last democracies to introduce such legislation and for years, through the late 1980s and the 1990s, we looked at legislation in Australia, New Zealand, Canada and the United States and learned from it. In 1993, I introduced the Right to Know Bill, which was based on best practice in other countries at the time. If a Labour Government had been elected in 1992, the then shadow Home Secretary&#151;now Lord Hattersley&#151;would have introduced legislation but, like the right hon. Member for Penrith and The Border (David Maclean), I was lucky enough to be able to promote a private Member&#146;s Bill and picked up the measure that the then shadow Home Secretary had drafted. We had the help of the Campaign for Freedom of Information and Mr. Maurice Frankel, and other experts on the subject, who had studied freedom of information measures all over the world, in producing a state of the art Bill. It had commitment and support from the then leader of the Labour party, Neil, now Lord, Kinnock and, subsequently, the passionate support of the next leader of the Labour party, John Smith.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o97"><a name="70518-0008.htm_para3"><a name="07051822001103">Labour was committed to introducing freedom of information legislation in the event of its forming a Government. I was thrilled when we became a Government and the Prime Minister said that we would go ahead. He set up a Cabinet Sub-Committee, of which I was honoured to be member, to examine how we would change the good thinking in the Right to Know Bill and all the work that had been done around the world into a White Paper, in preparation for an Act of Parliament.</p>

 May I just respond to the point, because it think that it would be courteous to the right hon. Gentleman to do so? I am sure that the Minister will confirm that the present Leader of House, the then Home Secretary, thought about this very carefully indeed. As he says himself, he was in two minds and wondered whether or not to include Parliament. He reached the conclusion that Parliament should be included&#151;it was his Bill. He was the Cabinet Minister who saw that Bill through, so he had given plenty of careful consideration to exactly the point raised by the right hon. Member for Penrith and The Border. Of his own volition, the present Leader of the House admits that the decision was not easy and that he was in two minds at certain times.</p>

Member for Penrith and The Border is. However, he makes the wider point that Parliaments handle freedom of information in different ways. Some freedom of information legislation covers parliamentarians, while some does not. It is a matter for each Parliament to decide. However, we have found another way. All the exemptions that worry the right hon. Gentleman are covered by the Data Protection Act 1998. The way in which the two Acts of Parliament lock together like a jigsaw ensures that the sorts of problems that the right hon. Gentleman is worried about are not real.</p>

 My hon. Friend is absolutely right. The right hon. Member for Penrith and The Border is addressing the sensitivities and shyness of parliamentarians about their correspondence, expenses and information. I do not know how much he has studied such legislation throughout the world, but I do not think he understands what an enormously dramatic thing he is doing and how completely he is undermining existing legislation. As my hon. Friend the Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, Central (Jim Cousins) suggests, the Freedom of Information Act 2000 goes wider than the issue that the right hon. Member for Penrith and The Border is addressing, yet much of it must go through the conduit of parliamentarians. If we are exempt, the whole Act, to the extent to which it comes through parliamentarians, is affected. Ultimately, whom else should it come through? We are the ultimate democratic body, and it is through us that people should test, argue about and explore matters of public policy and concern.</p>

Member for Penrith and The Border, but I do not think that he understands what a devastating Bill this is. As he said in his few remarks, these are difficult areas. The way in which the legislation is applied to public bodies is inconsistent. The Act has been in force for only two and a half years and people are uncertain about its application. The problems that he has brought to the attention of the House arise through the ignorance of individual officials and a lack of understanding. He is right to say that those problems have to be addressed, but not by changing the law. If we change the law and exempt ourselves, we are saying to all the other bodies that we have no confidence in the law. Those bodies will ask why on earth they should trouble themselves with freedom of information legislation if Parliament, which passed the Act in the first place, does not takeit seriously. Trade unions, health trusts and chief constables will ask why they should bother when Parliament does not think that it is worth reporting these things.</p>

 We have been told that the House gave no consideration to whether it should be covered as a public body by the 2000 Act. Pre-legislative scrutiny was carried out by this House&#146;s Public Administration Committee and the House of Lords. That point was considered, and it was on the basis of those considerations that the then Home Secretary included such a measure in the Bill. We had a full opportunity, albeit with some guillotines, to pursue the issue on the Floor of the House. There were many days&#146; debate, yet no one tabled an amendment on the matter.

The primacy of data protection has always been the essential element in public bodies&#146; responses to their requests.

He has gained plaudits from everybody. He has integrity, he is tough and he is extremely knowledgeable, yet his office has received none of the complaints or queries that the right hon.

Those concerns are a different but added way in which the Bill, and the manner in which it has been handled, will bring Parliament into complete disrepute and discredit. We ought to be ashamed of ourselves today, and anybody who votes for the Bill ought to be ashamed of themselves. Once again, we will have to throw ourselves on the mercy of the other place and hope that it has the good sense to throw out this discreditable and squalid little Bill.</p>

 I shall speak against the Bill and argue that the House should reject it on Third Reading. I have no complaint against the right hon. Member for Penrith and The Border (David Maclean), or the fact that he introduced the Bill. I have been in the House marginally longer than he has, although we may both feel that we have been here almost exactly the same time. I understand why he introduced the Bill, but both major parts of it are fundamentally misguided and unjustified. I shall seek to deal with the points that he made in his two brief contributions, and the points that were made in the one hour in Committee.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o108"><a name="70518-0009.htm_para2"><a name="07051822001147">I believe that the Bill was prompted by two things.

about that. There were cases that challenged the decisions of the House authorities to be restrictive. The Speaker, the House of Commons Commission and others eventually decided that there would be internal rules requiring us to disclose our travel expenses and so on. That was all to the good, but it was a response to public pressure. Even today&#151;my hon. Friends from Scotland will correct me if I am wrong&#151;we are not subject to nearly as rigorous a discipline as are colleagues in the Scottish Parliament, for example, who legislated two years after we did. We legislated in 2000 and they in 2002.</p>

 The freedom of information legislation in Scotland is seen as an exemplar both in the time allowed&#151;information must be disclosed far more promptly&#151;and in the level of scrutiny. Some Members of the House might be uncomfortable with the level of scrutiny that Members of the Scottish Parliament undertake. Every expense receipt is published online within a month of being submitted. That has led to an increased feeling among people in Scotland that they can see what their parliamentarians are doing, and that can only help to build trust in politics. Unfortunately, this Bill will help to diminish trust in politics.</p>

 I share that view. It was realised that there were proper limits to what people should be entitled to know. An example, now much quoted, given by my hon. Friend the Member for North Devon (Nick Harvey) in Committee, was that people should not be entitled to know, just because we are MPs, how many bedrooms we have in our houses, who sleeps in which bedroom, or how much we spent on the kitchen extension in our private residence. There are proper limits, but it is not proper to bar people from knowing how much public money we claim to travel between the House and our constituencies, and similar information.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o109"><a name="70518-0009.htm_para3"><a name="07051822001150">The right hon. Member for Penrith and The Border agrees with that. The difficulty with his case, which he understands, is that by proposing that the Commons and the Lords be taken out of the scope of the legislation the Bill would make the disclosure of such information entirely voluntary in both Houses. We alone would decide what we disclosed, and be subject to no external monitoring.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o110"><a name="70518-0009.htm_para4"><a name="07051822001151">There are places in the world where that position is taken. There is a debate going on in New Zealand about that very issue. It is strongly argued that the New Zealand Parliament should do as we are doing by keeping the present position and not changing it to exempt Parliament from that arrangement. There is no doubt about the fact that there would be a regime in place, but the difficulty with the argument put by the right hon. Gentleman and those who support the Bill is that it is impossible to say that we should be trusted to look after ourselves, but that councils, the Welsh Assembly, the armed services and all other public agencies cannot be trusted.</p>

Gentleman&#146;s difficulty. He says that because we are Parliament, we should be subject to a different regime. The good words of Parliament will not persuade the public, and reversing, on the basis of no serious consideration, a step that we took only two and a half years ago will in no way enhance our credibility.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o112"><a name="70518-0009.htm_para6"><a name="07051822001153">I want to pick up a point made by the hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent, Central (Mark Fisher). It is right to say, as the right hon. Member for Penrith and The Border argued, that when the Bill first came to Parliament it was not intended that the Commons and the Lords should be included, but one of our Select Committees came strongly to the view that we should be included. It recommended that to the Labour Government of the day, and the then Home Secretary, who is now Leader of the House, accepted it. The reason why the proposal was not significantly debated was that it commanded support across the Committee, after due scrutiny, and from the Government, after due consideration.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o113"><a name="70518-0009.htm_para7"><a name="07051822001154">The Government now say that they are neutral. There are reports in the press that there are strong divergences of view in the Government. It is suggested that the Lord Chancellor, the head of the Ministry of Justice, has one view, and that other people have another; I know not. There has been no scrutiny and no chance for either House to consider these issues in a Committee. There is a case for doing so. I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for North Devon and others, who have said that there is a debate to be had.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o114"><a name="70518-0009.htm_para8"><a name="07051822001155">Had those of us who were here spotted the Bill on the day that it was first listed on the Order Paper, and had we thought that it would not be opposed by the Government Whips, who usually oppose Back-Bench Bills almost without exception, particularly those that are not introduced by members of their party, we would of course have objected to it at that stage. However, the fact that we did not have that opportunity for debate does not make up for the fact that no Committee has been looking at it&#151;</p>

 May I draw the hon. Gentleman&#146;s attention to an amendment moved in Committee by the right hon. Member for Penrith and The Border, which would put the exemption in the context of section 34 of the 2000 Act, which refers to parliamentary privilege? Does he think that the exercise of the public interest override, which will continue to exist, would be severely inhibited by the co-location of the exemption with the concept of parliamentary privilege?</p>

 I am concerned about that. The substance of the Bill, although simple in its two propositions, touches on some complex legislation. Everybody accepts that the interrelationship of the Data Protection Act 1998 and the 2000 Act is not entirely straightforward. We therefore need careful responses rather than draconian and simplistic ones.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o115"><a name="70518-0009.htm_para9"><a name="07051822001160">The Bill says that from now on we should have a voluntary regime, while everybody else should have a compulsory regime. That is not justified, given that there has been no serious consideration. There has been no opportunity for colleagues to give evidence. There has been no attempt by the right hon. Member for Penrith and The Border or others to collect people&#146;s views. Different views were expressed in the Committee. My hon. Friend the Member for North Devon made it clear that he recognised the concerns about the Bill, but he did not endorse or oppose it, and expressly stated that he was not speaking for the Front Bench. We should deliberate about those concerns in an intelligent and considered way.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o116"><a name="70518-0009.htm_para10"><a name="07051822001161">People can still find it difficult to get information about non-controversial matters, even under the current legislation. I had an e-mail from somebody at a university in the United Kingdom saying that they were finding it difficult to get information about the public and ceremonial role and activities of Speakers for their academic research. If that difficulty exists, we need to examine the problem and ascertain the reason for such difficulty in obtaining information that should not be controversial. That includes not only information about expenses and travel, but anything to do with this place. If we exempt the Commons and the Lords, that means everything to do with our work here. It means the business of all the House Committees, all the functions of the staff and all the things that might be more controversial, such as how we spend public money on the buildings, various improvements and IT systems. All that would suddenly become subject only to voluntary disclosure. That is a serious problem.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o117"><a name="70518-0009.htm_para11"><a name="07051822001162">My next point is important for the outside listeners, viewers and followers of our debates. Members of Parliament are not subject to freedom of information legislation. Our correspondence is secret. If people come to see us as Members of Parliament, we are not public bodies but individual representatives. There is no risk of our releasing that information. We all have on our correspondence something that states that we are acting for people confidentially, and that we hope they will agree that the information occasionally has to be shared with staff and perhaps others in order to help them. People are asked to let us know if there is any difficulty with that. I always offer people the chance to understand. We are not at risk of having information forced out of our offices. The problem is whether information is at risk of falling out of a public authority&#146;s offices, because the current law does not cover that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o118"><a name="70518-0009.htm_para12"><a name="07051822001163">I therefore want to deal with the proper concerns that the right hon.

Member for Keighley (Mrs. Cryer) on the radio this morning&#151;but according to everything that I have heard and seen, they are not based on evidence of a genuine problem. There is theoretically a problem, but no evidence that problems have arisen.</p>

 I understand and accept the distinction, and the right hon. Gentleman makes an important point. I am happy to meet him and see any examples that he or other colleagues want to show me. I have not seen any examples of a problem in the two and a half years since the Act has been in force. Moreover, there are many examples of decisions whereby section 40(2) of the Freedom of Information Act, which covers exemption of personal information, applies. That is relevant to the material examples with which the right hon. Gentleman, my hon. Friends and I deal every day of every week in constituency cases.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o119"><a name="70518-0009.htm_para13"><a name="07051822001168">Let me give some examples. The names of people who signed a petition to a local authority about an allegedly undesirable tenant were not allowed to be released under the current regime. The name of an informant who notified a local authority of a potential breach of planning requirements in somebody else&#146;s property was not allowed to be released. Those are rulings; I am not inventing them. The cases have been tested and the information has been found to be exempt.</p>

This morning, the hon. Member for Keighley said that she would not want information that she shared about forced marriages to be revealed. That is right&#151;and it would not be revealed under current legislation. I understand her fear, but she is safe. Unless somebody incorrectly judges the law or acts illegally, all her constituents about whom she corresponds on that issue are safe.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o121"><a name="70518-0009.htm_para15"><a name="07051822001170">Information about the age, length of service and pay scale position of council employees who take voluntary retirement, which, even though the individuals are not named, could allow their identities to be deduced, was not allowed to be released. Then there is information about a pupil referred to in minutes concerning a disciplinary hearing against a teacher&#151;again, not allowed, even though the teacher had been willing for their name to be revealed. The names of members of the public responding to a public consultation exercise about a right of way&#151;again, not allowed. All the evidence of where the law has been tested comes down on the other side of the argument about whether we need change.</p>

That is a potentially public document in the sense that it involves a public campaign to help to release someone who is not being looked after properly by a foreign Government. I received a letter from the Secretary of State for Health in reply to a letter I wrote about the future of the 24-hour emergency clinic at the Maudsley hospital. That is, quite rightly, regarded as in the public domain. I wrote to ask the Secretary of State to defer the closure and she replied with her reasons why she would not. That should not be a secret. I had some correspondence with the Minister who is currently in her place on the Front Bench, about boundary changes in my constituency. Again, that is properly a public matter.

Those are entirely different. Everyone here would defend to the utmost the right of the public to know what we say about public policy. The arguments that we put on public policy and the replies that we get from the Government about them are perfectly proper matters for the public to know about. However, we would also defend the current legislative arrangements, under which inquiries connected with people&#146;s personal circumstances are not public property.</p>

 That is a concern. There are some other good examples of why we should not change the system. The Irish legislated in 1997; they now have very good freedom of information and data protection legislation that works extremely well. This Bill would mean a move back from such standards. The South Africans have a very open regime under their new constitution. The Indians too have a very open regime. The New Zealanders are debating at the moment whether to move in the direction of our present legislation, rather than away from it.

 The case that the right hon. Member for Penrith and The Border (David Maclean) seems to be putting is that if a letter is written by a Member of Parliament to a public authority official, that official might release the letter by mistake, but that if the Bill were passed, the official would know not to do that.

and a huge number of documents and regulations, have been produced to assist everybody to behave better in this matter.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o129"><a name="70518-0010.htm_para4"><a name="07051822001188">Although we passed the Freedom of Information Act in 2000, it took five years to come into force, and in 1998 we passed the Data Protection Act. To put it simplistically, the Data Protection Act deals with how we access our own information, and the Freedom of Information Act deals with how we access information about others. Clause 2 of the Data Protection Act defines sensitive personal data as,</p>
<a name="70518-0010.htm_brev0"><a name="07051822001671"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;the racial or ethnic origin of the data subject...his political opinions...his religious beliefs or other beliefs...whether he is a member of a trade union...physical or mental health or condition...sexual life... commission or alleged commission by him of any offence, or...proceedings for any offence&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o130"><a name="70518-0010.htm_para5"><a name="07051822001189">Therefore, some things were made sacrosanct from the beginning.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o131"><a name="70518-0010.htm_para6"><a name="07051822001190">As I said in my intervention on my hon. Friend the Member for Lewes (Norman Baker)&#151; this also relates to the point made by the hon. Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, Central (Jim Cousins) about parliamentary privilege&#151;sections 21 to 44 of the Freedom of Information Act provide exemptions anyway, some qualified and some not. Those are provided for all sorts of reasons: law enforcement; investigations and proceedings conducted by public authorities; prejudice to effective conduct of public affairs; health and safety; personal information; commercial interests; and, expressly, information provided in confidence. Some Members pushed for wider freedom of information, but, ultimately, there were lots of exemptions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o132"><a name="70518-0010.htm_para7"><a name="07051822001191">As my hon. Friend the Member for Twickenham (Dr. Cable) reminded the House, we also passed the Data Protection (Processing Of Sensitive Personal Data) (Elected Representatives) Order 2002, under which Members of Parliament who write to authorities do not have to have express consent, because the implication is that people who come to see us and ask for help give their consent in doing so. That has made life easier.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o133"><a name="70518-0010.htm_para8"><a name="07051822001192">Therefore, only five years ago we moved in the direction of providing more security to the protected route. Since then, we have had the Information Commissioner&#146;s guidelines in 2004, the Department for Constitutional Affairs code of practice in November 2004, advice for Members&#146; offices in this place in April 2005, a House of Commons standard note on freedom of information requests in June 2005, a House of Commons freedom of information note in November 2005, the Information Commissioner&#146;s Office&#146;s &#147;Freedom of Information Awareness Guidance&#148;&#151;Nos. 1, 2 and 13&#151;in 2006 and 2007, and a further note from the House of Commons. So much guidance has been given to authorities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o134"><a name="70518-0010.htm_para9"><a name="07051822001193">To deal with the concerns of the right hon. Member for Penrith and The Border, any authority or organisation can find guidance as to what they need to do on the Information Commissioner&#146;s Office website. There are also two sanctions. First, if judgment is incorrectly exercised, it can be challenged&#151;although of course, that is not as good as its not having been incorrectly exercised. Secondly, if people break the law they can be prosecuted, and the Information Commissioner willdo that.</p>

We should say no to the Bill, because it is an overreaction to a set of issues that have either not been addressed or not been evidenced. If the House of Commons Commission has continuing concerns, it should ask an appropriate cross-party Committee to consider the matter, and a deliberative exercise should take place in which the Information Commissioner is asked to give evidence, colleagues can give evidence and the public can give evidence too.</p>

 This has been a fascinating debate, although I doubt that many minds have been changed today&#151;or, indeed, in our last debate on the Floor of the House some weeks ago, or in Committee.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o138"><a name="70518-0010.htm_para13"><a name="07051822001198">The Government introduced the Freedom of Information Act 2000 to create a more open relationship between the citizen and the state. The Select Committee on Constitutional Affairs hailed the Act as a significant success. We can see for ourselves that freedom of information requests have resulted in the release of information of real value to the public on such topics as operation success rates, the results of restaurant hygiene inspections, the living conditions of animals in zoos, and even the recipients of common agricultural policy payments. That increase in the flow of information from public authorities should, I believe, be seen as one of the most important reforms introduced by the Government, and a fundamental change in the culture of the country.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o139"><a name="70518-0010.htm_para14"><a name="07051822001199">Information that is currently released by the Houses of Parliament under their publication schemes will continue to be released even if the Bill is enacted.

It was designed to help the public, not to disrupt the valuable work that Members of Parliament undertake on the public&#146;s behalf.</p>

 The Minister has explained that the Government are neutral, and I do not doubt her own sincerity&#151;she has not voted on the Bill.

In other words, if a Bill were introduced that said that councillors&#146; correspondence should be exempt or all health service correspondence should be exempt, would the Government also be neutral?</p>

 My hon. Friend makes a good point, and similar examples have been referred to earlier. It is for Members to decide whether the Bill would give the certainty that my hon. Friend is looking for, or if there are sufficient obstacles in the current legislation to prevent information from being released. That is a decision that Parliament must make. It is entirely up to individual Members of this House to decide, on balance, which of those two things would improve the Act and their ability to represent their constituents. The Government obviously recognise the right to privacy that constituents deserve. I suppose that those advocating this Bill would say that it is about protecting not Members of Parliament but their constituents. If information is exempt from release under the Act, it should not be released; there are already exemptions to protect such information.</p>

 I am very grateful to the Minister for giving way. Will she concede that the Bill is not confined solely to correspondence? It goes much wider than that and is not solely about protecting correspondence or the identity of our constituents&#151;assuming that that is the right way to go about doing so, instead of using the Data Protection Act 1998. The Bill covers all sorts of correspondence and does not address the particular point that was raised. I am sure that she will confirm that, given her knowledge of the Bill.</p>

 My hon. Friend is right, but of course, the exemption in the Bill is a qualified one. The Bill does cover other areas, including expenses, although I have no huge problem with that. I am not party to those expenses, so it does not affect me; however, that is a personal issue.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o146"><a name="70518-0010.htm_para21"><a name="07051822001218">Where it would be unfair to release personal data, they are exempt; where information is provided in confidence, it is exempt. However, those are legal tests. The exemption in proposed new section 34A would cover MPs&#146; correspondence as a class of information&#151;the point that my hon. Friend the Member for Stoke-on-Trent, Central (Mark Fisher) made a moment ago. It is therefore entirely right for Parliament to discuss whether the current protections are enough and whether the proposed exemption is necessary.</p>

The Freedom of Information Act 2000 should not inhibit the flow of the information that is so valuable in our modern society, and I would not want our constituents to feel that they cannot ask their elected representatives for help. The Government recognise, however, that this issue is clearly of concern to many Members&#151;hence so many being here on a Friday&#151;so it is right that the House debate it and those concerns be addressed.

 This has been a very interesting debate and let me say at the outset that the Conservative party remains neutral on this Bill.

If the Bill is passed, the intention of the Bill will need to be carefully explained to the public. It could also be pointed out, however, that should the Bill fail, MPs will not have the right to stop FOI requests made against public bodies when MPs have written to local authorities on their constituents&#146; behalf. Ultimately it will still be the public authority and not the MP who would in law have the right to decide whether the information was released. There is no guarantee built into the law, only guidelines, to ensure that the public authority would inform the MP.</p>

 On the subject of guidelines, has my hon. Friend seen the four pages of detailed guidelines relating to the handling of MPs&#146; correspondence? They are so woolly that it is as if they were written by 10 QCs on different sides of the argument.

not think that the information tribunal&#146;s decision on16 January 2007, confined as it was to Members&#146; travel allowances, need prevent us from action here. It would, however, have been helpful if the Information Commissioner had gone further and expressed the interrelationship between freedom of information and data protection in wider terms than he did in his judgment, not least because it would have prevented much of the existing confusion about MPs&#146; staffing arrangements and data protection issues. In the meantime, the Information Commissioner seems to be waiting for the result of this Bill before issuing clearer guidelines.</p>

A certificate was issued by the Speaker under section 36(6) of the Freedom of Information Act to stop the information being given.

 I completely agree.

The hon.

Member for Penrith and The Border, I should say that no constituent of mine has ever complained that information that they have given me as the Member of Parliament has gone into the public domain. The public will reach only one conclusion: that we have something to hide. That is why we are doing ourselves a disservice.

 I apologise to the hon. Member for Walsall, North (Mr. Winnick); at that very moment, I was berating my Front-Bench spokesman. I echo what has been almost the universal theme of this House: this is a dreadful Bill. It arose out of the Commission losing a case&#151;that is what this is about.

But it is not, and the catch-all&#151;the whole purpose of this&#151;is to remove this place as an accountable body within the terms of the statute.

The legislation has been in force for only 30 months, and, as yet, the Government have done no review of its workings and they have not identified any weaknesses in it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o164"><a name="70518-0011.htm_para15"><a name="07051822001251">We come on to the purported reason that is given for this Bill: that we are vulnerable in the correspondence that we, as Members of Parliament, have with public authorities. It has been laid before this House more than adequately&#151;that is certainly not what happened in the processes that took us to this Third Reading&#151;whereby the arguments could be examined and tested, and proper evidence adduced. However, none has been. We have had relayed conversations and we have seen a wafted, redacted page in front of us. Who redacted what? Was it the public authority removing the personal details of an individual? Or did Members of Parliament fear that coming into the Chamber they might drop something and someone else would have knowledge of a constituent? I am trying to argue that the fear is not reasonable.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o165"><a name="70518-0011.htm_para16"><a name="07051822001252">The Bill will be perceived as the House of Commons&#151;and, stuck in with us, the House of Lords&#151;looking to its personal interests. What are its personal interests? They are, no less, the administration of the House of Commons, and its expenses and costs. The point has been well made that that is public expenditure. The Bill will also cover our proper personal claims. Those are public moneys raised through taxation. I argue that no citizen in this country is not entitled to know those sums being paid by the people. That is a matter of principle, not just an argument of politics. The House is misjudging the situation if it thinks that the political judgment of excluding itself from the Freedom of Information Act is clever. The press will itemise and examine Members of Parliament.</p>

In truth, many Members of Parliament fear the revelation not of the personal details of an individual constituent&#151;we have seen no evidence to suggest that that is a legitimate fear&#151;but of the comments that they themselves make in a document. A Member might say, &#147;I know that there is a road coming through my constituency and I think that it is a good idea, but my constituents might not think that. I want my personal opinion on this matter to be weighed, but not available to those whom we represent and whom elect us.&#148; In the 18th century, it was ghastly to think that the mere vulgar public beyond the House of Commons should know the arguments of Parliament and the reasons behind its deliberations.

<p><a name="st_o351"><a name="07051822001553"><a name="70518-0012.htm_spnew2"><a name="07051822003025"><b>Mr. Barry Sheerman (Huddersfield) (Lab/Co-op):</b>
 I beg to move, That the Bill be now read a Second time.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o177"><a name="70518-0012.htm_para3"><a name="07051822001554">In the short time available, I shall provide a quick profile of the Bill. It is a modest Bill, but it will make a tremendous difference to many young people leaving school at 16. There is already the Children Act 1989 and we also have &#147;Every Child Matters&#148;, which deals with five major outcomes for children. However, we still live in a country and society in which those outcomes seem to desert children at 16. We seem not to care very much about what happens to some children at 16. Many of them become NEETs&#151;not in education, employment or training&#151;and some go into routine, mundane jobs that have no training attached to them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o178"><a name="70518-0012.htm_para4"><a name="07051822001555">My Bill is in four parts. First, I believe that every child leaving school should have a guarantee of an holistic assessment of their time in education. That should involve not only the bare academic qualifications that they have gained&#151;or not gained&#151;but something much deeper and richer involving their strengths and weaknesses and their out-of-school activities, to give a fuller sense of what the person has achieved as well as what they might be able to achieve if they make the right decisions about their career. Such assessments should already be taking place in most schools through the Connexions service, but in many parts of the country that service does not deliver. Connexions is going through a time of change, and soon it will again be run by local authorities. This is therefore an opportune time to ensure that every child leaving school has the right to a profile and an holistic assessment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o179"><a name="70518-0012.htm_para5"><a name="07051822001556">Secondly, my Bill proposes a guarantee of a mentor for every child between the age of 16 and 18. That mentor would be there for the young person either via the internet or through face-to-face meetings. If the young person did not have the family backing that many children have, the mentor would be there to give advice and guidance at those critical times when a child must decide whether to stay on at school and do A-levels, go into further education or go in for an apprenticeship. That is the time when a mentor can be vital, particularly in the lives of children who do not have a rich backing at home.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o180"><a name="70518-0012.htm_para6"><a name="07051822001557">Thirdly, my Bill would introduce vital guarantees for children with special educational needs and disabilities. When the Select Committee on Education and Skills, which I have the privilege to chair, recently investigated special educational needs the area that gave me the most concern was what happens to children with special educational needs and disabilities from the age of 16 through to 18 and beyond. My Bill will help those between 16 and 18, but of course that experience can be built on thereafter.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o181"><a name="70518-0012.htm_para7"><a name="07051822001558">Lastly, my Bill would deliver for every young person between 16 and 18 a minimum of two weeks&#146; intensive training in community leadership. I do not mean picking up newspapers and wiping off graffiti; I mean training in leadership skills. We know how to impart such skills, and we know that an intensive two-week period of community leadership training can make a  <br>

great deal of difference to getting young people into work, and into work with training.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o182"><a name="70518-0012.htm_para8"><a name="07051822001559">This is a modest Bill. I am sure that any Government who want to ensure a fuller life for young people would want to back it. I am sure that the Minister will say that he backs it, and that the new Prime Minister would like to embrace it because he really wants to make a difference in our country.</p>

 My hon. Friend the Member for Huddersfield (Mr. Sheerman) has put across the real qualities of his Bill very well in those four minutes. He will be aware, however, that the Government have a number of measures in train at the moment, not least the recent Green Paper &#147;Raising Expectations: staying in education and training post-16&#148;. I know that he welcomes the measures in that Green Paper.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o183"><a name="70518-0012.htm_para9"><a name="07051822001561">My hon. Friend also mentioned his focus on children with special educational needs. He and I have had many a debate, here in the Chamber and in Westminster Hall, on that issue, and I respect the work that he and his Committee have done on it. I am sure that we will continue to have a good, full dialogue on the matter.</p>

 I am grateful to Mr. Speaker for selecting this subject, and to the Minister for Trade for attending. I greatly appreciate his interest, and the way in which he always engages constructively with Members throughout the House. I say that most sincerely.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o205"><a name="70518-0012.htm_para31"><a name="07051822001593">The debate was prompted by the sudden appearance on the radar of the uncertain future of the Borough High Street post office in the London borough of Southwark, in my constituency. I received a letter about it, dated 19 April this year, from Alan Cook, managing director of Post Office Ltd, setting out the general plans as they affect Crown post offices across the country.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o206"><a name="70518-0012.htm_para32"><a name="07051822001594">I stress that this is separate from the decision announced this week by the Secretary of State for trade and Industry, to which my hon. Friend the Member for Richmond Park (Susan Kramer) responded on behalf of my colleagues and myself. That decision related to the general outcome of the review of post offices across the country. Within a matter of weeks it has been announced that many Crown post offices in greater London are to be franchised to WH Smith, and that others&#151;including the Borough High Street branch&#151;face an uncertain future. Then, this week, it was announced that thousands of other sub-post offices around the country would be similarly affected.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o207"><a name="70518-0012.htm_para33"><a name="07051822001595">The proposal that came to us first&#151;the London proposal&#151;stated:</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o214"><a name="70518-0013.htm_para3"><a name="07051822001602">I am grateful that colleagues representing other London constituencies are present, and in order to be fair I want to list the affected London offices, as the issue is broader than just a Southwark issue. According to my calculations, 16 Crown offices in 13 London boroughs are being told that they will be relocated in nearby WH Smith stores. I should add that the first six offices that went through a period of consultation did not include any Greater London ones, but the remaining 64 are subject to consultation between April and July.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o215"><a name="70518-0013.htm_para4"><a name="07051822001603">The following offices in London will be affected:in Bexley, the Crown post office in Bexleyheath;in Bromley, the Bromley Crown post office; in Westminster, the Charing Cross post office and the Oxford Street/Poland Street Crown post office; in Newham, the East Ham Crown post office; in Lewisham, the Forest Hill and the Lewisham post offices; in Hammersmith and Fulham, the Fulham Crown post office; in Hillingdon, the Hayes and the Uxbridge Crown post offices; in Hounslow, the Hounslow Crown post office; in Redbridge, the Ilford Crown post office; in Richmond, the Richmond Crown post office; in Lambeth, the Streatham Crown post office; in Waltham Forest, the Waltham Cross Crown post office; and in Greenwich, the Woolwich Crown post office. I am grateful to my colleagues the hon. Member for Bromley and Chislehurst (Robert Neill) and my hon. Friend the Member for Richmond Park for being present and for their interest in this matter.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o216"><a name="70518-0013.htm_para5"><a name="07051822001604">In addition, one post office has already been passed over to a franchise with WH Smith: Hammersmith Crown post office in Hammersmith and Fulham. A further six, including the Borough post office, are &#147;up for grabs&#148; in that they have an uncertain future. The other five are: the Enfield Wash post office in Enfield; the 238 Essex Road post office in Islington; the Ludgate Circus post office in the City of London; the Tottenham post office in Tottenham; and the Maida Hill post office in Westminster. I never knew that there was a Maida Hill before; I only knew that there was a Maida Vale, but I am reliable informed that that is nearby.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o217"><a name="70518-0013.htm_para6"><a name="07051822001605">That is the full list. Thirteen boroughs are affected. Westminster will suffer two losses, as will Lewisham&#151;or two transfers, to be fair. Hillingdon will have two transfers as well, other boroughs will have one, and six boroughs might or might not have an office transferred to a franchise operation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o218"><a name="70518-0013.htm_para7"><a name="07051822001606">In all our communities there have been significant numbers of closures of offices. There have been a series of closures in Southwark over the years. Offices have closed at the Elephant and Castle, the Bricklayers Arms, Bermondsey Street and Abbey Street. The result is that there is much greater demand for the existing Crown offices. All those in my constituency have experienced increased demand: the Walworth Road office is often packed, with queues of people both inside and out; the London Bridge and Borough High Street offices are very busy; and the Blackfriars Road office is in the middle of a big commercial  <br>

development. They are all in areas where buildingis going on&#151;where there is regeneration and redevelopment. The result is that people who used to use their sub-post office are now having to use the Crown post offices that are left, as the sub-post offices no longer exist.</p>

<p><a name="st_o362"><a name="07051822001607"><a name="70518-0013.htm_spnew0"><a name="07051822003036"><b>Robert Neill (Bromley and Chislehurst) (Con):</b>
 I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for giving way, and for raising this very important topic. Does he realise that his point is hugely reinforced by what is happening in Bromley, where we have precisely the same history? We are deeply concerned about a proposal to relocate the Crown post office in the centre of Bromley, which already has queues stretching on to the pavement outside because of increased demand, to the first floor of WH Smith, which also has queues stretching outside. There is only one escalator, going up, with stairs going down and a very limited lift, so it will be much harder to access than the current Crown post office, which is at street level and readily accessible by the disabled, the elderly, people with young children and so on.</p>

<p><a name="st_o363"><a name="07051822001608"><a name="70518-0013.htm_spnew1"><a name="07051822003037"><b>Simon Hughes:</b>
 That is exactly the sort of thing that persuaded me to raise this issue. I have no objection in principle to the Post Office sorting out its major financial difficulties through a variety of alternative methods. My hon. Friends the Members for Kingston and Surbiton (Mr. Davey) and for Richmond Park (Susan Kramer) and I have argued for alternative ways for the Post Office to raise money, such as selling a minority of its shares. It should try to be more solvent, although there is an argument that the Government could put in more money, which they have so far refused to do.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o219"><a name="70518-0013.htm_para8"><a name="07051822001609">However, if the outcome of pursuing such alternatives is a less good service&#151;a reduced chance of a speedy service, and one that is not as convenient&#151;we will be seriously underselling our constituents. There will be local consultations in all the boroughs affected. Not all my London colleagues are directly affected as my hon. Friend the Member for Richmond Park and I are. However, they are certainly concerned, and they and my local government colleagues across London want to make sure that no such proposal in the boroughs that we represent leads to a good accessible service moving out of the general area where people normally congregate, or into a shop, thereby providing customers with a lesser service. To be fair, WH Smith stores are generally in the places where the population go, but that is not necessarily case. Normally, Crown post offices are ideally positioned and well established, and people are well used to using them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o220"><a name="70518-0013.htm_para9"><a name="07051822001610">I turn to my specific concern ahead of the game, as it were, which is the Borough High Street post office. Not long after I was elected, the then Conservative Government proposed to close that post office. In conjunction with all the community groups, Labour and Liberal councillors&#151;it was not a party political matter&#151;trade unions and pensioner groups, we fought a campaign. The other day I was shown a photograph of me in that campaign&#151;looking considerably younger&#151;with the right hon. and learned Member for Camberwell and Peckham (Ms Harman). She looked a little younger too, although she is, of course, wearing very well.</p>

<notus-date day="18" month="5" year="2007" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>18 May 2007 : Column 953</b><br>

<p><a name="stpa_o221"><a name="70518-0013.htm_para10"><a name="07051822001611">The reality is that we kept the Borough High Street post office only because there was such a vigorous community campaign. That campaign was important; history has shown how important it was to win that battle. The post office has been, and is, very well used, and once the recent announcement was made, the community&#146;s strong and immediate response was to express great concern at the idea of its being moved. The problem for the Post Office is that it cannot enter into a franchise with WH Smith because there is no branch of WH Smith anywhere near the Borough High Street post office. My guess is that the others on the list&#151;the Enfield Wash, Essex Road, Ludgate Circus, Maida Hill and Tottenham post offices&#151;are all in the same boat: there is no WH Smith partner to move conveniently to.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o222"><a name="70518-0013.htm_para11"><a name="07051822001612">It is no answer to say that the post office can be moved to the Elephant and Castle&#151;that would be nonsense, even though there is a WH Smith at the Elephant and Castle. There is not one at London Bridge, except on the station, and it is too small to be a practical option. It would be complete nonsense, having closed the Elephant and Castle post office last year, to close another one and move it to the Elephant and Castle branch of WH Smith, which is in a shopping centre that is about to be knocked down and redeveloped anyway. That is not an option.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o223"><a name="70518-0013.htm_para12"><a name="07051822001613">The post office&#146;s location in Borough high street is extremely convenient. It is opposite Borough tube station. It is on many bus routes and it serves two local authority wards&#151;Cathedrals ward to the west and Chaucer ward to the east. It is also an area with many businesses, shops and institutions. The Commission for Racial Equality is based up the road, as is the College of Occupational Therapists. South Bank university is just down the road, and there are large hostels for students from the London School of Economics and King&#146;s college, so it is very well located.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o224"><a name="70518-0013.htm_para13"><a name="07051822001614">Is the Minister making it clear to the Post Office that if there is not an obvious neighbourly franchise partner who can provide as good a service or better in the same sort of location, it would not be acceptable to move the service significantly further away to a less convenient place, or to move it to a location that is inappropriate in terms of its catchment area? I believe that the Crown post office is listed. I may be wrong, but it is certainly an attractive and handsome building that has been there for a long time. It is part of the civic streetscape of Borough high street&#151;the old high street of the old borough of Southwark, before the metropolitan borough was abolished. It is an important building in the community, and it is great that it is used as the post office. There are many buildings like it, and nobody has suggested that it is not fit for purpose. It has two main doors for access, a large space at the front, it is visible from the main road and it is very convenient. I would be grateful if the Minister could reassure me that that Crown post office, and others like it&#151;I do not know the geography of the whole of Greater London&#151;will not be moved and put into premises of franchise partners where that is not appropriate. I hope that the Minister can reassure me that if a Crown post office&#146;s future has not been decided, it does not necessarily mean that a franchise will be granted to WH Smith or anybody else. I hope that all or some will be kept as flagships.</p>

The Under-Secretary of State for Trade and Industry, my hon. Friend the Member for Poplar and Canning Town (Jim Fitzpatrick), who would normally answer this debate, apologises to the House.

One could say that everything was fine when I was the Minister, but I had better not say that. We are having a debate about Crown post offices for one simple reason. I was the Minister who stopped an instruction by the previous Conservative Government to get rid of them all.

The information on the start of that consultation came to me by email one day after the official consultation had apparently started. It was later followed up by a letter.

Crown post office network is protected and invested in, which means that occasionally&#151;I stress, occasionally&#151;entering a franchise. I shall get to the figures in a moment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o228"><a name="70518-0013.htm_para17"><a name="07051822001621">The future of the post office network is a subject of great relevance to all Members of the House, regardless of the type of constituency we represent, be it urban, rural or, as in my case, a mixture of both. I have already participated&#151;and will no doubt do so again&#151;in consultations in my area about the review announced by my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry yesterday. Today&#146;s debate shows the need to answer specific questions relating to the Crown network and to the Borough office, in particular, but first I emphasise the fact that the Government share Members&#146; concerns about securing a sustainable future for the network. That was the whole purpose of my right hon. Friend&#146;s statement.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o229"><a name="70518-0013.htm_para18"><a name="07051822001622">The figures are stark; there is no way of getting around them. That is why the National Federation of SubPostmasters accepts the need to do something about the current size of the network. It is unsustainable. An average of 16 people a week use each of the 800 smallest post offices, at a loss of &#163;17 per visit. Losses have risen to &#163;4 million every week, despite an annual subsidy of &#163;150 million and total investment of &#163;2 billion since 1999. The hon. Member for North Southwark and Bermondsey said that we had not been investing in the network. That is not true.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o230"><a name="70518-0013.htm_para19"><a name="07051822001623">Less than a third of the 14,300 post offices are commercially viable. Increasingly, people want to access services in different ways&#151;using direct debits, ATMs, the phone and the internet. More than 5 million Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency customers renew their car tax either online or by phone; a decade ago the number would have been nil.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o231"><a name="70518-0013.htm_para20"><a name="07051822001624">Yesterday, my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State announced the Government&#146;s decisions, having considered the views put to us during the 12-week national consultation that closed on 8 March. The strategy to put the network on a stable footing will include investment of &#163;1.7 billion, subject to state aid clearance, to support the network and keep it national, with a continuing annual subsidy of up to &#163;150 million until 2011 and recognition of the need for ongoing subsidy beyond that date. Minimum access criteria will be introduced and will apply to all 2,800 postcode districts without exemptions to ensure that there is a national network with comprehensive coverage for customers in every part of the country. Overall, nationally, 99 per cent. of the population will be within 3 miles&#151;at most&#151;of a post office and 90 per cent. will be within 1 mile. Additional access criteria will protect deprived urban areas, some of which will be in the hon. Gentleman&#146;s constituency, and will apply to 15 per cent. of the most deprived urban areas, rather than only 10 per cent., as previously proposed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o232"><a name="70518-0013.htm_para21"><a name="07051822001625">In applying the criteria, Post Office Ltd will be required to consider the availability of public transport, alternative access to key post office services, local demographics and the impact on local economies. The company will draw up plans, to be put to local consultation, for an expected 2,500 post office closures, within the access criteria. Postwatch, local authorities and sub-postmasters will have input in the plans, which will be implemented over an 18-month period starting  <br>

this summer. However, the fact that the remaining post office network of about 12,000 will still have more branches than the entire UK banking network should not be forgotten.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o233"><a name="70518-0013.htm_para22"><a name="07051822001626">Postwatch, and subsequently the new National Consumer Council will monitor future decisions on the shape and size of the network to ensure that Post Office Ltd complies with the national framework. All the other decisions announced by my right hon. Friend yesterday related to investment and opening the network for services to rural and urban communities that suffer social stress.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o234"><a name="70518-0013.htm_para23"><a name="07051822001627">The network of 450 Crown post offices is heavily loss-making; overall, it lost about &#163;70 million last year alone. We support Post Office Ltd&#146;s policy for reducing the losses, which includes maintaining a core network of Crown post offices while continuing to drive efficiencies and to franchise branches where suitable opportunities arise. We welcome the commercial deal between Post Office Ltd. and WH Smith, announced on 19 April, to franchise 70 Crown offices, which will secure the retention of the main post office service in each of those areas. The franchises are an investment, not a disinvestment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o235"><a name="70518-0013.htm_para24"><a name="07051822001628">Almost 14,000 post offices are already run by private business&#151;either individuals or franchise chains&#151;including about 900 of the 1,400 large, town centre main post offices. The network has always relied on private business for the majority of its outlets. The offices set to be franchised under the deal with WH Smith represent a tiny fraction of the network as a whole&#151;less than a half a per cent. For the people and the communities concerned, had this deal not been done, it would have been at risk. Therefore, there has been 100 per cent. success in retaining the services by the franchising arrangement.</p>

 I shall do so in a minute, but first I shall deal with the issues in the hon. Gentleman&#146;s constituency. He clearly has particular concerns about the future of the Borough post office. Indeed, along with his Liberal Democrat colleagues, he has launched a petition, as we saw today, to save it, despite the absence of any proposals to close it&#151;there is no proposal to close it.</p>

 I just thought that we should get that on the record, as it was not quite clear when the hon. Gentleman introduced his petition.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o236"><a name="70518-0013.htm_para25"><a name="07051822001633">There are 115 Crown post offices in London, seven of which will be part of the arrangement with WH Smith. Post Office Ltd has also stated that the company will continue to run 373 Crown offices, 102 of which are in London. The Post Office has committed to keep three of the four Crown offices in the hon. Gentleman&#146;s constituency under its direct management: those in Blackfriars road, London Bridge and my old stomping ground of Walworth road. He will surely welcome the certainty provided in these cases. We recognise that, at this stage, Post Office Ltd is not able to confirm the position of the future of the branch at Borough one way or the other, so inevitably some uncertainty is  <br>

<p><a name="stpa_o237"><a name="70518-0013.htm_para26"><a name="07051822001634">I know that the Post Office has written to the hon. Gentleman to explain the situation, but I do not think that that is sufficient, so I shall ask it to arrange a meeting with him&#151;and any other London Members that he wishes to bring&#151;to discuss its intentions, and the issues of consultation and WH Smith&#146;s engagement with local Members of Parliament.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o238"><a name="70518-0013.htm_para27"><a name="07051822001635">I think that WH Smith has a responsibility to engage, so I shall give another commitment. Either myself or the Minister who has direct responsibility for this will write separately to WH Smith to ensure that it carries out its responsibilities to meet elected Members of Parliament and their representatives to discuss the process of the changeover&#151;the taking over of the franchise&#151;and ensure that hon. Members feel engaged and involved, and that they understand what is happening. I give the hon. Gentleman that commitment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o239"><a name="70518-0013.htm_para28"><a name="07051822001636">I know that the Post Office is working hard to deal with the issue of greater certainty over the future of the network. The fact that the company has already set out a clear position on the majority of the post office network is a welcome and significant step forward. So, I hope that the assurance that I have given about meetings with the Post Office and WH Smith will start the process of consultation and discussion.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o240"><a name="70518-0013.htm_para29"><a name="07051822001637">The hon. Member for Richmond Park (Susan Kramer) raised the lack of consultation. There should, and will be, consultation, and I shall ensure that it takes place. I cannot make comments about the specific branch of WH Smith that she mentioned, because I have no knowledge of it, but I can say that any arrangement that is made is not about reducing access to post office services&#151;whether or not that relates to disability; it is about improving access, the quality of access and footfall, which is what happens in the main.</p>

People were up in arms at Asda running the post office, but the footfall increased from about 80 a month to about 80 an hour. Why did that happen? Because to shop at Asda, which has a turnover of more than &#163;1 million a week, people had to go through the post office. This has been a boost and a boon to the village. This is about explaining things and engaging people, and it is about a sense of ownership: doing  <br>

things with people rather than doing them to people. Again, I give an assurance about discussions on the particular branch that has been mentioned.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o242"><a name="70518-0014.htm_para1"><a name="07051822001639">The hon. Gentleman raised the issue of the Charing Cross branch announced as part of the deal. May I just say for the record that we are talking not about the Charing Cross branch in London, but about Charing Cross in Birkenhead? I did not know that there were two Charing Crosses of such significance. Birkenhead is certainly significant in terms of the north-west.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o243"><a name="70518-0014.htm_para2"><a name="07051822001640">Franchising is not about a closure programme. Franchising and conversions are not about reducing the number of post offices; they are about trying to improve and sustain the network. One thing that Post Office Ltd has is expertise in negotiation about franchising. It has lots of experience of that. A decade ago, that was taken from it, and some of the post offices have gone. Who knows whether they would have remained open as a commercial enterprise or whether the sites would have been cleared for other commercial purposes? However, the fact that we have been able to save these means that we have the opportunity, over the next 10 years, to ensure that each of the Crown post offices is in a place that will be accessible to the existing customer base and will allow that customer base to increase. That is certainly true in urban areas, where a great deal of public and private investment is regenerating shopping centres, building new places for shopping and putting in place new transport infrastructure. It is important that we can take account of the impact of that, which is sometimes negative. If that means reaching a genuine arrangement whereby the Post Office gives a franchise that maintains and improves services and increases access to them, hon. Members should move forward sensitively with their constituents. However, as the hon. Member for North Southwark and Bermondsey said, constituents need to be consulted and engaged with so that they are brought into the programme of work. I repeat that I give the hon. Gentleman a commitment on that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o244"><a name="70518-0014.htm_para3"><a name="07051822001641">I will write to the hon. Member for Richmond Park about the specifics of the Richmond post office and arrange a meeting with her about WH Smith. I will make the same arrangements for the constituency of the hon.
