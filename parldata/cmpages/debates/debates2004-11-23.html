<p><a name="41123-01_spnew0"><b> Mr. Speaker: </b> 
 As the House will recall, it was decided earlier this month to dispense with most of the Sessional Orders. In their place, it was agreed that the Speaker should make a brief statement about the duties and responsibilities of Members. I am grateful to the Standards and Privileges Committee for its advice and suggestions.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41123-01_para0">
Our privileges allow us to conduct our debate without fear of outside interference. In particular, we enjoy freedom of speech, both in proceedings in Committee and debates on the Floor of the House. It is a privilege that comes with our membership since the Bill of Rights. This is one of a number of great privileges that we should all seek to preserve.

<a name="41123-01_para1">
It is up to each one of us to ensure that we, both as individuals and collectively, do not abuse the rights that we have been given. They should only be exercised in the public interest. We must ensure that we follow the letter and spirit of the code of conduct and related rules which we have approved to regulate our business.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41123-01_para2">
Each Member is here to represent the views of his or her constituents and to participate in the process of democracy that we all cherish. It is the hallmark of our procedures that every Member has the right to speak and to be listened to. We should ensure that every Member is heard with the respect to which we are all entitled, regardless of the views that are being expressed.

<a name="41123-01_para3">
Every member of the public has the right to expect that his or her Member of Parliament will behave with civility, in the best traditions of fairness, with the highest level of probity and with integrity. Their views are influenced by our behaviour here and if we are to maintain and increase public support, we should bear in mind that how we behave in this House has a substantial bearing on the levels of confidence and trust which others have in us.

I turn now to security, not only for Members of Parliament, but also for our staff and for the staff of this House, who work so hard on our behalf. In the coming months, further security measures will be put in place to ensure that this House remains a safe and secure place in which to conduct our business. In this respect, Members would not expect me to go into detail, but these measures must ensure that the House of Commons continues in its tradition of welcoming the maximum number of visitors, both from home and abroad.

I am filled with pride at being given the opportunity to move the Address, together with my hon. Friend the Member for Sheffield, Heeley (Ms Munn). It is a great honour both personally and for my constituency.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41123-02_para2">
I was elected to the House in a by-election 18&nbsp;years ago, almost to the day, and I am especially proud that my constituency is such a diverse and interesting place to represent. At the southern end of the constituency, in Knowsley, we have the estate of the Earl of Derby, which incorporates Knowsley safari park, which is, of course, particularly noted for its lions. On one occasion, residents living in the vicinity were asked what would happen if one of the lions escaped. &quot;The lions will have to look after themselves, like the rest of us,&quot; they were told.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41123-02_para3">
The heart of the constituency is the town of Kirkby, built mainly in the 1960s to accommodate people displaced by slum clearance programmes in Liverpool. I have had a lifelong love affair with the town since I was a student at the technical college many years ago. Kirkby went through hard times in the 1980s and early 1990s, with unemployment levels as high as 60&nbsp;per cent. in some parts. However, I am pleased to say that thanks to the sound economic stewardship of my right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer&#151;<i>[Interruption.]</i> Wait for it. The town is now recovering dramatically.

The House may be surprised to learn that a large part of my constituency is rural farmland. At a recent meeting in one village, I was asked what was going to happen about the problem of foxes causing a nuisance. I pointed out that, despite the Hunting Bill, in such circumstances landowners would still be able to shoot them. Another constituent then rose to his feet and said, &quot;Well, that&#039;s fine for the foxes, but does it apply to the Jacksons?&quot;
</p>

<p>
<a name="41123-02_para6">
My constituency is not in Liverpool, but most of us who live there are of Liverpool and happily answer to the description, &quot;scousers&quot;. As the hon. Member for Henley (Mr. Johnson) will no doubt confirm, if any Conservative Members have an issue with that, they should be warned: the right hon. and learned Gentleman the Leader of the Opposition and I have a little arrangement.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41123-02_para7">
My constituency, in its various shapes and sizes, has in the past been represented by William Ewart Gladstone, between 1865&nbsp;and 1868&#151;<i>[Interruption.]</i> It was a long time ago. It was represented for many years by Harold Wilson, and my immediate predecessor was Robert Kilroy-Silk, who is now a Member of the European Parliament. They are all difficult acts to follow. Until I stood in the by-election following the resignation of the matinee idol, Robert Kilroy-Silk, I had blithely gone through life thinking that I bore a strong physical resemblance to Robert Redford. It came as quite a surprise to be described in one national newspaper as
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;all nose, bone and moustache looking for all the world like a first world war Tommy about to go over the top at the Somme.&quot;</p>

For a while, I consoled myself with the thought that I was just not photogenic. However, when I suggested that theory to my wife, she would not hear of it. &quot;No, dear&quot;, she said, &quot;you just look like that.&quot; [<i>Laughter.</i>]
</p>

<p>
<a name="41123-02_para9">
I am afraid that I have no direct experience of Gladstone, but when I first became politically active as a teenager, our local MP was Harold Wilson. In 1966, as a reward for putting thousands of leaflets through letterboxes, I was invited to Harold&#039;s eve-of-poll public meeting, which was held in what was then called Prescot grammar school. At the end of the speech, as was his custom, Harold took questions in threes, which basically meant that if he did not like the sound of one he could answer the other two and hope that the third was forgotten. The first questioner asked, appropriately, about grammar schools. &quot;Mr Wilson&quot;, he said, &quot;you said in 1964&nbsp;that they would abolish the grammar schools over your dead body, and now it&#039;s in your manifesto to abolish them. What have you got to say about that?&quot; Harold duly answered the second and third questions, conveniently overlooking the first. A little later, the chairman&#151;I never quite knew whether out of malice or myopia&#151;called the same man again. He repeated the question, by this time purple with indignation. Harold stood up, took a long draw on his pipe and replied, &quot;Friend, you&#039;re showing a morbid curiosity with in my corpse.&quot;
</p>

<p>
<a name="41123-02_para10">
It is a particular pleasure to move this Address since so much of it is relevant to the issues that concern my constituents. Whatever divisions exist in my constituency, as elsewhere, about Iraq, we are as conscious and anxious as like everybody else about the security threats that we face in the modern world. 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>23 Nov 2004 : Column 9</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>We&nbsp;know that one grievance that fuels terrorism is the fate of the Palestinians in the middle east. My constituents will fully support my right hon. Friends the Prime Minister and the Foreign Secretary in their efforts to work with other world leaders to bring about a just settlement to that corrosive problem. As a former Northern Ireland Minister, I know at first hand the focus and skill that my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister has at his command, and I am sure that the whole House wishes him well in his efforts to bring peace and stability to the middle east.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41123-02_para11">
One of the major concerns in my constituency is law and order, and my constituents will welcome the measures in the Address to tackle crime, disorder and organised crime. As a former Home Office Minister, I know that a great deal has already been done to give the police and other law enforcement agencies the power and resources that they need, but that remains work in progress. I certainly welcome the proposed introduction of identity cards, which I strongly believe will help in the fight against crime and in combating terrorism.My constituents are impatient that those who are intent on creating havoc and misery in our communities should be either brought under control or, if that fails, removed from the community altogether. We have already lost patience with those in the courts and elsewhere who confuse human rights and civil liberties with having a licence to deal in drugs and keep hold of the profits. Such behaviour rightly causes outrage in decent, hard-working people.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41123-02_para12">
Another commitment that my constituents will welcome is the further reform of the national health service to offer more information, power and choice to patients, with equal access for all, free at the point of delivery. I know that when my right hon. Friends the Prime Minister and the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster (Mr. Milburn) utter the words &quot;reform&quot; and &quot;choice&quot;, nervous twitches break out on the Labour Benches. I would simply point out, however, that it is perfectly reasonable in the 21st century for people to have some choice and control over how services are provided. Surely it is a measure of progress that people now expect services to be delivered to suit the way that they live their lives, and it is fitting that a Government of the left should adopt such a progressive approach.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41123-02_para13">
My constituents are particularly looking forward to improved public transport, including the Railways Bill, which I hope will help Merseyrail to extend the electrification of our local network. The proposed tram link between Kirkby and Liverpool city centre will also be of enormous benefit to the travelling public. My hon. Friend the Member for Halton (Derek Twigg) is sitting next to me, and we are both also looking forward to the second Mersey crossing.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41123-02_para14">
Many of my constituents work in hazardous occupations, and some have died or been injured as a result of inadequate health and safety in the workplace. Tragically, members of the public have also lost their lives or been injured as a result of the negligence of those responsible for their safety. For those reasons, I am very pleased that the Government are to introduce a Bill to create a new offence of corporate manslaughter.

I hope that as much as possible of this ambitious programme can be put in place before the general election. For my own part, I am anxious to avoid repeating a mistake I made in a previous general election campaign. On the Saturday evening before polling day, I unwisely agreed to go on a tour of the many social clubs in my constituency, arriving at the piano bar of the Royal Antediluvian Order of Buffalos club as my last port of call. I was asked by the club compere to take the stage and sing a song. Emboldened by several pints of bitter, I thought, &quot;Why not?&quot; Unaccountably, I decided to give a rendition of &quot;Some Enchanted Evening&quot;. Having managed to get through it, I proudly headed to the back of the club where my agent, Mike Murphy, was standing. I approached him, poised to receive his admiring congratulations. &quot;That,&quot; he said, &quot;was worth a thousand votes&#151;but not for you.&quot; On the basis of the measures in this Address, however, I confidently expect to have a better song to sing at the next general election, and I warmly commend the Queen&#039;s Speech to the House.

Before I examine the Gracious Speech in detail, I shall deal with certain matters that do not fall directly within the remit of the Government&#039;s legislative programme. The next few days could determine whether devolved government is restored to Northern Ireland this side of the general election.

Opposition Members support the principles behind some Bills in the Gracious Speech, though we will doubtless have constructive suggestions about how they can be improved. However, there are a number of omissions from the Gracious Speech. There will be a Bill to give effect to the constitutional treaty for the European Union. Apparently, it will provide for a referendum, but there is no date. The Prime Minister said that he would stand up for Britain&#039;s interests in Europe, but as his own former economic adviser has admitted, the Prime Minister&#039;s approach to the constitution has been &quot;gutless&quot;. That adviser said of the British Government:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;First, it opposed a written constitution and then it put forward its own draft, which was treated with contempt. Then there was all that nonsense about &#039;tidying-up&#039;. There was no strategic thinking.&quot;</p>

</p>

<p>
<a name="41123-04_para6">
The Prime Minister promised to give leadership in Europe, so why can he not give a lead? Why is he waiting for the rest of Europe? Why is he content simply to follow? Why can we not have a date for the referendum?

Yet that same Prime Minister has already promised us &quot;the decent society&quot;, &quot;the creative economy&quot;, &quot;a stakeholder economy&quot;, &quot;a new age&quot;, &quot;a new age of achievement&quot;, &quot;the giving age&quot; and &quot;the age of challenge&quot;.

What the country wants to know is when he will deliver. The year 1998&nbsp;was the post-euphoria, pre-delivery year and 1999&nbsp;supposedly the year of delivery, but that clearly did not work because 2001&nbsp;became the instruction to deliver year. That was not a great success either, so 2003&nbsp;was christened the poised to deliver year. So what is it this year: is it the year of delivery, the year of achievement or are we just simply poised for the achievement of delivery?

<a name="41123-04_para15">
Perhaps the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry can shed some light on that issue. After all, she was the one who criticised the Government last year for their lack of delivery. That was a bit rich coming from her. She spent last year lecturing people about the need to save energy. As she says, why pay more than we need to? Yet two nights ago, her Department was lit up like a Christmas tree. When asked why, her spokesman helpfully explained by saying that the lights were either on or off.

Two years ago, the Government launched their flagship education policy, &quot;The Power to Innovate&quot;. That was designed to give schools more freedom. There are 21,000&nbsp;state schools in Britain, but just five have been granted that freedom.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41123-05_para3">
The same year, the Government launched earned autonomy and the Education Secretary promised that he would promote it energetically. Not a single school has got earned autonomy. When people hear the Prime Minister talking today about school freedom and choice and about discipline in the classroom, they will see it for what it is&#151;it is all talk. Parents want action. They want action to ensure that their children can actually learn when they go to school and are not disrupted by the unruly behaviour of others. That is why we would give head teachers the final say over expulsions.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41123-05_para4">
Patients want us to clean up our hospitals. The Prime Minister talks about security, but the security that patients want is the peace of mind that comes from knowing that they will not catch a new infection when they go into hospital. Three years ago, the Government promised that every patient had the right to expect that their local hospital meets the highest standards of cleanliness. We have had 21&nbsp;health Bills and 22&nbsp;MRSA initiatives, yet at least 5,000&nbsp;people still die every year from infections picked up in hospital. Doctors and nurses still do not have the power to shut wards that they know are infected.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41123-05_para5">
We will have almost a dozen Home Office Bills in this Session. After seven and a half years, with just five months to go before an election, why should people believe now that the Government are suddenly going to fix crime? The Prime Minister promised cash point fines for yobs&#151;it never happened. He said they would dock housing benefit from antisocial tenants&#151;it never happened. Night courts were closed after six months. As for being tough on crime and tough on the causes of crime, his Government are letting prisoners out early and have downgraded punishment for shoplifting. Is it any wonder that crime is out of control?
</p>

<p>
<a name="41123-05_para6">
Crime figures are the measure of whether the Government are succeeding or failing; that is what the Prime Minister says. When he criticises our record, he always uses the recorded crime figures. He did it again last week. Recorded crime fell by 18&nbsp;per cent. when I was Home Secretary. Under his Government, it has gone up by 16&nbsp;per cent. On his own criterion, he has failed where I succeeded.
</p>

<a name="41123-05_para7">
This weekend, we were told that drugs would be the Government&#039;s priority. We have heard that before, too. In 1999, the Prime Minister promised new action to break the link between drugs and crime. It was all talk. 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>23 Nov 2004 : Column 19</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>His Government have downgraded cannabis. According to the Met, more people are being caught with cannabis but fewer are being arrested. Perhaps that is what he meant by breaking the link between drugs and crime. What does it say about the Prime Minister&#039;s priorities that he talks about protecting children from sweets and crisps but will not keep them safe from cannabis?
</p>

<p>
<a name="41123-05_para8">
Yesterday, the Metropolitan Police Federation said that, even without arrest, there is still plenty of paperwork. People do not want the police filling in forms. They want them out on streets, challenging and confronting every kind of criminal behaviour, from graffiti to drug dealing. That is why we will take action to cut police paperwork by scrapping the politically correct form that officers have to fill in every time they stop someone. We will take action on drugs. We need to offer every youngster on hard drugs the chance of residential rehab. All the evidence shows that that is what works best. That is what we will deliver.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41123-05_para9">
The Prime Minister talks about our nation&#039;s security. It is one of his many priorities, just as it was 10&nbsp;years ago when he said:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;Today&#039;s politics is about the search for security in a changing world.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="41123-05_para10">
How can we guarantee security when we do not even know who is coming into our country? There are 250,000&nbsp;failed asylum seekers somewhere in Britain. So much for the Prime Minister&#039;s promise of a fairer, faster and firmer asylum system. He has had seven and a half years, but he has not even got to first base on that. How can he keep a straight face talking about security when he is going to cut our armed forces and disband historic regiments, including the Black Watch?
</p>

<p>
<a name="41123-05_para11">
People can see through the talk. They are fed up with it. They want action to reinstate 24-hour security at our ports. They want action to tighten up on work permits, and to let Parliament decide how many people can come into Britain every year. The Prime Minister knows it. That is why the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster&#151;the Minister paid &#163;130,000&nbsp;a year to write Labour&#039;s manifesto&#151;was busy briefing <i>The Sunday Times</i> that:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;the Tories have won a clear advantage by promising an annual limit for the number of asylum seekers and legal immigrants. Tony Blair is &#039;sympathetic&#039;&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="41123-05_para12">
But we know that the Labour Government will never deliver because they are all talk, all spin and no substance. They never learn and never change.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41123-05_para13">
The truth is that the Government have over-hyped everything. &quot;Over-hyped&quot; is not my word, but that of the right hon. Member for Darlington (Mr. Milburn). There is no one more addicted to over-hyping than the Home Secretary. Just last Sunday, he was talking about the measures needed to protect us from terrorism. He went through them in detail&#151;juryless trials, wire-tap evidence, yet more police powers to pre-empt terrorists. But there is no legislation in the Gracious Speech to provide them. So we have a Government who admit that the law needs to be changed, but not yet; a Government who say that protection from terrorism is a priority, but not yet; a Government who say, &quot;We will take action to keep you safe&quot;, but not yet. There can be no better example of the Government&#039;s pre-occupation with talk, 

<br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>

<p>
<a name="41123-05_para14">
We will promise only what we know we can deliver. We will ensure that children can actually learn when they go to school by giving head teachers the power to expel unruly pupils. We will give patients the right to&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;choose where they are treated and doctors the power to close wards when they are infected with a superbug. We will cut police paperwork so that the police can get out on the streets and cut crime. We will get a grip on immigration and asylum by giving priority to genuine refugees and people who have a real contribution to make to our country. And yes, we will give pensioners the security that they deserve in their old age by restoring the link between the basic state pension and average earnings. That is what this legislative programme should have been about&#151;the people&#039;s priorities of school discipline, cleaner hospitals, more police, lower taxes and controlled immigration. Today, after seven years of this Government and five months before the general election, all that we get from them is more rhetoric, more promises and more talk. But this Government will never turn talk into action so it is time for a Government who will.

My hon. Friend the Member for Knowsley, North and Sefton, East (Mr. Howarth) made a typically warm, witty and generous speech, and I pay tribute to it. As he said, he entered the House after a by-election in 1986. He replaced Robert Kilroy-Silk, whose television career, from what I hear, was largely spent with warring families who were at each other&#039;s throats. What a relief it must have been when he left television to join the UK Independence party.

My hon. Friend is, as we all know, a kind-hearted individual, but he is also someone with a sharp sense of humour, as we have heard today.

Her mother was a linchpin of the local health service, having first been a nurse and then helping to train hundreds of others to follow in her footsteps, and I hope and am sure that she is proud of the investment and improvements that the Government, with her daughter&#039;s support, have wrought in the national health service.

<a name="41123-06_para5">
The Queen&#039;s Speech commits the Government to continuing the policies for economic opportunity and change in our public services. The right hon. and learned Member for Folkestone and Hythe (Mr. Howard) asked where was the delivery, and he mentioned the Government&#039;s record. I am very happy to engage in a comparison of records, and indeed on what we have delivered. Over the past seven and a half years, Bank of England independence, prudent economic management and the new deal have delivered the lowest interest rates, lowest inflation and lowest unemployment for decades. Living standards of every section of the population are up. That is delivery after seven and a half years.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41123-06_para6">
When the right hon. and learned Gentleman was a leading member of the last Conservative Government, we had two recessions. We now have sustained economic growth. We had interest rates of 10&nbsp;per cent. for four years; now they stand at about 5&nbsp;per cent. When he was Secretary of State for Employment, this country lost 1&nbsp;million jobs; in the past seven and a half years, we have gained 2&nbsp;million jobs. That is delivery. We saw pensioner poverty and child poverty increase under the last Government. Now we see 700,000&nbsp;children lifted out of poverty and 2&nbsp;million pensioners lifted out of acute hardship.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41123-06_para7">
In the last Conservative Parliament, when the right hon. and learned Gentleman was a senior member of that Conservative Government, we saw spending per pupil in our schools cut. Since the Labour Government came to power, it has been increased by &#163;800&nbsp;per pupil in real terms. That is delivery.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41123-06_para8">
When the right hon. and learned Gentleman was last in office, national health service waiting lists&#151;under the Conservatives&#151;rose by 400,000. Now they have fallen by 300,000. Of course there are still problems; he mentioned one&#151;MRSA. But let us be clear: after years in which the NHS was run down, its services depleted, its training cut and its buildings unrenewed, we now have the national health service on its way back, thanks to the investment and reform under the Labour Government.

<p><a name="41123-06_spmin1"><b>The Prime Minister:</b> 
 I cannot, no, because I do not know the particular circumstances of the schools in the hon. Gentleman&#039;s constituency, but I bet that, if I look at the figures for those schools, they will have received substantial extra investment from the Government over the past few years. I do not know the particular circumstances of those schools, but I do know that, if we go into any constituency&#151;I believe that mine is typical in this way&#151;there is investment in primary schools, in secondary schools and in the numbers of teachers and classroom assistants. All of that was denied under the last Conservative Government; all of it delivered under this Labour Government. Let us never forget, indeed, that every penny piece of that investment, every economic measure, such as Bank of England independence, and every attempt at fairness, such as the minimum wage, was opposed by the right hon. and learned Member for Folkestone and Hythe and the Conservative party.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41123-06_para11">
The Queen&#039;s Speech therefore builds on our record. Legislatively, it focuses on crime and security, but it should be taken alongside the pre-Budget report next week, which will focus on economic stability and opportunity, and the five-year programmes, not just for the NHS and schools, but for skills, child care, housing, public health, transport, pensions, art and sports. In every area, we recognise that the future is posing fresh challenges, that the traditional ways of meeting them no longer do so and that, if we want to help the British people to cope with economic globalisation, terrorism, organised crime and the pressures of modern work and family life, we have to change radically the way that public services, the welfare state and the criminal justice system work.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41123-06_para12">
In respect of crime, the Queen&#039;s Speech does indeed build on earlier legislation. The right hon. and learned Gentleman suggested that all that had failed. He said that we did not want to look at recorded crime figures, but let me remind him that recorded crime doubled under the previous Government. According to the British crime survey, crime is down since 1997. It actually rose, even under the last Government, on the British crime survey figures. It is not true either that earlier legislation is effective. Antisocial behaviour legislation is now accepted in all parts of the House as one of the most successful pieces of law and order legislation that has been passed.

 I will do my very best to ensure that, since I am sure that the issue is every bit as important in Northern Ireland as elsewhere. Of course, if the hopes that he and I both have are realised, perhaps a devolved set of institutions can ensure that that happens quickly.

<a name="41123-07_para0">
The measures that the Conservative party opposed are now accepted. The Queen&#039;s Speech announces the establishment of a serious organised crime agency and widens law enforcement agencies&#039; powers to force co-operation with investigations. It takes up measures proposed by front-line law officers to tackle the menace of drugs and to compel criminals who are addicts into&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;treatment. It gives parish councils and local Government the powers that they have asked for to tackle things such as fly-tipping, night-time noise and problem alleyways, and through the establishment of prison and probation service, allows us to target the prolific offenders, grip their behaviour after release and on bail and make it harder for them to commit crime. Through the identity cards Bill, we will pave the way for a British identity card&#151;at first voluntary, and then in time, compulsory. That is a big change, but frankly, with terrorism, illegal immigration and organised crime operating with much greater sophistication, identity cards, in my judgment, are long overdue.

It is said that those measures are scaremongering.

Let us examine that in relation to the tax and spending policies that the Conservative party issued in the past few weeks. Last week, the Conservatives published their tax plans.

That is up to &#163;6&nbsp;billion of tax cuts or more. But then we read the small print of the document and, tucked away at the end is this sentence:

Are the Conservatives any more credible on spending? One year ago, the shadow Chancellor said that if elected, he would freeze departmental budgets in cash terms except for the national health service and schools. That is &#163;20&nbsp;billion of cuts in vital spending. However, while he says that he will stop spending, the other shadows have started fantasy spending. They have promised more spending on defence, prison, rehab places, the elderly, schools, school nurses, pensions, transport, higher education and the national health service. But they have run into a bit of a problem. They have sort of promised tax cuts; they have sort of promised spending; and they have sort of realised that it does not add up.

The right hon. and learned Member for Folkestone and Hythe said that no one had challenged his figures on savings.

The Tories say that they will spend &#163;2.9&nbsp;billion more on defence than Labour, and that they will get &#163;1.6&nbsp;billion of that from defence savings. When one looks at the detail, one finds that it is &#163;900&nbsp;million from what they call logistics and procurement, but unfortunately we are already going to save &#163;1&nbsp;billion from logistics and procurement; in other words, there are no savings of &#163;900&nbsp;million for the Tories to make. The other saving that the shadow Chancellor says he will get is from the new deal. He says that if he scraps the new deal he will save money, but the new deal is cutting unemployment and saving money for us.

The fantasy does not end there. <i>[Interruption.]</i> No, there is more.

The right hon. and learned Gentleman has to explain how he will renegotiate things that the Government have already entered into. That is the difference. In order to renegotiate terms that the Government have already committed themselves to&#151;on fisheries, on social policy, on the social chapter, on the common agricultural policy&#151;and which other countries have already agreed, the right hon. and learned Gentleman would have to get the agreement of every one of the other 24&nbsp;countries. Where are the other countries that are going to agree? They do not exist, so now we even have a fantasy European Union to go alongside the fantasy country.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41123-07_para16">
Fantasy policies are amusing for a fantasy Government, but supposing that Government became a reality, then the fantasy becomes a fraud on the British people and is no longer amusing but dangerous. It would be back to the failed policies of the past. Think of the damage to mortgages, to jobs and to prosperity; think, and then think again before voting the Tories back in. Under the right hon. and learned Gentleman the Tories are right back to where they were. No wonder&#151;he served as a Minister in that Government for 10&nbsp;years, seven of them in the Cabinet. He introduced the poll tax. He opposed the minimum wage. He was a key economic Minister when interest rates rose, unemployment topped 3&nbsp;million and negative equity took its toll. He is not the hope of a successful Tory future because he is the reincarnation of a failed Tory past. [Hon. Members: &quot;What about the Lib Dems?&quot;] I was going to say a word or two about the Liberal Democrats, if that is all right.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41123-07_para17">
As for the Lib Dems, I suppose at least they do not pretend that they can finance their spending commitments out of thin air, but they do pretend that taking &#163;30&nbsp;billion over one Parliament from top-rate taxpayers and giving local authorities the right to tax the income of hard-working families will finance their pledges. I simply say that that will increase hugely the income tax&#151;top and basic rate&#151;of millions of families. The wealthiest will find a way of avoiding it; it is ordinary families that will be hardest hit. Meanwhile, the Liberal Democrats will oppose the measures on crime that the same families will surely welcome.

<p>
<a name="41123-07_para18">
The truth is that the policies of the Opposition parties&#151;[Hon. Members: &quot;Is that it?&quot;] It is about all they deserve, but I have more if they want&#151;<i>[Interruption.]</i> Since they want a bit more, I will give them a bit more. On one of my occasional forays into Lib-Dem spending commitments, I have come across the best one yet. It is about bee keeping. The Lib Dem shadow Chancellor, the hon. Member for Twickenham (Dr. Cable), says:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;Benefits from bees&#039; natural pollination activities are enormous, worth billions of pounds. There is however negligible research into damaging diseases and I have pressed the Ministry of Agriculture for a bigger research commitment.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="41123-07_para19">
I hope that the Chancellor is taking note. I had not realised that there were votes in bee keeping, but if the Liberal Democrats think there are, there probably are. If any bee keepers are listening, we are right on your side.

The truth is that this Government have a strong economic record; there is investment in public services and investment in extra numbers of police. Legislation on crime and security will go alongside the pre-Budget report and the five-year programmes to provide opportunity and security for all in a changing world. By contrast, the policies of the Opposition parties are either incredible or, where credible, damaging. So there is a choice: economic stability or economic danger; investment in public services or cuts; action on poverty and social justice or indifference; the future or the past. This Queen&#039;s Speech is strong on economic opportunity, strong on the nation&#039;s security and fair in helping all people whatever their background to fulfil their potential to the full.

The other two parliamentary by-elections that have taken place since the previous Queen&#039;s Speech were thankfully not due to bereavement.

In respect of a Queen&#039;s Speech that is dominated by Home Office concerns and law and order, both the Chancellor of the Exchequer, who has, alas, left the Chamber, and the constabulary generally would describe Peter&#039;s departure, given his weekend interviews and subsequent comments, as a classic case of &quot;He&#039;s gone to Europe, but by God, he has not gone quietly.&quot; It does not look as though he will remain quiet on these matters either, which will keep many of us outside the Labour party entertained, even given his further distance.

<p>
<a name="41123-08_para6">
The reason for making this somewhat unusual move and for drawing attention to it at the outset is that that vote will be a genuine opportunity to invite cross-party support in the Division Lobby next week because of the remarkable series of Parliament-orientated events arising from Iraq that have coloured our proceedings regarding the role of Prime Minister and the relationship to the House of Commons. From within the House, there have been the reports from the Select Committee on Foreign Affairs, the Select Committee on Public Accounts and the National Audit Office. We have also had Hutton and Butler, and more recently, the Iraq survey group.

The Prime Minister referred in his opening remarks to the continuing heroic work that is being carried out by the British armed forces in Iraq. We certainly pay tribute to that. We have all expressed very grave concerns about some of the images that we have seen coming out of Falluja and about the reality behind them. Perhaps tomorrow&#039;s instalment of the Queen&#039;s Speech debate will be a more appropriate occasion for more detailed exchanges on these matters. With regard to the announcement of the 30&nbsp;January scheduled elections, which is welcome, we would like to see to what extent the conduct of what happened in Falluja and the implications that flow from it will be assessed in terms of the processing and moving forward of that democratic ballot.

The Queen&#039;s Speech contains slightly odd new Labour wording referring to and introducing an important component of the speech this year. It states:

I am not sure whose opportunity the drafters of that sentence had in mind.

Nevertheless, as we have seen since yesterday evening&#039;s reports of the thwarted attack planned against Canary wharf, this is a serious issue that requires a serious response. We must always bear it in mind that the security services have to get it right every time, but the terrorist has only to get lucky once. That has to be weighed in the balance every time.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41123-08_para12">
I do not share the scepticism that some have expressed at the coincidence of that report&#039;s coming into the public domain at the same time as today&#039;s Queen&#039;s Speech. However, it is interesting to note that, because of all that has gone before, the instinctive response of many members of the public to what the Government tell them about such matters is somewhat sceptical, to say the least. In this case, I regret that, because I do not, for a whole variety of reasons, believe that the Government orchestrated this in any way. The public response is indicative of the problem that will underlie many of the debates on such fundamental matters of life and death that will take place on the Queen&#039;s Speech and subsequently, presumably, into a general election.
</p>

<p>

The real danger is that terrorism and security measures are being conflated in the public&#039;s mind with issues of domestic crime and disorder. Indeed, there are those who for their own, rather disreputable ends would be only too eager and happy for asylum and immigration to be mixed into that elixir as well. As we know, asylum and immigration are themselves distinct issues that get conflated, but when they are poured with domestic law and order issues into the turmoil that can be created in the public&#039;s mind by those with an agenda of their own involving international insecurities, the debate can become very febrile and damaging for the fabric of society as a whole. Those of us in Parliament, as well as the political combatants if the debate plays into a general election, must to try to keep above those arguments and to resist such temptations.

We will make the case, vigorously and on several fronts, against the introduction of identity cards. First, there is the question of cost.

Secondly, as we heard during last week&#039;s exchanges in Prime Minister&#039;s questions, terrible complexities have recently been experienced in the computerisation of the Child Support Agency.

The public have little confidence&#151;and we do not share the Government&#039;s confidence&#151;that a computerisation of the complexity that would be required for a national ID system could, if it bears any relation to the haphazard and hellish track record on these matters, in any sense be relied on.

<p>
<a name="41123-08_para17">
Thirdly, of course, we must remember that identity cards did not prevent depraved individuals from carrying out terrorist assaults in Madrid and New York. We should not, therefore, allow the argument to develop that ID cards would be a fundamental failsafe against such an attack, particularly a suicide attack. A further issue is that, even according to the Home Secretary&#039;s own interpretation, these proposals would not kick in during this Session of Parliament, even if it were to run for its entire five-year length.

We continue to oppose detention without trial. In a liberal democrat society&#151;in the non-party sense of the term&#151;it surely cannot be acceptable. We acknowledge, however, that there is a real problem in regard to at least some of the detainees at Belmarsh. This matter is, of course, subject to the decision of the courts. It must be preferable to secure a conviction, when it is legitimate to do so, and that might involve the allowing of information obtained by phone-tapping to be given in court, if it is a relevant and essential piece of information. It is better to arrive at such a conviction than to leave someone languishing in a legal no man&#039;s land, as is happening at the moment.

The Prime Minister has also made much of a matter that we have been very straightforward about, which is that we, as a party, have had to reassess our attitude to antisocial behaviour orders.

We have been proved right about some of those implications, but we have to be realistic. My hon.

Where a developed view is concerned, I listened to the Leader of the House&#039;s interview on this issue on Sunday night&#151;<i>[Interruption.]</i> I am sure that other listening posts within the Labour hierarchy follow very carefully what he says when he gives his later-night weekend interviews. If, after a scheme comes into operation, 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>23 Nov 2004 : Column 32</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>judgments must be formed on its practicality and changes must be made in the stance, we should be upfront about that. That is the kind of rational discussion that the public want to see. In being straightforward in saying that, I hope that there will be a degree more straightforwardness in the response from the Government in acknowledging that to be the case.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41123-09_para4">
Let us consider some of the issues that we highlighted at the time. For example, if we put antisocial behaviour orders in the context of wider criminality in this country at the moment, we see that the prison population has risen by 20&nbsp;per cent. since the Government came to power. Before 1997, however, the Labour party in opposition argued that prisons were already overcrowded. Perhaps that is tough on crime, but it is not tough on the causes of crime. With that increase, re-offending rates are now running at 60&nbsp;per cent., and among 18&nbsp;to 21-year-olds, at more than 70&nbsp;per cent. &quot;Tough on crime&quot; is the headline, but we need to consider the facts that lie below it.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41123-09_para5">
Equally, the Government are tough on the implementation of ASBOs. It must be acknowledged, however, that the ASBOs that have been administered have a 36&nbsp;per cent. failure rate. What does &quot;failure rate&quot; mean? It means that the people made subject to ASBOs who break them&#151;the failures&#151;end up in detention. If we consider the detention figures, we see the effect that that has on those individuals becoming re-offenders. It would be better if we could get to those people&#151;this is our whole argument, on which we differ from the Government&#151;before the legal intervention takes place. Then, if something were to go wrong, we would have a better prospect of getting them back on the straight and narrow, before they reach the point of incarceration when they are much further down the track and much more difficult to reclaim as a fully paid-up, worthwhile member of society. That is a serious issue and it should be pursued.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41123-09_para6">
The third context in which the issue should be placed is the need, which I mentioned, for more police and community police officers generally. It remains ridiculous that 10&nbsp;per cent. of our active police on shift at any given time are acting as bureaucrats and are not out in the streets and communities. The vital need to reduce the bureaucratic imposition on the police continues.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41123-09_para7">
We support the Government on their establishment of a Serious Organised Crime Agency. It must make sense to bring those functions together in a more coherent one-stop-shop, as it were. We will scrutinise that, but we want to give it our broad support.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41123-09_para8">
What I find most perverse, almost, about this Queen&#039;s Speech is that the Prime Minister, before he became Prime Minister, and in his earlier years in office, would often wax lyrical and with great reflection and consideration on the fact that the 20th century had been too dominated by the conservatives, and that the progressives&#151;be they those in his party, my party or elements of the Conservative party&#151;should try to capture the 21st century. Both the Prime Minister and the Chancellor have delivered speeches in which they have alluded to the fact that Liberal thinking has influenced and led to the enactment of big improvements in social measures and liberties by Labour Governments. However, what has happened today? Sadly, the Prime Minister&#039;s analysis is being 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>23 Nov 2004 : Column 33</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>steadily eclipsed by his Home Secretary&#039;s approach. In a short space of time, the Home Secretary has managed to do something that took the neo-conservatives in the United States 20&nbsp;years, if not more. In aping them, he has managed to turn &quot;liberal&quot; into a derogatory term of abuse in this country&#039;s political dialogue. I am not talking about the party political term &quot;Liberal&quot;; I am talking about people who consider themselves liberal, whatever their party political allegiance.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41123-09_para9">
That is totally out of kilter with British society today&#151;this is reflected in the legislation that we have passed on same-sex relationships and other matters&#151;so much of which is instinctively liberal in its attitudes and aspirations.

</p>





<p><a name="41123-09_spmin0"><b>The Prime Minister:</b> 
 The right hon. Gentleman&#039;s argument is important, but surely there is no inconsistency between being liberal-minded on issues such as, for example, equality in terms of race, gender or sexuality and the incorporation of the European convention on human rights into our domestic law, and at the same time saying that people who make life hell for others in their communities should not be allowed to get away with it&#151;there is nothing illiberal about that approach, which contains a lot of common sense. I agree that we need to invest in Sure Start and in opportunities for young people, but what do we do when elderly and vulnerable people&#039;s lives are made really difficult&#151;sometimes they are made virtually impossible&#151;by antisocial behaviour? Surely we have to act. I do not see any inconsistency between being entirely liberal on issues to do with equality and very sure and tough on issues to do with proper behaviour.

 It is refreshing to get into a philosophical debate with the Prime Minister&#151;they should let him out more often.

Indeed, I shall quote the Home Secretary&#039;s interview on the Saturday before last&#039;s &quot;Today&quot; programme.

 Surely the essence of the problem with this Home Secretary is that he has adopted a raft of measures that greatly adds to the power of the state without in any meaningful way adding to the security of the citizen.

I certainly agree with the approach taken by the hon.

We in this country enjoy a relatively stable, mature, tolerant, fair-minded and open democracy and the material affluence that goes with it, and it is absolutely essential that we do not drift into&#151;or worse still, consciously design&#151;knee-jerk, short-term strategies that might, through a degree of popularity, buy votes in the run-up to an election, but which in the longer term would work against the interests of us all as citizens, regardless of political persuasion.

 I am very grateful. May I probe a little deeper into what the right hon. Gentleman is saying? He will be aware that a school of thought exists today whereby the publicity and policy making that have accompanied the events of the past few years in reality constitute an attempt by a particular part of the political spectrum in the west to create a &quot;new enemy&quot; to replace the one that existed during the cold war, and that the threat of al-Qaeda has been exaggerated to promote a particular style of politics. Does he share that concern?

 I do not doubt that there are some who are of that mindset, and that the absence of the old fixed certainties&#151;which were physically embodied in the presence of the Berlin wall and in the competing values and weapons systems that lay on either side of it&#151;has created something of a void. However, I do not subscribe to the view that that has somehow left all politics in a moral vacuum, and I doubt whether the leaders of the Conservative or Labour parties do either.

I shall deal briefly&#151;given that this philosophical excursion has lasted rather longer than I anticipated&#151;with the other measures in the Queen&#039;s Speech and indicate our stance. We support the education measures for 16&nbsp;to 19-year-olds, which are aimed essentially at part-time students. However, if we had had this legislative chance today, we would of course have legislated, as we have done in the Scottish Parliament, for a much fairer deal for our students&#151;a deal that does not involve the savage amount of personal debt that will result from the imposition of student fees, and from the top-up fees that will shortly accompany them, in England and Wales.

Apparently, the Labour party has launched a new website, called &quot;Proud to be British&quot;.

Britain is a good country; it has a sense of fair play and of tolerance and the other virtues that I referred to earlier.

The people of this country deserve that to be debated in a mature and rational way, and to have it put forward as a set of principles and a coherent view of Britain today and Britain&#039;s role in the world.

 First, I associate myself with the comments of the mover and seconder of the loyal address. My hon. Friends addressed the House with grace and wit, and created a sense of fun. Of course, we do not really come here to enjoy ourselves; anyone who wants to leave the Chamber now is free to do so, before I start boring hon. Members to death.
</p>

This Queen&#039;s Speech contains many measures and, in common with what has been said in the newspapers over the past few days, I believe that it is a Queen&#039;s Speech for an election. I am reliably informed by the Sunday papers that it is based on the themes of security and opportunity. Those are certainly fine sentiments. We have talked about being British and I believe that we are entitled to expect any British Government to ensure that we can enjoy both security and opportunity. Those will be the themes of Labour&#039;s general election manifesto.

Hon. Members will not be surprised to hear me say, as I have before, that at the heart of that economic strategy must be the continuing development of a manufacturing strategy. I believe that the Government have paid proper attention to that, but more needs to be done. I want to say sincerely, not just in passing, that the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Manufacturing Advisory Service, set up by the Government, is now working effectively across the nation. In my region of the west midlands especially, it is making an important contribution to companies and firms that wish to take on innovative processes, find new ways of doing things and share that information with the particular sector in which they are operating. There is no question but that the service has made a serious contribution to companies and I pay tribute to it.

<p><a name="41123-11_spnew1"><b> Mr. Peter Pike  (Burnley) (Lab):</b> 
 My hon. Friend represents a black country constituency and I represent a Lancashire constituency, both of which are heavily dependent on the manufacturing sector. My hon. Friend welcomes current developments, but is it not also important for the Government to do even more for research and development, especially if we are to advance the sharp-end industries such as aerospace, pharmaceuticals and so on?
</p>





<p><a name="41123-11_spnew2"><b> Mr. Purchase: </b> 
 My hon. Friend is absolutely right about the similarities between our constituencies. We both have aerospace sectors, which indeed provide the cutting edge of research and development, that are greedy and anxious for further investment in new products, blue-sky thinking and, most importantly, innovation. Our companies must innovate and bring useful products to the marketplace, which can also help the rest of the industry. I entirely accept my hon. Friend&#039;s point; we share the same view on that matter.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41123-11_para3">
I should like to make a couple of points about manufacturing. First, it has been tremendous to see the productivity gains that have been made by 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>23 Nov 2004 : Column 38</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>manufacturing industries. Many of those gains were forced by necessity as a result of difficult competitive conditions in Europe and worldwide. Despite those conditions, we have seen an annualised rate of something like 5&nbsp;per cent. growth in manufacturing productivity while the economy as a whole has also improved, but only by about half that annualised rate.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41123-11_para4">
Manufacturing employment, of course, has fallen by nearly 5&nbsp;per cent. in 2003&nbsp;alone, even though output has risen. That accounts mathematically for the improvement in productivity, but the loss of employment is keenly felt in my constituency. I cannot give the complete story, but I have to tell the House that a very important company in my constituency will make the sad announcement of its closure tomorrow. The company has manufactured in Wolverhampton for close on 100&nbsp;years, but its last 150&nbsp;jobs will be lost to the area tomorrow.
</p>





<p><a name="41123-11_spnew3"><b> Sir Nicholas Winterton  (Macclesfield) (Con):</b> 
 I share the hon. Gentleman&#039;s concern about the jobs that will be lost in his constituency. He and I are as one in our support for manufacturing. Will he state clearly that the Government can play a major role in ensuring a satisfactory and prosperous future for manufacturing industry by minimising social and additional oncosts? In addition, should not the Government ensure that, where possible, contracts are placed with UK manufacturing concerns? In this connection, I am thinking particularly about textiles and the Ministry of Defence. Does the hon. Gentleman agree that such contracts should not be placed with dubious holding companies or shell companies that place manufacturing overseas?
</p>





<p><a name="41123-11_spnew4"><b> Mr. Purchase: </b> 
 The hon. Gentleman describes the unacceptable face of capitalism when he talks about shell companies. It is unfortunate that some companies on the international stage feel that they can compete only by stripping out all the major costs incurred in an advanced economy like the UK&#039;s. I do not accept that the social costs of employment should be stripped out. When he uses the word &quot;minimising&quot;, does the hon. Gentleman mean that adequate provision will be made for workers? If so, I am with him entirely. However, I do not want such provision to be cut away to the level sometimes evident in the far east or Latin America, where workers are nothing but units of production with no social or economic life of their own. That is not the way forward for us. In fact, it was a member of the Conservative party who said that Britain would be lost if it had to compete only in terms of rates of pay for workers. We cannot win by taking that approach.
</p>





<p><a name="41123-11_spnew5"><b> Lembit &#214;pik  (Montgomeryshire) (LD):</b> 
 On that point, does the hon. Gentleman agree that companies have a lot to gain from the motivation and loyalty of their staff? Employers, especially in the textile industry&#151;and the Laura Ashley company has been creating uncertainty about employment in my area&#151;must recognise that the UK is a superb employment base, where workers will render loyal service as long as they feel that they are being treated like people.
</p>





<p><a name="41123-11_spnew6"><b> Mr. Purchase: </b> 
 The hon. Gentleman makes a point that I would be proud to make myself. He is absolutely right. One of my big disappointments is that my colleagues in this Labour Government have found it 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>23 Nov 2004 : Column 39</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>necessary to wait on legislation from Europe before improving the condition of workers in this country. In my view, a Labour Government should have been able to achieve that improvement on their own, but the improvement is being made, in the way that has been described, and I support that.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41123-11_para5">
I was talking about statistics. The fall in manufacturing employment is a serious problem, but output has risen by 5&nbsp;per cent., which accounts for the improvement in productivity. Manufacturing investment continues to rise, and national surveys reveal a considerable degree of confidence in manufacturing circles. That confidence may not be as high as it was a couple of years ago, but it is still quite strong. We have lots to build on, and lots to do. I believe that the manufacturing base in this country still represents the most important engine for growth of any sector in the whole economy.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41123-11_para6">
I want so speak briefly about Wolverhampton and the surrounding area. As a recent survey by the local chamber of commerce set out, the paradox is that although sales and profits are rising, there is a lack of growth in real confidence. That is mainly explained by cash flow difficulties and falling revenues, but also by business investment itself showing some degree of strength.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41123-11_para7">
It is a mixed picture, but what is important is that the Government give as much support as they can. That means creating an environment in which companies feel able to take on new workers and to cope with the legislation that we rain down on them from time to time. In the majority of cases, I believe that we do that for perfectly good, sound, sensible reasons, but sometimes we may not give enough lead-in time before laws take effect, and that can create difficulties, particularly for smaller companies that simply cannot cope with some of the legislation that we ask them to deal with, particularly that relating to what my colleagues describe as the work-life balance.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41123-11_para8">
I have told one of my right hon. Friends about a company in my constituency that employs 20&nbsp;women on hand presses and one or two smaller hydraulic presses. Two youngish men are employed as setters, and they also clean up the tools a bit and make sure everyone has enough work to do. There is one woman, in the office, doing the bits and pieces, and she has a little computer to get the payroll done and one or two other things. Finally, there is the owner of the company. It just so happens that both men&#151;nice men, married men&#151;have wives who are having babies. I really do not see how that company, which has 20&nbsp;women to keep moving on the presses, can afford to have the two setters off at the same time on paternity leave. I hope that my hon. Friends on the Front Bench will recognise that not all industry is made up of massive companies with enough resources to bring in different people at different times. In particular, the west midlands and the north-west have a plethora of smaller companies, sometimes with no more than half a dozen or 20&nbsp;workers. If one person is out of that work force, it creates quite a difficulty. I hope that the Government will understand what is said by people such as me who have spent 20&nbsp;or more years in industry and who try to understand the difficulties created when we introduce legislation. However laudable, sensible and honourable that legislation may seem&#151;much of it can

Our manufacturers are doing very well on exports. They are working damned hard. They are creating markets and going out to exploit the opportunities that arise.

There are many measures in the Queen&#039;s Speech, and many will be addressed later in a far more detailed way than I can even attempt today. I shall confine myself to two or three more points. I feel particularly strongly about educational opportunity and allowing all individuals to realise their full potential. I shall absolutely resist going down one particular route on that; those on the Liberal Democrat Front Bench are already smiling at me, but I will resist them, because that subject would not be helpful to what I want to say. My point is that my Front-Bench colleagues seem absolutely intent on change, change and more change, but I am not at all sure that all that change is compatible with improving opportunity or that people can continue to cope with it.

I have two good grammar schools in Wolverhampton, one for girls and a mixed one that is now private. They do excellent work; I have no quarrel with that. I want that excellence extended right across the secondary state sector. The only practical way to do that&#151;it remains as true now as it was in 1966&#151;is by bringing the skills that we need on to one site and to offer the curriculum choices that will, as it says in the Queen&#039;s Speech

We are extending financial support for 16&nbsp;to 19-year-olds. In my constituency that makes a great deal of sense. We were one of the pilot areas, and there is no doubt that the scheme has improved the staying-on rate, which was frankly pretty abysmal in my constituency and in the west midlands. Kids were leaving school at 16&nbsp;because that was the thing that they did. We have seen some changes. In the 1980s and 1990s employment opportunities were simply not there so it seemed to make sense to stay on at school. We have now consolidated that and there is no doubt that financial support&#151;it went as high as &#163;40&nbsp;a week for full attendance and good results&#151;has played an important role.

I approve of the creation of the Serious Organised Crime Agency. It is right to recognise the importance of tackling serious crime, especially money laundering, which is at the root of the drugs trade and prostitution&#151;things that worry me in my constituency. The police are working hard on it, but the problem goes underground and becomes taken as normal. I am afraid that the drugs trade, money laundering and prostitution are serious and growing problems. So I welcome the introduction of the Serious Organised Crime Agency, but I have to say that it sits pretty badly with the idea of introducing American money into casinos.

In the 1960s, Harold Wilson refused George Raft entry into the country because of his connection with gambling and organised crime.

Finally, I want to speak about a constituency problem that many Members may share. I can see little reference in the Queen&#039;s Speech to local government, yet one of the major problems I hear about in my surgeries is the lack of new council housing. We have a shortage of council housing under a Labour Government. If more council houses were built in Wolverhampton, I could fill any number of them. I do not want to prejudice anything else that is being done, but we need a new approach and money for new building. Selling council houses does not particularly worry me, provided that we build more. If we adopt a policy&#151;in the south, the midlands and the north&#151;of ensuring a good supply of council housing, it will solve many, many of our problems.

 It is a great pleasure to follow the hon. Member for Wolverhampton, North-East (Mr. Purchase), particularly as he stays in my constituency from time to time, and he is very welcome when he does. I did not agree with all that he said, but I did agree with him when he talked about the difficulties faced by small businesses in his constituency, when they find that unnecessarily burdensome regulations are imposed on them. However, much of that comes from the European Union, which he seemed to extol the virtues of in the latter part of his speech.

<a name="41123-12_para9">
This is a phoney Queen&#039;s Speech because its programme will be aborted by a general election, as the hon. Member for Wolverhampton, North-East has just implied. In fact, it is more a manifesto than a plan for legislation. The theme is clear: if it moves, ban it; if it does not, tax it. According to the Queen&#039;s Speech, there is a new menu for banning. We will apparently ban certain lottery causes, as well as goods and services that do not conform to certain religious beliefs. We will promote rural heritage, but we will ban the thing that symbolises rural heritage: hunting. I do not know why the Queen&#039;s Speech does not mention of banning the smoking of cigarettes in public places because we will apparently go ahead with that as well.

Certainly, taxation and private and public borrowing will be major issues at the next general election. The Queen&#039;s Speech talks of promoting economic stability, 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>23 Nov 2004 : Column 43</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>but not for a very long time has credit been so bloated. Various economists, such as Professor Congdon, have pointed out for some time the threat that that poses to economic stability, particularly given the prospect of inflation. They are saying that we cannot live for ever on borrowed money. That is as true of our economy as, for example, the American economy, where, as the House will know, the currency is now suffering under enormous pressure.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41123-12_para11">
In our economy, the effect on house prices of heavy borrowing has been sharp and immediate, not just because of recent increases in interest rates, but because the speculative bubble, blown up by credit, has now been pricked. A downward spiral has begun, as people hold back from buying property and sellers begin to feel the pinch of a much higher debt-to-asset ratio, and they in turn pull in their horns. Given the nature of the British housing market, the recessionary process can be very rapid, and the shock is greater because people have become unused to recessions in this country.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41123-12_para12">
The expansion of the British economy has been almost continuous for a quarter of a century. Its roots lie in the Thatcher reforms of the 1980s, particularly in the stabilisation of industrial relations; in the taming of trade union power; in the insulation of Britain from the worst excesses of EU regulations, which were referred to in the previous speech; and in the limits imposed on excessive taxation. All that added up to a British economic miracle, which was certainly the envy of the rest of Europe, if not the world.

The attempt by the Labour Government to keep in place key Conservative policies, which they defined as new Labour, was, in retrospect, bound to fail, although the pretence was kept up for most of the last Parliament. Tax policy produced the early cracks in the foundations. The &#163;5&nbsp;billion tax on pensions was introduced as early as July 1997. That was quickly followed by new health insurances taxes and swingeing increases in stamp duty. By early 1998, a further 13&nbsp;taxes had been introduced, including a cut in married couple&#039;s allowance. A steep rise in national insurance contributions came in early 1999, as did the total abolition of married couple&#039;s allowance and mortgage tax relief, together with a further 15&nbsp;rises in taxes. The big increases in national insurance contributions were made in 2002, and were followed by 10&nbsp;increases in taxes in 2003&#150;04.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41123-12_para14">
The total effect has been to increase the net tax and social security burden as a percentage of gross domestic product from 34.8&nbsp;per cent. in 1996&nbsp;to an estimated 36.5&nbsp;per cent. in 2004&#150;05, all of which has happened during a period of rapidly rising GDP. The effect on individuals, especially those in low income tax brackets, has been dramatic. The number of people who pay taxes has increased by 4.2&nbsp;million&#151;a dramatic figure&#151;between 1996&nbsp;and 2004. The number of taxpayers has risen from 25.7&nbsp;million to an estimated 29.9&nbsp;million this year. When taxes go up, the evidence from around the world is that the poorest off are the hardest hit.

It is also true that as well as the lowest paid being proportionately hardest hit by tax, they are the most vulnerable to unemployment, which is the inevitable secondary effect of high taxation. That is why the Conservative party is right, from the point of view of good economic management alone, to place the lowering of taxes high on its agenda for its return to office. A low-taxed economy happens to be a recipe for greater fairness and economic well-being. Economic management and social fairness are, however, not the only factors that guide Conservatives to the fundamental belief in the merits of low taxation. We Conservatives believe that, above all, it is a guarantee of personal freedom.

<a name="41123-13_para1">
The issue of how to cut taxes is not easy to address, particularly when the momentum towards ever-increasing taxation is as fast as it is at the moment. Certain taxes, such as the death tax, which is what the inheritance tax should be called, are theoretically easier to cut because, despite the emotion attached to them, they do not bring in much money to the Exchequer. In the case of inheritance tax, it is between &#163;2&nbsp;billion and &#163;3&nbsp;billion a year. As for the merits of the current level of inheritance tax, why should a person&#039;s home be taxed just because he has the misfortune to die in it? Why should he be able to sell it free of tax in life, but be taxed on its disposal in death?
</p>

<p>
<a name="41123-13_para2">
Cutting income tax in a way that carries real benefit to the general public is more difficult because the short-term loss of revenue is large. My personal view is that the way forward is to stabilise public spending to the rate of inflation and to divert real increases in GDP to tax cuts. In that way, national wealth will grow at a faster pace and in the medium term it will allow us to improve public services with budgetary impunity. There is also, of course, much that can be done to improve efficiency within the public services, about which parties on both sides of the House have talked. The need to cut waste is clear. In that context, I chair the Treasury Committee Sub-Committee, which recommended the amalgamation of Customs and Excise with the Inland Revenue, so I suppose I have to welcome that aspect of the Queen&#039;s Speech.

Raising taxes is not the only way in which Labour threatens to destroy the Thatcher legacy. The Government made it clear that they are once again willing to link arms with their founders and paymasters, the major trade unions, whose demands are firmly on the table. This summer, the four big unions&#151;Unison, Amicus, the Transport and General Workers union and the GMB&#151;began speaking clearly again with one voice.

 The hon. Gentleman will cheer even harder at this: the union will also insist on the right of trade unions to engage in secondary action. Mr.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Curran also called for a substantial rise in the minimum wage. One wonders whether reference in the Queen&#039;s speech to a law that streamlines railways is a direct response to that, in particular the call for renationalisation. Certainly, Tony Woodley, the general secretary of the T&G, wrote in the quasi Communist <i>Morning Star</i> in support of Kevin Curran, and he has attacked new Labour for being &quot;pro-business&quot;. What, in effect, those increasingly powerful trade unions are saying is that one cannot be a true member of the Labour party and support business at the same time. All that is having an effect on business confidence, and thus on this country&#039;s economic prospects.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41123-13_para5">
The third great issue threatening this country&#151;one to which the hon. Member for Wolverhampton, North-East addressed himself at the end of his speech&#151;is mentioned directly in the Queen&#039;s Speech: our relationship with Europe. As matters stand in the European Union, the process towards a federal state continues relentlessly, constitution or no constitution. The acquis communautaire, which is endemic in the Union treaties, ensures through the judgments of the European Court that the process moves in one direction and cannot be reversed. In the United Kingdom, the judgments of the European Court are supported by our courts under the terms of the European Communities Act 1972. That is true even when, as with the 1978&nbsp;Merchant Shipping Bill, the British Parliament tries to reverse the judgments of the European Court.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41123-13_para6">
The significance of the proposed constitution is that its adoption would mean that European law had primacy over our law and over member states in its own right. The primacy of European law would no longer rest on the foundation of an Act of the British Parliament which was reversible. A new system of law would be established in the UK of its own right. The only escape from that would be for the UK to leave the EU. Currently, that would be possible under article 59&nbsp;of the proposed constitution, but the article itself would be amendable through qualified majority voting in order to force countries to stay in the EU against their will. Although it is arguable that, in those circumstances, force majeure would apply, there would at the very least be legal chaos in which two separate systems of law would work side by side, in competition with each other.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41123-13_para7">
For those reasons, the Government&#039;s determination to adopt the new constitution needs to be resisted at every turn. For those who question the benefits of British membership of the European state, it is the single most important reason for rejecting the Government&#039;s claim in the Queen&#039;s Speech for continuing in office. Once the constitution is rejected&#151;and with it, de facto, the acquis communautaire&#151;it will become possible,

It was bound to be the case that a Labour Government, if left in office for too long, would destroy the legacy of the Thatcher revolution on which this country&#039;s economic recovery has been based. The case for Labour in the mid-1990s was that it would be best able to reform public services, in particular the health service. Beginning with the sacking of the right hon. Member for Birkenhead (Mr. Field) and, with him, throwing out pension reform, Labour has reverted to type. It has raised taxes and blown the proceeds, and now it is consolidating its return to its true roots by embracing trade union socialism.

It is all too easy to lump together disparate groups. It is important that we recognise that the actions of David Omand in the Cabinet Office are vital not only to the security of this country but to its liberty.

We also need to understand what those threats are and what the nation truly faces. The Spanish Government failed to do that and mixed up the terrorism of ETA and of al-Qaeda.

The way in which a networks react and operate is fundamentally different from that of individuals and entities, as any systems analyst would say.

We must remember that the key objective of any terrorist group is to get the Government and the security services to overreact. The biggest single recruiting sergeant for the IRA in the 1970s was the introduction of internment. That turned out to be a big mistake and turned the IRA into a coherent, organised and supported organisation. Why does Hamas survive? It is because it has tacit support in the community. Terrorism thrives only where there is a political vacuum, so a counter-terrorism Bill must include proper safeguards, however frustrating introducing them might seem. The law must be not only flexible enough to respond to terrorism but robust enough to prevent miscarriages of justice. Such details need to be examined in pre-legislative scrutiny.

It was costing the local authority &#163;300,000-plus to clean up after the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Travellers. A police sergeant was put in charge of the unit, and he can now use the powers of the police, landowners or the local authority&#151;he has the choice.

I would draw the Minister&#039;s attention to one further problem. If the Government successfully prosecute someone under the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002, they get the costs of the court case paid for, as well as getting the assets of the person who has been convicted. However, the arrangements are different for a local authority. Waltham Forest is the classic example. It took some people to court in a case involving intellectual property rights, and the judge rightly ordered the seizure of their assets under the Act. The local authority was not entitled to costs, however, because there was no money available. If the Government could extend to local authorities and the private sector the ability to cover the costs of bringing such a prosecution out of the seizure of assets, it would go a long way towards ensuring that other organisations, such as trading standards, could do their job properly. That is a loophole that needs to be dealt with.

I would also argue that we need to increase the role of special constables. Why is not every director of security in a bank also a special constable, for example? When they came across international fraud or money laundering, they would then have the power to take the appropriate action and to present their evidence to the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;police. Why should they have to rely on calling in the police? If they were special constables themselves, they could use those powers. That is what happens in Canada, and we should introduce such measures for our banks, internet service providers and other such organisations.

There is also a major problem of skills shortages in the justice system. There are only 240&nbsp;computer forensic officers in our police forces. If we are serious about tackling organised crime, we need to get the resources into what have traditionally been regarded as the Cinderella services, and I would argue strongly that we need massively to increase the resources going into that particular area. We also need to recognise the international aspect of this problem, and to ensure that issues of jurisdiction are tackled.

Finally, I welcome the inquiries Bill.

They have raised a number of issues that I hope that the Government will take on board from our report. They involve such matters as terms of reference, how the chair is selected, and the kind of secretarial support available. They also involve a review of recommendations, and of how an inquiry&#039;s recommendations are acted on. I would argue that there is also a greater role for Parliament in that Bill.

The Queen&#039;s Speech refers to two Bills on education: one to streamline standards and the other to extend the education maintenance grant and assistance for 16&nbsp;to 19-year-olds. Such assistance is particularly important in a constituency such as mine and in Barnsley overall. 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>23 Nov 2004 : Column 55</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>The objective of the Bill to streamline standards relates to a policy to allow more individuals to reach their full potential. One argument that I have always made on education is about the difference between individuality and individualism. I see individuality as being about enabling a person to reach their full potential. There was a setback in the form of an Act passed by Parliament during the past year, but I will not go into that; it is now history.

 The hon. Gentleman will be aware that, as my hon. Friend the Member for Wolverhampton, North-East pointed out, there has always been a fee structure in further education. Indeed, I did my O and A-levels as a student at night classes and I paid a fee for doing so. Previously, I worked for an employer who paid a fee for me to attend the local technical college for two years. There has always been a fee structure; the question is how we assimilate it in such a way that people can afford the fees. There is an absolute difference between that and the Act of last year&#151;but I do not want to get further involved with that. I want instead to refer to the notable developments that have taken place in education in my constituency and in Barnsley overall.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41123-16_para3">
We have a number of new primary schools. Previously, the primary schools were run-down; we had not had a new one for more than 25&nbsp;years. Now, we have two brand-new primary schools and a number of major refurbishments, which create an environment much more conducive to learning. At the same time, there have been a number of developments in the local secondary schools. On Friday, I had the privilege of attending Elmhirst secondary school to give out achievement certificates. It is the most improved school of last year; there has been a 31&nbsp;per cent. increase in attainment. The headmaster could say with great commitment that this year the improvement will be even more marked. Watch this space&#151;but the investment that the Government have put into education has clearly done a terrific amount to help to renew Barnsley.

That planning has involved the entire community looking at what Barnsley will be like in 30&nbsp;years. Education is at the centre of where we expect the town to be in 30&nbsp;years.

We have had a crime reduction and disorder partnership in Barnsley since 1995, and I have had the privilege of chairing it since that time. Much of our work has been recognised and adopted by the Government. I know that the Conservative party is rather sceptical about the role of support officers, but Conservatives should reflect further on the value of providing a framework in which community support officers work with the police. Right across the borough we have created what we call LPTs or local police teams, which consist of police officers working with community support officers and estate tenants with the help of local authority professional officers. The team has a social worker, a housing officer and has access to a legal adviser. As soon as a problem arises in a particular location, it can be dealt with and resolved pretty speedily.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41123-16_para6">
The LPTs have had a progressively effective impact. Comparing the last quarter with that of a year ago, Barnsley has seen a 51&nbsp;per cent. reduction in crime. There has been about a 30&nbsp;per cent. reduction in domestic burglary and a 20&nbsp;per cent. reduction in car crime. The co-ordinated approach is clearly working well. If Conservative Members want to know how crime support officers actually work in the LPTs, I invite them to visit Barnsley to see how it is done.

 I would accept that it is not mirrored across the country, but statistics show that, across the country, there has indeed been a reduction in domestic burglary, as in car crime, right across the piece. Although it is not exactly the same from one constituency to another, there is certainly clear evidence of improvement. We now have between 138,000&nbsp;to 140,000&nbsp;police officers, the largest number ever to operate in the UK, and they are working with

If the same provisions in the hon.

It provides a template that many other local authorities are actively considering. Positive developments in tackling crime are therefore evident and they are built on the back of what the Government have proposed for tackling antisocial behaviour.

Drugs are a big problem in Barnsley, as they are across the piece. In the late 1990s, we had an enormous problem with heroin. In 1997&#150;98&nbsp;the drug action team, which is part of the partnership, suggested that as many as 5,000&nbsp;people regularly took heroin. Since then, we have provided a number of overlapping programmes, with some going into primary schools and some into secondary schools, and a recent report from the DAT suggests that great improvements have been made. There has been a fall in the number of people taking class A drugs and the number of young people starting to take such drugs, which shows that many of the national framework&#039;s programmes are indeed beginning to work.

This year&#039;s heroin crop in Afghanistan, estimated at 3,500&nbsp;tonnes with a market value in excess of &#163;30&nbsp;billion, could undo much of the good work that has been done in our communities. We need to concentrate on what we, as the lead nation, can do in tackling opium eradication in Afghanistan. Although eradication is vital to that country&#039;s future as it is to the welfare of our communities in the UK, we need to be aware that sustainable eradication programmes take considerable time to work through. It is necessary to build viable communities and replace institutions.

Some have suggested that aerial spraying is the best way to eradicate the poppy crop and get on top of the opium problem in Afghanistan, but it would be a disaster and would undermine much of what has already been done. The provisional reconstruction teams have an opportunity to engage effectively with the community, but if we were to embark on an aerial spraying eradication programme it would undermine the good relationships that have been built up. Rather, we should put in place an income substitution programme and help to introduce new crops for farmers or to create industries in which the farmers could earn incomes other than from poppy growing. If we were to do otherwise, it undermine all that has been achieved in Afghanistan. I hope that Front Benchers are listening and taking notes, because it is crucial to get that message across to those who are proposing aerial spraying as the way forward.

He did not forecast that when he was running for election in 1997.

We are told that the Government will introduce legislation to increase security for all, and I wish them well with that. I do not know what the answer to terrorism is. The climate today is that a person is willing to sacrifice his or her own life in order to kill others. What is the deterrent against that? Again, and in the light of what they have done since 1997, I say that I have absolutely no faith that the Government have any clue about how to deal with security.

On identity cards, I was the first Member of this House to introduce a ten-minute Bill on this matter, and I am sick to death of just talking about it.

The Gracious Speech also says that the powers of the police and others to fight crime will be strengthened. For goodness&#039; sake! We are to have eight Home Office Bills. When the Conservatives came to power in 1979, police morale was rock bottom, and the very first thing we did was to introduce the Edmund-Davies report, which restored morale. It is a waste of time introducing more laws that will not be enforced. The problem is one of management. Far too many excellent officers take early retirement because they are stressed or for other reasons. That leaves us a police force that simply does not have the experience it needs. It is no good all officers being young. We are all on life&#039;s journey, and we need a mix of ages, common sense and proper training for the police. Having special constables walking around in exactly the same uniforms as properly trained police officers, pretending to the general public that they are the same, is absolutely ridiculous. The management of our police force needs to be dealt with, and we need to restore morale.

It is absolutely ridiculous for any Member of Parliament to say that it is all right to take cannabis and that it does not damage health. It is a disgrace, and when we have a Conservative Government I hope that they will change all that.

Because of a complete mess-up with the timing of the prosecution, by one week, the only thing that has been done to that person is the imposition of a &#163;60&nbsp;fine.

We have a mobile society&#151;people move from bedsitter land to different areas&#151;so there were problems with registration, particularly in black communities and deprived areas. About 2&nbsp;million people were missing from electoral registers. That was tackled to some extent by the current Government in the Representation of the People Act 2000, which introduced a version of rolling registers, but that still has not tackled the problem properly.

Would not identity cards be of great value in securing electoral registration? If we gave votes to people at the age of 16&nbsp;and ensured, through the schools system, that registration for identity cards started as people were reaching that age, that could be used to track them for electoral registration purposes, wherever they move in the United Kingdom, to achieve their rights. A democracy should have as its first building blocks the vote and the ballot. I argued earlier that voting was not enough in Iraq, but it is the starter and it must be universal. We should do all that we can to establish universal provision, so I shall try to persuade the Home Secretary to switch more to that agenda. He says that he is sympathetic, but we must ensure that that agenda is delivered.

I introduced a further private Member&#039;s Bill on civil rights for disabled people when I drew lucky in the ballot a couple of years later. Alf Morris, now Lord Morris, had introduced a similar measure in 1992, and my hon. Friend the Member for Kingswood (Mr. Berry) had introduced a dramatic version on the Floor of the House in 1994. In 1995, the then Conservative Government opposed my Bill because they had introduced the Disability Discrimination Act 1995&nbsp;in conflict with it. At that time, the views on how far we should go with civil rights for disabled people were solidly divided into two camps.

<a name="41123-19_para6">
This Government have extended the interpretation of the 1995&nbsp;Act and introduced legislation to establish the Disability Rights Commission. In fact, that was done with the support of those on the Conservative Front Bench. Things have moved considerably in that period. The next stage is that we now need to get nearer to achieving civil rights for disabled people, and we need to stop the people who discriminate. Like the arguments of race, gender and age, people should not be able to use the argument of disability to discriminate against other individuals. No one should be able to discriminate by perceived, actual, past and possible future disability. The notion that people should discriminate on the ground of disability is very peculiar because we could all be disabled in the future&#151;I am much more disabled than I used to be&#151;so it is like people discriminating against themselves or their possible future selves. That could not happen with other forms of discrimination. We can understand, without agreeing, why people discriminate in other areas.

Finally, I want to deal with the points about the European Union made in the Queen&#039;s Speech. Ever since the days of Harold Wilson when the vote was lost and we argued &quot;No&quot;, pointing to the undemocratic, bureaucratic and essentially capitalist nature of the EU, my position on the EU has not changed, but there is no use arguing against a two thirds vote against us in the hope that things will alter very considerably. We must get in and seek to change things.

 I thank you for calling me to speak, Madam Deputy Speaker.

I came from those talks directly to the House, and I appreciate you calling me to speak in the debate.

Of course, that is why the talks have taken place and why my party has taken part in those talks. The Prime Minister made it clear what the basis and aims of the talks are. I refer the House to a statement that he made in the city of Belfast on 17&nbsp;October 2002, in which he said:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;Another inch by inch negotiation won&#039;t work. Symbolic gestures, important in their time, no longer build trust. It is time for acts of completion. Republicans to make the commitment to exclusively peaceful means, real, total and permanent. For all of us, an end to tolerance of paramilitary activity in any form.

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;aware that in the past two days my party has met the Minister with responsibility for security in Northern Ireland and the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland. We put one question to both: what is an act of completion? Does it consist of IRA-Sinn Fein repudiating and ceasing violence and being disbanded, or does it simply mean that they make a statement that they will give up violence? Can the Prime Minister tell us what he believes it means?&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="41123-19_para14">
The Prime Minister replied:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;I can. It is not merely a statement, a declaration or words.

<p>
<a name="41123-19_para16">
Running with that is that we need not only full decommissioning but an end to the criminal activities of IRA-Sinn Fein. The Prime Minister made it clear that he also believed that they must cease. Then I read in a newspaper this week that a leading member of Sinn Fein in the south of Ireland is spying on senior Fianna Fail and Fine Gael politicians, and there is a hue and a cry from IRA-Sinn Fein that the Dublin courts do not provide justice and that that man should not be condemned. So the IRA is busily engaged in those activities.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41123-19_para17">
Some people say to me, &quot;But Ian, is it not a fact that things are now different?&quot; People should not be deceived. We do not have a normal situation in Northern Ireland. I have the last report made to the Northern Ireland Policing Board by the Chief Constable. He gave the figures for what happened last year, and this year as far as they go. The number of persons charged with terrorist offences was 56&nbsp;in April to September 2003, and 41&nbsp;in April to September 2004. That is not a big reduction or normalisation. The number of deaths occurring as a result of the security situation was four in April to September 2003, and three in April to September 2004. The number of shooting incidents was 103&nbsp;in April to September 2003, and 103&nbsp;in April to September 2004. The number of bombing incidents was 26&nbsp;in April to September 2003, and 37&nbsp;in April to September 2004. The number of casualties arising from paramilitary-style attacks was 149&nbsp;in April to September 2003, and 116&nbsp;in April to September 2004.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41123-19_para18">
The situation is not normal. It is essential not only that IRA-Sinn Fein put away all their guns and that those are seen to be put out of use for ever, but that we see what happens to their massive criminal activity. Something like &#163;500,000&nbsp;of cigarettes were recently stolen from the Gallaher&#039;s factory. All those things are piling up, as well as the bombings, killings, targeting, recruiting and so on. The Government have to face up to the problem. Yet in the midst of that we are told that, because of normalisation, certain things are to take place and the Royal Irish Regiment is to be cut. In fact, steps have been taken eventually to disband that regiment altogether.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41123-19_para19">
We need to keep those things in mind when great pressure is put on Northern Ireland&#039;s politicians to make a settlement. If there is to be real peace in Northern Ireland, IRA-Sinn Fein must give up all their weapons in a way that the ordinary man in the street knows that it has been done. It must be clear and open, and there must be a ceasing of their criminal activities and those activities that continually put a black spot on our Province. The soldiers of the RIR deserve honest treatment. They need honesty, clarity and certainty about what is happening to their regiment.

They claim the right to keep them, and any royalties for printing them in a newspaper will be paid to the IRA. That is what they are at now. All I can say to the House is that I believe that both Governments must put to an end to that by standing up and saying, &quot;Do what the Prime Minister said. Let us have completion.

As I listened to the Queen&#039;s Speech, I was struck by two things. The first was that this Queen&#039;s Speech is a clear indicator that the Government are increasingly out of touch. That is perhaps inevitable when one has been in office for several years, had one&#039;s diary organised every day, made ministerial visits in which one is met by welcoming parties and been told what one wants to hear by all around. The second was that, wrapped in all the Bill titles and messages in the Gracious Speech is the Government&#039;s obsession with spin. This Queen&#039;s Speech is about fighting a general election campaign. It is a public relations exercise, which is the wrong strategy for the country. The Bills mentioned will not make the difference claimed by the Government. I look forward, over the next few months, to taking messages from our side of the House to the country, to explain precisely why the Government&#039;s strategy is wrong, will not work and cannot work.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41123-20_para8">
Put simply, the Government seem to believe that new laws mean action. If that were true, we would not this year have a Queen&#039;s Speech full of Bills from the Home 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>23 Nov 2004 : Column 72</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>Office&#151;another series of Bills designed to tackle crime and disorder. Over the past seven years, we have had endless Bills on crime and disorder&#151;more than 20&#151;including the Crime and Disorder Act 1998, the Criminal Justice (Terrorism and Conspiracy) Act 1998, the Youth Justice and Criminal Evidence Act 1999, the Criminal Justice and Court Services Act 2000, the Anti-terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001, the Police Reform Act 2002&nbsp;and another Criminal Justice Act in 2003. Yet crime is becoming more and more of a problem for more and more people in our society, despite the Government&#039;s claims. Out there, our constituents, including those of Ministers, find that crime, antisocial behaviour and the threat of violence on our streets are getting worse and worse, year by year.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41123-20_para9">
What is the Government&#039;s response to all that? A propensity to establish new offences where none is needed. I can think of two obvious recent examples. The Government, to create a headline, introduced legislation on the use of mobile phones while driving, but the existing offence of careless driving was perfectly adequate to do the job. We voted recently in this place on smacking, but there exists an offence, assault, which is perfectly adequate for dealing with genuine violence against children. Too often the Government introduce Bills and create new offences, not because that will make a difference in the fight against crime but because they want to create the impression that they are trying to do something in that fight.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41123-20_para10">
What we need is proper enforcement of existing laws. The police do not say that they need more offences to deal with people. When one goes out on a Saturday night with one&#039;s local police force, as I suspect Members on both sides of the House do, one does not hear those officers asking for additional penalties to levy on offenders. They say, &quot;I wish we just had a few more officers on the beat. We wish we were not one of only two cars on patrol in a wide area.&quot; We need more police officers on the streets and less bureaucracy.

 The Minister says that we have them. I can tell him that I recently talked to a chief superintendent in my area, who said that the truth is that we have far fewer police on the streets today than we did 10&nbsp;years ago, not because they are fewer in number, but because the police are now committed to doing so much stuff behind the scenes on behalf of the Government: collecting data, filling in forms and dealing with a raft of bureaucracies that simply did not exist a generation ago. That means that, out on the streets, the thin blue line is thinner than it has ever been. If the Minister does not accept that, he is simply reinforcing my point that the Government are increasingly out of touch.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41123-20_para11">
What is the experience on the ground? Let me share some experiences with the Minister, since he does not believe me. Earlier this year, I did an exchange with the hon. Member for Liverpool, Riverside (Mrs. Ellman). I went and spent some time in some of the rougher areas in her constituency, where I talked to people who are suffering from antisocial behaviour. I remember talking to one young family in particular. They live in a run-down block, and every night a gang of youths comes into the stairwell outside the flat, takes drugs, causes trouble and vandalises the place extensively. One has to 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>23 Nov 2004 : Column 73</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>ask: where are the police? When someone is in that position, being traumatised, night after night, is it really beyond the wit and wisdom of our society to deliver policing to tackle those problems? That experience is shared by people across the country. When they seek and need the police, the police are not there. That is not because officers are not committed. We have some fine police officers in this country, but there are not enough of them on the streets and in patrol cars to do the job when needed.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41123-20_para12">
In my constituency, which is in many respects a great contrast to that of the hon. Member for Liverpool, Riverside, the lack of police presence is all too common. We had a terrible case recently. A young man walking across a recreation ground late at night was tackled by a gang of young people. He was assaulted, viciously attacked, had a number of his teeth kicked out and was left unconscious. The police took 45&nbsp;minutes to arrive. The ambulance got there first, and the ambulance staff were assaulted by the gang of yobs. It is simply not good enough that the police took 45&nbsp;minutes to arrive.

<a name="41123-20_para13">
The police try to do something about antisocial behaviour. To give another example from my constituency, a local beat officer faced a problem of over-18s buying alcohol for under-18s. He wanted to point a closed-circuit television camera at a specific off licence to enable him to identify those buying alcohol for under-age groups. He said that it took days of paperwork to enable him to do so&#151;endless form-filling and process just to tackle one problem. That is madness and it should not be happening.

 The hon. Gentleman is painting a very bleak picture of what some of our emergency services have to deal with, and to a certain extent I agree with him. I know only too well of instances of ambulances arriving at a public house where there has been an incident and of ambulance officers being attacked by people on the licensed premises. There seems to have been a breakdown in society. Can the hon. Gentleman point to a time when he believes that that breakdown began?

 I know what the hon. Gentleman is encouraging me to say. I could pick 1997&nbsp;as an obvious time when the decline started. He would no doubt try to claim that it began in 1979. I think that it has been a trend over the past 40&nbsp;or 50&nbsp;years, and it is accelerating. The level of respect in our society is decreasing and the likelihood of people stepping outside conventional, legal, law-abiding behaviour is increasing as time goes by, and we must address that.

Hon. Members who have talked about the need for a broad range of solutions and for different agencies to work together to bring different ideas to bear on the problem are all absolutely right.

 The hon. Gentleman is right. As I said a moment ago, the problem does not have a single solution. Active and proactive participation from all those involved is required; licensees clearly have a role to play in reducing antisocial behaviour. None the less, where there is trouble, illegality and disorder, the police are too often unable to do anything about it. A couple of years ago, there was a large illegal rave involving 2,000&nbsp;or 3,000&nbsp;people just outside my constituency. As the event started to build, 12&nbsp;officers were available in the local station in Kingston. They said that there was nothing that they could do, so the event built up and became a major public order problem. We simply do not have enough officers to deal with problems when they arise.

None of these problems will be solved by a raft of new legislation or increased bureaucracy&#151;by Metropolitan police officers having to fill in forms every time they stop someone on the streets. I wait patiently, but probably fruitlessly, for the Government to realise that we will reduce crime only if we put the police back into pole position&#151;if we give them real power again, trust them with the job and get them out of police stations and back on to the streets to do the job that we need them to do: fair but tough policing of such problems.

If ever there were a symbol of a Government whose transport policy has been in chaos, continues to be in chaos and will be in chaos until we can finally get rid of them, it is the railways Bill.

It was the Government&#039;s great answer to the problems of the railways. &quot;The terrible Tories&quot;, they said, &quot;have privatised the railways and caused chaos. Our Strategic Rail Authority will solve the problem.&quot; Three or four years later, the Government have discovered that it does not work. Sadly, I have no confidence that the alternative announced today will do any better. We are seeing the creeping renationalisation of the railways. Many responsibilities for the management of the network are being passed to Network Rail, which is a creature of Government. The remainder are being passed back to the Department for Transport.

There are more passengers on our railways today than before the Beeching cuts were made to a much larger rail network. I travel into Waterloo in the mornings, and it would not matter who owned or controlled the railways, because there are too many trains chasing too few slots, too few platforms and too little space at key junctions. It is not about ownership or control, but about measures to alleviate congestion.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41123-21_para5">
One tragedy of the past few years was that the SRA produced a clear strategy to address some of the pinch points on the network, including on the routes through my constituency, but within a few months of those ideas being put forward the Government shelved them all. All around the country there are opportunities to ease congestion that this Government have passed by. That is a great loss. When Labour loses office, people will look back on transport policy as one of its great failings.

The references to education in the Gracious Speech had a heavy element of double-speak:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;The Government will continue to legislate to allow local authorities to provide innovative and safe school transport&quot;,</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="41123-21_para7">
which really means that the Government will continue to make progress on passing a law that will end the provision of free school transport. The Gracious Speech also said:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;A Bill will be introduced to extend financial support for 16&nbsp;to 19&nbsp;year olds engaged in training and education.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="41123-21_para8">
That really means that the Government will charge substantially higher fees to those in our colleges who study at level 3&nbsp;and above and who are over the age of 19. That is top-up fees mark II. If one reads the documentation behind the proposed measure, one sees great commonality between what the Government said about top-up fees and what they are now saying about the new proposal. They are saying that people who get higher qualifications earn a premium in their professional and working lives, so they should contribute more to the education that they receive. The hon. Member for North-East Derbyshire (Mr. Barnes), who is no longer in his place, talked about his experience of coming to qualifications slightly later in life than many people. Somebody who leaves school at 16&nbsp;having failed in their exams, goes back to college immediately to try again and works their way through level 1&nbsp;and level 2&nbsp;qualifications will probably be 19&nbsp;before they set about obtaining a level 3&nbsp;qualification. Such a person will now be charged a 50&nbsp;per cent. higher fee.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41123-21_para9">
Across the further education sector, there will be examples of people who are trying to broaden their skills and to move themselves to the next stage professionally, but who will lose out significantly. Such people may be deterred by the measure, which is not about deferred fee payments in further education; it is about money up front, paid by the students, many of whom will turn away from education and training as a result. For all the Government&#039;s great words about commitment to broadening educational access to all, the measure is a retrograde step that they will come to regret.

 I remind the House of the business interests recorded in the register.

<a name="41123-21_para11">
The Government are very keen on warnings. There are new health warnings on cigarettes, and there are to be wealth warnings on credit card statements. I think that there should be a label displaying a clear warning at the bottom of Queen&#039;s Speeches. Today&#039;s speech was something of a deception. By my reckoning, at least two thirds of the Bills will never become Acts. Worse, there are phrases in the Queen&#039;s Speech that are a sham:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;My Government will continue to take forward&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. the constitutional legislation introduced last year.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="41123-21_para12">
Let us be clear about that. The constitutional legislation introduced last year is not going on to the statute book this year, and I very much doubt that it will do so in any year. Even more disgracefully, we were told:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;Measures to reform the law on mental health will continue to undergo pre-legislative scrutiny.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="41123-21_para13">
Those measures are updating legislation that is now 20&nbsp;years old. More than four years ago, the then Secretary of State for Health promised me that it was a Government priority, but it is still at the stage of pre-legislative scrutiny. That is simply not good enough for a Government who were committed to introducing them.

There is always something to welcome in any Queen&#039;s Speech. I particularly welcome the measures on animal welfare and against animal welfare extremism, which are very important. I also welcome the Bill to merge the Inland Revenue and Customs. I do so on behalf of the Select Committee on the Treasury, which recommended such action almost five years ago. I have to tell the House that the Government then turned down our recommendation, and it is only now, some four and half years later and after the O&#039;Donnell review, that it has finally been accepted.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41123-21_para15">
The Treasury Committee reported on the O&#039;Donnell review as well, and I hope that the Bill that is introduced to complete the merger takes account of our two major concerns. First, we were concerned that merging two very large organisations with very different cultures should not put at risk the collection of the revenue and the service that individual and business taxpayers deserve to receive. Secondly, confidentiality should be protected and indeed enhanced in statute. That is all the more important because the two departments and their policy-making arms are now being moved into the Treasury building itself, and the arm&#039;s length relationship that should exist between Treasury Ministers and Revenue officials may become all the more suspect when they are sharing the same corridor, building or cafeteria. I hope that those two reservations or concerns will be taken into account when the Bill is introduced.

I also notice&#151;it is possible that they Deputy Leader of the House can help me on this&#151;no reference anywhere in the Queen&#039;s Speech to legislation to reform statistics. The way in which this Government have treated statistics is nothing short of disgraceful. First, they promised a statutory framework to make statistics truly independent of Government. Having spent four years producing the code of practice, they have welched on that responsibility and not introduced the necessary legislation. That is all the more important when national statistics and the national statistician are being dragged into the political arena because the Government have set themselves all these different targets and have then expected statistics to be thrown up to measure their achievement or otherwise.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41123-21_para17">
It is all the more important that we put the Office for National Statistics on a basis that is truly independent of Government. At the moment, its staffing and resourcing, as well as, indeed, the staffing and resourcing of the body that supervises national statistics, the Statistics Commission, depend on the Treasury budget. The national statistician and the ONS are still responsible to a Treasury Minister. That is not good enough in a modern democracy, and we should legislate soon to give ourselves the independent department of statistics and independent office of the national statistician that other modern democracies have.

As some of my hon. Friends have said, the Government are still flailing around improving security and public behaviour. We spend weeks in this building debating banning smacking, smoking and hunting, and suddenly the Government wake up and realise that, with an election coming, they have to deal properly with terrorism and yob culture. If these terrorism Bills are now so necessary, why has it taken the Government three years after September 2001&nbsp;to tighten our security? Was it that the original Bills were so badly drafted that new offences have suddenly proved necessary? Why, three years after that dreadful act, are the Government still flailing around trying to come up with the right legislative response? On antisocial behaviour, why is this now their third attempt to improve the legislation to give the police and local authorities the powers that they really need to crack down on such behaviour? I do not think that that is good enough.

Secondly, I would like to see much tougher enforcement powers. The Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004&nbsp;has just gone through the House, and the Government missed the opportunity to give local authorities the powers that they need to enforce the planning rules. Thirdly, I suggest to the Government that we need a stricter definition of just who these Travellers are. On investigation, far too many of them turn out not to be wandering itinerant people, but to have had or have homes or assets in this country; quite often, they have considerable wealth in this country that enables them to purchase fields to carry out significant and substantial infrastructure works to build up sites for what are clearly commercial purposes. I apologise to the hon. Member for North-West Leicestershire (David Taylor) for keeping him waiting.

 I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for giving way at this point.

 The hon. Gentleman was courteous enough to accept my three points, and I will accept his, but those are all matters that we could put right in this House through legislation.

For individual taxpayers, it would have been refreshing had the Government announced that they were going to look again at their horrendous tax credits system, under which people are paid too late, then overpaid and asked to refund the money, and find that the helpline does not work, that the staff whom they deal with are constantly changed and that complaints are lost. That system does not help those of our constituents who need the most help. It is exactly the same with the Child Support Agency, as was proved by the resignation of its chief executive. There are the same computer faults, the same poor customer service, and the same helpline inadequacies. Why are our surgeries and advice bureaux full of constituents complaining about their tax credit award, the overpayment that is demanded to be repaid, or the negligence of the Child Support Agency? Why do they come to us to sort out such problems when the Government are running bureaucracies that should be eliminating them?

For business, the Queen&#039;s Speech does not reflect the Secretary of State&#039;s last-minute U-turn and her sudden, new-found interest in deregulation and simplification, as I could find no specific measures on those topics. Last year, the Treasury Sub-Committee reported on the administrative cost of tax compliance, pointing to factors such as the company car scheme and statutory sick pay, which impose an unnecessarily complicated burden on business that Government could easily eradicate. They could easily exempt smaller businesses from all this new legislation until it is properly proven. They could confine the various tax changes to a single day in the tax calendar, thus helping small firms, in particular, to budget better for the year ahead. I appreciate that the Department for Work and Pensions is trying to confine the implementation date for legislation to two points in the financial year, but other Departments across Whitehall have not followed suit, and it remains true that several such changes are introduced at different points.

 The legislative programme put before us today contains some very interesting Bills, including some that we might support should they ever be put to a vote.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41123-22_para8">
At the centre of the Queen&#039;s Speech is the law and order and terrorism agenda. It is a shame that the Government came to power claiming to restore hope but now cling to office by turning to the politics of fear. This Queen&#039;s Speech is clearly a prelude to a general election campaign in which fear and terror will be placed at the heart of the Government&#039;s proposals. It is probable that leaflets accusing those who have the temerity not to agree wholeheartedly with ID cards of being soft on crime are already winging their way to the printers and will soon be coming through a door near us. In 1997, Labour told us, &quot;Things can only get better&quot;. That now has a hollow ring, but perhaps its 2001&nbsp;anthem, &quot;Lifted&quot;, will take on a new meaning should many of these measures go through.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41123-22_para9">
At the heart of the Government&#039;s agenda is the Bill on identity cards, but that has already descended into utter confusion with Ministers all over the place on what ID cards are and what they are meant to achieve. I heard one Minister on the radio at lunchtime describing ID cards as a means of dealing with identity fraud, asylum, crime, fraud in public services and terrorism, as well as offering gold-plated proof of identity. That is a lot for one little card to manage to do. Other Ministers have told us that they are no different from a store card or a driving licence. Well, frankly, they cannot be both. Either they are an aid to fighting terrorism or they are no different from a store card.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41123-22_para10">
We were presented with a vision by one Minister who said, &quot;When people are stopped in their car and they don&#039;t have their driving licence with them, they can hand it in to the police later on. That&#039;s all right; there&#039;s no problem with that.&quot; However, it strikes me that, if an identity card is meant to deter terrorism, it would fail in that objective if the police were to stop a suspected terrorist and say, &quot;We suspect you of terrorism. Where is your identity card?&quot;, and, on being told, &quot;I don&#039;t have it&quot;, asked the person to hand it in to the police within 72&nbsp;hours, 14&nbsp;days, or whatever. That would rather defeat the purpose.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41123-22_para11">
So, what is the identity card for? That is the crux of the proposal, and of the muddled thinking behind it. It is even worse when we consider the situation in Scotland. The Scottish Executive have&#151;quite rightly, in my view&#151;said that they will not make identity cards compulsory for services delivered under the devolved Administration. However, in an earlier exchange with my hon. Friend the Member for Banff and Buchan (Mr.&nbsp;Salmond), the Prime Minister confirmed that, as far as the Westminster Government were concerned, identity cards would be compulsory for services 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>23 Nov 2004 : Column 81</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>delivered from Westminster Departments. So we now face the ridiculous situation in which, if someone wanted to go to a doctor or hospital in Scotland, they would not need to present an identity card, but if they wanted to pick up their pension or their benefit, they would have to do so. That is a recipe for utter confusion, if ever there was one. It gets worse, however. We are told that identity cards are essential in protecting those services. I have many elderly constituents who are already struggling with Post Office card accounts and bank cards, and the PIN numbers that go with them. They will now also have to struggle with an identity card when they try to collect their pension. That, too, is a recipe for utter confusion.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41123-22_para12">
We are told that the cards will not be compulsory. The Prime Minister suggested that they would be voluntary to start with, moving towards compulsion. As I understand it, however, anyone who applies for a passport will also have to apply for an identity card at the same time, and pay an increased fee to get it. A Minister said on the radio today that that would involve 80&nbsp;per cent. of the population. That sounds pretty compulsory to me. The difference between identity cards and driving licences, store cards or any other cards is that people have a choice whether to apply for one of those cards, but they would not have a choice in regard to an identity card, as they will become compulsory.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41123-22_para13">
The logic behind the system is that the card will become compulsory anyway, but its application will have to become stricter if it is to have any chance of dealing with the many things that people claim that it will tackle. It will become compulsory, whether we like it or not. It will become compulsory in Scotland by stealth for the same reason, and that is something that the Executive need to deal with. If the Government want to make it compulsory, they should debate the issue on those terms, rather than in the wishy-washy way in which they are doing at the moment, saying, &quot;Oh, it&#039;s not really compulsory. You&#039;ll get used to it. It&#039;s all voluntary.&quot; That is simply not true. It will become compulsory because that is the logic of the system that they are introducing.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41123-22_para14">
Worse than that is the fact that the identity card scheme is unlikely to produce the desired result. Let us take the example of the fight against terrorism. We all agree that terrorism is a problem that we need to fight against, but the argument should be about the best way of doing that. I suggest that identity cards will not offer effective protection against terrorism. In the most high-profile al-Qaeda attacks, terrorists either moved across borders using tourist visas&#151;as they did in the 11&nbsp;September attacks&#151;or were already domiciled in the country concerned and equipped with legitimate identity cards, as in the case of the Madrid bombings. There is no evidence that identity cards would have any impact on dealing with the terrorist threat.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41123-22_para15">
Also, fraud will be committed in any system. Many of those who take part in organised crime and terrorism will already have several passports and identity cards from other areas. In the United States, they might perhaps have driving licences from several states. That is already an established way of getting round identity checks, and one new card from the UK is not going to make any difference. However, Ministers have said that there will be a significant difference because of the 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>23 Nov 2004 : Column 82</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>biometric data that will be stored on the card. We are told that that will involve cutting-edge technology, and that that will be the answer to the problem.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41123-22_para16">
However, the technology is unproven and has never been used on a large scale. I think that the hon. Member for Milton Keynes, North-East (Brian White) said earlier that the biggest existing biometric database held information on only some 2,000&nbsp;individuals, but we are talking about a UK-wide system that would be required to cover millions of individuals, and whose technology would have to work. I&#151;and, I suspect, most other hon. Members&#151;have a filing cabinet full of cases involving constituents whose lives have been blighted by the failures of the computer system at the Child Support Agency. The Government have an appalling record on computer systems, not just at the CSA. Other hon. Members have mentioned the Passport Agency, the immigration service, and even the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency. The stark reality is that the Government, whose record on computer systems is shocking, are proposing to introduce a system to deal with something as important as identity cards, using unproven technology.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41123-22_para17">
How are we to collect this biometric data, if the system is to be semi-voluntary? Will people be obliged to give an iris print, a blood sample or a fingerprint? How would that be consistent with traditional civil liberties in the UK? Are we going to be given the opportunity to say that we do not want this? No, we are not, because eventually we shall need the card to make a hospital visit, to collect benefits and pensions, and to do everything else. Identity cards are a very bad idea. I am sure that we shall all be accused of being soft on crime if we press ahead and oppose them, but we are going to oppose them, because we are not convinced that they will go any way towards doing what is claimed.

<a name="41123-22_para18">
We have heard about the Bill to set up a British FBI, as it is already colloquially called. There might be some merit behind that proposal, provided that proper care is taken with Scots law. Again, however, we need to know more details. Much has been made of the railways Bill, which we will probably support, as something definitely needs to be done to tackle the state of the railways. But, as always, the devil is in the detail. We are told that responsibility for the railways will be devolved to the Scottish Parliament, and possibly the Welsh Assembly. However, we have not been told what funding from the old Strategic Rail Authority and its schemes would go with that devolution of responsibility, but that would be important.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41123-22_para19">
We are also not sure about the status of some of the main cross-border lines. That has been a matter of contention with the SRA, which considered that the line as far north as Edinburgh was a strategic line, but that nothing north of there was strategic, and that although much of the system was proposed to be devolved, that line was not, because of its strategic nature. These measures must be set out in much greater detail before we can decide whether to support them, provided, of course, that they even reach the Floor of the House before the general election, which we are reliably informed&#151;or not so reliably, depending on one&#039;s point of view&#151;will almost certainly be in May. It is no coincidence that, although identity cards have been talked about for years, it is only in the dying days of this Parliament that they are being brought before us for

We have heard about the proposed disability discrimination Bill. I have a personal interest in that subject, and I await with interest the detail of the provisions. It has been suggested, in the press at least, that the Bill will attach certain duties to local authorities. Again, however, if more such duties are to be introduced, we shall want to know whether any funds will be made available to follow them. Government after Government have placed more and more duties on local authorities, but the funding does not necessarily follow. This makes it more and more difficult for the authorities to carry out those duties and puts an even greater burden on the council tax payer. That is true in England, as it is in Scotland.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41123-22_para21">
Mention has also been made of the consumer credit Bill. In principle, I would be keen to support that, as the terms of some consumer credit agreements are scandalous. Massive interest rates can be charged on those agreements, not only by so-called loan sharks but by supposedly respectable high street banks and stores, whose interest rates can be very high. In the Meadows case, for example, relatively small amounts ended up over the years as a massive debt. Such cases should not be allowed to continue. Perhaps we should go further, however, and consider capping interest charges.

The Queen&#039;s Speech is missing certain measures that should be included. The hon. Member for Sevenoaks (Mr. Fallon) referred to the Child Support Agency, and the chaos in which it finds itself following the resignation of its director. Many of my constituents, both parents with care and parents without care, are at their wit&#039;s end in their dealings with the CSA. Many of those cases have been dragging on for years without end. Many women are owed huge arrears, which are not being chased up, and they are being fobbed off with excuse after excuse. I have taken up many cases on their behalf&#151;we have been successful in some, whereas in others, we are still banging our head against a brick wall with the agency.

<a name="41123-22_para23">
In an increasing number of cases, the agency is paying out for its maladministration, because it is simply unable to do the job that it is supposed to do. Problems with the computer system lie at the bottom of that. The Government introduced a new system of calculation, which has experienced problems, again because the computer system has not worked. Because people have not been moved on to the new system, two people working side by side, with exactly the same circumstances, can pay two vastly different rates, which is leading to a great deal of anger and concern about the agency.

<a name="41123-22_para24">
What is missing from the Queen&#039;s Speech as regards the agency is some idea as to how to tackle the inherent problems, how to get the system working, and how to make sure that money is paid over quickly. Prior to being elected to this House, I was a practising solicitor, and dealt with many family law cases. A simple system operated of going to the courts to get an interim payment quickly and efficiently, until the rest was dealt

When the agency was set up, we were told that the courts were inefficient, but it was possible to get an interim payment through the courts in weeks, rather than the months taken by the agency. I respectfully suggest to the Government that they consider seriously at least re-introducing an interim payment that can be obtained through the courts, to speed the matter up.

The Queen&#039;s Speech contains nothing relating to the state pension. Other Members have talked about the tax credit system and its complexity. A great deal of anger is boiling up among our pensioners about that system. The Scottish National party proposes a citizen&#039;s pension as a way to tackle that, and I appeal again to the Government to consider seriously those issues. We cannot go on as we are doing, with more and more pensioners having to apply for means-tested benefit, and with the Government&#039;s estimate that some 75&nbsp;per cent. of pensioners may be eligible for some form of pension credit in the near future. That is scandalous&#151;we should aim for a citizen&#039;s pension of a reasonable amount, which will take pensioners out of poverty. Interestingly, when the Prime Minister spoke about pensioners earlier, he made a distinction between poverty among children and hardship among pensioners. There is poverty among pensioners too, and it is getting worse because of the tax credit system and rising fuel prices that will hit many this winter. Nothing in the Queen&#039;s Speech deals with those issues.

<a name="41123-22_para26">
On energy, we would have looked for the Government finally to tackle the Office of Gas and Electricity Markets on the question of transmission charges relating to renewable resources in north Scotland, which are likely to strangle many of those projects at birth unless action is taken. That issue is being allowed to drift on with no end in sight. If the Government do not take firm action to make sure that Ofgem introduces a suitable and fair system of transmission charges, there is no chance of reaching any of the renewable targets set by the Government or any other renewable targets. The issue of transmission charges and the sunset clauses will ensure that many projects never proceed in the first place.

We heard mention in the Queen&#039;s Speech of a referendum on the EU, with reference to a Bill being introduced to give effect to the constitutional treaty for the EU, subject to a referendum. We heard much about that in this debate. A shiver ran up my spine when the hon. Member for Wolverhampton, North-East (Mr.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Purchase) spoke about the counter-balancing force of the European Union against the United States. Such talk will increase yet further the vote against the European constitution. My party is generally pro-European, but we do not want to see a federal Europe, to which reference has been made, and we will not support the constitution in its current form. In my area of Scotland, we have seen the effect of the common fisheries policy on fishing communities. Indeed, it has devastated many traditional communities in the north and east of Scotland. The constitution as currently drafted will make that situation worse. Very many people in Scotland will take the same view, and if a referendum were held today, the constitution would be booted well and truly out of the park. If the Government are serious about putting the issue to a referendum, they need to tackle the inequities of the common fisheries policy in particular.

Mention was also made&#151;obliquely perhaps&#151;of the situation in Iraq and the need to help the Iraqi Government establish democracy through elections in January. That is all fair and well, but the Government must also consider how the situation in Iraq will be stabilised. I urge the Government to consider again securing greater UN involvement and replacing American and British troops, who, rightly or wrongly, are seen as the troops who fought the war and, as a result, are considered by many Iraqis in a different way from troops sent specifically as peacemakers. We should consider replacing many of the troops currently there with troops under a UN command, preferably drawn from Muslim nations, who would have a greater connection with many Iraqis.

The Black Watch is currently deployed in Iraq, but the Queen&#039;s Speech tells us nothing about the Government&#039;s intentions towards regiments in Scotland and parts of England. At the same time as the Black Watch is fighting in Iraq, the Government intend to amalgamate the regiment and get rid of the Black Watch tradition back home in Scotland. That is totally unacceptable to my party and to the vast majority of the people of Scotland. The Government must come clean&#151;if they expect our troops to take part in such deployments in Iraq, they must keep faith with the troops. There is nothing worse than for troops to be sent overseas to take part in a war, whether or not one agrees with that war, and to seek at the same time the end of their regiment back home. The regiments mean a great deal to the troops who belong to them. As civilians, we often fail to recognise the family feeling within regiments. I have become aware of the family feeling within the Scottish regiments and the determination within Scotland that those regiments should not be amalgamated into one super- regiment or even into a fantasy brigade, an idea which was floated the other week.

 I think that I am right in saying that my constituency has one of the highest age profiles among parliamentary divisions, with a high proportion of retired people. Those people react with a number of emotions to the failure of the Government&#039;s policy on crime and disorder.

They are disproportionately the people who collect for the Royal British Legion or the Red Cross. They are involved in all sorts of civic groups; they keep voluntary organisations going; and, typically, they are on the parochial church council. One tends to see the same faces in all those voluntary groups, whether it be the carer group, the stroke group or whatever. Those

The low-level disorder that now affects many parts of constituency&#151;I am sure that it is not untypical&#151;stretches credulity to its limits. Some 10&nbsp;days ago in the village of Hordle in the New Forest, the parish council found itself barricaded in the village hall and unable to get out as a consequence of the activities of a baying mob of youths outside, and the police had to be called to release them. The problems in Hordle are not entirely new, but they are shocking.

<a name="41123-23_para2">
Communities used to police themselves. Antisocial behaviour is nothing new, and rowdy children and problem families have always existed. However, if parents were unable or unprepared to deal with such a problem in the past, it would have been dealt with by relatives, neighbours or informally by the local policeman. If any of those people were to take effective measures now, they would quickly find that it is they who would be up in front of the beak, so we increasingly rely on the police.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41123-23_para3">
There are far too few police, who also lack proper power to deal with the problem. All sorts of new measures have been introduced, some of which have their place and are effective in some ways. However, the principal measure that has been introduced to deal with antisocial behaviour, the ASBO, is, in my view, far too long in coming. The evidence that must be collected and taken to court some weeks later leaves the problem festering for far too long.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41123-23_para4">
It is in the nature of antisocial behaviour and low-level disorder that it must be dealt with quickly&#151;even instantly&#151;because people&#039;s lives are made a misery for months. I want to see all sorts of measures of a much shorter order that can be introduced more quickly. The Government have dipped their toe in the water with the introduction of on-the-spot fines, on which I am inclined to go further.

The Government indicated that they would take action, which, I believe, would have been effective. The Prime Minister told us that the Government would use housing benefit as a means of enforcing proper social control, which I would have welcomed. It is unfortunately the case that a disproportionate number of those whose antisocial behaviour presents problems are in receipt of one benefit or another. Indeed, an increasing proportion of our population is in receipt of benefits, and we therefore have a proper and potentially very useful means of social control. To receive benefits should be part of a contract that involves behaving according to certain standards. I ask Ministers to listen to what the right hon. Member for Birkenhead (Mr.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Field) has to say in that respect, because the Queen&#039;s Speech should have had rather more to say, and I am disappointed that it did not.

Given the nature of the disorder that we now face&#151;admittedly it is low level, but it disrupts and makes many people&#039;s lives a misery&#151;and the need to deal with it quickly and effectively, I suggest that the police need the summary powers that parents used to exercise.

It is undoubtedly the case that the creative power available to judges as a consequence of the Human Rights Act 1998&nbsp;has allowed them to remove from our constituents the proper protection of statute law and planning rules.

the hon. Member for Sheffield, Heeley (Ms Munn) graciously referred to the fact that it was my service in Iraq that prevented me from attending the previous Queen&#039;s Speech. With that in mind, I want to draw to Treasury Ministers&#039; attention what I regard as a failure in the vital regard of prosecuting the war against terrorism. About this time last year, we had three principal enemies in Iraq: organised criminal gangs who regarded a stable Iraq as a threat to their operations; former regime loyalists, of whom there were actually very few, although they were well funded and well armed; and foreign fighters. In essence, that was it.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41123-23_para14">
My fear is that in the intervening year we have acquired a fourth and very much more dangerous enemy in Iraq: a huge number of disaffected Iraqis. I regard that as a failure of policy on our part. By September last year, we had conducted democratic elections in the four provinces under British control in southern Iraq, and provided a local government structure. The United Nations told us that there was no electoral register, but every household had a ration card, so we were able to conduct elections on the basis of a household franchise. That worked very effectively. Those elections were conducted by a number of political parties, all of which were enthusiastic about trying out democracy and gaining power.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41123-23_para15">
Once that local government structure was created, the problem was that the regime in Baghdad&#151;the coalition provisional authority&#151;would not allow sufficient genuine power and responsibility to be handed to those locally accountable and elected authorities. An enormous amount of frustration built up, and as a result people moved to support the hotheads and militants for whom there had been no support before.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41123-23_para16">
Another factor leading to this fundamental growth in the number of disaffected Iraqis is the way in which operations have been conducted. There is an etiquette that British troops exercise when, for example, searching an Iraqi property. The man of the household is brought outside and briefed on what is to happen. He 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>23 Nov 2004 : Column 89</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>is then allowed to go back inside and brief his women-folk. One may call it an illusion. Nevertheless, the etiquette is maintained whereby the man remains in charge and is not humiliated in front of his women-folk. The operation is discharged on that basis. I do not believe that our American allies operate in that way and according to that etiquette. As a result, there is huge and growing discontent, and irritation with those who are increasingly regarded as &quot;the occupiers&quot;.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41123-23_para17">
We have the expertise in these matters: we have 30&nbsp;years&#039; experience in conducting such peace support operations. Our failure of policy was in failing to bring the benefits of that expertise and experience to our principal ally. If one behaves like a poodle, one gets treated like a poodle. I do not believe that we ever had in Baghdad someone of sufficient authority&#151;with the Prime Minister&#039;s ear&#151;to call the shots and make clear our feelings to our American allies. Perhaps Peter Mandelson might properly have done that job, particularly given his experience in Northern Ireland. That was a policy failure on our part.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41123-23_para18">
A principal failing of the Queen&#039;s Speech is the determination to proceed with reducing the number of Army battalions by two. Such a reduction begs an important question: why does a medium-sized operation of low intensity require the mobilisation of so many reservists? I have no resentment at having been mobilised, but how does supposedly being able to do with fewer regular infantry square with the need to call up reservists more often? I do not believe that the public will understand that at all.

<a name="41123-23_para19">
The Ministry of Defence has been entirely infected with the most strange contagion. When one talks to MOD people about the problem of Army, Air Force and Navy numbers, they are full of jargon. They employ a kind of &quot;newspeak&quot;. They refer to &quot;network-enabled capability&quot; and &quot;effects-based warfare&quot;. The basic theory is that through technology, we have abolished attritional warfare. Our weapons systems will be so &quot;smart&quot; that they will knock out our enemies&#039; capability before they even realise that the conflict has started. As a consequence, we will need fewer platforms. Of course, there is a fault in that logic. What if they hit us first and get the few platforms that we possess?
</p>

<p>
<a name="41123-23_para20">
Let us assume that the MOD is right in its fundamental assumption. Let us assume that the investment that the Government are undertaking, allegedly, in high-tech warfare is of such a calibre that they have abolished attritional warfare and we will hit the enemy so hard first that we knock out his capability. The flaw in the logic is this: how often do we go to war in that way? How many conflicts that we participate in require that sort of capability? It is nice to have&#151;indeed, it is vital to have&#151;but in reality 90&nbsp;per cent. of what the British Army does is what we are now doing in Iraq: low-intensity peacekeeping operations, which require huge numbers of men on the ground. The principal difficulty that we have faced in prosecuting the war in Iraq is that we have far too few troops on the ground, as have the Americans. That in itself points to an enormous failure of planning for the whole Iraqi operation. There was a plan to fight a high-intensity war and very little planning for the post-war reconstruction.

I am concerned about the effect of the Queen&#039;s Speech on my constituents and the fact that, in many regards, it does not address a number of the problems that they experience in their day-to-day lives. Many problems that we face in my constituency relate in one way or another to the pressures of over-development. My constituency has four secondary schools, all of which are good, but all of which are now full. As more and more houses are constructed in the constituency, it is difficult to see where the children of secondary school age will be able to go to school.

Also on the subject of over-development, it is very difficult to register with an NHS doctor in Rayleigh, and practically impossible to register with an NHS dentist. Essex now faces the prospect of 131,000&nbsp;houses being imposed on the county by 2021. There is no realistic way in which we can satisfactorily accommodate house building on that scale. The Government&#039;s policy of national housing targets, which the Queen&#039;s Speech gave no indication of revoking, is leading to that incessant pressure. That is further amplified by the figures being endorsed by regional bodies&#151;in this case, the East of England regional assembly.

It has no moral or political legitimacy whatever in the other areas of

Flooding is an emotive issue for us in Essex, given how we suffered in the so-called great flood of 1953. Some 300&nbsp;people died in Britain that night, about 100&nbsp;of them in Essex, principally when the sea defences burst on Canvey Island. The sea came in and many people lost their lives in tragic circumstances. For historical reasons, we take the issue of flooding particularly seriously in my part of the world.

That being the case, we were very disappointed when the Government decided to abolish the Essex local flood defence committee and to merge it with a regional flood defence committee which, it is proposed, will comprise both Norfolk and Suffolk. Our view in Essex is that we had a perfectly good flood defence committee, which was not broke, so we did not require anybody to come and fix it. Unfortunately, because of the fixation with regionalism and regional bodies, the Government still appear determined to press on with that decision, which may be popular with them but is very unpopular in Essex, and especially southern Essex.

Friend the Member for New Forest, West, there is little logic in seeking increasingly to intervene in trouble spots around the world, while at the same time reducing the number of troops who are best trained and prepared to undertake such interventions.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41123-24_para9">
I very much hope that the Government will reconsider that matter and decide that there is no need to abolish the battalions that are first to be called for by other countries around the world when peacekeeping troops are required. I repeat the point that if the Americans called for a British infantry battalion when they have the most powerful Army in the world, it is a lesson that should not be lost on Defence Ministers.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41123-24_para10">
I conclude with a particular plea for the Scottish regiments, and I do so as an English Member of Parliament. Some of the Scottish regiments have tremendous traditions, which are not just a matter of history but stand as a record of the good service that they have given to date and that they will&#151;we hope&#151;give to the country in the future. It would be a travesty if the Black Watch, after its brave service in Iraq in what I believe remains a good cause, were to be recalled to the UK at the end of its tour of duty only to be told to prepare for a disbandment parade. That would be necessary if they were amalgamated, and their cap badge would be lost. I believe that the Black Watch has given very good service and that the House should take proper notice of it. I would like to hear a definitive announcement that the Black Watch, and indeed the other Scottish regiments, are to be saved. That would benefit all Members, all parties and all the people of this country who owe those regiments such a tremendous debt.

<p><i>Motion made, and Question proposed,</i> That this House do now adjourn.&#151;<i>[Ms Bridget Prentice.]</i>

<a name="41123-24_time1"><h5>8.31&nbsp;pm</h5>
</p>





<p><a name="41123-24_spnew3"><b> Mr. Martin Caton  (Gower) (Lab):</b> 
 This feels to me like an Adjournment debate in more senses than one. It feels as though I have reconvened a meeting that we held in these very premises in March last year, when I secured a debate with a very similar title to tonight&#039;s&#151;&quot;Government Support for Learning-disabled Athletes&quot;. My right hon. Friend the Minister will remember that, at that time, my stimulus for raising the issue was a letter that I had received from my constituent, David Vaughan, and his mum, Daphne.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41123-24_para12">
David was, and is, a learning-disabled young man with an enthusiasm and a capacity for swimming. He was then 17&nbsp;and he could not understand why the International Paralympic Committee had banned all learning-disabled athletes from the Athens Paralympics. He wanted to get that position changed before the games went ahead. I shall not repeat the arguments that I made in that debate, except quickly to remind the House how the exclusion of learning-disabled athletes came about and what was done at that time to try to rectify the problem.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41123-24_para13">
The Paralympic Committee&#039;s decision came about after it was discovered that 10&nbsp;male Spanish basketball players in the Sydney Paralympics of 2000&nbsp;had cheated because they did not have the learning disability that they claimed to have. That led first to the suspension of the International Sports Federation for Persons with&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Intellectual Disability, called INAS-FID for short, and to a ban on learning-disabled athletes from all Paralympic competition. The IPC then called on INAS-FID to take a number of other actions, which it agreed to do. Probably the most important was helping to establish an eligibility and verification scheme that everyone could sign up to.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41123-24_para14">
That was, and remains, the key issue of contention. Between 2001&nbsp;and early 2003, real progress was made in some areas, but in February the IPC management committee ruled that not enough had been done and that learning-disabled athletes would not go to Athens to participate in the Paralympics. That was, of course, a terrible kick in the teeth to the 15&nbsp;British athletes with learning disability on the world-class performance programme who had been training as hard as they could with Athens as their goal. It was also a blow to learning-disabled athletes such as David Vaughan, back in the Mumbles in the Gower, who was then 17&nbsp;and not yet at a stage to be able to go to Athens, but who wanted to know that learning-disabled athletes were still respected members of the Paralympic family.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41123-24_para15">
In the Minister&#039;s reply to me last year&#151;and, indeed, in his replies to questions that I have put to him in the past few weeks&#151;he explained that the decision on eligibility must remain the sole responsibility of the International Paralympic Committee. However, he made clear his and the Government&#039;s hope and expectation that those problems would be overcome and that an acceptable eligibility verification and protest system would be put in place to ensure that athletes with learning disability returned to compete in the international sporting arena.


<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>23 Nov 2004 : Column 94</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>

<p>
<a name="41123-24_para16">
If this were an adjourned meeting recalled to discuss progress after more than a year and a half, there would be precious little to report. The Athens Paralympics went ahead, and was a wonderful event. I congratulate all the British athletes with physical disability who did so well, but I still feel that it is a great shame that no learning-disabled athletes were able to take part.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41123-24_para17">
Matters have moved on since last March. Sadly, they seem to have moved in the wrong direction, and there is now a danger that they will accelerate over a cliff. I have received another letter from David and his mum, alerting me to the possibility that, at its meeting in Cairo&nbsp;on Thursday&#151;the day after tomorrow&#151;the IPC will decide to exclude learning-disabled athletes permanently.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41123-24_para18">
As I understand it, the decision stems from a motion passed by the IPC general assembly. Basically, the motion said that the ban would be lifted if INIS-FID was able to develop a
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;watertight, reliable, valid and proven&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="41123-24_para19">
system for the inclusion of learning-disabled athletes in IPC competition. However, if INIS-FID cannot provide that system, a proposal to exclude learning-disabled athletes from all IPC events should be presented.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41123-24_para20">
In preparation for Thursday&#039;s meeting, the IPC has circulated a lot of information about what INIS-FID has done and various expert assessments of that work. According to the IPC, the bottom line is that the eligibility verification system proposed by INIS-FID has not been tested rigorously enough. It does not include a satisfactory scientific method of showing how learning disability affects different sports differently, which has prevented the proper testing of a protest procedure. The IPC has therefore found that INIS-FID has failed to demonstrate the development of a

<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;watertight, reliable, valid and proven&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="41123-24_para21">
system for athletes with learning disability.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41123-24_para22">
At about the same time as I got the letter from David and Daphne, I was contacted by the charity Mencap, which is campaigning to get the ban lifted on behalf of learning-disabled athletes throughout our country. It is doing a good job, as a full-page article in the <i>Daily Mirror</i> last week showed. I want to put on record my thanks to Mencap for the help that it gave me on this issue, especially in providing me with copies of all the documents circulated by the IPC for Thursday&#039;s meeting. Frankly, a lot of it is technical and requires more knowledge than I have about particular sports. However, virtually all the papers that I read on eligibility verification for learning-disabled athletes said that we are not there yet, but we are getting there.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41123-24_para23">
There seemed to be a general recognition that the sports information and consequences questionnaire developed as the foundation for the new eligibility verification regime could be the way to assess learning-disabled athletes. In any case, the feeling seemed to be that genuine athletes with learning disabilities should be in the Paralympics, that it must be possible to develop mutually acceptable eligibility criteria, and that everyone should renew their efforts to achieve that goal.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41123-24_para24">
In those circumstances, talk of a permanent or even indefinite ban is premature and counterproductive, to put it mildly. However, that recognition of the place of especially talented learning-disabled athletes in the 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>23 Nov 2004 : Column 95</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>Paralympics&#151;which is, I am sure, the majority opinion in the world of disabled athletics&#151;is still not universally held. Sadly, some argue that a learning disability is not a disability that should make someone eligible to compete in disability sport. They argue that because sport is all about physical performance, only physically disabled people should be eligible. That view may be understandable, but it is wrong.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41123-24_para25">
High-quality athletic performance in any sport requires a combination of physical fitness, natural talent and the mental abilities of concentration and planning, as well as an ability to implement strategy and tactics and to cope with stress. Another ingredient is, of course, fast reaction times. That is why learning-disabled athletes cannot compete successfully in mainstream sports at the highest level, and why they belong in the Paralympics. It is also why the IPC needs to become a bit more hands on in achieving the robust verification procedure which everyone agrees is needed. After all, one of its stated objectives is
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;to support and encourage education, cultural, research and scientific activities that contribute to the development and promotion of the Paralympic movement.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="41123-24_para26">
Permanently banning one group of people from participation in the highest level of competition specifically for disabled people would be an astonishing measure. At a time when, across the world, people have been pressing for a more inclusive agenda and for improved rights for disabled people, a body set up to promote disability sport is on the brink of excluding this important group of disabled people from the most important events. If that goes ahead, it is not only learning-disabled athletes who will be the losers; it will be the reputation of the International Paralympic Committee and perhaps the Paralympics themselves. Surely, nobody can want that.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41123-24_para27">
My first request to the Minister is that, while recognising the independence of the International Paralympic Committee, he does everything that he and the Government can to help move things in the right direction and get learning-disabled athletes back into the Paralympics as soon as possible, and certainly before the Beijing games in 2008. The British Paralympic Association is keen to see learning-disabled athletes back in the Paralympics.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41123-24_para28">
Secondly, will my right hon. Friend consider the consequences of excluding learning-disabled athletes from the Paralympics on funding for organisations and institutions involved with delivering sport for learning-disabled people and for individual athletes? Historically, about &#163;50,000&nbsp;was awarded to the UK Sports Association for People with Learning Disability for the furtherance of Government elite sport objectives. Funding of that nature is based on medal results at Paralympic level. If learning disability is banned from the Paralympics, funding will cease at the end of this financial year.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41123-24_para29">
Sport England gives funds to the English Federation of Disability Sport for the enhancement of grass-roots sports for all impairment groups. However, there is no statutory requirement for any of that funding to be distributed to learning-disability sport. No resources have been provided to the English Sports Association since 2000, and the chief executive has had to stand down for two months as a result of funding difficulties.


<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>23 Nov 2004 : Column 96</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>

<p>
<a name="41123-24_para30">
For many individual learning-disabled athletes, the situation has been even worse. Pre-Sydney, a small number of learning-disabled athletes were on the world-class performance programme for athletics and swimming, funded by UK Sport. After Sydney, all learning-disabled athletes were dropped from that programme, and swimmers were moved from the programme aimed at Athens to the world-class potential programme targeted at Beijing. If Thursday&#039;s vote goes against learning-disabled athletes, those swimmers will also be dropped from eligibility for that support.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41123-24_para31">
Of course, the elite schemes are being rolled out to athletes below potential gifted and talented standard, sometimes in secondary schools through ideas such as the talented athletes scholarship scheme. It looks at the moment as if learning-disabled athletes will not be recognised by those schemes if they are not part of the Paralympic movement. We need some political leadership at this difficult time to ensure that until we get learning-disabled athletes back into the Paralympics, funding will be available from the lottery or the public purse to keep them and their organisations going.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41123-24_para32">
I am pleased to report that my constituent, David Vaughan, was selected to compete at the global games in Sweden during the summer. Those games were set up for learning-disabled athletes when they were excluded from the Athens Paralympics. He achieved his own personal time and is now in the top 30&nbsp;world ranking for butterfly. He had a great time, and he and his family are understandably proud.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41123-24_para33">
Will my right hon. Friend consider whether, until we get the Paralympic verification system that lets learning-disabled athletes back where they belong, medal success at the global games might attract appropriate financial support. I am mindful of the precedent set by UK Deaf Sport, which is not connected to the Paralympic movement but has a separate international competition, the deaf Olympics. That is recognised by UK Sport, which means that funding is awarded on the basis of medal success there. In 2004, that amounted to &#163;75,000. If the IPC decision goes against learning disability on Thursday, it should surely be possible for UK Sport to regard the global games as the pinnacle of learning-disability sport and provide funding accordingly.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41123-24_para34">
Even if we get the wrong decision on Thursday, that should not be the end of the campaign. The correct place for the best learning-disabled athletes to compete is at the Paralympics. That is what they want, and that is what is right. It is also what the Paralympic movement is all about. Another of its key objectives is to promote Paralympic sports without discrimination for political, economic, disability, gender or race reasons. I hope that every voting member of the International Paralympics Committee has those words in mind when they come to make their decision the day after tomorrow.

<p><a name="41123-25_spmin0"><b>The Minister for Sport and Tourism  (Mr. Richard Caborn): </b> 
 I thank my hon. Friend the Member for Gower (Mr. Caton) for securing the debate this evening on the important issue of the Government&#039;s funding for learning-disabled athletes. He acknowledges that the Government are fully committed to providing opportunities for everyone to participate in sport. We believe that everyone should enjoy the benefits of sport. 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>23 Nov 2004 : Column 97</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>One of my Department&#039;s strategic priorities is to focus on communities so that we push forward an agenda that will increase and broaden the impact of sport across society now and for the future.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41123-25_para0">
We have a public service agreement targeted specifically at increasing the take-up of sporting opportunities among priority groups by 2008. We therefore recognise the need to improve opportunities for people from under-represented groups, including those with learning disabilities, to participate and compete at all levels. The Government wholeheartedly support disability sport. Sport England&#151;the Government-funded body that distributes lottery funding&#151;promotes community sport and is responsible for developing and maintaining the infrastructure of sport in England. It provides substantial funding for the English Federation of Disability Sport to lead a unified, co-ordinated and comprehensive approach to sports development in England for disabled people. It gives more than &#163;1&nbsp;million a year to the EFDS and a further &#163;1&nbsp;million in lottery funding goes to the federation&#039;s inclusive fitness initiative, which is very successful.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41123-25_para1">
The partnership between Sport England and the EFDS is vital in ensuring that the federation can be an effective lead for disability sport, as well as acting as an umbrella group for the seven disability sport organisations recognised by Sport England. In addition, the national strategy for physical education, school sport and club links is aimed at all children, whatever their ability or circumstances, and provision is made for young disabled people in the gifted and talented programme, which is part of the Government&#039;s wider strategy to improve gifted and talented education.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41123-25_para2">
Young people with learning difficulties have been taking on leadership and volunteering roles as part of our very successful &quot;step into sport&quot;. Of course, participation in sport by disabled people is not confined to community level. If we are to take sport seriously as a means of enriching individuals&#039; lives, and of allowing them to take control of their futures and to exercise their birthright of being equal alongside able-bodied people, it is our moral duty to do everything that we can to foster an environment in which disabled people can flourish and excel in the elite arena of sport.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41123-25_para3">
However, I am aware that during the 2000&nbsp;Paralympic games in Sydney, several athletes&#151;none of them British, I am pleased to say&#151;who were subsequently found not to have met the eligibility criteria, competed and won medals in events for athletes with learning disabilities. That is what my hon. Friend spoke about. As a result, the International Paralympic Committee decided to suspend athletes with learning disabilities from the Paralympics. The International Sports Federation for Persons with Intellectual Disability had its membership of the International Paralympic Committee suspended, and athletes with learning disabilities did not compete in Athens. The IPC has charged the international community of learning disability sporting organisations with coming up with a system of classification that will satisfy the IPC and see athletes with learning disabilities return to compete in the international sporting arena.


<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>23 Nov 2004 : Column 98</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>

<p>
<a name="41123-25_para4">
Until the issue is resolved and a classification system agreed, UK Sport has taken the view that it cannot continue to fund elite athletes with learning disabilities. UK Sport&#039;s action on this is in line with policy regarding the use of lottery funding to support success at the Olympic and Paralympic games and would apply to any athlete on the world-class performance programme.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41123-25_para5">
I can, however, answer the question that my hon. Friend asked. UK Sport has provided the UKSAPLD with &#163;50,000&nbsp;for this financial year. This has traditionally been provided because of the organisation&#039;s work in registering athletes with learning difficulties for the Paralympics. However, although learning-disabled athletes are at present no longer part of the Paralympics, in recognition of the organisation&#039;s wider role for people with learning difficulties, financial support has been continued and UK Sport is reviewing the funding of UKSAPLD, along with its other funding decisions for Paralympic sports and organisations, to determine the level of support that will be provided for 2005&#150;06.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41123-25_para6">
UKSAPLD has been advised that UK Sport may no longer fund it if it cannot resolve its current financial problems, to which my hon. Friend referred. The association is likely to receive some funding next year but a decision has not yet been taken about how much, and it is being supported solely by UK Sport&#039;s &#163;50,000&nbsp;Exchequer commitment.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41123-25_para7">
I should like to reassure my hon. Friend about the talented athlete scholarship scheme. The eligibility criteria for the scheme were established following full consultation across sport and education, which included the British Paralympic Association and the national governing bodies of sport. In considering the criteria, those organisations have been mindful of the present situation regarding the exclusion of learning-disabled athletes from the Paralympics. Currently, athletes with a learning disability are not eligible for TASS; however, should the IPC decide at its meeting on Thursday or in the future to include learning-disabled athletes in the Paralympics, the eligibility criteria for support through TASS will be revisited.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41123-25_para8">
The Government are aware of the complex issues of classification in disability sport, and recognise the problems associated with the current national and international classification system. The complex issue of classification in disability sport must be resolved between the international community of learning disability sporting organisations and the elected members of the IPC. Although the INAS-FID has been reinstated as a member of the IPC, athletes with learning disabilities remain suspended from the Paralympics until the IPC is satisfied with the system of classification.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41123-25_para9">
My Department is in regular contact with the EFDS about that, and I am very confident that the EFDS will continue to do everything it can to help our elite athletes with learning disabilities and to improve sporting opportunities at the grass roots for people with those disabilities. I sincerely hope that a system of classification, such as my hon. Friend described, will be

I hope, too, that the outcome of the IPC meeting on 25&nbsp;November, which will consider the future involvement of athletes with learning disabilities at the Paralympics, will not prevent our elite athletes with those disabilities from having a future in the Olympic movement.
