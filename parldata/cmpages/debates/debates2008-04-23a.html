the idea attracts support from more than 60 per cent. of the population. The Scottish Executive will not be able to obstruct the introduction of the identity cards scheme throughout the United Kingdom. If they, as providers of devolved services, choose not to avail themselves of the opportunities that the scheme allows to assert the identity of those who seek public services, that is entirely a matter for them. That is what devolution is all about.</p>

 When it comes to tackling terrorism and providing security in this country, does my right hon. Friend agree that ID cards have a part to play?

 My hon. Friend is quite right. The evidence is overwhelming that those who have been convicted of terrorism&#151;during the past year, a significant number have been convicted beyond reasonable doubt in our courts&#151;almost invariably use multiple identities to advance their horrific objectives. There is no question but that a secure and reliable system of identity that fixes the identity of a person through biometrics will assist in dealing with terrorism, and everyone involved in policing terrorism confirms that that is the case. Many quotations from those charged with that responsibility express the idea that one of the most important things we could do to assist in that task is set up an identity card scheme underpinned by biometric identity. Moreover, 71 per cent. of the people of the UK agree with that, because they understand its importance in our fight against terrorists.</p>

 On a day when we probably all woke to the announcement of the publication of yet another report that shows the amount of identity fraud through credit cards and the cost to the United Kingdom, there is no question but that we need to move to the same position as 24 out of 27 of the countries in the European Union and have identity cards. Those countries do not have oppressive regimes. Indeed, in many respects, the current Administration in Scotland look to them with envy. They are social democratic regimes that have moved to identity cards because they help people to protect their identity, especially against the sort of fraud that is perpetrated daily.</p>

 One aspect of the Government&#146;s identity card scheme is that everyone, of any age, will have to travel to one of only 11 biometric centres in Scotland. For some people who do not live close to the centres, that means long and expensive journeys to get their identity protected. Of course, the Secretary of State knows all about identity theft, having stolen one from the Secretary of State for Defence. Is not it absurd that the Government solution to counter-terrorism is that 80-year-olds in Pitlochry will have make 100 mile round trips to get their data scanned, while people in England have to have an identity card to get the services that they need?</p>

That is why we have developed a network of offices, which will be expanded if necessary. There currently are nine throughout Scotland.

It is important to send the people of Scotland a clear signal today that what occurred on 3 May last year will not happen again, that we will not see a repeat of the confusion that led to the unacceptable number of spoilt papers again, and that steps have been taken by the Government and will be taken in due course by the Scottish Administration to restore people&#146;s confidence in the integrity of the electoral system.</p>

 I first welcome the hon. Gentleman to his promotion to shadow Secretary of State for Scotland. I can see looks of great relief on the faces of some of those sitting behind him that he has accepted the post. What has happened to fuel costs is a global phenomenon. A few years ago, the price of a barrel of oil was $10; today it is $117. Of course that puts pressure on the tremendous inroads that we have made in reducing fuel poverty. That is why the Chancellor of the Exchequer and Treasury Ministers met the fuel companies to discuss the extension of social tariffs, and why we have increased the winter fuel payment, which is now worth considerably more than any previous scheme. We have done that precisely to help people who are facing rising fuel bills, and we will continue to take action because we believe that fuel poverty is a genuine social evil that has to be combated.</p>

 My hon. Friend is a long-standing advocate and proponent of the coal industry in Scotland, and he is quite right. Let me refer him back to my original answer and remind him that 33 to 35 per cent. of Scotland&#146;s electricity comes from coal-fired power stations, so coal has to play a part in the balanced energy mix. Clean coal technology is being pioneered in Scotland by Doosan Babcock, Clyde Blowers and others, and Scottish companies are also playing their part in the carbon capture and storage competition that is being run at the moment. I entirely agree with my hon. Friend that coal has an important part to play in the future.</p>

 The Minister will be aware that the availability of fossil fuels for electricity generation and other purposes is a major concern in Scotland, given the potential shutdown of the Grangemouth refinery. Will the Minister tell us what role the UK Government are playing in seeking a resolution to this matter, and will he update the House on the current position? Can he also offer business and private motorists in Scotland a reassurance that contingency arrangements are in hand to ensure that there will be no threat to fuel supplies, and that the panic buying and stocking up of petrol is therefore completely unwarranted?</p>

 My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State has been in regular contact with the Secretary of State for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform over the past few days, and they have made it clear that by far and away the best solution will be a negotiated solution between the management and the trade unions. The hon. Gentleman will be aware that such talks are under way, and being facilitated by ACAS.

200 miles for many. A motorcycle school in Oban has already closed as a result and the same thing is happening elsewhere. Will the Government apply the brakes to those new plans for the test centres, review their locations and build such centres in all parts of the country before the new test regime comes into effect?

 I am aware of the concern about this issue in the hon. Gentleman&#146;s constituency and elsewhere&#151;and, indeed, in my own constituency. The question of the siting of the new test centres is obviously an issue for the Driving Standards Agency, not for the Government, but it is important that such things are kept under review. Motorcyclists represent 1 per cent. of road traffic users, but have 19 per cent. of fatalities and accidents, so it is in the interests of motorcyclists themselves that standards are raised. That, as the hon. Gentleman says, is the good intention behind the move, as part of a European directive. I take his point that it is important to keep these issues under review. I, for one, would not want to see closures of the training centres of the type that he mentioned.</p>

I saw a photograph of him in the newspaper in motorcycle leathers&#151;at least, I assume they were motorcycle leathers&#151;so I know that he has been part of the campaign. I entirely agree that the safety of motorcyclists has to be the paramount concern, which is, of course, why the new testing regime is being brought in&#151;because motorcyclists are dying on our roads to a hugely disproportionate extent in comparison with their total number. Having said that, I think it important to keep the location of the new test centres under review to ensure that we do not see the closure of the training centres such as has been mentioned, which would clearly not be in anyone&#146;s interest.</p>

Through the new contract with general practitioners, the Government had a major opportunity to revive general practice in this country, and to rebase the NHS in patient-centred care and primary-care-led services. They failed to do that; by contrast, they have entered into a conflict with general practitioners that will undermine the service. The Government are taking an approach to the reconfiguration of primary care services that matches the dangers of the approach that they took to reconfiguration of secondary care. The progressive centralisation of services, the progressive undermining of access to care, the progressive undermining of the ability of clinicians across the NHS to determine what is best for their patients&#151;those are the tragic consequences of the Government&#146;s failure to negotiate the GP contract successfully. Their mean-minded approach is not to negotiate in partnership with general practitioners, but to try to arrive at a solution that cuts costs and centralises services, while undermining the independence and clinical effectiveness of general practice.</p>

 My hon. Friend raises an important point. In the course of the GP contract negotiations, the move towards a quality and outcomes framework had real potential, but as the National Audit Office report published earlier this year set out starkly, in order to try and secure agreement with general practitioners the Government took a large amount of that money out of the pot and put it into the minimum practice income guarantee.

Recruitment in deprived areas was most difficult and it remains difficult. The Government&#146;s response should have been to deal with that problem, not to try and impose a solution everywhere else. By encouraging PCTs to offer new practices in under-doctored areas, the Government are saying now the same thing as they said in 2006 in the community White Paper, which we supported throughout. However, it is wholly wrong for them to seek to impose a polyclinic system in London and across the country, including in the most under-doctored areas, which would deprive many people of access to GP surgeries in their local neighbourhood.</p>

 My hon. Friend is right. In an article in the <i> British Medical Journal </i>on 22 March 2008, Martin Roland, professor of health care at the university of Manchester and director of the National Primary Care Research and Development Centre, said:</p>
<a name="80423-0004.htm_brev5"><a name="08042357001207"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;The UK system of universal registration with a single general practice promotes equity, provides a &#145;medical home&#146; for coordinating care, and is an effective mechanism for holding providers to account for the quality of care provided.&#148;</p>

That relationship between patients and their doctor is instrumental in delivering effective care, but the Government are determined to undermine it. <i> [Interruption.]</i> The Secretary of State says &#147;Rubbish,&#148; but he should look at what his own PCT is proposing in Hull. In a document, which I have seen, the purpose of which it acknowledges is to reconfigure GP care in the area, it says that its objective is to have fewer GP sites&#151;by which I think it means practices&#151;and to put polyclinics down in Hull. Hull is an under-doctored area, as the Secretary of State knows perfectly well. Of course there is a case for additional practices, but the consequence of the polyclinic plan will be that some of the existing practices will be shut down, and that will not enable services to be delivered more effectively in the area.</p>

 I agree with my hon. Friend. The impact on rural areas is one of the most significant and worrying aspects of the way in which the Government are going about this. I have been to many places throughout the country. Not so long ago I was talking to GPs in Worcester and to the local medical committee in Cornwall. One can imagine the situation: there are practices  <br>

throughout Cornwall and the Department of Health tells the local PCT that it must have a polyclinic, but there is no obvious place for it, so it is just popped down next to a GP practice somewhere and practices in many neighbouring areas close down as a consequence.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o29"><a name="80423-0004.htm_para8"><a name="08042357000175">There are different models of care in different parts of the country. Interestingly, the south-west has some of the largest practices in the country&#151;for example, I went to Frome&#151;for the simple reason that sometimes a network system between a large GP practice and satellites is one of the most effective ways of ensuring access to neighbouring villages. But scrapping all that and not having an organic system that is developed by GPs themselves, in favour of the polyclinic system where GPs do not have independent contractor status and can no longer design services for their area&#146;s needs, will undermine access in rural areas at precisely the moment that towns and villages throughout the country are losing their post offices, shops, pubs and public services. Their GP surgery is one of the critical elements that they now perceive is under threat.</p>

 They are also losing their dispensaries. Is my hon. Friend aware that 8.5 million patients are in GP practices that dispense drugs? Under the Government&#146;s White Paper on the future of pharmacy services it will be almost impossible for GPs to dispense drugs in the future. Why on earth remove patient choice in this way? This is yet another service that will be lost in villages in my constituency and colleagues&#146; constituencies.</p>

 Yes, I am interested in what my hon.

The polyclinics are expensive beasts; they cost about &#163;800,000 each, so money has to be raised for them. I suspect that in many cases the Government intend to ensure that they have a large pharmacy, which will take the pharmacy profits, and the dispensing doctors in local surgeries will lose out and shut down as a consequence.</p>

 I caution the hon. Gentleman to go a little further down the line of variation around the country. Wolverhampton is one of the most deprived cities in the country. We have the excellent Phoenix medical centre, which might be termed a polyclinic, which is expanding its hours because it is so popular, and many of the services that it offers have been taken from the acute hospital, not from GPs. Correspondingly, the Castlecroft medical centre, with which I am registered, is building a brand new GPs&#146; surgery, and the Mayfields medical centre, which opened recently, has a pharmacy alongside.

Members: &#147;Why?] It must be driven by GPs in response to the needs of patients&#151;it would be useful if the Secretary of State were to read the Opposition motion. The Government amendment does not provide any evidence that the Secretary of State sees any role for GPs or clinicians in interpreting the needs of patients, so I do not know how he thinks that patients&#146; needs will be met.</p>

There is no reason why services that can be delivered more effectively in the community should not be delivered in the community, and there is no reason why GPs should not be able to commission services from a hospital or a community provider transferring services into the community. Sometimes, the hospital itself can provide those services, which certainly can involve diagnostic and treatment services. There will even be places where GP practices conclude that their premises are so poor that they need to come together in larger practices and premises. None of that causes me any problem at all.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o31"><a name="80423-0004.htm_para10"><a name="08042357000180">Because the hon. Member for Wolverhampton, South-West (Rob Marris) represents a constituency in Wolverhampton, perhaps he has not carefully examined the Darzi plan in London and what is currently being rolled out in every PCT across the country in a one-size-fits-all fashion, which is the creation of polyclinics. The Darzi plan in London makes it clear that a polyclinic is 25 GPs occupying 16,000 sq ft costing &#163;800,000 a year with all the services in that place. Where are those polyclinics being put? Last week, I was in Bexley, where a polyclinic is being located on the site of Queen Mary&#146;s hospital, Sidcup. In Epsom, a polyclinic has been proposed for the site of St. Helier hospital. That is not taking care closer to home; that is centralising primary care, which will take it further away from the people whom it is meant to serve.</p>

That is one of the problems with GP fundholding that needed to be sorted out. The Government have not sorted it out because the same problem is occurring in places where there has been any progress on practice-based commissioning.</p>

We have repeatedly made it clear in this House that we need a strong voice for patients. We need &#147;health watch&#148; locally and nationally to make that happen, but where general practitioners are concerned, we also need the exercise of patient choice. Again, it is interesting to quote Martin Roland from Manchester:</p>
<a name="80423-0004.htm_brev6"><a name="08042357001208"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;The NHS goal of providing patient choice in primary care is not realised in many parts of the country where patients have little real choice of practice. Increased patient choice requires more high quality practices, not the small number of large practices that some polyclinic models suggest. We know that patients in small practices rate their care more highly in terms of both access and continuity. Indeed, although small practices show more variation in quality, on average, they achieved slightly higher levels of clinical quality than larger practices in the quality and outcomes framework.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o33"><a name="80423-0004.htm_para12"><a name="08042357000184">So having more high-quality practices, which include many smaller practices, is the route down which to go. Our patient choice proposals are similar to some that the Government made in the community White Paper of 2006. They are about making sure that when patients move from one practice to another, proper capitation follows them and to ensure that practices with open lists cannot be declared full when there is no justification for that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o34"><a name="80423-0004.htm_para13"><a name="08042357000185">Those proposals are precisely the mechanisms to make sure that general practice, although integral to service delivery and commissioning, is none the less increasingly accountable to patients. At the moment, the Government seem to be moving to a world in which the only customer to matter is the primary care trust. To whom is the primary care trust accountable? The experience of everybody&#151;including, I suspect, most of my hon. Friends across the country&#151;is that primary care trusts are accountable only to the Department of Health and Ministers, who are the only people they ever listen to.

 I am most grateful to my hon. Friend for giving way; he is being very generous. What he describes has particular resonance in Wiltshire, where the PCT seems to be giving GPs incentives to move towards a polyclinic system. For example, a polyclinic is being proposed for halfway between the town of Corsham and the nearby village of Box. That would be convenient for neither place, but the PCT appears to be giving GPs in both places financial incentives to move towards it, even if that is not in patients&#146; best interests.</p>

would ask us to consider what happened in his constituency. General practices there wanted to come together and create a single premises for the whole town. They have done that, and the services are there. What is happening now? The Government say that there must be a polyclinic in every primary care trust, so the GPs in Macclesfield are threatened by the fact that the PCT wants to create another polyclinic in the PCT area. That would undermine those GPs&#146; situation. Frankly, that is not acceptable.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o35"><a name="80423-0004.htm_para14"><a name="08042357000190">The Government made a complete mess of the GP contract. To give a simple measure of that, they paid &#163;1.76 billion more than they were planning to. The National Audit Office reported that the Government said that under the new contract they were expecting a productivity gain in primary care of 1.5 per cent. a year. In fact, there was a drop in productivity of 2.5 per cent. in each of the first two years. The Government got the precise opposite of what they were hoping for&#151;and we know the whole story of what happened to out-of-hours services across the country.</p>

Local enhanced services could have commissioned Saturday morning surgeries or extended opening hours on weekdays. I find it utterly astonishing that back in February, in the midst of a conflict with the British Medical Association, I could ask the Secretary of State whether he knew whether primary care trusts had commissioned local enhanced services for extended opening hours and get the answer that he did not even know. Having not used the contract for the purpose for which it was intended, the Government now blame GPs for the costs and consequences of a contract that they negotiated and pressed GPs to accept.</p>

polyclinics will be. In the past couple of days, we have seen on the Department&#146;s website evidence of how it is guiding primary care trusts to go about not only developing polyclinics but reconfiguring the whole of general practitioner services. It is clear that it wants to do that on the basis of a small number of contracts with large providers. That is true not only for this first polyclinic, but pretty much across the board.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o38"><a name="80423-0005.htm_para1"><a name="08042357000198">For a long time, the Department has wanted to get rid of the independent contractor status of GPs and turn them into salaried employees; Ministers seem now to have embraced that absurdity. Presumably, the Department is thinking that it can save a third of the cost of a GP, because a salaried GP costs only two thirds of what a principal in general practice costs. That is a dangerous route, because if practitioners lose their independent contractor status, they will find it impossible to take the position of GP budget holders or practice-based commissioners.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o39"><a name="80423-0005.htm_para2"><a name="08042357000199">In November 2004, we had a debate on family doctor services in the Opposition&#146;s time. The Government&#146;s response then was to say, &#147;Look how useful practice-based commissioning will be for the future.&#148; Now we have another debate, and what is the Government&#146;s response? It is, &#147;Look how useful polyclinics will be in future.&#148; Practice-based commissioning has disappeared. It has stalled across the country; more than half of primary care trusts are not giving it management support and the information to support it is not available to general practices. The proposed measure is a weak substitute for fundholding in the sense that it does not give real budgets or real incentives to save and reinvest for patients and it does not give the opportunity to innovate in contracts with health care providers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o40"><a name="80423-0005.htm_para3"><a name="08042357000200">The Government&#146;s approach is a shameful abdication of the Government&#146;s existing policy, which two years ago Tony Blair said was absolutely central to health care reforms. He said that there should be practice-based commissioning, but that has disappeared and is off the lexicon; instead, the Government are reverting to type and going towards a centralised, top-down, one-size-fits-all approach.</p>

 We know exactly who is to blame for that&#151;the Government. To be fair to NHS employers and the NHS Confederation, when it came down to it they were overawed by the Government, who put in their own interpretation of their estimate of the QOF&#151;quality and outcomes framework&#151;points that were going to be gathered by GPs. The British Medical Association, to be fair, said pretty clearly that it thought that it would be a higher figure. The difference on the QOF was about 16 per cent.&#151;that is about 160 points, and there is &#163;125 a point, so that is about &#163;20,000 per GP. The Government have therefore ended up spending millions more than they ever intended.

There is clearly an opportunity for GPs to manage care on behalf of their patients so that the relationships and continuity that they already have can be turned into something that delivers integrated care for patients and so that where services are provided they are in the best interests of patients. GPs should not be immune from competition. There should be a role for alternative providers and different models of care, but it should not be a one-size,  <br>

top-down kind of care. We need patient choice of the kind that I described. Patients should be able to exercise not only choice in secondary care but choice in who is their primary care provider. We should ensure that the remuneration of GPs not only incentivises them to be in socially and economically deprived areas looking after the patients who are most in need of their primary care services but is geared towards quality and outcomes, including patient-reported outcomes, not just the process measures that are in the QOF at the moment.</p>

Primary care is instrumental to the delivery not only of high-quality care but of cost-controlled care. We can see, in this country and in others, what happens when the people making clinical decisions are not also responsible for the resource consequences. GPs can be those people. They will be well rewarded, as they are and should be, but they should have the responsibility that goes with it. They should not be treated, as the Government have treated them, as production line drones who behave only as the Government direct.</p>

Most GPs to whom I have spoken would be happy to respond to that and would have no difficulty in doing so. Earlier this week, I spoke to a GP in Camden who said that when she went to the primary care trust and said that she wanted to open at 7 o&#146;clock in the morning because all the patients who wanted extended hours wanted them at that time, she was told, &#147;No, that is not good enough because the Government have told us that you&#146;ve got to open until 8 o&#146;clock in the evening.&#148; She does not have any patients who want to go there at 8 o&#146;clock in the evening&#151;they want to arrive at 7 o&#146;clock in the morning&#151;but the PCT is now in such a top-down system that it will not even listen to GPs and patients.</p>

We continue to support that premise. The role of the general practitioner as provider and commissioner of care, and as a strong advocate for their patients&#146; health and well-being, is central to everything that we are doing. It is why we have made an unparalleled investment in GP services, from &#163;3 billion in 1997 to &#163;8 billion today. It is why there are now 5,318 more GPs and 4,471 more practice nurses than there were in 1997. It is why GPs now spend, on average, 50 per cent. more time with each patient than they did in the 1990s. And it is why we have increased the pay and reduced the hours of GPs, thus resolving a serious recruitment problem, while introducing a quality and outcomes framework regarded with admiration around the world, which helps to make GPs central to the care of people with long-term conditions, achieving documented improvements in health outcomes for conditions such as asthma and diabetes. The Tory motion describes all of that as &#147;undermining and undervaluing...GPs&#148;. I can think of lots of professions that would love to be undermined and undervalued in such a way.</p>

 My hon. Friend makes an important point. We can take the example of London, where polyclinics are a specific proposition. A review of health services in London, carried out by NHS London and involving London clinicians, pointed out that for 40 years people have been trying to revamp, reorganise and update services there. In London, 54 per cent. of GP practices are single-handed, compared with an average of 40 per cent. throughout the country, and 97 per cent. of patients have to go to hospital for out-patient appointments. That figure stands at 90 per cent. in the rest of the country, which is still too high. The vast majority of people want to access such services in the community. In London, we have the worst problem of people going to A and E and clogging it up when they should go to primary care. That is why Lord Ara Darzi, working with clinicians in London, has devised a specific model for London, which is not a blueprint for the rest of the country.</p>

 Of course I can. Two central fallacies underpin the Tory party position. The first is that we are imposing a system of polyclinics throughout the country. We are not.

Those terms describe flexible models for bringing primary care together with a range of other services, be they diagnostic services, specialist care for patients with long-term conditions such as diabetes, or adult social care. It is hardly a novel idea. Health centres featured in the earliest descriptions of the national health service in 1948.

envy of the world. We should not, however, be complacent or take the view that the service is never capable of improvement to meet modern needs. We should always be prepared to accept the case for evidence-based reform. The Government must recognise that they damage the service, which is so widely supported among the general public, at their peril, because it is such an important part of our health service.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o72"><a name="80423-0007.htm_para2"><a name="08042357000282">Whatever the Secretary of State says about how fortunate GPs are, given the way in which the Government have treated them, he must recognise that morale among GPs is very low. I am sure that he talks to GPs throughout the country, so I am sure that he recognises that they feel demoralised. Indeed, one Norfolk GP said to me recently, &#147;We&#146;re well paid&#151;we recognise that&#151;but we feel that some of our professionalism has been taken away from us, because we&#146;re dictated to so much from up above&#148;&#151;that is, from Whitehall. When GPs try to develop practice-based commissioning, those who make the decisions often do not listen. When they try to refer patients for services such as those for teenagers with mental health problems and discover that services are inadequate or simply non-existent in rural Norfolk, they cannot feel much pride in their job, despite the fact that they are being well paid. The Secretary of State should recognise the real concerns among general practitioners, who take pride in their work, which they undertake for the very best of motives. Their concerns should not simply be dismissed as unfair attacks on the Government.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o73"><a name="80423-0007.htm_para3"><a name="08042357000283">I have spoken to a number of GPs in the past fortnight.

The second issue was the state of practice-based commissioning and where it is going. The Conservative spokesman rightly referred to the fact that it appeared to have completely stalled, certainly in many parts of the country. The third issue is the central imposition of what we must now call health centres, rather than polyclinics. I shall return to that issue later as well.</p>

Doctors feel that they are taking the blame for a contract that was ultimately the Government&#146;s contract. It was forced through three years ago, and GP leaders at the time warned the Government of the effect it would have. The National Audit Office reports that there has been a &#163;1.76 billion overspend on the contract since its introduction. Remarkably, the contract frustrates GPs while failing to be consistent with some of the Government&#146;s key objectives, particularly in regard to preventive care, despite the potential of the quality and outcomes framework&#151;QOF&#151; system. I fully recognise that the introduction of that system could do much to incentivise preventive care. The contract also fails to be consistent with the Government&#146;s stated objectives on reducing inequalities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o75"><a name="80423-0007.htm_para5"><a name="08042357000287">I want to deal specifically with the QOF system&#151;the system that encourages GPs to do all sorts of things with preventive care. When the QOF system is reviewed, there is an evidence-gathering process to determine what should be incentivised in the reviewed system. On this occasion, a lot of work was done to develop ideas for addressing osteoporosis, including testing those who are most at risk, especially after the first fracture. A lot of work was also done on peripheral arterial disease and on heart failure. But what happened then? The thing that particularly frustrated GPs and many others is that the entire objective evidence-gathering process came to nothing because, at the last minute, the Government decided that the political imperative was to force through a one-size-fits-all extension of hours. That is the reality.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o76"><a name="80423-0007.htm_para6"><a name="08042357000288">An NHS Confederation briefing yesterday confirmed that the political imperative had involved increased hours and that all the evidence-based work&#151;especially the work on osteoporosis&#151;had gone of the window. That is what frustrates clinicians who care about their patients more than anything. A one-size-fits-all extension of hours has now been forced through. I fully support the case for extending hours and for making access more flexible. I am sure that everyone in this Chamber finds it difficult to see their GP&#151;because of the hours we work and the fact that we work away from home&#151;quite apart from those on low incomes who feel anxious about taking time off work and who would like to see a GP outside normal working hours.</p>

 I agree with my hon. Friend about the one-size-fits-all solution. One of my local surgeries deals with a lot of commuters, and it has devised a scheme whereby people can e-mail their doctor and get a response on a certain day. Often, it is not a case of needing to see a doctor so much as needing to ask a question and getting reassurance, which might not be available from someone who does not know the patient. Would my hon. Friend support more such schemes being developed in the future?</p>

 Absolutely. All sorts of innovative things are being developed. In many practices, there is a commitment to speak to a patient by telephone on the same day, if an appointment cannot be arranged. Often, a telephone consultation is just what the patient needs. We should certainly support the use of e-mail and telephone consultations. Surely it should be for local commissioners to drive through decisions on increasing hours and making access more flexible in order to meet their local needs, rather than having a one-size-fits-all solution imposed from the centre.</p>

I understand that there was a written statement yesterday, although I have not seen it. I would welcome an intervention from the Secretary of State to tell us what might be about to happen. We understand that an announcement is imminent.  <br>

Will he tell us, either now or through the Minister of State, the hon. Member for Exeter (Mr. Bradshaw) at the end of the debate, what is proposed? A lot of people who care a lot about this matter want that work to be incentivised, because it involves good, preventive health care.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o78"><a name="80423-0007.htm_para8"><a name="08042357000292">In an earlier intervention, I challenged the Secretary of State about the fact that the GP contract often ends up paying more to GPs in the leafy suburbs than it does to those in the most deprived communities. I want first to look at the minimum practice income guarantee. The <i> Health Service Journal</i> has highlighted huge variations in payment to practices, regardless of the number of patients they serve or the needs of those patients. The article highlights two practices in Westminster, one of which happens to be based at Buckingham palace. That practice gets twice as much money as it ought to, because of the minimum practice income guarantee. The article states:</p>
<a name="80423-0007.htm_brev0"><a name="08042357001220"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Under the allocation formula, the Buckingham Palace practice was due to get just &#163;14,657 this year. But the guarantee added another &#163;16,505. That left the practice with payments of &#163;113 for each of its 276 needs-weighted patients, compared with the sample average of &#163;63.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o79"><a name="80423-0007.htm_para9"><a name="08042357000293">How on earth can the Government justify that system? They are paying more money to practices&#151;often in the more affluent communities&#151;that do not need it. As the <i> Health Service Journal</i> and many others have said, that money ought surely to be used to address health inequalities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o80"><a name="80423-0007.htm_para10"><a name="08042357000294">Another issue highlighted by the <i> Health Service Journal</i> is practices excluding patients under the QOF system. I hope that the Minister will be able to respond to this when he winds up the debate. Massive variations have been highlighted, with some practices excluding 10 times more patients than the national average. As I understand it, if patients can be excluded from the QOF target, it is easier to hit the target and to get the money. There is no evidence, however, that the problem is most serious in practices that genuinely find it difficult to approach patients because they are in hard-to-reach communities. For example, Tower Hamlets and the Heart of Birmingham primary care trusts have among the lowest levels of exclusions in the country. The point made by the <i> Health Service Journal</i> is that this is a misapplication of millions of pounds of public money that ought to be going towards reducing health inequalities in some of the most deprived communities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o81"><a name="80423-0007.htm_para11"><a name="08042357000295">Overall, the highest payments under the QOF system of incentivising GPs to undertake preventive health care, which is so important to reducing health care inequalities, go to practices in leafy suburbs. How on earth can the Government justify that system? My fear about the Conservative perspective is that if we simply give all the responsibility and power to GPs, that will ultimately do nothing to change such inequalities. Ultimately, if we are to ensure that money and funding is directed to the most disadvantaged communities, there is an essential role for strong commissioning.</p>

as health inequalities, which we would like to address with different mechanisms. Perforce, such mechanisms are often seen as top-down control&#151;and it seems to be another shibboleth that we should decry that sort of control. Will the hon. Gentleman explain how one does that balancing act? It is difficult for any of the three main parties to balance in their policies the top-down element, which, unlike local control, we think we do not like, bearing in mind some of the results that flow from local control&#151;most notably displayed in the phrase &#147;postcode lottery&#148;.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman makes a thoughtful intervention. There is, of course, the potential for conflict. Ultimately, however, our highly centrally controlled system has failed to deliver in reducing health inequalities; and all the evidence suggests, particularly if we reflect on what happens overseas, that real engagement at the local level and integrating services for health and social care with housing, community regeneration and so forth is the best way to address those underlying inequalities. Change to that extent cannot be delivered from Whitehall; it simply does not work. All the evidence from centrally controlled systems demonstrates that point. For me, then, we are more likely to achieve success if we provide genuine accountability to the communities that are served.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o82"><a name="80423-0007.htm_para12"><a name="08042357000298">The evidence that I have picked up from talking to GPs in many different parts of the country&#151;it was reflected in what the hon. Member for South Cambridgeshire (Mr. Lansley) said earlier&#151;suggests that practice-based commissioning is dead in the water. There is a growing frustration among GPs that all their efforts to try to make something of it and put forward innovative ideas about services that could be delivered in a community setting close to people&#146;s homes&#151;perhaps avoiding the need for a long journey to an acute hospital&#151;are falling on stony ground. They feel that there is no longer any political drive behind it, which has resulted in GPs becoming completely disillusioned with the concept, increasingly believing that it is going nowhere.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o83"><a name="80423-0007.htm_para13"><a name="08042357000299">Over the past few weeks, I met a group of GPs in Dorset. I noticed that the Conservative spokesman was in Poole, so I was about 10 miles up the road from there.

 The hon. Gentleman is making an intelligent point, but I have to say that I disagree with him on a number of issues. Certainly in my area, the availability of alternative community-based clinics has made a radical difference to GP referral patterns&#151;hugely to the benefit of patients and patient satisfaction. In my practice, we do regular surveys of patient satisfaction and we have seen significant increased satisfaction as a result of patients being able to see medical people much closer to their homes and much more focused on their GP practice. In many cases, they receive care and treatment from people they personally know, which has to be an advantage. I accept that in other areas it might not be working as well, but the model itself seems to work very well.</p>

The Conservative spokesman acknowledged, in response to an earlier intervention, the importance of recognising the potential for conflicts of interest, but that is absent from the Conservative motion and from most of their pronouncements. There are real concerns, including among many GPs, about potential conflicts of interest, and it cannot be said that GPs will always act in the patient&#146;s interests. One example can be seen in what I said earlier about exclusions under the QOF system. In my view, it is a dangerous game simply to believe that GPs can run the whole system. They are absolutely central to it, but their role has to be combined with strong, effective commissioning.</p>

 I entirely support that approach. As I said earlier, I should prefer a PCT that decided to adopt it to be democratically accountable to the community that it served, but I have no difficulty with the concept.

We in Norfolk are in a ludicrous position. We face the loss of a community hospital in Aylsham, a market town, and we are seeing the loss of beds in other community hospitals. Surely we should develop existing, trusted centres of excellence and take the consultants out of acute hospitals, ending the divide between primary and secondary care and providing genuine local care for those who need it.</p>

They have conveyed the clear message that they dislike the degree of central control exercised by the present Government, yet they propose to introduce a CSA-style unaccountable quango, presumably based in London, to direct the national health service. The Child Support Agency is rather unpopular, and I suspect that when people find that their local hospital is to be closed by a centralised unaccountable quango in London, they will regard it much as they regard the CSA. There is no democratic local accountability in that, and the Conservatives know it. They reject this model, and decide instead to retain the idea of a centralised system.

 I wish to start by paying tribute to GP Professor Dr. Brian McGuinness who retired this week as the chairman of the Society of Medical Writers. He is plain old Dr. McGuinness to me and he epitomises the type of GP that we all talk about. He was the ultimate family GP. I have not seen him for about 20 years, but he established one of the first large GP practices that I was aware of, in a socially deprived area in the north-west. That practice encompassed many of the services that we have been talking about with regard to polyclinics. His practice was not a polyclinic&#151;it did not have a fancy title&#151;but it was a good practice providing a good service to the local community, commensurate with its needs.</p>

The practice had seven or eight GPs and provided adequate services to the local community and was well respected. Dr. McGuinness was possibly one of the most highly regarded GPs I have ever known, especially in the socially deprived area in which he practised. He recently received a lifetime achievement award, but it is to his credit that he has vowed to continue to work to encourage GPs and other medics to write about their experiences. I therefore begin by paying tribute to GP Professor Dr. Brian McGuinness, who is one of the best of men as well as one of the best doctors I have ever encountered.</p>

As their MP, my job is to represent the opinion of all my constituents, and my GPs have some very strong opinions about what is happening and the Government&#146;s proposals. They are unanimous in being incredibly angry and they feel undermined and persecuted by the Government. It all stems from the much spun pay rise that GPs received in 2004. It is very rarely mentioned that that pay rise brought GPs&#146; pay to an acceptable level, given their training, experience, commitment and hours. Before the pay rise, GPs were one of the lowest paid professions, so it was right to give them that pay rise and bring their pay to that level.</p>

It was preposterous to have stories about GPs earning &#163;250,000 on the front page of national newspapers, and that did GPs no good. As I said when I intervened on the Secretary of State earlier, GPs represent the most cost-effective and efficient branch of the health service. They cost &#163;20 per consultation, even for long consultations.</p>

However, over the past few years, that has suddenly and dramatically changed and it is again becoming difficult to recruit.

GPs work on the relationship with their patients because they know the value of having a good relationship with them, including an element of confidence. Polyclinics will probably include Australian or other antipodean doctors, or Polish doctors. They will come and staff the clinic for six months, probably as part of their travels, and then move on.

As there are shortages of fully trained medical practitioners in many parts of the country, will not the system embed second-class health care at polyclinics for some of the most vulnerable people in our communities?</p>

 My hon. Friend is absolutely right. The polyclinics will take off in the areas of higher social deprivation where, because of the transient nature of those who will work in those polyclinics and the problems in various hospitals, such as Peterborough, we will see a lesser service on offer rather than a better one. GPs who can combine&#151;like those in the example from Macclesfield that we were given&#151;will do so if it is what the community wants, desires and needs. If it is cost-effective and serves the community better, nothing stops GPs getting together now to provide such services. Many GP practices already do that so there is no barrier to the essence of a polyclinic; GPs can provide that service if their patients need it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o111"><a name="80423-0008.htm_para18"><a name="08042357000350">I hope that the Minister will clarify those services that a polyclinic will provide better to a community than those that GPs have the freedom to provide now. What is this magic bullet represented by a polyclinic? What will it do that GPs cannot do today?</p>

 I can help the hon. Lady on that point. One thing that polyclinics will do, for example, is to be open 12 hours a day, seven days a week. Virtually no GP practices are open for such hours. Secondly, polyclinics will provide services such as radiography, blood testing, ECGs and all sorts of facilities that are not available in the vast majority of GP practices&#151;nor are they likely to be. Polyclinics are a model that will, we hope, keep patients away from acute hospitals and prevent long queues forming in accident and emergency made up of people who have no need to be there. They will enable those people to be looked after in a much more comfortable setting much closer to  <br>

 The hon. Gentleman makes a number of points. The only reason that we see pressures on accident and emergency services at the moment is that cottage hospitals and community hospitals are being closed down. As for 12-hour practices, I have had no letters in my postbag on that subject and no constituents coming to my surgeries to say, &#147;I wish my doctors&#146; surgery was open for 12 hours a day.&#148; It is unreasonable to expect GP surgeries to open for 12 hours a day, if we have good local facilities provided by the PCT.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o112"><a name="80423-0008.htm_para19"><a name="08042357000353">Let me give an example to the hon. Gentleman. A GP recently told me of a PCT manager who got very stroppy with him in his surgery, because the GP had seen a patient who had been out of hospital for 10 days after a post-partum haemorrhage in hospital, and who went to his surgery and complained of chest pains and a pain in the leg. She was a very poorly lady. The GP immediately thought that that could be a pulmonary embolism, did the right thing and sent her to hospital. He was then criticised by the PCT for doing so, when any GP anywhere would do the same in such circumstances, polyclinic or no polyclinic. When a GP sees a patient with acute needs, such as chest pains, he saves the PCT that &#163;3,000 admission fee, because many GPs will diagnose and treat in their surgery as far as possible before sending a patient to hospital.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o113"><a name="80423-0008.htm_para20"><a name="08042357000354">I do not see polyclinics as filling a need because I do not think that the need is there. GPs provide an excellent service; they save PCTs a huge amount of money; and they are incredibly cost-effective. Patients like the service. They like having a local GP. GPs enjoy building up a good relationship with their patients, so why, if it is not broken, do we need to fix it? That is what I do not understand.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o114"><a name="80423-0008.htm_para21"><a name="08042357000355">In areas such as Macclesfield, where we need such services, we have provided them. What is the image of the polyclinic? Why are we imposing such a service on to communities? Why are we making it more difficult for patients? Why are we imposing something that doctors do not want?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o115"><a name="80423-0008.htm_para22"><a name="08042357000356">On the point about blood counts, can anyone show me a GP who does not take blood tests and send them on to a hospital lab? A GP who does not do that in his practice should not be a GP. Many GPs provide that service&#151;I have never heard of one who does not. Can anyone show me a GP who does not refer on for radiography or who does not provide the test? They have those services at their fingertips if they need them. </p>

 New technology offers other opportunities. Clearly, the hon. Member for Dartford (Dr. Stoate) might not be aware of the pilot scheme in Lancashire whereby GPs&#146; surgeries can send ECGs to a centre in Manchester where trained cardiac nurses interpret them on their behalf. They do not need the patients to go to a single place. Local GPs are perfectly capable of carrying out 12-lead ECGs and sending them off for remote interpretation.</p>

the need for polyclinics, but I do understand that GPs are not happy. Patients do not understand the need for polyclinics. In fact, nobody understands why the Government are doing this. The system is not broken, so why are the Government trying to impose this change unless they are trying to save costs in some way?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o116"><a name="80423-0008.htm_para23"><a name="08042357000359">In conclusion, I have voiced the concerns of my GPs and patients, who are happy with long-established GPs in my constituency. They do not want a polyclinic. They like what they have at the moment. If they were to have anything, they would want greater resources to be given to GPs so that they could extend the services that they currently offer. They do not want a centralised polyclinic to which they would have to travel, particularly in Bedfordshire.</p>

<a name="80423-0009.htm_brev0"><a name="08042357001226"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Let me try to understand. They are, apparently, totally opposed to the &#147;privatisation&#148; of general practice&#151;yet, of course, the private sector is precisely where they themselves work and earn their crust!&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o121"><a name="80423-0009.htm_para4"><a name="08042357000367">I was rather disappointed by a document distributed at yesterday&#146;s NHS Confederation briefing. Headed &#147;Privatisation and reduced quality&#148;, it stated:</p>

However, this seems to ignore the fact that GP practices are independent for-profit contractors already.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o122"><a name="80423-0009.htm_para5"><a name="08042357000368">The most effective response to that approach comes from the pressure group &#147;Keep Our NHS Public&#148;. It is not a rabid, left-wing group: its members are highly dedicated professionals who are passionate supporters of the NHS, through and through, and I shall paraphrase some of the points that they make.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o123"><a name="80423-0009.htm_para6"><a name="08042357000369">The group accepts that GPs are independent contractors, but asserts that they are crucially different from the large corporations that stand ready to compete for the provision of health services. It says that GPs know their patients and are driven by local priorities&#151;exactly what the Secretary of State said when he acknowledged the value of the relationship between GPs and local families. The group believes that profits for shareholders drive the private corporations, and that those corporations will decide which patients to treat and which services to offer.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o124"><a name="80423-0009.htm_para7"><a name="08042357000370">The pressure group believes that professional judgment can be overridden by company policy, and that governance and the monitoring of standards of care could be impeded by commercial confidentiality. It also says that the skill mix may be downgraded, and that NHS pay, conditions of service and pensions might not be retained. I believe that such warnings about the dangers of commercialisation need to be taken very seriously, and in that regard I commend to Ministers two seminal articles that have been published recently.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o125"><a name="80423-0009.htm_para8"><a name="08042357000371">The first article appeared in the <i> British Medical Journal</i>, and it looked at the US experience of competition in the health care system. It said that the US has long combined public funding with private health care management and delivery. It noted that extensive research had found that the US&#146; for-profit health institutions provide inferior care at inflated prices, and that the US experience shows that market mechanisms undermine medical institutions that are unable&#151;or unwilling&#151;to tailor care to profitability. Finally, the article said that the poor performance of US health care is directly attributable to reliance on market mechanisms and for-profit firms, and that it should serve to warn other nations from following that path.</p>

plan, and it also looks at revenue-maximisation strategies, the concentration on lucrative procedures and the selection of risk. It even pays a tribute to the British system, saying:</p>
<a name="80423-0009.htm_brev3"><a name="08042357001229"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;When the British NHS faced a shortage of primary care doctors, it adjusted pay schedules and added incentives for high-quality care, and the shortage diminished. Our commercialised system seems incapable of producing that result.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o128"><a name="80423-0009.htm_para11"><a name="08042357000374">The article ends with the observation:</p>
<a name="80423-0009.htm_brev4"><a name="08042357001230"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Sometimes we Americans do the right thing only after exhausting all other alternatives. It remains to be seen how much exhaustion the health care system will suffer before we turn to national health insurance.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o129"><a name="80423-0009.htm_para12"><a name="08042357000375">That worry has been reinforced by at least one whistleblower, who was reported in <i> The Guardian</i> on 9 April. I have seen the papers involved, which I think that he probably sent to all members of the Health Committee. They were very long and complicated, so I do not blame any colleague who has not read them through, but the man who provided them has seen the lengths to which organisations that want to break into the market will go to enhance profits. I am reminded of the recent revelations about how a drug manufacturer went to unethical lengths to prolong the life of one of its proprietary drugs that was long out of patent.</p>

That terrible quandary arises because I am not completely sure that the NHS as I have known it for years will be entirely safe under either of the two main parties. I do not yet know how I shall decide to vote, but my voting record would suffer if I did not support either proposition.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o131"><a name="80423-0009.htm_para14"><a name="08042357000377">I welcome much of what the Government have done for the NHS. I appreciate the extra money that they have provided and the way that they have handled the service, but I hope that they will look very seriously at the warnings that I have repeated about the dangers of opening up family doctor services to commercialisation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o132"><a name="80423-0009.htm_para15"><a name="08042357000378">However, I am also worried about the Conservatives. We all know the proverb about how difficult it is for a leopard to change its spots, but it has a corollary&#151;that even when a leopard does change its spots, it remains rather proud of having had them. The changes to the NHS made by the previous Tory Government included the introduction of market forces, the purchaser-provider split and the private finance initiative. I therefore cannot quite accept that any future Conservative Government would oppose the commercialisation that I strongly believe is not welcome in general practice.</p>

worried about how it might affect their practices and patients. I therefore think that it will help the House if I set out what I see as the vision for this type of health care.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o134"><a name="80423-0009.htm_para17"><a name="08042357000381">I envisage a mechanism whereby people can be treated far closer to their own homes, with far less reliance on public transport, far shorter queues and much less reliance on accident and emergency departments, which are often inappropriate places for people to go with many health care needs. They are often not seen by the most appropriate person in the department, and in many cases it is not the nicest place to be. A and E departments simply become clogged up, which often gets in the way of the serious, life-saving work that they need to do. The last thing that they need is a group of patients coming to the A and E who would be far more appropriately treated by their GP practice, district nurse or pharmacist, in a setting that would be far better for their health care.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o135"><a name="80423-0009.htm_para18"><a name="08042357000382">It is important to set out exactly what the polyclinic model is intended to do. The hon. Member for Mid-Bedfordshire (Mrs. Dorries) said that there is nothing that a polyclinic can provide that cannot be provided by a GP service. I am sorry that she is not currently in her place. The fact is that a polyclinic or such a model could offer a huge number of services that currently cannot be made available in GP services. An obvious example is X-rays. The hon. Member for South Cambridgeshire (Mr. Lansley) made the point that ECGs can be sent online. Of course they can, and of course blood tests can be taken in GP practices. However, it is much more difficult for a GP practice to have an X-ray or ultrasound department with the necessary scanning equipment and range of health care professionals. That is well beyond the scope of current general practice, and we need a radically new way of deciding how those facilities should be produced.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o136"><a name="80423-0009.htm_para19"><a name="08042357000383">When I ask my patients what they want, they say that they want to be treated as near to their homes as possible, hopefully by people whom they know, trust and have had dealings with before. They do not want to go and sit in a crowded, noisy hospital among patients who clearly have far greater health needs and therefore should obviously take priority. The polyclinic model is a good example of how we can transform patient experience.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o137"><a name="80423-0009.htm_para20"><a name="08042357000384">Another obvious example of why the system might work is that it is currently estimated that every time somebody walks into A and E, it costs the health service about &#163;150. A GP consultation costs about &#163;20, so we can immediately see that anybody who attends their GP surgery instead of going to A and E will lead to a dramatic saving in health care expenditure, which could therefore be targeted better than by spending it on A and E. Obviously a polyclinic would have extra fixed costs and there would be other services to consider, but it would still mean a significant cost saving compared with people going to A and E, and it would therefore leave far more money for investment in NHS services and for better use in patient care.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o138"><a name="80423-0009.htm_para21"><a name="08042357000385">The NHS has moved on. Clinical practice is evolving all the time, and patients&#146; expectations are changing. When I first entered general practice, people almost always had surgery as in-patients in hospital. They often stayed in hospital for several days, or even weeks. Now, 70 to 80 per cent. of all surgery is day surgery.  <br>

The idea of relying on large, impersonal hospitals is a model that has outgrown its usefulness, and we need to move on to a much more flexible and modern approach. I believe that polyclinics, rather than diminish the range of services and choice, will increase it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o139"><a name="80423-0009.htm_para22"><a name="08042357000386">The myth that goes around that if a polyclinic is set up, patients will no longer have a choice of GP, is clearly rubbish. Under the patient choice directive, patients will be able to request a specific GP. Provided that that GP is on duty, that it is reasonable and that he or she has the available appointments, the patient will be able to specify that GP. It does not have to be impersonal. In fact, the model that I read out in an earlier intervention will, in many cases, be based around existing practices, which could be significantly extended or developed to add the extra services that are not currently available, albeit with extra funding and resourcing.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o140"><a name="80423-0009.htm_para23"><a name="08042357000387">Another advantage of polyclinics is that they will allow GPs, acute specialists and other health professionals such as pharmacists to work together for the first time. General practice can often be isolating, and in small, isolated practices it is often quite difficult to have the mix of colleagues and clinical expertise that is required for personal and professional development.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o141"><a name="80423-0009.htm_para24"><a name="08042357000388">I am aware that time is pressing on, so I do not wish to go on too long, but I wish briefly to quote Mr. Anthony McKeever, the chief executive of the care trust in Bexley, where my practice is situated. I wrote to him recently to ask what the PCT&#146;s model of polyclinics was. He stated:</p>
<a name="80423-0009.htm_brev5"><a name="08042357001231"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;We do not intend to create polyclinics on the assumption that &#145;one size would fit all&#146;...A couple of local practices have indicated that they would like actively to explore the possibilities of providing a more integrated care landscape...So, there will be plenty of opportunity to avoid the pitfalls which some anticipate...Certainly, however, the GPs I spoke to direct recognised that the development of primary care &#145;hubs&#146; or polyclinics could be achieved without damaging and unintended consequences.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o142"><a name="80423-0009.htm_para25"><a name="08042357000389">As far as I can see, that is the chief executive of a PCT being sensible and pragmatic and understanding that flexibility is perfectly acceptable under the Government&#146;s plans, and who actively wishes to work with local GP practices to ensure that what actually happens is a huge improvement in patient care outcomes.

I do not believe that they have made the case transparently and openly for a Kaiser Permanente, California model of private sector health provision. They know full well that were they to make that case, they would not get it past their own parliamentary party, the health sector trade unions or other health care professionals.

<p><a name="stpa_o144"><a name="80423-0009.htm_para27"><a name="08042357000392">It is ironic that the Secretary of State was in crowing mood. As I said earlier, we always see the vacuity of the Labour party&#146;s record and arguments on the health sector when it has to go back 60 years, to historic documents about what was or was not said by general practitioners and medical practitioners in 1947. The fact is that this Government have presided over a doubling of expenditure on the health service but barely any change in outputs and the impact on patients. Their work force planning was described in the Select Committee&#146;s report last year as &#147;disastrous.&#148; The right hon. Member for Rother Valley (Mr. Barron) was noticeably shy in not sharing that with the House.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o145"><a name="80423-0009.htm_para28"><a name="08042357000393">The Government have presided over a health service in which one is more likely to die of a hospital-acquired infection than, for instance, in a road traffic accident. They will have spent approximately &#163;100 billion on the health service, and we will not take any lectures from a Government who, for example, have increased GP salaries by 50 per cent. for less work. I do not blame the general practitioners for that; it is this Government&#146;s cack-handed mismanagement that has resulted in that situation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o146"><a name="80423-0009.htm_para29"><a name="08042357000394">I well remember that the then Prime Minister came to Peterborough in April 2000 to open the walk-in centre in Midgate, in the city centre. Such centres were then the great thing, the next big thing of Labour&#146;s Maoist onward march of health reform. They were going to solve all the problems and take up the slack in the primary care sector. Of course, they are not in fashion now, so we have even more change.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o147"><a name="80423-0009.htm_para30"><a name="08042357000395">My opposition to the scheme is not a knee-jerk opposition to change. Dare I say it, I am quite Fabian in my approach&#151;I believe in the inevitability of gradualism. In such a big organisation, there will always be change, but I object to the top-down approach of the change and the fact that there is no real autonomy, authority or democracy in respect of general practitioners, health care professionals, nurses, managers, elected councillors and others at local level. The change is being imposed. That is to be regretted&#151;a point made by Members across the House.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o148"><a name="80423-0009.htm_para31"><a name="08042357000396">General practitioners in particular need to be properly consulted; they need buy-in to the new health centres or polyclinics. It is no good the Secretary of State, in his rather uncharacteristically sneering remarks, belittling the work of GPs, who are the most trusted health care professionals in the UK&#151;perhaps the only point in my speech with which the hon. Member for Dartford will agree. It ill behoves the Secretary of State to take that confrontational tone, and it is no wonder that such a significant number of GPs are not predisposed to vote Labour at the next general election.</p>

We have issues around asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder, diabetes and heart disease. We have a large ethnic minority population who are predisposed to some chronic conditions. We felt that to be subsumed into a greater Cambridgeshire PCT was not appropriate&#151;the fact that the trust was approximately &#163;30 million in deficit at the time concentrated our minds somewhat, too.

As I said earlier, I cannot believe that of a Government who seem to be having a nervous breakdown in their interaction with those who should be their core supporters. We know that the Labour party has always had a rather sanctimonious, smug attitude&#151;only Labour cares about public health, the poorest people in our society and the health service. Of course, that has never, ever been true.</p>

All fine and dandy in principle, but what does one-stop medicine actually mean? Where will the doctors to staff the polyclinic come from? No established doctor who has his or her own family practice will want to give it up to work at a polyclinic. Does that mean that less experienced and capable staff will be recruited? I hope not.

We have had a huge influx of EU migration in Peterborough that has put massive strain on surgeries across the city, notably the surgery of Drs.

Member for Romsey (Sandra Gidley) would probably jump up and tell us that our constituents&#146; first port of call for health care help and professional advice is the local pharmacist, and not the local GP; that will remain the case. The vast majority of doctors who work in family care services are committed to their flock&#151;their patients in the community where they practise.

In their changes, the Government are investing an extra &#163;250 million to establish more than 250 new primary care services, which will include both GP-run health centres and GP practices. Some 113 of them will be established in some of the most deprived communities in the country which have historically been under-doctored. There will be 152 new state-of-the-art GP-led health centres, which will be open between 8 am and 8 pm, seven days a week. One such structure will be built in a constituency that neighbours mine, but it will serve my constituents well. Those health centres will offer a wide range of health services, including pre-bookable GP appointments and walk-in services for registered and non-registered patients, and a range of specialist services.</p>

Particularly for those who do not have their own transport, it is a lot easier to go to the town centre by bus than it is to get to the local hospital, so it will be a great advantage to urban Rotherham to have that facility, which will be open seven days a week, 12 hours a day.</p>

people with young families. I thought that that was a gross misinterpretation of the agreement, and so did the primary care trust. It had to try to negotiate with the GP practice on whether it would relax its strict interpretation of the rule and free-up access in a reasonable way. We were not talking about opening the practice seven days a week, 12 hours a day; we just wanted to free-up access in a reasonable way, so that people who were on that family doctor services list could get seen in a more reasonable time. That was a complaint about one surgery; there were no complaints about the many other GP surgeries in my constituency. </p>

 Perhaps I can help my right hon. Friend. The issue is not so much about the number of people who demand such services when they are well as it is about the number of people who are using accident and emergency departments on a Saturday and Sunday, but who would far rather be seen in their local clinic, a bus ride away, by their local GP, pharmacist or practice nurse. The real benefit of opening 12 hours a day, seven days a week, is far more to do with keeping people away from accident and emergency departments&#151;many of which may be 10 or 20 miles away, or even more&#151;that are inappropriate for them.

 I agree. The question posed in the motion, and asked by the hon. Member for South Cambridgeshire (Mr. Lansley), is: what about walk-in centres? Our walk-in centre in Rotherham will close. It is based in a pretty old building that used to be a hospital. It is not an acute hospital now, although services such as podiatry are based there. People will instead go to the new primary health care centre&#151;we are not calling it a polyclinic&#151;that will be built in Rotherham. I had an e-mail from the primary care trust earlier this week saying that there will be two new GP practices in there. Those practices will not be transferred; they will be new. It also said that local GPs who want to bid for that contract will have the right to do so. Family doctor services could even expand if they are successful in obtaining an NHS contract to provide that type of service in the Rotherham primary care centre. We should recognise that no matter who runs such centres, those are national health service contracts designed to provide better services for our constituents.</p>

This is the first time I have said that, but it is a true representation of how decisions have been taken for the past 59 years.</p>

England and Wales. It is a little less now because of the action that this Government have taken, but are GPs flooding into South Yorkshire to come and work alongside the hard-working GPs dealing with massive problems at every surgery, because of the difficulties that we have, sadly, with smoking, drinking, eating and the scars that industry has left on individuals?

The rest of them get on with doing a very hard job under difficult circumstances because of the size of their patient list and the disease burden that those patients carry. The BMA badly misrepresents GPs, as it did on the issue of extending practice opening by a few hours in the evening and on Saturday. The BMA and the GPs within it are badly led.</p>

 It is a great pleasure to follow the right hon. Member for Rother Valley (Mr. Barron), who is always worth listening to. He is the Chairman of my Select Committee, so I must be nice to him.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o185"><a name="80423-0011.htm_para12"><a name="08042357000451">I have had a number of briefings from doctors on this subject. I went to a town hall-style meeting in the village of Great Doddington that was attended by 100 people, where the local GP spoke with great passion about her worry that the result would be that the village surgery would close. I can see the appeal of having many services on one site, but there is a real concern that centralising provision and making facilities bigger may result in the loss of village practices, which would be to the detriment of my constituents.</p>

Unfortunately when I had finished that electioneering I fell flat on my face, did my leg in and cracked my ribs and I was covered in blood. I finished up at the GP&#146;s surgery, and while she prodded and poked me she had a great opportunity to explain her concerns in some detail. In all the time that I have been a Member of Parliament, when I have been told something by those who are highly respected in the community, I have always taken on board their concerns.

 The hon. Gentleman raises an interesting point, because precisely that situation has arisen in many areas other than in Northamptonshire.

My wife went to see her local GP, but saw another instead who said she had nothing to worry about. She did not get better, so she saw her own doctor, who knew her history intimately. She had liver cancer; she was immediately referred to the acute hospital and, thanks to the NHS, she was saved. This happened five years ago. My concern is if that situation had involved a polyclinic where she did not know the doctor, I am not sure whether she would have bothered to go back to get a second opinion.</p>

 I am interested to hear the hon. Gentleman&#146;s examples and am sorry to hear about his cut leg and cracked ribs. If the hon. Gentleman&#146;s GP had decided that he needed an X-ray, or if his wife&#146;s GP had decided to order a liver ultrasound scan, it would have been far better to have that X-ray or ultrasound scan then and there in the same clinic, rather than waiting for two or three weeks for provision in one of the local hospitals, which might be 20 miles away. Surely it is better to have the ultrasound scanner and the X-ray machine on the same site to deal with such matters as one-stop events?</p>

I have found no one who does not want this. We must travel miles to get to a hospital, and we are in an expansion area where 52,000 new homes are about to be built. We want a hospital. Listening to this debate, my fear is that somebody will say, &#147;They can have a polyclinic, because then we will not have to provide them with a hospital,&#148; which would be totally and utterly unacceptable.

The key issues to come out of the debate are the disparity in existing provision, the nervousness about future provision and the potential for a break in the important GP-patient relationship.

He was also right to highlight the concerns about the imposition of polyclinics or GP-led health centres&#151;it is whatever the Government have chosen to call them today&#151;which will be centralised, top-down structures that will be unresponsive to local needs in some circumstances and undermine access in rural areas.

 Sadly, the Secretary of State is not in his place. Unusually for him, the issue has clearly rattled him. He did not set out how he will explain to his constituents that the PCT that covers his constituency has admitted that it sees the imposition of a polyclinic as an opportunity to reconfigure GP services, thereby possibly closing existing practitioners. He did not support the family GP, and, interestingly enough, he did not defend the imposition of health care centres or polyclinics.</p>

It is right that the Opposition support any willing provider. I can give the hon.

He is right to highlight the additional pressure on accident and emergency departments, which was initially a direct result of the Government contracting both extended and out-of-hours services under the GP contract, which came into operation in 2004. Before I move on, I also want to know whether the hon.

<p><a name="stpa_o197"><a name="80423-0011.htm_para24"><a name="08042357000470">The right hon. Member for Rother Valley (Mr. Barron) is a distinguished Chairman of the Health Committee, and his contributions are always thoughtful and serious. He was right to say that GPs are the backbone of the NHS and that less well-represented areas often face serious problems with health inequalities. There is no political difference between the three main political parties that that needs to be addressed. However, the Government amendment deliberately obfuscates and confuses two particular central Government initiatives, which need to be separated and debated independently. As the right hon. Gentleman said, patients demand greater access, and we support that demand where it is necessary. However, we also need to consider why it is there. The reason Members of Parliament found significant constituency concern when the contract was changed was that patients found that access to their GPs was not as it had been before. That concern has died down because patients have found a way of circumventing the problem, by going to accident and emergency and putting additional pressure on ambulance trusts. We need to make sure that the decision in respect of services used is with the patient, not with central Government.</p>

Government&#146;s failure to deliver improvements, particularly in the context of the significant amount of taxpayers&#146; money that has been invested in the national health service. He was also right to point out the important requirement for GPs and their patients to be consulted properly about the central Government proposals.</p>

He gave a direct example of how that had benefited his constituents in Peterborough. My hon.

<p><a name="stpa_o201"><a name="80423-0011.htm_para28"><a name="08042357000474">In the time that remains, I want to highlight some of the key issues. I turn first to the GP contract. We should not allow the Government to get away with the view that GPs are somehow responsible for the reduction in out-of-hours and extended hours provision. That reduction was the direct result of the GP contract that was imposed by the Government and effectively led to reduced patient access. Furthermore, the cost of out-of-hours provision has increased by two or three times because the Government have insisted that it should be provided by primary care trusts rather than general practitioners. That has led to announcements, even last week, of cuts in out-of-hours services by contractors to primary care trusts.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o202"><a name="80423-0011.htm_para29"><a name="08042357000475">The subsequent Government reversal, as they attempted to reinstate what they were responsible for withdrawing, has shattered the relationship between the Government and GPs, resulting in GPs being very upset. In a poll, 98 per cent. of them said that they thought that the Government&#146;s methods of negotiation were unacceptable and 97 per cent. said that they had no confidence in the Government&#146;s handling of the national health service.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o203"><a name="80423-0011.htm_para30"><a name="08042357000476">All that is not the responsibility of the current Secretary of State. However, he has exacerbated the problems through his Department&#146;s tactics. The Government seriously miscalculated the number of points that GPs would earn. They rewarded GPs for a level of activity that was already in place, and that has been a significant contributory factor in the drop in productivity, leading to an additional cost of &#163;1.76 billion to the taxpayer.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o204"><a name="80423-0011.htm_para31"><a name="08042357000477">We Conservatives are not against polyclinics or GP health centres; in fact, when they are supported by the local community, via GPs and patients, we support them. However, we are deeply concerned about the Government&#146;s plans to impose polyclinics or GP health centres in every primary care trust. That is imposition without consultation or evidence. According to the Department of Health website, the consultation process is supposed to finish on 15 May, three weeks&#146; time. However, in certain circumstances there has, to date, been no consultation at all.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o205"><a name="80423-0011.htm_para32"><a name="08042357000478">The House must understand that we are not talking about some minor tweak to primary care. The establishment of GP-led health centres and polyclinics will be the largest change to primary care since the establishment of the NHS 60 years ago. We have heard stories about how polyclinics and GP-led health centres will be inconvenient for some individuals. They will be suitable for some, particularly in urban areas, but there is real concern among GPs&#151;and, more importantly, their patients&#151;in rural communities.</p>

and more convenient. There are arguments against the contention that they will be more convenient, particularly in respect of rural areas. In fact, polyclinics are more expensive than traditional GP surgeries, in respect of not only infrastructure, but the occupancy costs per patient. In addition, the Government must not underestimate the importance of GPs acting as gatekeepers controlling access to expensive secondary care. We Conservatives will not coerce GPs and their patients into polyclinics against their will.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o207"><a name="80423-0012.htm_para1"><a name="08042357000480">Other mechanisms and structures could be put in place and need to be considered. For example, an innovative system is operating in the floor above the Boots store in the centre of Poole, where a consortium of GPs is providing a range of services that are proving much more accessible than those at the traditional GP practice.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o208"><a name="80423-0012.htm_para2"><a name="08042357000481">Let me ask a few brief questions. Ministers are not&#151;or were not until the Secretary of State seemed to change the policy earlier&#151;allowing PCTs to consider the appropriateness of a polyclinic or GP-led health centre for their area. Will the Minister confirm his view? Ministers are not insisting on consultation, ensuring consideration of the impact on patient care or basing their decisions on evidence. Ministers are not allowing PCTs to use their money instead to improve the provision of health care through existing practices. Why, for example, will they not allow PCTs to use this money to invest in community hospitals rather than GP-led health centres&#151;the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Beverley and Holderness (Mr. Stuart)? Why will not they allow non-spearhead PCTs to invest this money for smaller GP practices in socio-economically deprived areas, thereby reducing health inequalities? Why will they not allow this money, if desired by a primary care trust, to be invested in, for example, occupational health?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o209"><a name="80423-0012.htm_para3"><a name="08042357000482">In short, the Government have been holed below the waterline as regards any suggestion that the central command and control era is over&#151;in fact, it is going in exactly the opposite direction under this Prime Minister. At a time when the Government are closing and downgrading rural services such as post offices, local schools and police stations, we cannot have yet another local service under threat. Local accountability, local decision making, local consultation and local needs and requirements are all being overridden by Ministers. We will change that. We will empower local GPs and patients to reflect local communities&#146; needs and requirements, driven by quality of service and by patient outcomes. Our plans will drive improvement in the provision of health care and deliver a better, more effective, more efficient and patient-focused national health service.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o211"><a name="80423-0012.htm_para5"><a name="08042357000485">We recognise the vital importance of the GP as provider and commissioner of care and as a strong advocate for their patients&#146; health and well-being. The primary care system in this country is the envy of the world. I therefore reject the accusation contained in the Opposition&#146;s motion that GPs are undervalued and under-appreciated. In fact, there are today more than 5,000 more GPs than there were in 1997, and their average pay has increased from &#163;46,000 in 1997 to &#163;110,000 in 2005-06. Investment in primary care services has more than doubled from &#163;3 billion in 1997 to &#163;8 billion in 2005-06, and GPs as a whole do a fantastic job.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o212"><a name="80423-0012.htm_para6"><a name="08042357000486">However, health care can never stand still. Sixty years on, the NHS must react to 21st century challenges, offering services that are responsive to what patients want and need. The NHS next stage review interim report, &#147;Our NHS, our future&#148;, which we published last autumn, recognised the need to improve access to primary care and community services, and it set out a number of proposals to make services more equitable and to ensure that patients have real choice. Those included &#163;250 million of new money for new GP practices in the most under-doctored areas, benefiting patients in 50 primary care trust areas, and for more than 150 new GP-run health centres&#151;one in each primary care trust area in England.</p>

They will all have a strong focus on promoting health, particularly to hard-to-reach groups, and on preventing health inequalities. When we talk about developing health centres or when some local parts of the health service describe plans for polyclinics, we are not referring to a single, fixed model of care. These terms describe flexible models for bringing primary care together with a range of other services, be they diagnostic services, specialist care for patients with long-term conditions such as diabetes, or social care. Research shows that the public want services that are more joined up, and it shows that more integrated care produces better health outcomes. But there is no one-size-fits-all solution. What matters is doctors, nurses and other clinicians working with the public to design integrated care to meet local circumstances. That is why the Government are providing investment for the new health centres, and why we have given the local NHS the flexibility to design the services that will be based in those centres.</p>

every primary care trust area, those include: an easily accessible location; being open from 8 in the morning until 8 in the evening, seven days a week; bookable GP appointments and walk-in services; services for registered and non-registered patients; and a maximisation of the opportunities to integrate and co-locate with other community-based services.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o232"><a name="80423-0012.htm_para26"><a name="08042357000516">It is extraordinary, although not surprising, that the Conservative party is aligning itself so firmly with the forces of conservatism against improving health services for the public. That might curry it some favour with the BMA, but most people can spot producer interest capture when they see it. What an astonishing&#151;and from our point of view welcome&#151;set of affairs that the Conservatives should be positioning themselves so firmly on the wrong side of the health argument. That is why their motion will be defeated. I commend our amendment to the House.</p>

<a name="80423-0013.htm_brev1"><a name="08042357001244"><ul><p class="tabletext">That this House supports the dedication of police officers in the City of London Police, the Metropolitan Police Service and the British Transport Police but notes the unacceptable trend in teenage murders in London, including the shocking figure of 27 murdered in 2007; believes that Londoners&#146; daily experience of crime, particularly lower level crime and anti-social behaviour, is now far removed from some official statistics; is deeply concerned that violent crime in London as measured by the British Crime Survey is the highest of all the regions in England and Wales and that fear of crime in London is now also the highest of all the regions in England and Wales; further notes the link between gun crime and drugs; further believes that local communities should be given greater freedom to direct the efforts of their police force if streets are to be made safer; and condemns the current Mayor of London for his complacent attitude to these serious crime issues.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o237"><a name="80423-0013.htm_para3"><a name="08042357001048">London is the greatest city on earth. It is protected by the dedicated officers of the Metropolitan Police Service, the City of London police and the British Transport police, whom I have had the privilege of visiting during most of today. But it is also the city where the British Home Secretary, on her own admission, does not feel safe walking alone at night, and it is the city where 27 teenagers were murdered by other teenagers in 2007. Last month, a Labour Back Bencher, the hon. Member for Islington, South and Finsbury (Emily Thornberry), said &#147;I suspect that hardly any children in Islington have not been mugged at some stage.&#148;</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o238"><a name="80423-0013.htm_para4"><a name="08042357001049">London is the city where more teenagers are being mugged each year. The Metropolitan Police Service figures&#151;not the Home Office departmental figures&#151;show that the number of 11-to-22-year-olds reported to have been mugged in London rose from 19,276 in 2004-05 to 24,701 in 2006-07, an increase of 28 per cent. In Lewisham alone, 454 more muggings were recorded over the same period, an increase of 88.5 per cent. The Minister should note that those are Metropolitan Police Service figures.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o239"><a name="80423-0013.htm_para5"><a name="08042357001050">According to the British crime survey, London has the highest level of violent crime among all the regions in England and Wales, and also the highest level of fear of crime. Londoners are twice as likely to be robbed as people in New York city. Violent crime has increased over eight years, according to official measurements of total violent crime and to measurements of violence against the person. The respective increases have been 15.3 per cent. and over 15 per cent. Those are the Mayor&#146;s own figures. Robbery has increased by just under 20 per cent. in eight years. In 2007-08 there were more than 37,000 incidents of robbery in London. Those too are the Mayor&#146;s own figures. The number of sexual offences was greater in 2007 than in 1999-2000, according to Metropolitan Police Service figures.</p>

 As ever, my hon. Friend gets it absolutely spot on. Like many on the Conservative Benches, he has learned the lesson that if one cracks down on so-called low-level crime in a zero-tolerance fashion, that inevitably leads to a cut in much more serious offences, as night follows day. That is what the empirical evidence around the world demonstrates. It is taking my hon. Friend to speak out and say that London needs a Mayor who believes in that policy. The current Mayor clearly and palpably does not.</p>

 Are not my hon. Friend&#146;s last point and the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Putney (Justine Greening) reinforced by the extraordinary development that, when a London headmaster wrote to the Mayor complaining of abuse of the free travel pass leading to attacks on the school pupils for whom he had responsibility, the Mayor&#146;s response was to have the arrogance and temerity to describe that decent headmaster as a Victor Meldrew? What sort of political lead is that from the Mayor of London?</p>

 It is no kind of leadership and my hon. Friend&#146;s point, like that of my hon. Friend the Member for Putney, speaks to arrogance and complacency about antisocial behaviour in public spaces, especially in London transport settings.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o259"><a name="80423-0014.htm_para8"><a name="08042357001114">From the start of the travel pass scheme in September 2005 until July 2007, only 394 bus passes were permanently withdrawn from under-18s despite the fact that there is clearly a problem, as has been demonstrated both in Putney and in Bromley. The TfL behaviour code defines antisocial behaviour in ways we would all recognise&#151;using offensive or threatening language, smoking, playing music very loudly, damaging or defacing photo cards, physical or verbal abuse, unlawfully carrying a weapon and drug use. TfL figures show the staggering statistic that 65 per cent. of Londoners have experienced or witnessed antisocial behaviour on buses or tubes in the past two years&#151;two out of three Londoners. That is a fatally depressing statistic of which Mr. Livingstone should be wholly ashamed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o260"><a name="80423-0014.htm_para9"><a name="08042357001115">We need a new London Mayor to tackle that level of dissatisfaction.</p>

 It is not surprising that the Mayor is not in sympathy with the naturally law-abiding citizens of London because in earlier years he preferred to spend time with Sinn Fein rather than with Ulster&#146;s police force. London people were prepared to forgive him that and give him a chance, they hoped that he had changed; but as he has shown that currently he prefers the company of homophobic, hate-filled extremists to that of people interested in community safety we can see why his character is not suitable to be Mayor of the city.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o261"><a name="80423-0014.htm_para10"><a name="08042357001118">In addition to the sanctions we believe should be attendant on under-18s&#146; antisocial misbehaviour, which breaks the behaviour code, there should be permanent withdrawal of their bus passes until they participate in a restorative justice programme to earn them back. That is an excellent and original idea proposed by my hon. Friend the Member for Henley. As well as those sanctions, we want more police visibility, which we can pay for in part by employing fewer press and communications officers. According to the Central Office of Information, Mr. Livingstone has more press officers than the Prime Minister, although as his popularity rating is almost as dire as the Prime Minister&#146;s we might wonder whether that is a good use of Londoners&#146; money. Transport for London forecasts that it will spend &#163;66 million on advertising, marketing and communications in 2007-08. It would be a sensible idea to cap that spending in real terms rather than going ahead with the &#163;84 million requested by Mr. Livingstone. Those figures are from the Greater London authority group budget report, 2008-09. Under our proposal, &#163;16.5 million of the money saved would be redirected to the existing safer transport teams and would pay for approximately 440 police community support officers, delivering more visible presence on our transport network&#151;approximately doubling their strength.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o262"><a name="80423-0014.htm_para11"><a name="08042357001119">Police support officers are valued by the Conservatives; they could particularly help to crack down on one of the low-level issues identified by my hon. Friend the Member for Henley&#151;fare evasion. Why? Punish the smaller offences and the larger ones will diminish in number. The example that we have already mentioned is New York, but there are other examples in cities around the world.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o263"><a name="80423-0014.htm_para12"><a name="08042357001121">In 2006, fare evasion in London rose from about 2.3 per cent. to 3.18 per cent on conventional buses, with a cost to the taxpayer of &#163;36.7 million. On bendy buses, fare evasion rose by a much bigger amount, rising from 7.8 per cent. to 9.3 per cent. That is more than double the rate on conventional buses. Those are figures that my hon. Friend the Member for Henley has delved into, and they are quite worrying. The revenue loss on bendy buses alone was &#163;8 million, and the total loss for all buses was in the region of &#163;46 million. That is about &#163;1 million a week in lost revenue. Every criminal who evades their fare and is not caught is a criminal who may have form for more serious offences, so the issue is not just about lost revenue.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o264"><a name="80423-0014.htm_para13"><a name="08042357001122">TFL deploys about 300 revenue protection inspectors on its entire bus network, about 200 revenue control officers on the underground, and about 200 traffic enforcement staff. Considering that there are about 7,700 normal buses and about 300 bendy buses, there is a minimal chance of people being caught, and offenders know it. We hope that a new London Mayor will be able to direct the Metropolitan Police Authority to investigate, in partnership with TFL, giving revenue protection inspectors new and better powers, including, for the first time, the power to take names and addresses, so fare-dodgers can truly be held to account.</p>

They cover a huge rail network, which extends way beyond London, with a mere 427 fully warranted officers and 303 PCSOs and support staff. In 2003-04, just over 15,000 offences were committed at overground stations, but by 2005-06, that figure had risen to more than 19,300. We propose that about &#163;3.1 million earmarked for the MPS advertising and spin doctor budget be released to fund approximately 50 extra fully warranted officers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o267"><a name="80423-0014.htm_para16"><a name="08042357001127">Those new officers could patrol suburban station platforms, particularly the stations with the highest levels of crime. We are talking about not just the inner city but the outer parts of London, which, sadly, the Mayor treats with arrogant disdain. He seems to think that his heartlands are in the allegedly tough, hard areas of the inner city. We want some attention to be paid to the suburbs of this great city, and the proposal of my hon.

The capital cost for new equipment is about &#163;3,000 to &#163;3,500 a bus. Running costs for the cameras, aside from the capital element, would be about &#163;45.</p>

 It may help my hon. Friend to know that the proposal is for live CCTV on buses. As I think the right hon. Member for Enfield, North (Joan Ryan) is about to say, there already is CCTV on buses, but in only 5 per cent. of cases is that CCTV made available when a crime has been committed.</p>

emergency police assistance. Subject to the trial working as we believe it will, police officers would have the ability to dial into the system to see what was going on in real time, using mobile technology where that was available.</p>

I heard only this morning that one of the problems&#151;an evidential problem&#151;is that often the Crown Prosecution Service will not charge until it has reviewed the CCTV evidence, which can take weeks to reach the CPS and the police at the station. Everybody knows that. My hon. Friend has a solution to the problem; the Labour party in London has had eight years and done nothing about it.</p>

 Has the hon. Gentleman had the opportunity to see the evidence given to the Select Committee in our inquiry on the surveillance society? He is right. There is a demand for more cameras, but there are additional costs in viewing the footage. It is not just a matter of installing the cameras and making sure that the footage is viewed live. The resources are needed to enable people to look at that footage before they make the decision to prosecute.</p>

On the Mayor&#146;s own figures, 10 gun crimes a day take place in London, which is higher than when he took office. We believe that more should be done in relation to hand-held scanners. We all know that the British Transport police began Operation Shield in London to tackle the scourge of the carrying of offensive weapons, through the use of hand-held metal detectors and walk-through detection arches.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o271"><a name="80423-0014.htm_para20"><a name="08042357001135">We have looked at the Metropolitan Police Authority reserve, particularly the contingency reserve where we believe that 2 per cent. of net revenue is squirreled away. The current budget proposal includes a reserve of about 2.4 per cent. We would reduce that to 2.3 per cent. That could release up to &#163;2.5 million for more detectors. The British Transport police are using one model of metal detector for Operation Shield. The Met have a preferred model, AD11-2, which is a lot cheaper. Depending which option we went for, our &#163;2.5 million, which we show we can provide, would pay for up to an additional 26,000 hand-held scanners.</p>

ACPO&#146;s Secured By Design standards result in a quarter less crime in housing estates than in non-Secured By Design housing estates. Those standards cut crime and the fear of crime. Despite Mr. Livingstone&#146;s two terms in city hall, there is not much sign of that being made a priority.</p>

The National Audit Office, all professionals, everybody, said that that was a far better way to count crime. Among other things, if there was an affray in London or elsewhere before the introduction of NCRS, however many people were involved, however many victims, it would have been treated as one crime. After the introduction of NCRS, they were treated as five victims and five crimes, quite rightly. The hon. Gentleman knows that. That is why making comparisons with before 2003 is utterly erroneous and utterly bogus.</p>

I hope that the crisis in Oxfordshire is momentary and that he will be able to join us again. He gave London about an hour in an Opposition day debate. Let us have the debate, but let us have it, as the hon. Member for North Southwark and Bermondsey suggests, on serious terms with serious figures.</p>

 In the annual guide to what one pays and what one gets, my Conservative-controlled borough of Westminster records as No. 1 in its top 10 achievements for 2007-08 a fall in total crime figures, including a 6.8 per cent. reduction in burglary. Kensington and Chelsea, a borough for which I am also Member of Parliament, also announces that burglaries have been slashed and says that Kensington and Chelsea residents are less likely to be victims of burglary today than at any other time this century, and that burglary figures have halved in just seven years. Does my right hon. Friend agree that even those who dispute the Metropolitan police figures, even those who dispute the crime statistics that were all welcomed in 2000, might pay some regard to figures that have come from their own Conservative local authorities?</p>

However, there is a fine line when politicians play foolish and bogus statistical games, which, by the bye, is to treat Londoners as idiots. There is also a fine line on traducing the work of not only every single policeman and woman who is out on the beat in our capital city, but every council of whatever hue working through crime and disorder reduction partnerships to secure those figures. Does that mean complacency? No, of course it does not. Does it mean that there is not a whole lot more to do in a range of areas, which I shall discuss later? Of course it does not.  <br>

 I commend the Minister on his approach. I am not here to defend the current Mayor in the election campaign or to speak in favour of Labour policy, but a former Labour Home Secretary sought to establish an agreement across the parties with the Office for National Statistics on crime figures. Does he agree that it would be worth while to seek to do that again? Will he condemn those people in any party in any London borough who seek for party political purposes to misrepresent crime generally, and violent crime specifically, as going up, when it is going down, which increases the fear of crime among ordinary people on the street?</p>

 Many of the recommendations in the Smith review came out of that cross-party initiative on criminal statistics, which included Liberal Democrats and Conservatives, and has been implemented on my watch. Some of the recommendations have not been implemented, because there are difficult issues surrounding, for example, the definition of an assault&#151;it involves harassment and other areas. Grown-up politicians in this House now agree on the figures. Let us&#151;mayoral candidates and otherwise&#151;debate the policies and the substance, but we should not debate the basic statistics, which is utterly shameful.</p>

 Absolutely. In terms of the pace of introduction, that took place in the teeth of Conservative opposition. Conservatives said that it could not be done London-wide in the original time frame, let alone a year early. As an outer London, suburban MP&#151;my constituency is next door to that of the hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood (Mr. Hurd)&#151;safer neighbourhood teams are making as much of a difference in the outer London suburbs as they are in inner London. The notion that the past eight years have all been about a zone 1 mayoralty is nonsense.</p>

 In my constituency in Brent, murders decreased from 10 to four in 2006-07, which is the reality of the extra investment that has gone into the police. The Opposition need to discuss statistics in terms of the reality for people on the ground. That is still four murders too many, but there has been a huge reduction. Will my right hon. Friend discuss the British Transport police? When Transport for London took over the Bakerloo line, there were 50 additional British Transport police, the stations were cleaned, the number of guards was increased and fare evasion was cut by more than half.</p>

 I am very grateful to the Minister; I shall not intervene on him again. Many of us, across the parties, have tried to deal with crime in this city.

Perhaps more important than that percentage figure is the fact that that means that there are 1,386 fewer victims of crime. That is a very important figure.

 I can tell my right hon. Friend that it has been replicated across London boroughs. The most interesting thing is that three of my hon.

I am afraid that I am a rather impatient man, so I did not wait for the latest edition of &#147;Enfield Council News&#148; but went on to the website, which refers to offences having fallen by nearly 10 per cent. between 2003-04 and 2006-07&#151;a trend that continues in 2007-08. That matters in terms of substance, as it goes on to talk about notable changes such as motor vehicle crime being down by 17.6 per cent., residential burglary down by 8.9 per cent., and sexual offences down by 22.5 per cent.</p>

No Labour Members, or, I think, Members in most parts of this House, are washing their hands of the levels of crime in this fair city of ours. To be very serious, up to about eight years ago, when we first recaptured a London police authority, and in my own Department in the &#146;70s, &#146;80s and &#146;90s, there was perhaps far too much washing of hands and coping with acceptable levels of crime instead of dealing with it. That is not what has prevailed over the past 10 years, even on the sort of figures that the hon. Member for Bromley and Chislehurst (Robert Neill) introduces and overcooks. There has been a significant decrease in crime, according to the Met&#146;s own figures. That has been repeated quite happily by a range of Conservative councils throughout London, and I pay credit to them for assisting in that process, along with Labour and Liberal Democrat councils. We cannot have it all ways. We cannot traduce the figures, and by traducing them, traduce what every single policeman and woman does in service to London, nor can we have a series of policies proffered that treat London as though nothing has happened for the past eight or 10 years&#151;as if it were year zero.</p>

There has also been an undertaking by the Metropolitan Police Authority, under the Mayor&#146;s tutelage, to look in great detail at every aspect of stop-and-search in London.</p>

That process has been going on for quite a while. I had a hand in it myself some time ago, when I was the Minister responsible for London&#146;s transport and I worked closely with the Mayor. He is a Mayor who, I might say, understands entirely how much a bus costs and how much it costs to run. As a starting premise, we should accept what our police, our police community support officers, our councils and the people of London have done, working together with our Mayor.</p>

 I shall try to be constructive, but is it not true that the police are spending less time on patrol and on front-line policing than they were? Is the Minister looking at that, with a view to getting more police on patrol?</p>

 Yes we are, as Ronnie Flanagan said in his report and, I hope, as we will say in some depth in the forthcoming policing Green Paper in the spring. I take some of the hon. Gentleman&#146;s point to heart. More and more of our policing teams need to be out on the front line, and increasingly they are. We have heard a rather bogus slicing of figures this way and that by the hon. Member for Bury St. Edmunds, who used them rather obtusely instead of just using the figures themselves. I do, however, accept the starting premise of the hon. Member for Bexleyheath and Crayford (Mr. Evennett).</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o289"><a name="80423-0016.htm_para3"><a name="08042377000012">The absolute key has been getting neighbourhood policing teams in place in every ward in London. By any token, that is an astonishing feat in the defence of law and order. It is to the great credit of the Mayor and the leadership of the Metropolitan police, and it should not be traduced lightly by Johnny-come-latelies of any description, whether they can be bothered to attend these debates or not.</p>

I have checked, and this is the third Opposition day debate on crime in London that they have managed during my 10 years in the House. They come along every four years. We had one in 2000, just before the mayoral election, I understand&#151;the hon. Member for North Southwark and Bermondsey will know far better than I. There was one in 2004, after the election, and we are having one now. We are pleased that momentarily, perhaps every four years, the Opposition show some concern about crime in London. I do not decry that, but perhaps it might be helpful if they did so a bit more often.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o291"><a name="80423-0016.htm_para5"><a name="08042377000014">We broadly agree with the other points made by the hon. Member for Bury St. Edmunds about sorting out crime in London, largely because many of them are being dealt with already. We have already made sure that the Met and other police services are moving towards ensuring that local crime information is provided so that communities can hold basic command unit commanders to account. There might not yet be a pretty little map, but if the extent of the contribution of the hon. Member for Henley to policing in London is that there should be a pretty little crime map as well as the information, God bless him.</p>

In many areas, councils working with the police are doubling&#151;and more&#151;the number of safer neighbourhood teams in specific town centres. That is all built on a good record that stands up to any sort of scrutiny. It is not sufficient and does no one credit to dismiss measures as gimmicks when they are introduced, yet now say they are the best things since sliced bread.</p>

At the time&#151;barely weeks ago&#151;the right hon. Member for Haltemprice and Howden (David Davis) dismissed it as a gimmick, yet the hon. Member for Henley now apparently thinks that it is a good idea. Perhaps if the two connected now and again, we could get some consensus and have a proper debate about how that would help London.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o294"><a name="80423-0016.htm_para8"><a name="08042377000017">An enormous amount of work has been done, although is not enough&#151;God knows enough tragedies happen that show that it is not enough. However, the tackling guns and gangs action programme has done much work, which led to Operation Kartel. Action took place during the February half-term in 11 boroughs, supported by TGGAT, which led to a 50 per cent. reduction in gun-enabled crime compared with the same period in 2007; a 26 per cent. reduction in knife-enabled crimes; 542 fewer personal robbery offences, and the seizure of 170 weapons, a good deal of cash and a kilo of cannabis. We are already considering purchasing 200 hand-held search wands for several operations targeting those who carry weapons. Those measures are not panaceas. Taken together, they will help to drive down crime and liberate our communities from its impact.</p>

We are working with colleagues from the Department for Children, Schools and Families to try to ensure that the youth action plan and our tackling violent crime action plan knit together the contributions from a range of central and local authorities. No doubt that will be helped by the Mayor&#146;s plans to bring a further 1,000 officers into the Met and by working with London&#146;s communities to listen to and tackle their concerns, not least through the neighbourhood policing teams, which matter, as I think everyone would agree.</p>

 This is definitely the debate that Londoners want us to have just one week ahead of the mayoral elections on 1 May. Like my hon.

We have moved on since then and it is now, rightly, this Labour Government&#146;s responsibility if they have failed to tackle crime. However, it is also worth reminding hon.

It is perfectly legitimate to remind ourselves of those facts when we consider the pledges, plans and promises put forward by the Conservative party.

candidate for Mayor, with responsibility for policing among other matters, but I will indeed move on. According to the hon. Gentleman&#146;s manifesto&#151;he has at least produced a manifesto&#151;he will apparently use his influence to tear up red tape and needless form-filling. Presumably what he had in mind was needless P45 form-filling, of which he has some experience.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o302"><a name="80423-0016.htm_para16"><a name="08042377000030">Let me move on to the Labour Mayor&#146;s position. The incumbent, Ken Livingstone, is keen to distance himself from the Government when appropriate, but at other times he is keen to make himself known as the Labour Mayor. We have to take the two together. I am happy to put on record the fact that the combination of the Government and the Mayor has enjoyed some successes, the biggest example of which is the safer neighbourhood teams. Like probably all hon. Members present, I have been round with the safer neighbourhood teams in a number of my wards and seen their impact on the ground. I can see that they are delivering the reassurance that people need and are beginning to eat seriously into crime levels.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o303"><a name="80423-0016.htm_para17"><a name="08042377000031">I am told that the biggest problem for the safer neighbourhood teams in some of the leafier suburbs&#151;Government Members should please not quote me on this&#151;is that there is no crime for them to deal with. If safer neighbourhood teams are telling me and other hon. Members, as I suspect they are, that there are times when things are relatively quiet and they would like some other challenges, we might need to consider giving them a more flexible structure.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman has made an interesting point about safer neighbourhood teams. Perhaps he will be interested to learn that one of the teams in my borough, although it does excellent work, needs a safer neighbourhood base to patrol from. The Metropolitan police acquired suitable premises about six months ago and has been paying rent and rates on them ever since, but the premises remain empty because the bureaucrats at Scotland Yard made a muck-up of the procurement process and had to restart it. That money has therefore been wasted and the team does not have a base. Is not that a strong argument for a much more direct political drive and direction of the Metropolitan police service, as is being proposed by my hon. Friend the Member for Henley (Mr. Johnson)?</p>

 It is certainly a case for ensuring that the procurement process works correctly. I am sure that all hon. Members support the idea, which the Minister mentioned in our last topical debate on this subject, that the safer neighbourhood teams should have bases in their wards, so that they are more accessible and visible and do not have to travel so far. The hon. Gentleman was quite right to raise that point, and no doubt he will be issuing an appropriate press release to his local paper confirming that he has quite rightly raised the matter in Parliament.</p>

I was about to mention the estates strategy to which the hon. Gentleman has just referred.

the following three years. I do not want to have to turn round and say to people in a few years&#146; time, &#147;I know the Metropolitan police promised that your new police station would be opened before the old one closed, but actually they have run out of money so they have simply closed the old one and not opened the new one.&#148; We need some certainty on that question.</p>

 All these things are important, but does my hon. Friend accept that what matters most to all our constituents is that there should be an effective and speedy response when crimes are committed? For example, I still get too many complaints from people who have been attacked, perhaps in a pub or in a house, and who have found that no one comes for many minutes and sometimes for half an hour or longer. Also, we must ensure that, when an investigation takes place, it is done well. Again, I have had far too many complaints that serious allegations&#151;including allegations of rape&#151;have been badly handled by the police and/or the Crown Prosecution Service, with the result that justice is not done and victims are not looked after.</p>

 I thank my hon. Friend for that intervention. I do not want to give the impression that everything is functioning well. We have all had examples of constituents who have been the victim of a crime and who have, unfortunately, had to wait a considerable length of time for a response. Sometimes that response has not been forthcoming at all and, ultimately, it has been the safer neighbourhood team that has had to respond a few days later. There is still a need to ensure that the response is timely.</p>

 Before the hon. Gentleman moved on to the failures, he was talking about some successes. Does he agree that there has been another significant success in the past eight years, namely the radical transformation of the relationship between the police in London and the black and minority ethnic communities and, for that matter, the lesbian and gay community in London? This has resulted in many more people having a strong relationship with the police, which the police have been able to use in ensuring our security. Does the hon.

 I thank the hon. Gentleman for his intervention. Londoners, who live in a very diverse community, will be looking very carefully at what the different mayoral candidates have said, and I think that they will draw their own conclusions from the comments that have been made in the past. Our candidate, Brian Paddick, has certainly done his best to support the work that the hon.

We had a pledge in 2005 to increase the number of community support officers to up to 24,000&#151;a pledge that has been reduced to 16,000, with a direct impact in London of a reduction from 6,400 to 5,600 such officers. Serious concerns were raised by Sir Norman Bettison of the Association of Chief Police Officers when he gave evidence to the Home Affairs Committee a couple of days ago. He spoke about a funding gap, particularly for tackling serious and organised crime.</p>

I take the Minister&#146;s point and I am not going to say that it is all down to police numbers, but clearly the problem is increasing and it is particularly significant for young people, whether as perpetrators or victims. It may not all be due to police numbers, but it is a problem that needs to be resolved, whether by the Government, local authorities, communities or, indeed, individuals.</p>

I praise the Mayor for that, as it was greatly needed. The Conservative Front-Bench spokesman said that the Conservatives would not cap it, but does the hon.

The hon. Gentleman has, however, reminded me that the Home Office needs to address one particular aspect of tackling gun and knife crime&#151;the research carried out into the effectiveness of different projects. The range of projects currently run from perhaps a single ex-offender who has taken it on his or herself to organise something at a very local level through to much larger funded projects. On the basis of a conversation with a member of the Metropolitan Police Authority, I know that not much research has been done into which of those projects really deliver and which deliver value for money. I hope that when the Minister responds, he will be able to say a little about what research the Home Office is either carrying out now without my knowledge, or intends to carry out to assess which projects deliver the best value in tackling this very serious problem.</p>

Another proposal that I would put to the hon. Gentleman is the idea of giving one of the officers in the safer neighbourhood teams specific training in youth issues in order to provide the link with young people. If it were needed to deal with disadvantaged youths or others outside the system, an officer would then have the necessary training to make contact and perhaps forge a more positive relationship with them.

 I agree. Provision varies from one local authority to another, but many provide a variety of options for young people, for instance through youth centres or uniformed organisations. As the hon. Lady says, there is a group who will not take advantage of such services, but we might be able to find ways of providing diversionary activities in which they do want to participate. If that means giving them authorisation to do parkour running around an estate, perhaps we should facilitate the process. We need to ensure that the range of options offered to young people allows them all to access activities that interest them.</p>

 I wanted to respond to the last three interventions. I know that the Government are considering whether, rather than change the membership of a safer neighbourhood team, they should enable someone who has the skills to target characters who need work to carry out detached youth operations in each ward. That person would focus particularly on young people between 15 and 21 who are not employed, studying, training or in an apprenticeship, because they are the ones who give the grief: they can afford to be out all night causing trouble because they have nothing to do in the daytime.</p>

 I agree. That echoes what was said by the hon.

Perhaps the Minister will be able to update us on what is happening to dormant accounts. I assumed that they would start to provide a level of funding that is not in the system at present, and might create opportunities for engagement with that group of people.</p>

It is the boroughs and the Home Office. We need some honesty about who will provide funds. The Mayor will not be providing those 1,000 extra officers, and I think that credit should be given where it is due.</p>

 I recall that the hon. Lady made the same point during a topical debate a few weeks ago. There is clearly an issue over the gearing of the precept&#151;how much it contributes in real terms, and how much is contributed by the Home Office.

 While we are at it, could we have a third piece of honesty? Should not the Conservative party admit that it opposed funding increases? Conservative councils&#151;and probably Liberal Democrat councils as well&#151;consistently take credit for the falls in crime for which they opposed funding, and continue to claim that tax rises are unnecessary when they are exactly what paid for those extra police officers.</p>

That would be better than a rather sterile debate about the statistics.</p>

They are not dependent on a change to the way in which the offences are calculated. Regrettably, it is clear from those figures that London as a region is doing very badly compared with other regions, whether on violent crime, vehicle crime or burglary. There is an issue as to how London compares with other parts of the country, even if the background is that crime is falling. London still has more than its fair share.</p>

 I sometimes wonder where the Conservatives come from. If they ever talked to police officers in the community or knew anything about the safer neighbourhood teams, they might join me in complaining about the loss of our community support officers. The fact is that they are applying to become police officers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o329"><a name="80423-0018.htm_para2"><a name="08042377000100">If we are to have any consistency in safer neighbourhood teams, we cannot use them as a training ground for police officers. Intelligence about and knowledge of a local area cannot be built up in a few months, and if someone moves on rapidly they never get that intelligence and we never get the full effect of safer neighbourhood teams. My complaint is not about police numbers but about the churn in police community support officers. Many go on to become police officers, because we are recruiting more and more. That means that we lose the intelligence and the knowledge of local areas that we need, which are vital to safer neighbourhood teams.</p>

 My hon. Friend has made some very good points, but may I put it to him that he has not quite set out the whole picture of the history? For a start, he has missed out the fact that under the previous Conservative Government, overall crime doubled. Is that not a point that Londoners should take into account? Secondly, he seems to imply that police numbers have gone up because of police pay. That is certainly a factor, but is there not also an aspect of political will, from both the Government and the Mayor of London, who has put money for more police in his budget and his precept?</p>

 Absolutely. The Mayor has to be commended for the resolute approach he has taken to delivering what people in London have told all of us, of whatever political persuasion, is their priority: community safety and more police on the streets. The Mayor has delivered that and had the political guts to stand up and say that if we are to have it, we must pay for it. He has put it in the precept, and people can see where the money has gone.</p>

 May I take the hon. Gentleman back to the matter of PCSOs? He said that he regretted that some are training to become police constables. Does he not think that it should be for each borough commander to decide the balance between PCSOs and constables and to allocate his own establishment budget, rather than have the decisions made centrally for him?</p>

 I do not really see that as a major issue. The fact is that people would rather have police officers than PCSOs. We all understand that, but when people begin to understand the role of community support officers, they value them equally. PCSO numbers have grown rapidly in London, and people are getting used to them. Borough commanders should have some flexibility, but they should also be accountable to local communities. Communities should know what they are entitled to get, and having a model of safer neighbourhood teams helps. There are safer neighbourhood teams of different sizes in my constituency, due to the action of my local police commander. However, a minimum number should be set so that people understand what they are entitled to.</p>

 I have just a short point to confirm what my hon. Friend said about police recruitment. As he knows, I represent the area where the training college is situated. When I was first elected in 1997, recruits rattled around like peas in a pod. Once the pay went up, the training centre was full. That is anticipated to continue, and the police are about to take leases on a block of flats opposite, which is being developed into 250 flats for the foreseeable future. That shows that they anticipate that recruitment trend continuing, even though officers spend far less time at the police training college than they used to because they train more on the job.</p>

I went to see my borough commander and local inspector to talk about the forms and how we could get our safer neighbourhood teams and police officers out on the street, rather than having to spend too much time on bureaucracy. They sent downstairs to have the form brought up and we went through it. I said, &#147;Wouldn&#146;t you want to get rid of this form?&#148; He said, &#147;No, absolutely no way.

When there is an incident the police will have no record of who has been stopped. If somebody wants to check why they were stopped and make a formal complaint there will be no formal record of what has taken place. It does not make sense. It does not add up. The Conservatives say that they want to get rid of bureaucracy and to make the police more effective, but they would take away a tool that is essential for the operational efficiency of the police. They claim that they want to make the police more accountable, but they would take away the form that allows an individual to check why they were stopped and what intelligence was gathered about them.</p>

 Does my hon.

Local Conservatives in my area have said exactly that, and it is to be deplored.</p>

 I agree absolutely. People from all sections of our communities need confidence in their police force. Stop and search was one of the things that undermined not only the relationship between police and local communities but police efficiency. To go back to it would be a retrograde step.</p>

Out of generosity, we should start a campaign to get back the money spent on his education, as it was clearly wasted. That is clearly the biggest crime to debate tonight. This debate is taking place because the Conservatives&#146; campaign has faltered, and we have proved why it has done so in this debate on crime in London.</p>

The hon. Member for Eltham (Clive Efford) read out statistics relating to my local borough and said that in Redbridge crime had dropped. We should commend the Conservative council in Redbridge for taking over when the Government stopped its funding for street wardens, and for paying for those wardens with local taxpayers&#146; money, and not from the Mayor&#146;s budget. We should pay full tribute to those who deserve it&#151;to Councillor Weinberg and the council in Redbridge.</p>

Putting aside what the statistics show, last Wednesday night I attended an area committee and a crime forum in my constituency, and I heard people say what they are honestly concerned about. That is what I want to talk about today. Whether we are talking about crime or a fear of crime, people are worried. Elderly people come to me and say that they are concerned about going out in the evenings. Recently, I went round some of my local underground stations. My constituency has one of the highest number of underground stations of any constituency outside central London. I was quite upset to find that some of them are not manned; there was no one there. We recently found that some CCTV cameras, the introduction of which was lauded by all, including me, were not actually plugged in. They were not recording anything, either live or for playback later. </p>

Colleagues in all parts of the House will forgive me if I say that sometimes I get concerned, and that I fully understand why people do not vote in any elections&#151;a problem that we should all be worried about. The reason they do not vote is the way we conduct ourselves sometimes. On occasions, we should be ashamed of ourselves for that.</p>

A few weeks ago I was at a station in my constituency where I felt intimidated by groups of youths hanging around. I am sure the hon.

In the area where that had happened, the ward had seen a dramatic drop of up to 60 per cent. in antisocial behaviour. I believe that that is due to the input going in, backed by councillors of all political parties on Redbridge council.</p>

 I agree with the hon. Gentleman&#146;s initial comments and join him in paying tribute to Chief Superintendent Dave Grant and all his officers in Redbridge. Is not one of the key matters the London Mayor&#146;s youth offer, which would give Redbridge more than &#163;1 million for the youth facilities that, I agree, are so needed in the borough? The hon. Gentleman keeps paying tribute to the local Conservative council, but it has cut grants to the voluntary sector by 5 per cent., some of which would have dealt with young people, and it has had a failed policy on swimming pools. I think there is just one swimming pool in the whole of Redbridge. Young people could use swimming pools if they were available in the borough.</p>

 I thank the hon. Gentleman for his comments. I should be delighted to answer his remarks about swimming pools. There are two swimming pools in Redbridge, one of which has major health and safety problems. The council is committed to building a new swimming pool to replace it. Unfortunately, that is opposed by the Labour councillors in the London borough of Redbridge, but the council is pressing ahead none the less.</p>

Businesses and people in my constituency tell me that low level crime is not being reported, for a number of different reasons. It could be because people cannot get through to the police. That is no fault of the police, who are trying to react as best they can with the powers that they have, and they have to set priorities. A lot of crime&#151;I do not like to call it petty crime, because it is not petty to the victims of it&#151;is unreported. That skews the statistics, but I shall not go into the statistics because I do not think that matters. People in London believe that crime is an issue. We are duty bound to tackle it. Whoever is Mayor of London on 2 May is duty bound to tackle it. I, for one, pledge to do everything I can to do so.</p>

We should by all means have a political debate about why such things are happening, but we cannot reduce this to slogans, as we have sadly heard again to some extent this afternoon.</p>

An example of that was when a London newspaper ran a story in January 2008 saying that Ken Livingstone had announced new measures to deal with youth and knife crime, and then a week ago ran a story saying that he was speaking out for the first time on knife crime. I do not have the articles with me, but that is part of a calculated misrepresentation of the response of the Mayor of London and other agencies to a deeply worrying trend that we must deal with together.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o348"><a name="80423-0019.htm_para2"><a name="08042377000140">In response to that, we must continue with that non-accidental choice of investing in effective policing on the streets&#151;the 10,000 additional police officers that have been put on the streets of London by the Mayor and the Government since 2000, reversing the long-term trend that my hon. Friend the Member for Eltham (Clive Efford) described so clearly as having gone into reverse in the 1990s. Our safer neighbourhoods police are doing a superb job, not just in helping to bring down crime, as they have done, but in building up relationships and intelligence about what is happening in the streets, which is so important.</p>

Whether people choose to bandy around the term political correctness, as they so frequently do on these occasions, let us just remind ourselves that that collapse of trust, confidence and community intelligence leads to more crime and lower detection rates. It fails on its own terms. We must all do better, which includes my local authorities, at integrating services and information  <br>

 I am grateful for the opportunity to contribute to this important debate on an issue of great concern to many of my constituents, who regularly get in touch with me about it. Like many hon. Members, I have been disappointed by the tone of the debate. I am also disappointed that I am again the only Wandsworth MP to contribute to a debate about crime in London, which is a concern not only for my constituents, but across my London borough. My constituents have a number of concerns about crime. They are worried about their children; they are worried when they come home from work late, which I do when we have late votes here; and my constituents who run businesses are concerned about the lack of policing when they open their shops late, which I shall briefly discuss later.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o355"><a name="80423-0019.htm_para9"><a name="08042377000150">Although we have heard a lot of talk about safer neighbourhood policing&#151;we welcome our local safer neighbourhood teams&#151;beat policing is nothing new. For years, having the police out in the community has been the bedrock of keeping crime down in communities across England, let alone London. The Government have rebranded beat police as safer neighbourhood teams, but community beat police officers are critical whatever name is used to describe specific teams in specific wards. In my part of London, we have to wait  <br>

far too long for our safer neighbourhood teams to get their full complement. As I have said, compared with the number of warranted officers in the Wandsworth borough command unit a decade ago, we have fewer officers. We have police community support officers, who play a vital role in tackling crime locally, but they were never meant to be a substitute for the officers whom we have lost in Wandsworth. When my constituents find that their London precept for the Met has quadrupled to fund a lower level of warranted police officers in their local community, they do not think that they have got a good deal.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o356"><a name="80423-0019.htm_para10"><a name="08042377000151">The officers work extremely hard. I pay tribute to the safer neighbourhood team in Roehampton, which is led by Sergeant Pete Salmon. Given the number of officers, it has done a fantastic job in getting out into the community. They work with the local community in not only places such as the Alton estate and the Lennox estate, but the university of Roehampton, which forms an increasing part of the Roehampton community as it grows. The team&#146;s problem&#151;and one that we as a community have in areas such as Roehampton&#151;is that although it works hard, there is not enough of a police presence alongside it. I am thinking not only of the day time, when many of the safer neighbourhood teams operate; I am thinking particularly of the night time, when there are an increasing number of crime-related issues across my constituency. Safer neighbourhood teams that patrol during the day are simply not there at night, so they cannot address those issues.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o357"><a name="80423-0019.htm_para11"><a name="08042377000152">I particularly want to talk about local businesses. Like many London constituencies, my constituency, which includes places such as Putney, Roehampton and Southfields, does not contain large companies. The lifeblood of our local economy is small businesses, which are particularly prone to crime. The window of the Putney Tandoori on the Lower Richmond road, for example, has been smashed two or three times. Time and money has to be spent, and the shop has to be shut down, for the windows to be repaired. That has a real impact on the profitability of a business. When businesses on Danebury avenue are constantly being raided, the circumstances do not make for viable businesses; I know that Greggs bakery there has had such problems. If we are to regenerate parts of London&#151;and we certainly want to regenerate Roehampton&#151;clamping down on crime and making sure that people feel safe at any time of the day or night is really important.</p>

 I am grateful for that, Mr. Deputy Speaker. However, I have to say that issues have been raised about the commitment of my hon. Friend the Member for Henley (Mr. Johnson); apparently, that does not cut both ways. <i> [Interruption.]</i> Well, I could ask where the hon. Member for Battersea (Martin Linton) is. What I am saying is that we can all make such points.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o359"><a name="80423-0019.htm_para13"><a name="08042377000157">Crime is an issue for my constituency. When I conducted a crime survey, more than 3,000 people responded. They largely said that they felt as if their local area was getting less safe. They raised issues of antisocial behaviour, being mugged, their children being mugged and crime on transport. My constituents want those issues to be tackled because they do not feel that they are being so at the moment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o360"><a name="80423-0019.htm_para14"><a name="08042377000158">Nor do they feel that the money that they are paying as part of the mayoral precept is giving them any sort of return in terms of policing per pound. In the eight-year period of the London mayoralty, my constituents have paid &#163;66 million more than before into the Met police precept. We have not had any sort of return on the money that we have invested. Frankly, we would rather have spent the money locally and had more police, who can arrest people on our streets, to complement the PCSOs. That has not happened. Most of my constituents want a Mayor who will genuinely try to make the city safer instead of living by headlines. We want a Mayor who will seriously tackle youth crime, about which parents in my constituency worry every day.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o361"><a name="80423-0019.htm_para15"><a name="08042377000159">I shall finish by citing one statistic. In recent years, about one in 20 secondary-school-aged children who live in Wandsworth reported having been a victim of mugging. That statistic is surely unacceptable to any of us in this House, whichever side we sit on. If we can at least agree on one thing, it is that crime is too high and that we need to bear down on it by spending our money smartly so that communities such as my own can feel safer.</p>

The double standards of the Conservatives show that they are confused and in denial. As my hon. Friend the Member for Eltham (Clive Efford) said, they claim credit locally for falls in crime but, on a London basis, claim that crime has not fallen. They oppose the investment that has gone in. We just heard the hon. Member for Putney (Justine Greening) say that she does not believe that anything has changed in London and that community policing is exactly what it was previously, but we know that there has been huge investment and that that is connected to what has happened to crime rates.</p>

In reality, the money for the police officers who were put into the ward, as mentioned by my hon. Friend, was taken out of another ward that had even higher crime, the reason being that, under the Labour council, those officers had been paid for by the council, but the Conservatives have moved them into wards that receive Government funding through the new deal for communities or section 106 moneys. Once again, they are using statistics and money to manipulate figures in a way that can disadvantage people locally.</p>

(Mr. Slaughter). I think that the tetchiness that we have seen from Labour Members indicates that a raw nerve has been struck and that our points have hit home.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o366"><a name="80423-0019.htm_para20"><a name="08042377000168">I do not seek to talk London down or to denigrate good work that is done in London. However, I want to know, as do all of us who have constituents in London, how we can make things better and why, against this background, London&#146;s great competitor city of New York has done better at dealing with crime than we have and is now safer than London. I have two key points to make on that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o367"><a name="80423-0019.htm_para21"><a name="08042377000169">First, I went to New York recently and spoke to a precinct captain in the Red Hook district of Brooklyn&#151;a tough area. He made the point that the political commitment of Mayor Giuliani and Mayor Bloomberg was a key factor in giving the drive necessary to support police officers and the community as a whole in tackling crime.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o368"><a name="80423-0019.htm_para22"><a name="08042377000170">Secondly, the specific technical advantages of the CompStat system and crime mapping had given the police and the community the material that they needed to work together to tackle crime in one of the hardest parts of New York. I am sorry that that proposal from my hon. Friend the Member for Henley (Mr. Johnson) has been so airily dismissed by Labour Members. London deserves better than that. It is a serious proposal, accepted by serious people tackling crime in another city. I would have hoped that we were broad-minded enough to work together and take that on board. I would have thought that we all wanted to do justice to the tackling of crime in this city in such a constructive spirit. I am sorry that that has not always been achieved in this debate.</p>

Members in paying tribute to the work of all police officers in the capital in their daily fight against crime. The Metropolitan police, the City of London police and the British Transport police all work hard on our behalf to secure the protection of everyone who lives and works in the capital. It is right that we should recognise their service, commitment and dedication to duty. But the inescapable fact highlighted by the debate is that the Labour Mayor and the Labour Government are letting London down on crime. Violence against the person is up, with over 3,300 crimes committed each week. Drug offences, with their links to organised crime and gang violence, have increased by an astonishing 200 per cent. since the Mayor came to office, and nearly half of Londoners say that they simply do not feel safe in their communities at night. If that is a measure of success it shows just how out of touch the Government and the Mayor are with reality and with real Londoners.</p>

Members have highlighted the shocking number of teenagers killed on London&#146;s streets in the last year: 27 teenagers were murdered, with 11 murders of young people in 2008 already. One of the most disturbing trends is that both the victims of these crimes and those suspected of carrying out the offences are getting younger. Analysis from Trident has shown that in certain cases the age of those involved is as low as 14, with more teenagers being charged for murders and shootings. I have spoken previously about the organised gang culture, supported by the trade in class A drugs, that lies behind a significant proportion of these crimes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o374"><a name="80423-0020.htm_para4"><a name="08042377000177">One of the most insidious aspects of the organised criminal gang structure is the conscious focus of those who recruit new gang members on some of the most vulnerable in society&#151;those with poor educational attainment and weak family support structures, and those who suffer from addiction, mental illness and unemployment. They are targeted to deal drugs to give them an income. That is why the utter failure to control drug crime in the capital is so serious and why simply giving out more cautions for drug offences&#151;with the number doubling in the past two years&#151;sends out the wrong message.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o379"><a name="80423-0020.htm_para9"><a name="08042377000182">For too many, the impact of antisocial behaviour and what some describe as &#147;low level&#148; crime is significant. There is nothing low level about the impact of antisocial behaviour on people&#146;s quality of life. For many, especially the elderly or vulnerable, their street, shops or neighbourhoods do not feel safe. That picture is reflected in the opinion surveys of London residents and hardly alleviated by the comments of the Home Secretary or the actions of the Leader of the House.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o380"><a name="80423-0020.htm_para10"><a name="08042377000183">However, young people are more likely to feel the effects of antisocial behaviour and crime. Around a third of all street robberies are committed against the under-16s. Some Labour Members have rightly highlighted the number of young people who are mugged in London. It is absurd that the Government continue to drag their feet in recognising crimes against the under-16s in the British crime survey. As we have heard, such offences often occur on the buses, the tube and other forms of public transport, with mobile phones, iPods and other valuables being stolen.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o381"><a name="80423-0020.htm_para11"><a name="08042377000184">My hon. Friend the Member for Henley (Mr. Johnson) rightly identified a more visible police presence, the use of real-time CCTV and tougher measures to tackle fare evasion and the abuse of the transport system as important measures to restore public confidence.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o382"><a name="80423-0020.htm_para12"><a name="08042377000185">The Government have completely lost their way in cracking down on antisocial behaviour. Their rigid, centralised, bureaucratic command and control structures have driven the police in the wrong direction, chasing meaningless targets for &#147;bringing crimes to justice&#148;, involving issuing penalty notices like glorified parking tickets. In 2006, nearly 21,000 penalty notices were issued in the capital&#151;yet only four out of 10 were paid in full. It is difficult to identify the &#147;justice&#148; in that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o383"><a name="80423-0020.htm_para13"><a name="08042377000186">Even the Metropolitan Police Commissioner, Sir Ian Blair, has hit out at the system that has grown up around him. Yet neither the Government nor the Mayor have acted on that. So much for the bonfire of the regulations, for which the Metropolitan Police Commissioner called. That is why my hon. Friend the Member for Henley is absolutely right to identify the need to scrap the unnecessary stop form, freeing around 160,000 hours, which the police could spend on the beat, protecting Londoners and catching criminals. </p>

<p><a name="stpa_o384"><a name="80423-0020.htm_para14"><a name="08042377000187">The Government&#146;s supposed measures to improve community safety have made things worse, not better. London&#146;s A and E departments are feeling the strain from the impact of the Government&#146;s 24-hour drinking laws. Since the introduction of those changes, London hospital casualty admissions for alcohol-related problems have increased by a third. That highlights how cavalierly the Government introduced 24-hour licensing. But since 2000 the police precept has increased by around &#163;400 million&#151;an increase for the taxpayer of 150 per cent. per person. That is why we need to give Londoners proper details of police performance in their areas, through effective crime mapping in their neighbourhoods.  <br>

That way, communities can play a more active part in holding the police to account.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o385"><a name="80423-0020.htm_para15"><a name="08042377000188">The real question, however, is how committed the Government are to neighbourhood policing. As we have heard, the Flanagan review states that the current police numbers are &#147;unsustainable&#148;. The Government have welcomed the report, so presumably they welcome the cuts in police numbers that it underlines. The clear message is that police numbers are at risk. Violent crime in London is up, while drug crime has rocketed under Labour. Londoners deserve better than the tired offerings of a tired Mayor and a tired Government. It is time for a change. It is time for concerted action to make this city a safer place. It is time for a Conservative Mayor of London.</p>

 I thank all hon. Members who have taken part in this debate. I would have welcomed a contribution from the hon. Member for Henley (Mr. Johnson), who was no doubt the reason it was called, but he managed to turn up for only 40 minutes of it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o386"><a name="80423-0020.htm_para16"><a name="08042377000190">I thank my hon. Friends the Members for Eltham (Clive Efford), for Regent's Park and Kensington, North (Ms Buck) and for Ealing, Acton and Shepherd's Bush (Mr. Slaughter), who all spoke in the debate, and all my hon. Friends who asked questions. I should also point out that although my hon. Friend the Member for Tooting (Mr. Khan) has been here for much of the debate, he is unable to speak in debates as a Government Whip.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o387"><a name="80423-0020.htm_para17"><a name="08042377000191">The points that all my hon. Friends made stood in stark contrast to the two contributions that we heard from the Opposition Front Bench. That marks the difference in what this debate is about. All that we heard from the Opposition Front Bench was a story about the real issues of crime in London. We heard no reflection at all on the statistics with which the Metropolitan Police Service has provided us. Instead, we heard an attempt to whip up fear about crime and to portray London as a city where there are people roaming every street who will attack anybody at a moment&#146;s notice. That was the picture that Opposition Members were trying to portray. My hon. Friends pointed out, as I will point out in a moment, what the Metropolitan Police Service&#146;s statistics actually say. Of course there are challenges, but let us try to move forward on the basis of facts, not spurious exhortations to the public to believe that we are all doomed.</p>

<p><a name="st_o422"><a name="08042377000192"><a name="80423-0020.htm_spnew0"><a name="08042377001722"><b>Keith Vaz:</b>
 On the issue of facts, when Sir Ronnie Flanagan gave evidence to the Select Committee on Home Affairs, he did not talk about a reduction in police numbers. He welcomed the resources that the Government had given over the past 10 years and talked about the more efficient use of resources. The hon. Member for Hornchurch (James Brokenshire) is wrong to misquote Sir Ronnie as he did.</p>

<p><a name="st_o423"><a name="08042377000193"><a name="80423-0020.htm_spnew1"><a name="08042377001723"><b>Mr. Coaker:</b>
 My right hon. Friend puts the issue well. Let me read out some facts, so that we can get them on the record. Police numbers in London are at  <br>

record levels. Since 2000, there has been an increase of more than 10,000, which has been made possible by the Government&#146;s and the Mayor of London&#146;s investment. The figure of 35,000 is made up of more than 31,000 police officers and more than 4,000 PCSOs. The Mayor&#146;s budget for 2008-09 includes an additional 1,000 police officers. Let me also put it on the record that those are the figures from the Metropolitan Police Service. They are the figures that the Opposition seemed to traduce, when they said that there were not real figures or figures to be trusted. I will tell you what, Mr. Deputy Speaker, if I am going to trust any figures, I am going to trust the Metropolitan Police Service&#146;s figures on recorded crime.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o388"><a name="80423-0020.htm_para18"><a name="08042377000194">It was interesting that the hon. Member for Bury St. Edmunds (Mr. Ruffley) would not go back to 2002-03, but used 1998-99 as his baseline. The reason is that there was a different way of counting crime in 1998-99. Let me go through the figures, just as the Metropolitan Police Service has, from 2002-03 to this year, which are all counted in exactly the same way, so that the people of London know exactly what is happening. Between 2002-03 and this year, there was a more than 20 per cent. reduction in crime. There has been a reduction in the total number of murders in London since 2002-03 of 17.5 per cent, and a reduction in the total number of knife-enabled offences of more than 30 per cent. during that period. The year-on-year figures from the Metropolitan Police Service also show considerable reductions in crime. We need to ensure that the people of London know about these reductions, not because we want to be complacent or because the job is done, but because we want to move forward on the basis of facts.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o389"><a name="80423-0020.htm_para19"><a name="08042377000195">My hon. Friend the Member for Eltham took great delight in reading out what Tory-controlled authorities in London were saying about crime in their local newsletters and on their websites, and I do not blame him for doing so. What they are saying is totally at odds with what those on the Opposition Front Bench have suggested. Let me defend some of those Tory borough councils in London for what they have said about crime. Tory-controlled Barnet council says that it has seen a 17.5 per cent. reduction in crime, while Enfield council&#146;s website states:</p>
<a name="80423-0020.htm_brev0"><a name="08042377001605"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;The number of offences in Enfield has fallen by nearly 10 per cent.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o390"><a name="80423-0020.htm_para20"><a name="08042377000196">Many other Tory-controlled authorities right across the city are congratulating themselves on falls in crime and telling their residents about them. That is completely at odds with the picture that the Tory mayoral candidate and the Opposition Front Bench spokespeople are trying to paint.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o391"><a name="80423-0020.htm_para21"><a name="08042377000197">Why have we seen this reduction in crime? Why have we seen such an increase in confidence among people in London in this regard? It is partly a result of the introduction of the safer neighbourhood teams, which were introduced with the wholehearted support of the Mayor. Indeed, with his support, they were introduced a year earlier in London than in much of the rest of the country. We now have visible, accessible, responsive policing on our streets in all 600 wards in London. Let us also be clear that a key part of the safer neighbourhood teams in each and every ward is played by the police  <br>

community support officers, whose introduction was opposed by the Conservatives, including the hon. Member for Henley.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o392"><a name="80423-0020.htm_para22"><a name="08042377000198">Alongside the safer neighbourhood teams, we need to see tough enforcement of the law, and we have indeed seen special police operations taking place alongside the work of the teams. Let us also remember that tough enforcement of the law includes tough sentencing. One of the toughest sentences that the people of London support is the minimum sentence for the possession of unauthorised firearms, which was also opposed by the hon. Member for Henley.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o393"><a name="80423-0020.htm_para23"><a name="08042377000199">While we are talking about the need for tough enforcement, let us also reflect on what contributes to the reduction in crime, and on what makes a difference. Alongside the tough enforcement approach and the safer neighbourhood teams comes partnership and prevention. If we are to continue to reduce crime and to tackle gun and knife crime, we also need to invest in youth services and the partnerships involved in them. The Mayor of London has led the way in supporting initiatives across the city to prevent young people in particular from becoming involved in crime. He has been particularly involved in trying to divert young people away from crime in the first place. With the Government, he has set up a new &#163;75 million youth offer, which will make a considerable difference in tackling these issues in our communities across London. It will give support to the parents and young people who need it, and it will develop the services that are so important if we are to continue to bear down on&#151;</p>

 I should like to thank Mr. Speaker for agreeing to the subject of this Adjournment debate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o403"><a name="80423-0021.htm_para7"><a name="08042377001215">I should start by declaring that in 2006 I brought together a number of campaign groups in the justice for families campaign, which I chair. I am also taking the unusual step of releasing a campaign song, the proceeds of which will be used to prevent miscarriages of justice.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o404"><a name="80423-0021.htm_para8"><a name="08042377001216">There is something rather dreadful happening in England today, but not in Scotland. In England, we have targets for adoption and rewards for moving children from one family to another, but not in Scotland, where the priority is to keep families together. In England, two thirds of children leaving care are adopted, but not in Scotland, where two thirds of children under five go home to their birth parents. The drive to increase the number of adoptions and the recycling rewards for local authorities have caused masses of miscarriages of justice. Yvonne Coulter, Chris Smith, PC and S and the Websters were all cases in which children were stolen by the state from their birth parents, only for it to be found later that it was a mistake. A mistake, yes, but not a mistake that can be put right.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o405"><a name="80423-0021.htm_para9"><a name="08042377001217">I know of a case in which a baby was put into care on a fast track to adoption because his mother might get post-natal depression. Is that right? I do not think so. How did it help the local authority? It helped it hit its recycling target. In the deep, dark corners of the British legal system, hidden away by threats of imprisonment for those who speak out about injustice, we have allowed bad practice to fester. No action can be taken by a Member of Parliament to prevent solicitors from undermining their own clients because they want to keep the money coming in from the local council. No action can be taken by an MP to stop social workers who lie to the courts because they want to win a case and hit their adoption targets, or to stop doctors who provide rubbishy, unproven and unchallenged medical evidence that destroys families, but fills their bank accounts.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o406"><a name="80423-0021.htm_para10"><a name="08042377001218">The reason for that is the secrecy of the proceedings under the Access to Justice Act. There are a number of very good people working in the system to protect children from maltreatment, but they are undermined by the lack of action to deal with bad behaviour by practitioners. That has to come to an end. We need to consider the issues honestly and openly while we have an opportunity to amend the Children and Young Persons Bill. I have two new clauses that could assist in improving accountability without undermining children.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o407"><a name="80423-0021.htm_para11"><a name="08042377001219">As in all aspects of the public or private sector, there is a range of people of different competences. There are some very good people working as social workers, lawyers, experts or judges, but there are also those who are incompetent or corrupt. The difference in public family law is that the secrecy of the system prevents accountability. In theory, there are checks and balances that prevent the abuse of state power, but practitioners  <br>

often collude to prevent those checks and balances from coming into operation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o408"><a name="80423-0021.htm_para12"><a name="08042377001220">A good current example is a case covered in the following verse in the song I referred to earlier:</p>
<p align="center"><a name="08042377001632">&#147;The boys they say that they won&#146;t talk to their mom</p>
<p align="center"><a name="08042377001633">The judge says foster care is what must be done</p>
<p align="center"><a name="08042377001634">Dad says its wrong by writing a book</p>
<p align="center"><a name="08042377001635">He&#146;s put in jail &#145;cos somebody looked.&#148;</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o409"><a name="80423-0021.htm_para13"><a name="08042377001221">It is absolutely absurd to place two children aged 13 and 15 in foster care because they will not talk to their mother, who is estranged from their father. The father would like to appeal, but the lawyers, including his own solicitor, are working against him. To appeal, he needs a judgment, but he still has not been given it. On Monday, I spoke to the 15-year-old, who is in fact 16 today, and he said, &#147;I think children&#146;s social services are a complete disaster. My brother is mortified because he wants to go back to his dad. I think the way things are happening is pathetic. My father has never hurt either of us.&#148;</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o410"><a name="80423-0021.htm_para14"><a name="08042377001222">Let us understand the reality of this. Tens of thousands of pounds are being spent to keep in care two children who have never been hurt by their father. In effect, they are being imprisoned in care for no good reason. However, outside Parliament, we are not allowed to scrutinise the reasoning. The problem is that the rule of law is systematically undermined in the family division.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o411"><a name="80423-0021.htm_para15"><a name="08042377001223">There is supposed to be a tape recording of the hearing. However, as yet, we have not managed to obtain a copy of such tapes. Transcripts are refused to parties on the basis of exaggerated costs. In the Harkness case, the transcript did not correlate with the parents&#146; memory of the case. In Pauline Goodwin&#146;s case, the tape of her hearing in the Court of Appeal seems to have gone astray. If somebody manages to get a case to the Court of Appeal, the court has been known to say that it is out of time even though somebody has been struggling for years for a judgment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o412"><a name="80423-0021.htm_para16"><a name="08042377001224">One of the more worrying aspects about the Court of Appeal is that substantive cases are heard at the permission stage. If the court decides to refuse the appeal, it makes an order under section 54(4) of the Access to Justice Act 1999, preventing the case from going to the House of Lords. The Act prevents family law decisions from being considered by the House of Lords to ensure that we have a unified body of law. We have to ensure that parties are provided with tapes of their hearings immediately afterwards so that they can obtain timely copies of the judgments. We also need to change section 54(4) of the 1999 Act so that there is proper consideration of issues by the UK Supreme Court, the House of Lords.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o413"><a name="80423-0022.htm_para0"><a name="08042377001225">It is worth considering a few cases in some detail to see how things go wrong. Fran Lyon&#146;s case never encountered the courts. She was a pregnant mother who became one of my constituents for a while before she emigrated. She was told that she was such a great risk to her baby that the child had to be removed within 15 minutes of birth and she could never breast-feed. However, her case was reviewed in Sweden. All the information cooked up by children&#146;s services and doctors in Northumberland was examined and it was decided to discharge her from hospital. Fran suffers from angiodaema so she has a tracheotomy. The doctors in the north-east said she had Munchhausen  <br>


<meta name="Date" content="23 Apr 2008">

syndrome by proxy and caused her angiodaema herself. The doctors in Sweden said that she should sue the doctors in the north-east for malpractice because her angiodaema was not self-induced&#151;it even occurred when she was unconscious. Yesterday, I received the official English translation of the Swedish social work report, which concluded:</p>
<a name="80423-0022.htm_brev0"><a name="08042377001618"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Our assessment is that there is no need for support or any other programme with regard to Fran&#146;s capacity as a parent.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o414"><a name="80423-0022.htm_para1"><a name="08042377001226">In England, the plan was to take the baby 15 minutes after birth, which would have also involved the usual twin-tracking adoption plan. In Northumberland, there was systematic and corrupt abuse of process. Sadly, that is all too common in the system.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o415"><a name="80423-0022.htm_para2"><a name="08042377001227">In Norfolk, in the Webster case, the health visitor was pressurised to change her opinion about the family. When combined with unreliable and wrong medical evidence, that caused three of the children to be adopted. Another case in Norfolk involved three social workers in a 12-person case conference deciding to override the nine-three vote that a child was not at risk. Instead, they put the child on the child protection register. All 12 experts got together. Nine voted that there was no problem, but three voted that there was and later decided to ignore the nine. That is abuse of process. It is not democratic and it is not a proper mechanism. I am aware of other sub judice cases in Norfolk, on which of course I cannot comment. They all involve abuse of process and perversion of the course of justice.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o416"><a name="80423-0022.htm_para3"><a name="08042377001228">Although the targets and financial rewards for adoptions have now rightly been scrapped, their presence has massively damaged an already creaking system. While they were in place, in law the opinion of the local authority was subject to a financial conflict of interest, which made a substantial number of judgments unlawful. The lawyers like to blame the social workers. However, the real problem lies in the court system and the law.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o417"><a name="80423-0022.htm_para4"><a name="08042377001229">The test for almost any decision making is whether there is a &#147;risk of significant harm&#148;&#151;the standard section 31 definition in the Children Act 1989. The vagueness of that description allows all sorts of nonsense to be accepted. At the same time many parents&#146; solicitors are subjected to a conflict of interest because they are also paid by the local authority or guardian. It is sadly not rare for a parent&#146;s solicitor to fail to contest an application for a care order, or indeed to persuade parents, against their will, to accept that the section 31 threshold has been met. At that point the parents are at the mercy of the state&#146;s family steamroller.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o418"><a name="80423-0022.htm_para5"><a name="08042377001230">In the meantime, the children are almost invariably ignored. I referred to the case of children who did not want to be in care; they are being ignored by their guardian. Someone is appointed whose job title is &#147;representing the interests of the children&#148;&#151;the guardian ad litem. Most of those guardians work for CAFCASS&#151;the Children and Family Court Advisory and Support Service. CAFCASS East Midlands was recently inspected by Ofsted, who found the service &#147;inadequate&#148;; in other words, not up to the job.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o419"><a name="80423-0022.htm_para6"><a name="08042377001231">Historically, the judges have had a tendency merely to agree with the proposals of the local authority, unless the guardian takes a different view; we therefore have a system that depends on a financially biased local authority and a frequently inadequate guardian&#151;not a recipe for good decision making. That meant that  <br>


<meta name="Date" content="23 Apr 2008">

parents did not have a prayer. Things have improved more recently, and that should soon become evident from the statistics on cases. There are still problems following the new public law outline, but most of the cases in which there are problems are still sub judice, so I shall not refer to them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o420"><a name="80423-0022.htm_para7"><a name="08042377001232">What are the Government doing? Recently, the case of Simeon Kellman came before the criminal courts. He used a council&#146;s child database to find victims to abuse. The Government are to introduce a national database, so that the Kellmans of this world can find their victims nationally&#151;very clever. We know that being in care is not good for children, so why are children put into care for rubbishy reasons?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o421"><a name="80423-0022.htm_para8"><a name="08042377001233">Another problem is that we really do not know what happens to children who go through the system. One local authority lost 61 children in one year; it has no idea where they have gone. There is an annual return called the SSDA903 that is sent to the Department for Children, Schools and Families. That return does not track the point at which children come out of care, unless they are adopted or go into special guardianship. It does not track most outcomes; it gives them as &#147;other&#148;. When one asks people to go through the files, as we did in the case of the authority where 61 children were lost, they say that they can find some of the children, but one local authority&#151;admittedly a rather large one&#151;does not know where 61 kids went. In Scotland, authorities do look at where children end up. That is why it is easier there to find out what is happening to the children.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o422"><a name="80423-0022.htm_para9"><a name="08042377001234">We have been running a massive social experiment in forced adoption&#151;adoption against the will of not just the parents, but those children old enough to understand what is happening. A study conducted by Ofsted looked at children&#146;s views of the adoption process. At least a third said that they did not want to be adopted; they wanted to be left where they were. Inevitably, a large number of forced adoptions break down, but there is little research on the subject. I recently had discussions with the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children about the process of forced adoption and how it affects children in the long term. Figures indicate that the failure rate of forced adoptions is, at a minimum, a quarter to a third. That is the sort of information on which we should get proper research, but that research is not being done.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o423"><a name="80423-0022.htm_para10"><a name="08042377001235">Another appalling aspect of the system is the way in which children are damaged by care proceedings, even if the proceedings end with the children going home. Let us take a situation where a baby is taken away at birth and put into foster care&#151;that is not good for the baby, to start with. After about a year&#146;s legal wrangling, when people have made lots of money from representing various parties, the child goes home because it is found that there was no evidence of any risk in the first instance. Think about the Fran Lyon case; what would have happened to her if she had stayed in England? She would have lost her baby at birth and there would have been massive wrangling. In fact, her first lawyer told her that she should just give up because she would never win, so she emigrated. It damages children to go through that process. The fact that the system tends not to let go means that children get damaged by the process.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o424"><a name="80423-0022.htm_para11"><a name="08042377001236">A case in Oldham&#151;the judgment was anonymous, which is very good&#151;caused a mother to have an abortion to avoid care proceedings. In that case, a child was taken away at an early stage because of allegations that the child had been harmed by the parents. After massive legal and medical wrangling, and an attempt to get a second opinion&#151;the opinion was initially refused by the court of first instance and by the court of appeal, but then accepted by the court of appeal&#151;the parents were proved innocent. They were not just not guilty; it was proved that it was not a shaken-baby-syndrome-type case, for those who study these things. There was no justification for the intervention whatever, but the child and the parents suffered, and the mother had an abortion to prevent the same thing from happening to another child.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o425"><a name="80423-0022.htm_para12"><a name="08042377001237">We really need to carry out proper, rational risk analysis. The intervention of the state is almost invariably damaging. We need to minimise the damage caused by intervening while any investigation is going on. Most foster carers are good people, but we have to stop covering up situations where foster carers abuse the children in their care. The Care Leavers Association wants a public inquiry on the issue, and we should accede to its demand. We also need to revisit the idea of supporting families, rather than using the hammer.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o426"><a name="80423-0022.htm_para13"><a name="08042377001238">The system is far more badly broken than I expected it to be when I started studying it. The way in which the child protection system operates has wide ramifications for society. The evidence is clear in the number of prisoners who have been in care. It is also clear that the removal of children from mothers who are victims of domestic violence is causing them not to report that violence. The procedures followed after multi-agency risk assessment conferences, which are carried out in response to 392 forms, are causing concern among mothers who are victims. People suffer in silence rather than having to handle the consequences of asking for help.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o427"><a name="80423-0022.htm_para14"><a name="08042377001239">We cannot continue leaving the details to the practitioners. Proper scrutiny and accountability are essential. The system is supposed to have as a priority keeping families together. Why, then, are they split up in England, but kept together in Scotland? The Prime Minister said that the difference came from a difference in social work practice. Clearly, the system does not do what it says on the box. It does not protect children properly or support keeping families together properly. The evidence is there, north of the border.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o428"><a name="80423-0022.htm_para15"><a name="08042377001240">We have systematically excluded grandparents from the decision-making process. That is ludicrous, as they are the normal source of back-up child care. Early-day motion 1199, which I tabled, focuses on the issue, following suggestions from the GrandParents Association and various other lobby groups. I am pleased to say that a motion has been tabled at the Council of Europe leading towards an investigation into family law in England and Wales. It would be good if we could have such an investigation in this country and not rely on the Council of Europe to sort out our problems.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o429"><a name="80423-0022.htm_para16"><a name="08042377001241">Yesterday, we heard of the number of families destroyed by the system, often for no reason other than financial reward. Today we must start debating the issues, and tomorrow we need to reform public family law and stop such things ever happening again.</p>

 I congratulate the hon. Member for Birmingham, Yardley (John Hemming) on securing a debate on an issue that is important to everyone in the House and outside&#151;an issue that we should examine with care and consideration. Instead of ranting, we should take a comprehensive, considered and objective view of what we can do to make life better for those who are among the most vulnerable in our society. I am pleased, therefore, to have the opportunity to speak about the proceedings for children and to reiterate and emphasise the Government&#146;s commitment to helping and supporting vulnerable children.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o430"><a name="80423-0022.htm_para17"><a name="08042377001243">Fortunately, the number of children in need in this country is relatively low compared to the total number of children in the country, but that does not mean that we should be or are any less committed to addressing those children&#146;s problems. We take our responsibilities in that regard extremely seriously. I shall summarise the recent background to the way we deal with matters relating to children and young people. In 2003, we published the &#147;Every Child Matters&#148; Green Paper, which set out five outcomes that we want to see achieved for all children. It is worth remembering that one of those outcomes was that children should be protected from harm and neglect so that they stay safe.</p>

The Children Act 2004 put in place new structures to help us deliver those five outcomes. Also in 2004 we published &#147;Every Child Matters: Change for Children&#148;, which set out a continuing national programme of change, outlining how the reforms were to be implemented. At the heart of that programme was the goal of ensuring that all children, especially the most vulnerable, are able to stay safe. I agree with the hon. Gentleman in one respect. Our starting point is that state intervention is and must always be a last resort. We firmly believe that children should live with their parents, provided it is safe, and that, where necessary, families should be given extra support to help them stay together.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o432"><a name="80423-0022.htm_para19"><a name="08042377001245">On 1 April this year, I made a written statement to the House detailing two key reforms to the wider care proceedings system, which came into force on that day. The first of those was the revised Children Act statutory guidance to local authorities, issued by my colleagues in the Department for Children, Schools and Families and the Welsh Executive. It underlined to local authorities the need for them to work more closely with families and others to find alternative solutions to entering legal proceedings at all, always, of course, on the basis that it is safe to do so.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o433"><a name="80423-0022.htm_para20"><a name="08042377001246">The guidance stressed that local authorities must explore all safe and suitable alternatives. Those should include targeted support for parents to enable children to remain at home and, another option that is hugely important in our diverse society, the possibility of the child being cared for within the wider family, whether by grandparents, aunts, uncles or even older siblings.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o434"><a name="80423-0022.htm_para21"><a name="08042377001247">Of course, that was already a requirement in the Children Act 1989, but it was re-emphasised, and I hope will be continually re-emphasised, under the guidance published a few weeks ago. That said, where the local authority has immediate concerns about safety, they are able to apply for an emergency protection order or to  <br>

make an immediate application in care proceedings. We know&#151;something to which the hon. Gentleman referred&#151;that the longer-term prospects for children who remain with their extended birth family where it is established that it is safe, can be much better than for children who are in care.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o435"><a name="80423-0022.htm_para22"><a name="08042377001248">At the same time in April, a second reform, the public law outline, also came into effect. This is a new judicial case management tool that dovetails precisely with the statutory guidance. It provides a more streamlined procedure for the way in which courts handle care applications, so that cases can be resolved more rapidly when a local authority decides that the only safe solution is to seek an order through the court.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o436"><a name="80423-0022.htm_para23"><a name="08042377001249">The outline makes it clear to local authorities what the courts expect of them. Local authorities will have to demonstrate to the court that they have thoroughly explored all suitable and safe alternatives. They will also have to show the court what steps they have taken to work with families to try to enable the child to remain within his family home or within the wider family. In that way, the outline will, to all intents and purposes, provide an additional check on the actions of local authorities that issue proceedings.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o437"><a name="80423-0022.htm_para24"><a name="08042377001250">I want to share with the House some of the things that were said at the formal launch of those reforms on 1 April. I sat and listened to the three representatives of the Children and Family Court Advisory and Support Service young people&#146;s board who talked more eloquently than any politician or professional about their hopes and aspirations for the way in which the reforms will impact on their lives.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o438"><a name="80423-0022.htm_para25"><a name="08042377001251">One of them said:</p>
<a name="80423-0022.htm_brev1"><a name="08042377001619"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;You will be working with us as active partners in our own case...listening to us, understanding us, moving at our own pace...sometimes faster, sometimes slower.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o439"><a name="80423-0022.htm_para26"><a name="08042377001252">So I take issue with the hon. Gentleman when he says that we are not listening to what young people have to say. He will know that I have a particular interest in ensuring that young people&#146;s voices are heard in this place in terms of extending our democracy, and in terms of those who are vulnerable and who need the state&#146;s systems to protect them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o440"><a name="80423-0022.htm_para27"><a name="08042377001253">Another of the young people said, &#147;Sise does matter.&#148; Sise being: see us, inform us, support us, empower us. It is true that in the past it has been all to  <br>

<notus-date day="23" month="4" year="2008" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><b>23 Apr 2008 : Column 1438</b><br>
easy sometimes to forget that what we do, we do to protect children, and that children&#146;s voices can often be swamped in the adult noise. Of course the Children Act underlined that when it said that the welfare of the child must be paramount in the decisions of the court. I do believe that the Children Act strikes the right balance; a balance between the complex set of rights and responsibilities, the rights of a child to be safe from harm, and the responsibilities of parents. It also makes it clear that the state has a duty to intervene, when a child&#146;s welfare demands it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o441"><a name="80423-0022.htm_para28"><a name="08042377001254">We have introduced the Children and Young Persons Bill, which is a key part of our agenda to improve outcomes for children in care. Our aspirations for children in care must be as high as those for our own children. We must ensure stability in every aspect of care, and there must be good parenting from all those working with children in care, in the same way as we work on improving parenting for those children who remain with their families. There must also be a stronger individual and collective voice for every child in care. The Bill will provide the legislative base to deliver many of the changes set out in the White Paper, &#147;Care Matters: Transforming the Lives of Children and Young People in Care&#148;, to make that vision a reality.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o442"><a name="80423-0022.htm_para29"><a name="08042377001255">The hon. Gentleman has raised a number of individual cases, although he could not refer to some of them in detail. I do not believe that there is systematic corruption and unprofessionalism throughout the social services, local authorities, the courts or elsewhere. He is being unfair to those who work closely with children who need our help and support, and who ensure that those children receive that help and support. The president of the Association of Directors of Children&#146;s Services &#147;flatly rejects&#148; the odious claims surrounding so-called forced adoptions. There is no coherent evidence to support those claims, and the notion that honest, skilled and hard-working professionals would seek to cause children to be adopted unnecessarily is unacceptable. I believe that she holds that view honestly and professionally, and the Government and I support it. Our underlying theme will always be that the welfare of the child is paramount, which is what we seek to achieve.</p>
