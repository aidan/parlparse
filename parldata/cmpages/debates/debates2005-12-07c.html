</p>



<p><a name="st_o0"><a name="51207-01_spmin0"><b>The Secretary of State for International Development  (Hilary Benn): </b> 
 It is good to see so many Members in their place in anticipation of International Development questions, is it not?
</p>

<p>
<a name="51207-01_para0">
<a name="stpa_o0">Economic growth is fundamental to reducing poverty in Africa. The continent needs more private sector investment, better roads to link producers to markets and fairer global trade. At Gleneagles, the G8&nbsp;agreed a comprehensive plan to support Africa&#039;s economic development. As part of this, the UK has recently announced &#163;17&nbsp;million for the African Union-New Partnership for Africa&#039;s Development investment climate facility, and a trebling of UK &quot;aid for trade&quot; to &#163;100&nbsp;million a year by 2010&nbsp;to help poor countries boost exports.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o1"><a name="51207-01_spnew0"><b> Christine Russell: </b> 
 I thank the Secretary of State for that very positive reply, but does he agree that one of the best ways to promote economic development in Africa is to unlock the continent&#039;s vast agricultural potential? Will he therefore assure the House that at next week&#039;s World Trade Organisation ministerial talks in Hong Kong, he will lead the way in lobbying for the removal of, or a reduction in, the unfair trade barriers that deny African farmers access to world markets?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o2"><a name="51207-01_spnew1"><b> Hilary Benn: </b> 
 I agree with my hon. Friend. Some 70&nbsp;per cent. of people in Africa work in agriculture and if their lives are to improve, they need to have a better chance of exporting their products to the rest of the world. She can rest assured that the Government will go on doing what they have been doing: pressing for changes that will unlock that potential, so that Africa can have a better future.

<p>
<a name="51207-01_para1">
<a name="stpa_o1">So what are Ministers expecting African countries to do at the WTO talks to ensure a deal on unfair trade barriers? What pressure is the Secretary of State putting on Peter Mandelson and what does he expect from African countries at the talks in Hong Kong?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o4"><a name="51207-01_spnew3"><b> Hilary Benn: </b> 
 It is more a question of what African countries are expecting from the Hong Kong talks. They are looking for recognition of the need to improve access to their agricultural markets and of their different starting point. They are looking for special and differential treatment, and those are the proposals that they have tabled. They are also looking for a special safeguard mechanism that will enable them to protect themselves against surges in imports. In the end, their contribution is to look at a deal and to decide whether it will be in their interests. The truth is that we have a long way to go if we are to achieve the outcome next week that all Members want; but that does not mean that we should stop trying, and we will not.
</p>

 (Lab): Given the Government&#039;s opposition to forced liberalisation in African countries, as in other developing countries, what is my right hon. Friend&#039;s attitude to International Monetary Fund conditionality, which seeks to impose precisely that in many African countries&#151;for example, Ghana?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o6"><a name="51207-01_spnew5"><b> Hilary Benn: </b> 
 The Government&#039;s position on conditionality was clearly set out in the policy document that we published earlier this year. I have been working to get the World Bank and the IMF to review the use that they make of conditionality. In the end, it is about enabling developing countries to take their own decisions, but all Governments have responsibilities in deciding how they are going to spend their money, such as managing their economies effectively and keeping inflation low, because high inflation impacts on poor people in particular.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o7"><a name="51207-01_spnew6"><b> Mr. Andrew Mitchell  (Sutton Coldfield)</b> 
 (Con): The Secretary of State was entirely right to identify Conservative Members&#039; intense interest in International Development questions today. As the Prime Minister made clear in his recent Guildhall speech, the engine of economic growth in Africa and elsewhere is free and fair trade. Does the Secretary of State accept that the WTO meeting in Hong Kong next week, which both he and I hope to attend, is in danger of being derailed by the European Union&#039;s subtle yet blatantly protectionist negotiating position, particularly on agriculture?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o8"><a name="51207-01_spnew7"><b> Hilary Benn: </b> 
 May I say to the hon. Gentleman that I am very glad to see him still in his place this morning? I share his aspirations for the outcome of the world trade talks and his frustration at their current state. The EU has tabled one offer and then a second, but in order to unlock these negotiations there needs to be movement on all sides. The question is: can we, in the short time remaining, enable that movement? The effort currently being put into those major negotiating issues means that 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>7 Dec 2005 : Column 853</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>the issues that the poorest developing countries are concerned about, to which I referred a moment ago, are not getting a look in. There is one exception: the agreement on trade-related aspects of intellectual property rights, which I welcome greatly.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o9"><a name="51207-01_spnew8"><b> Mr. Mitchell: </b> 
 None the less, the position that the Secretary of State sets out is a serious and depressing one for the talks next week. Will he press the European Union negotiators, even at this late stage, to put on the table a meaningful real-terms cut in trade barriers, rather than the current phoney offer, which cuts tariff headrooms but not the actual tariff levels? Do not those tariffs prevent some of the poorest countries on earth from starting to trade their way out of poverty?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o10"><a name="51207-01_spnew9"><b> Hilary Benn: </b> 
 They certainly do prevent the poorest countries on earth from doing that. The fundamental problem, as the hon. Gentleman is only too well aware, is that there are 25&nbsp;member states of the European Union and not all of them share the perspective that he and I share. That is part of the problem, and it would help the EU to move if there was some movement by others in those negotiations. At the moment, however, we are stuck, because everybody is waiting for somebody else to move.
</p>

 (Lab): My right hon. Friend will know that economic development also depends on secure and sustainable public access to water. Across Africa, there have been huge and growing protests against water privatisation, which has priced the poor out of access to water resources. He will also know that there has been a growing counter-movement to develop public-public partnerships in water management provision. Can he tell the House what involvement the UK Government have had in those public-public water resource management projects?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o12"><a name="51207-01_spnew11"><b> Hilary Benn: </b> 
 I share my hon. Friend&#039;s concern about the need to ensure that more people get access to clean water, not least because it will improve children&#039;s health and enable more girls to go to school. Some 95&nbsp;per cent. of our bilateral spending on water goes to support public provision, community-led provision or humanitarian provision of clean water supply, and that demonstrates where the Government&#039;s priorities lie.

 Order. Perhaps I may point out to the hon. Member for Na h-Eileanan an Iar (Mr. MacNeil) that it is not the done thing to stand in front of a Member who is addressing the House.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o15"><a name="51207-01_spnew14"><b> Andrew George: </b> 
 Although I exonerate the Secretary of State from my criticism, how can the Prime Minister and the Chancellor of the Exchequer trumpet the so-called success of the Gleneagles agreement and claim historic debt write-off when, this year, African countries will pay back a great deal more in debt repayments than the UK will provide in monetary aid?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o16"><a name="51207-01_spnew15"><b> Hilary Benn: </b> 
 The Government are right to take pride in what we have been able to achieve, with the support of others, in obtaining support for a multilateral debt 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>7 Dec 2005 : Column 854</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>cancellation deal, because it will mean, for between 18&nbsp;and 38&nbsp;developing countries&#151;14&nbsp;of the initial countries are in Africa&#151;that up to $55&nbsp;billion worth of debt is cancelled for ever. That was not the case when 2005&nbsp;started. However, the process of debt relief and cancellation is a continuing one. At the beginning of the year, few people thought that it would be possible to get a deal on that scale and it is a result, in particular, of the efforts of my right hon. Friends the Prime Minister and the Chancellor of the Exchequer, to which I pay tribute. When that deal comes into effect, African countries will have to spend less of their precious resources on servicing debt that is not sustainable.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o17"><a name="51207-01_spnew16"><b> Mr. William Cash  (Stone)</b> 
 (Con): In the spirit of congratulating the Government when they deserve to be congratulated, will the Secretary of State accept that some Opposition Members think that the Government have taken a positive initiative towards improving the lot of those countries in Africa and the developing world? But does he recall the Bill that I introduced earlier this year to deal with corruption in Africa? He mentioned conditionality, so will he impose a condition of external audit, if the countries concerned are not prepared to agree voluntarily, to eliminate corruption?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o18"><a name="51207-01_spnew17"><b> Hilary Benn: </b> 
 I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for his kind words and I know that he takes a real interest in these questions. Tackling corruption and promoting good governance are absolutely fundamental to economic growth, which is the subject of the original question, especially in Africa. Many of the poorest countries, are those in which there has been corruption and a failure of governance. We have to try to achieve a position in which countries audit their own spending, so that they can be accountable to their own people. I assure the hon. Gentleman that I take seriously the responsibility that we have to ensure that the funds we use are audited and tracked properly, so that we can account to the House for the way in which that funding has been used. I look forward to continuing the discussion that we have already started on that subject, because it is a very important issue.

 (Lab): If he will make a statement on the Government&#039;s plans to mark international AIDS Day. [34884]
</p>



<p><a name="st_o19"><a name="51207-02_spmin0"><b>The Secretary of State for International Development  (Hilary Benn): </b> 
 On world AIDS day the UK highlighted the importance of more and better funding for the fight against AIDS, and of working towards universal access to AIDS treatment by 2010. As EU President, the UK hosted a meeting that launched an EU statement on HIV prevention for an AIDS-free generation. The Government also published a briefing paper on &quot;Harm reduction&#151;tackling drug use and HIV in the developing world&quot;.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o20"><a name="51207-02_spnew0"><b> Ian Lucas: </b>

<b>7 Dec 2005 : Column 855</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>right hon. Friend use his good offices to raise the matter with drug companies so that young children suffering from that terrible disease receive the appropriate treatment?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o21"><a name="51207-02_spnew1"><b> Hilary Benn: </b> 
 I have seen the report from M&#233;decins sans Fronti&#232;res to which my hon. Friend draws attention. I share his concern and happily undertake to take up the issue, because it is important that we use all the means at our disposal to fight that terrible disease, which presents a real threat to the future development of Africa.
</p>

</p>








<p><a name="st_o23"><a name="51207-02_spnew3"><b> Hilary Benn: </b> 
 We work with a wide range of voluntary and community organisations in the development field and I pay tribute to them for the work they undertake in helping communities to overcome stigma and, in particular, in providing support to orphans and vulnerable children. In the developing world, 13&nbsp;million children have lost one or both of their parents to AIDS. The work done in local communities makes the biggest difference; if the disease is to be beaten, treatment is hugely important for those who are already HIV-positive. The only way to achieve an AIDS-free generation is if people do not acquire the HIV virus in the first place. That is why being open and honest about the virus&#151;how people catch it and how they can protect themselves and fight it&#151;is fundamental to winning the battle. The work of the organisations to which the hon. Gentleman referred is hugely important in supporting communities to have the confidence to be open and honest about how to defeat the disease, and I applaud them for the work they are doing.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o24"><a name="51207-02_spnew4"><b> Joan Ruddock  (Lewisham, Deptford)</b> 
 (Lab): May I draw my right hon. Friend&#039;s attention to the Select Committee report on that very subject, published last week? Will he support one of our recommendations and agree that, as in many countries, if people need drugs, they also need the money to pay for them, that will make universal access to treatment impossible? Will he work with UNAIDS and the World Health Organisation to issue an international policy statement on free access to treatment for AIDS at the point of delivery?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o25"><a name="51207-02_spnew5"><b> Hilary Benn: </b> 
 I agree entirely with my hon. Friend&#039;s point about the importance of ensuring that people can gain access to the drugs that will save their lives. It is no good if people cannot afford them because the price is too high. That is why much of the &#163;1.5&nbsp;billion that we are committing to the fight against AIDS over the next three years&#151;which, as my hon. Friend knows, makes Britain the second-largest donor in the world in the fight against AIDS&#151;is going to support building the capacity of developing countries to improve their health services and make those drugs available to people. That is the only way we shall save people&#039;s lives.

<p><a name="st_o26"><a name="51207-02_spnew6"><b> Malcolm Bruce  (Gordon)</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>7 Dec 2005 : Column 856</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>expressed some concern at the need for annual monitoring to ensure that the target is reached? Will he consider incorporating targets on access to HIV/AIDS treatment in the next spending round? Will he report on cross-Whitehall co-operation and explain what review of programmes his Department is undertaking in the light of the AIDS crisis? It affects countries such as Botswana, where his Department has little aid engagement at present, threatening their very survival.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o27"><a name="51207-02_spnew7"><b> Hilary Benn: </b> 
 On the hon. Gentleman&#039;s last point, Botswana is of course a middle-income country whose economy has been growing fast and well. In the end, the Department and I have taken the view that it is important to prioritise our efforts where we think we can make the most difference. There is a lively and real debate about targets as we move towards &quot;all by 10&quot;. The first thing we need is for individual countries to set their own targets, because a global target to measure progress as we go may not capture the ability of countries to build up capacity as quickly as we would like. Secondly, the global steering committee is looking at that question and, in particular, at which milestones we should use to measure the progress we make between now and 2010&nbsp;in achieving access for all. The committee will report in the middle of next year and we shall look carefully at its recommendations.

Will my right hon. Friend consider given extra ring-fenced funding to Swaziland to help it combat that AIDS rate?

 I can tell my hon. Friend that we are, through a regional project, funding work to support the fight against AIDS in Swaziland.

This year alone, it is estimated that 4.9&nbsp;million people contracted the virus and only 1&nbsp;million are receiving treatment out of a total infected global population of more than 40&nbsp;million. It is disastrous that the three-by-five initiative appears to have failed and that the G8&nbsp;aspirations for HIV/AIDS appear to be adrift. What is DFID&#039;s strategy to ensure that developing-nation Governments recognise and prioritise prevention and treatment and that the pharmaceutical industry allows the manufacture of cheaper, generic antiretroviral drugs?

<p><a name="st_o32"><a name="51207-02_spnew12"><b> Hilary Benn: </b> 
 I share the hon. Gentleman&#039;s concern, and the statistics that he describes paint a very depressing picture. However, the three-by-five target has been a good thing because, at the end of June, 500,000&nbsp;people were on antiretrovirals in sub-Saharan Africa&#151;treble the number of 12&nbsp;months earlier. Is that progress? Yes, it is. Is it enough? No, it is not. Having a target encourages people to get themselves organised, which is why we fought so hard for the new target.

<a name="51207-02_para0">
<a name="stpa_o2">On prevention, the policy statement that we achieved for the first time in the EU makes the argument that is it only by prevention that we will defeat this disease. Openness and honesty is the key. On access to drugs, the agreement that has been reached to extend the period in which countries have to apply the TRIPS agreement&#151;the least developed countries did not have to do so anyway until 2015&#150;16&#151;gives those countries the opportunity, if they have not got manufacturing capacity, to import from elsewhere, and we have to work with them to enable them to use that new freedom to get the drugs to those who need it.

That agreement is very welcome&#151;I pay tribute to him for his role in bringing it about&#151;but he will also know that the previous agreements have not led to a single case of the rules allowing antiretroviral drugs to be brought to those who need them.

</p>








<p><a name="st_o34"><a name="51207-02_spnew14"><b> Hilary Benn: </b> 
 The reason why the agreement has not yet delivered the benefits that we would like is that legislative changes were needed both in developing countries and in the EU&#151;the EU has now put them in place&#151;but we have been providing technical assistance to help countries to take advantage of that new freedom. We must now step up the international effort, because those poor countries that cannot manufacture those drugs now have the opportunity to import them, and it is important that that freedom is used.

A little more credit for what we have been able to achieve in helping Commonwealth countries to tackle poverty might be appropriate. Let me cite just one example of the continuing support that we give.

 As I am sure that my hon. Friend knows, we have an increasing aid programme for India.

 We welcome moves to reduce tariffs, subsidies and other barriers to the free flow of goods and services. The UK has made assessments based on research by the World Bank, United Nations organisations and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development that suggest that substantial gains for developing countries could result from the liberalisation of agricultural and industrial trade. The actual gains will depend, of course, on the level of reform and the policies that developing countries themselves put in place to take advantage of a more open trade system. Assistance to help the poorest countries to do this will be important, and the UK Government are committed to trebling trade with them and increasing support to &#163;100&nbsp;million a year by 2010.

 The hon. Lady is well aware that agriculture support is a big issue in France, is she not? I made the point earlier that there are 25&nbsp;member states in Europe that have different views. In the end, there must be agreement in Europe so that progress can be made.

 The Secretary of State said earlier that someone has to move in the world trade talks. Is it not the case that the United States has moved and that President Bush has said that he is ready to eliminate all tariffs? Is that not an offer that the European Union and Britain cannot refuse?

 Yes. It is important that we give schools the freedoms that they need. I am delighted to hear that the hon. Gentleman supports these reforms. I assume, therefore, that the Conservative party will be voting for them.

 Absolutely. <i>[Interruption.]</i> With our support&#151;<i>[Interruption.]</i> With our support, the Prime Minister knows that there is no danger of losing these education reforms in a parliamentary vote. So he can afford to be as bold as he wants to be. That is when he is at his best&#151;or so I am told. Can we agree that that means trust schools owning their own buildings and land, employing their own staff, setting pay locally, developing their own culture and ethos and controlling their own admissions?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o61"><a name="51207-03_spmin6"><b>The Prime Minister:</b> 
 Of course it means all those powers that currently are available to foundation and voluntary aided schools being extended to other schools as well. That is the purpose of the proposals. Incidentally, before I answered any questions, I should have welcomed the hon. Gentleman to his new position and congratulated him on winning the Conservative leadership election. But can I tell him where I feel that we may&#151;and I am sorry to say this&#151;have a disagreement? As I understand it, his position is that all schools should be free to set their own admissions procedures. I am afraid that I believe that the present admissions code should remain in place. So perhaps we can clear that up, too.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o62"><a name="51207-03_spnew20"><b> Mr. Cameron: </b> 
 I want schools to control their own admissions. That is what is in the White Paper, and let us see that it turns into the Bill. <i>[Interruption.]</i> It is only our first exchange, and already the Prime Minister is asking me the questions. This approach is stuck in the past, and I want to talk about the future. He was the future once. Education is one of the public services in desperate need of reform, so does he agree with me that our aim should be to ensure that all schools have these freedoms? Will he ensure that this is one reform where he will not look back and wish that he had gone further?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o63"><a name="51207-03_spmin7"><b>The Prime Minister:</b> 
 I certainly can say, as I have said before, that it is important that all schools get these freedoms. However, it is obvious that we disagree on the issue of admissions. I think that if schools are free to bring back selection at the age of 11, that would be regressive for our country. So I am afraid that in this grand new consensus we have to disagree on that point.

Therefore, I have to say to him that it is not merely in respect of education policy that we have to agree. We have also to agree that the investment that is so necessary to back up that reform continues. I am afraid that his economic policy, which is to cut back investment, because of his desire&#151;<i>[Interruption.]</i> I am happy if this is another policy that he is about to change. He is saying that this year he would not have put all the investment in but rather have shared that investment half and half between tax cuts and investment. That would mean substantial cuts in public investment. I am very happy to have this new consensus with the hon.

 The type of improvement that my hon. Friend is describing is one that is happening right across the national health service at the present time. It is extremely important that it continues.

Of course, there should be proper treatment of anyone who is detained, and I have already made it clear that, as far as I am aware, it is not an issue here.

 Yes, I most certainly am committed to that.

In China, for example, one power station is being built every week or every two weeks. Therefore, unless we manage to get a comprehensive framework that also involves India and China, it will not be of much use to us. I entirely agree that the issue is immensely important.

 I just said in answer to the previous question that it is important that we get binding targets.

<p><a name="st_o92"><a name="51207-03_spmin22"><b>The Prime Minister:</b> 
 First, I understand that Somerset county council, which is the local transport authority for Taunton, has received more than &#163;20&nbsp;million for local transport, which is an increase of more than 20&nbsp;per cent. in the past few years, and has indicated that congestion in Taunton will be a priority.

In the end, it is our job to provide the powers and the money, and it is the local authority&#039;s job to make the best use of them. I hope that that happens in Taunton, which, like many towns, faces a congestion problem, because the local authority has additional powers and resources.

In view of what the United States is alleged to be doing, does he really believe that having mini-Guantanamos across Europe helps to win hearts and minds in that war?

 We have already moved a long time ago from words to action. It is partly as a result of what my right hon.

We ourselves have put an immense amount of overseas aid into Sudan. We have been leading the way on ensuring that the proper talks take place in order to get a long-standing settlement. I think that the action that we have taken speaks volumes for the commitment of this country as well as the commitment of this Government. It obviously continues to be a deeply difficult situation, but the only proper way through is to build up the African Union force so that it can keep the combatants apart long enough for us to be able to get a peace deal negotiated.

 I had hoped that the judgments were somewhat more objective than that. My hon.

Sure Start has made a real difference to people&#039;s lives. I know that there are conflicting reports estimating the value of the scheme, but I believe from my own experience of visiting many Sure Start schemes round the country, including those in my constituency, that they have made an enormous difference not only to the children but to the parents. I have talked to many families who have gained skills and jobs for the first time through Sure Start. That is why I believe that it should continue.

 I beg to move,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_0">That leave be given to bring in a Bill to equalise of the size of parliamentary constituencies; and for connected purposes.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="51207-04_para0">
<a name="stpa_0">The catchy title was not my first choice; I wanted to call the Bill the rotten boroughs Bill, because that is what we have at the moment. Those of us who did our history before the national curriculum was introduced thought that this problem had been solved in 1832, but it has not. There are 230&nbsp;small parliamentary seats in this country, in which the electorate is more than 5&nbsp;per cent. below the national average. I am afraid, Mr. Speaker, that several of them are in Scotland, and many are in Wales. Very few are controlled by the Conservatives, although that is of course irrelevant to the purpose of introducing the Bill.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51207-04_para1">
<a name="stpa_1">There is something in the Bill for the leaders of both parties. The constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for Witney (Mr. Cameron) has 9,000&nbsp;voters more than the average. If that figure were reduced to the average, it would give him more time to campaign for a Conservative victory&#151;of which we are now more confident, thanks to his accession to the leadership&#151;as he would not have to spend so much time in his constituency. There is also something in the Bill for the Prime Minister. A cursory look at who represents these small seats reveals a disproportionate number of Labour Members who cause him trouble. So the Bill could provide a cost-free way of getting rid of some of his enemies.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51207-04_para2">
<a name="stpa_2">The nature of the problem is quite extraordinary. The smallest seat represented in the House has 21,169&nbsp;voters. The largest has 107,767, which is more than five times as big. The Member who represents the smallest seat got here by getting 6,213&nbsp;votes; the Member who represents the largest had to get 32,717. That cannot be right.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51207-04_para3">
<a name="stpa_3">The average electorate across the whole UK is just under 68,500, but 239&nbsp;seats are more than 10&nbsp;per cent. above or below that target, which creates a variation of nearly 14,000&nbsp;votes. That is a third of all the seats in this place, and if we include the numbers that are 5&nbsp;per cent. above and below, that is nearly two thirds of the seats, which is still a difference of 7,000&nbsp;votes. About two thirds of the seats in the House are therefore more than 5&nbsp;per cent. above or below the average. Self-evidently, that seems unfair. Whatever the party advantage or disadvantage, it surely cannot be right that some people can get here with one fifth of the votes from one fifth of the electorate with which other hon. Members have got here.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51207-04_para4">
<a name="stpa_4">My Bill is designed to deal with that unfairness, not to deal with other questions of the fairness of the voting system or the size of Parliament, although I am in favour of a smaller Parliament. I have drawn on a report from the Electoral Reform Society, however, and a pamphlet written a couple of years ago by my hon. Friend the Member for Chichester (Mr. Tyrie), who used the issue as part of his argument for a smaller Parliament.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51207-04_para5">
<a name="stpa_5">The problem derives from us&#151;it is a self-inflicted wound. Usually, the House deals with injustice created by events beyond our control. In this case, however, 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>7 Dec 2005 : Column 872</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>under the Parliamentary Constituencies Act 1986, the boundary commission has instructions that have led to the conclusions that I have itemised. The injustice is therefore created by us, and it is in our hands to remedy it.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51207-04_para6">
<a name="stpa_6">Let me examine the problem in a little more detail. The Act gives Wales a minimum of 35&nbsp;seats, but it has 40. I do not think that there is a case for the over-representation of any part of the United Kingdom, but Wales now has its own Assembly, and Assembly Members duplicate work with Members of Parliament. If it had the same quota as the rest of the United Kingdom, it would have 32&nbsp;seats. As a result of that anomaly, 33&nbsp;Welsh seats are more than 10&nbsp;per cent. below the average UK electorate. Of the 50&nbsp;smallest seats in the whole United Kingdom, half are in Wales.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51207-04_para7">
<a name="stpa_7">There used to be a similar problem in Scotland, which was in part corrected&#151;wholly corrected, I thought, until I examined the figures&#151;by the Scotland Act 1998. It is supposed to use the same quota as England, which would give it 57&nbsp;seats, but it has 59&#151;again, it is over-represented. Scotland has even less of a case than Wales for over-representation&#151;it has its own Parliament, and Members of the Scottish Parliament perform constituency functions that, in England, usually fall to English Members of Parliament. If any part of the United Kingdom does not deserve to be over-represented, therefore, it must be Scotland.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51207-04_para8">
<a name="stpa_8">A few very small seats in Scotland are created by a geographical exemption, which the boundary commission is allowed to use. I think that that exemption should go. Even if it should remain, however, surely the problem should be dealt with in Scotland. If it wants to have three or four small seats because of Orkney, Shetland or the Western Isles&#151;I have been mugging up on the correct pronunciation of the new name for the Western Isles seat, but seeing you there, Mr. Speaker, I am afraid that my courage fails me, and I am sticking to the old English words; it seems to me that the new name is unpronounceable for anyone from south of the border&#151;it should stay within its 57&nbsp;seats and have a couple of larger ones to make up for it.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51207-04_para9">
<a name="stpa_9">Paradoxically, Northern Ireland is given 16&nbsp;to 18&nbsp;seats in the boundary commission instructions, and it is mandated that there should be 17&nbsp;unless there is a compelling reason to the contrary. It has 18, is at the top of the range, its average number of voters is nearly 10&nbsp;per cent. below the UK average, and if it had only 17&nbsp;seats, the average number of voters in a Northern Ireland seat would still be below the UK average. In the case of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, therefore, we must move to a United Kingdom average, which would remove a large part of the problem, but far from all of it.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51207-04_para10">
<a name="stpa_10">England has a different problem. One seat is palpably too large&#151;the Isle of Wight&#151;and it is under-represented in this place. As I understand it, however, that is the Isle of Wight&#039;s choice&#151;it does not want to be divided into one and a half seats&#151;
</p>








<p><a name="st_1"><a name="51207-04_spnew1"><b> Mr. Andrew Turner  (Isle of Wight) (Con):</b> 
 Hear, hear.
</p>








<p><a name="st_2"><a name="51207-04_spnew2"><b> Mr. Maples: </b> 
 I am endorsed by my hon. Friend the Member for Isle of Wight (Mr. Turner), who comments from a sedentary position. I took the precaution of 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>7 Dec 2005 : Column 873</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>discussing the matter with him in advance. I think that the Isle of Wight is a special case, and if it chooses to be under-represented, that is its choice.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51207-04_para11">
<a name="stpa_11">The huge disparity between the other over and under-represented constituencies, however, arises from about four causes. The first is the population shift, year after year, from cities to suburbs. The boundary commission works from old electoral registers. In the current review, it is working from electoral registers from 2000. The election at which the new seats come into operation will be in 2009&nbsp;or 2010&nbsp;probably, although the sooner the better. The registers will be nearly 10&nbsp;years out of date at that point. The reviews take place only every eight to 12&nbsp;years, so there is little opportunity to make up for the discrepancy between Parliaments.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51207-04_para12">
<a name="stpa_12">The second group of reasons relates to the boundary commission&#039;s instructions not to cross county and London borough boundaries except in exceptional circumstances, which produces some odd results. My county, Warwickshire, is small. We have had five seats, and my own seat has had 85,000&nbsp;voters. It will come as a shock to a Welshman or a Scot that any seat could be so large. We were entitled to 5.45&nbsp;seats, so we have five. Now, apparently, we are entitled to 5.52&nbsp;seats, and will have six. Following a very modest increase in the number of voters, we are gaining a 20&nbsp;per cent. increase in the number of seats. Obviously some counties will have two fewer seats, because their entitlement is slightly below 5.5. I believe that in such cases we must let&#151;indeed, instruct&#151;the boundary commission to cross county and London borough boundaries.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51207-04_para13">
<a name="stpa_13">According to the 1991&nbsp;electoral register, the Banbury constituency was already 8,000&nbsp;voters too big by 1997, 15,000&nbsp;voters too big by 2001&nbsp;and 19,000&nbsp;too big by the time of the election that was held earlier this year. As for the other side of the coin, Sheffield, Brightside was already 5,000&nbsp;voters too small by 1997, 13,000&nbsp;voters too small by 2001&nbsp;and 19,000&nbsp;too small by 2005. We must let the boundary commission adjust the boundaries in accordance with what it expects to happen.


<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>7 Dec 2005 : Column 874</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>

<p>
<a name="51207-04_para14">
<a name="stpa_14">Most of the seats whose electorates are too big are held by us, and most of those that are too small are held by Labour. Of 118&nbsp;seats that are more than 10&nbsp;per cent. below the average, 83&nbsp;are Labour-controlled. That strikes me as palpably unfair.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51207-04_para15">
<a name="stpa_15">The remedy is obvious. First, the quota must be paramount. There should be a United Kingdom quota, and the boundary commission should be instructed that it may not deviate by more than 5&nbsp;per cent. in either direction. There should be a single boundary commission for the whole United Kingdom, so that the same rules are seen to apply everywhere. Secondly, boundary reviews should happen more frequently. I suggest at least one review every four years&#151;one for each Parliament. That would allow more frequent, but necessarily smaller, adjustments.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51207-04_para16">
<a name="stpa_16">Thirdly, the boundary commission should be entitled to take projected population changes into account. We know that in Stratford-on-Avon about 1,000&nbsp;people a year will be added to the population because of planning approvals that have already been granted, and houses that are already being built. Fourthly, the commission should be allowed to cross county and London borough boundaries to adhere to the quota. Fifthly, geographical exemption should be abolished in all parts of the United Kingdom.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51207-04_para17">

<a name="stpa_21">Total landings of fish from UK vessels increased last year. They are now worth about &#163;510&nbsp;million to the UK economy. Our exports of fish and fish products were also up, valued at around &#163;880&nbsp;million. The pelagic sector, which relies mainly on herring and mackerel, continues to do well, as does the shellfish sector. The importance of nephrops, more commonly known as prawns, continues to grow as a proportion of the UK&#039;s total catch. However, some other species are still in decline, or their stocks remain at dangerously low levels, most notably cod.

<a name="51207-05_para5">
<a name="stpa_25">The Minister says that many stocks are under pressure but, as he knows, all white fish stocks and indeed others are to some extent being dictated by the cod recovery plan. Therefore, even if a stock is in robust condition, because of the attachment to cod in a mixed fishery, it can have a very low quota estimate. Is there not a case for a full review and public examination of the cod recovery plan, taking into account recent scientific evidence on climate change and other factors, which perhaps can look to establish a plan that does not discriminate against other fisheries in pursuit of an attempt to recover cod in the central North sea?

In tactical terms, it would be a mistake, however, for the UK Government to argue for an earlier review, because I suspect that that might open up a number of proposals that the hon. Gentleman would find much less attractive than the status quo. We are, however, constantly trying to satisfy ourselves that the plan, which has not had long to work in fisheries calendar time, is right. At the December Council we will argue very strongly against further pain being inflicted on the UK fleet&#151;I will deal with this issue in a moment&#151;including the important Scottish white fish fleet, because in our view we have yet to give the plan enough time to work. So to call for a review of it would not serve our interests well.

<p><a name="st_18"><a name="51207-05_spnew11"><b> Mr. Bradshaw: </b> 
 We accept that the cod stock is still very low in historical terms and does not show any sign of recovery. However, it is our very strong view that the United Kingdom has done more than any other member state to reduce effort on cod, and the Commission accepts that. We have reduced it by some 62&nbsp;per cent. since the cod recovery plan came in, so in our view it is other people&#039;s turn to take a bit of pain.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51207-05_para6">
<a name="stpa_26">This year has also been a very important one for the development of fisheries policy. In June, my colleagues in the devolved Administrations and I published our response to the Prime Minister&#039;s strategy unit report, &quot;Net Benefits&quot;. That response, &quot;Securing the Benefits&quot;, sets out a framework for the development of fisheries policy around the UK and how we will change for the better. I followed up &quot;Securing the Benefits&quot; by publishing a detailed action plan, &quot;Charting a New Course&quot;, in October. This plan sets out how the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs will deliver the commitments made in &quot;Securing the Benefits&quot; in England. These actions will help to deliver a more sustainable and profitable sector.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51207-05_para7">
<a name="stpa_27">We have already made progress in delivering these commitments. &quot;Net Benefits&quot; recommends that fisheries management take more account of recreational sea angling interests. We recently launched a consultation on proposals to increase the minimum landing size of bass, in recognition of anglers&#039; strong interest in this stock and of pressure for a bass management plan. These proposals could provide real benefits to all interested parties by increasing the overall value of landings and by allowing more fish to spawn. We have also increased the representation of recreational angling interests on the sea fisheries committees.

<p><a name="st_20"><a name="51207-06_spnew1"><b> Mr. Bradshaw: </b> 
 The fishery to which the hon. Gentleman refers has been closed for the past two or three months because of the collapse of the stock. The UK will certainly argue very strongly in the December Council for continuing measures to protect the sand eel stock.

<a name="stpa_32">The Government have also listened very carefully to the concerns expressed in the royal commission&#039;s report about the environmental effect of bottom trawling&#151;an issue that I take extremely seriously.

</p>

<p>
<a name="51207-06_para2">
<a name="stpa_33">There have been one or two other important developments this year that I should mention before turning to the detail and to our priorities for the December Council. Modernising and streamlining fisheries management has been another priority. In October, I launched the new Marine Fisheries Agency, which is formed from the sea fisheries inspectorate and other delivery teams within DEFRA. Separating policy and delivery functions in this way will strengthen our ability to provide a professional and efficient service. This change goes hand in hand with improving compliance, so that we can secure an industry that is profitable in the long term.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51207-06_para3">
<a name="stpa_34">Another high priority for the Department is the better regulation initiative. Rules are necessary to manage the fisheries, but the combined effect of current controls on fishermen is to impose too great a burden on them. We need to cut back on red tape wherever we can, and I am very pleased that DEFRA has linked up with the National Federation of Fishermen&#039;s Organisations in a joint project to identify what changes we can make. Working with the NFFO, we have already proposed to the European Commission a number of changes that 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>7 Dec 2005 : Column 880</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>should be made to EU law. We have pressed Brussels for an effective action plan to cut burdens on fishermen, and the Commission has promised to provide its ideas at the December council.
</p>








<p><a name="st_21"><a name="51207-06_spnew2"><b> Mr. Philip Hollobone  (Kettering) (Con):</b> 
 Given that the Minister has been talking about ecosystems and the health of fish stocks, can he tell us about the consequences of the 1998&nbsp;ban on the dumping of sewage in the North sea? Has there been a noticeable improvement in the marine environment, and is he satisfied that other EU countries with North sea coastlines are complying with that regulation?
</p>








<p><a name="st_22"><a name="51207-06_spnew3"><b> Mr. Bradshaw: </b> 
 Yes. That regulation has had an enormous impact on the quality of our marine environment; indeed, the measures that the UK and other countries have taken to deal with sewage in a more sustainable way have contributed to our seas being cleaner than at any time since the industrial revolution. But there are other pressures, which are still growing. One reason a marine Bill is so important is that it will enable us to take an overall, holistic approach to the management of our marine environment. That is an enormous challenge, given that most of what happens occurs underwater and is invisible to the human eye. Nevertheless, we are talking about a very important resource for our country.
</p>








<p><a name="st_23"><a name="51207-06_spnew4"><b> Mr. Salmond: </b> 
 Before the Minister moves on to the Fisheries Council, will he comment on a point of detail concerning the pelagic fleet? A scheme has recently been developed through which white fish licences can be aggregated into the pelagic sector. That is obviously a very good thing for the five boats that have such licences, but the other 15, which will not have time to acquire such licences and aggregation, are to some extent being discriminated against. At first sight, this scheme therefore appears to discriminate against some fishermen and in favour of others. Will the Minister have a look at this issue and see whether the time scale can be extended, so that all boats can be treated on equal terms?
</p>








<p><a name="st_24"><a name="51207-06_spnew5"><b> Mr. Bradshaw: </b> 
 I certainly will examine this issue. The decision to which the hon. Gentleman refers was subject to extensive consultation over a number of years and was taken with the support of fishing industry representatives. But I undertake to write to him or to say a little more about this issue at the end of the debate.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51207-06_para4">
<a name="stpa_35">Another issue flagged up in &quot;Net Benefits&quot; is problems with the current quota management system, which is regarded as confused and confusing. I agree, and in response we initiated a major programme earlier this year to reform our quota management arrangements. The programme is being undertaken in collaboration with the devolved Administrations and in full consultation with the industry. The plan is to deliver changes by 2008. They will bring clarity to the use and transfer of quota, while recognising the impact on vulnerable communities and on the small vessel fleet.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51207-06_para5">
<a name="stpa_36">In addition to effective management of quota, the fishing fleet must be of the right size to take advantage of fishing opportunities in a sustainable way. This balance of capacity and opportunity is particularly relevant in the western channel, where the Commission 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>7 Dec 2005 : Column 881</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>proposes further restrictions to protect flatfish stocks. In addition, our economic modelling of the south-west beam trawl fleet, which targets these stocks, suggests that there is some overcapacity. I have therefore asked for an assessment of capacity across all fleet segments so that I am in a position to take a strategic view of how best to achieve a fleet structure that is sustainable in the long term. On the basis of that work, and in the light of the conservation needs, I will be actively considering further decommissioning in England and Wales in 2006&#150;07.
</p>








<p><a name="st_25"><a name="51207-06_spnew6"><b> Mr. Austin Mitchell  (Great Grimsby) (Lab):</b> 
 The fear, certainly in Grimsby, is that in the process of decommissioning&#151;unfortunately, some Grimsby owners want to decommission, because the industry is not profitable&#151;preference will be given to the south-west, especially the beam trawlers, which are heavy users of fuel. The problems of the whole nation, and particularly of Grimsby, need to be taken into account and the aid should not be focused only on the south-west.
</p>








<p><a name="st_26"><a name="51207-06_spnew7"><b> Mr. Bradshaw: </b> 
 I assure my hon. Friend that the Government will take a holistic approach to the capacity situation. He is right to highlight the problem caused to particular sectors of our industry by high fuel prices, but I suggest that they are here to stay. If we are to achieve a sustainable and profitable fishing fleet in the long term, it makes sense to take such considerations into account when considering decommissioning. I will certainly bear in mind the representations that my hon. Friend has made and will no doubt continue to make on behalf of his constituents.

<p>
<a name="51207-06_para6">
<a name="stpa_37">For the second half of this year, much of our focus has been on delivering a successful UK presidency of the EU. Further progress in engaging stakeholders has been made through the setting up of regional advisory councils. The UK has been a key player in this process, and under our presidency we have seen the launch of both the pelagic and the north western waters RACs. Those new RACs have already provided advice on the annual quotas regulation. The established North sea RAC has also made significant developments, including providing advice on the Shetland box that has directly influenced European policy. The RACs are now planning to advise on key Commission policies, such as maximum sustainable yield, over the coming year.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51207-06_para7">
<a name="stpa_38">We have also achieved agreement on measures to restore and maintain healthy fish stocks. We agreed a recovery plan for southern hake and nephrops in the Cantabrian sea and western Iberian peninsula, and technical conservation measures for the Baltic sea were agreed last month in the Council. Both will be of long-term benefit to fish stocks.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51207-06_para8">
<a name="stpa_39">One of our other objectives is to improve decision making under the CFP, with better stakeholder involvement, and we hosted a constructive meeting on that at the October Council to consider possible changes to working methods for adoption of the annual fisheries total allowable catches&#151;TACs&#151;or what most people refer to as the fishing year.

 While the Minister is talking about improving the way in which those issues are dealt with, will he consider how advice from the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea is released? The run-up to the Council is always a difficult time for fishermen, but this year advice was released from ICES that haddock stocks were plentiful. Within a week we were told of a proposal for a 40&nbsp;per cent. reduction. I appreciate that that reduction has been scaled down since, but it caused much anxiety to fishermen, who feel as though they are on a rollercoaster ride.

 I should point out that the reduction was successfully negotiated by my excellent officials, but the hon. Gentleman has a point. That is one of the reasons why we wanted to put the issue on the agenda for our presidency. Although there is general support in the Council for some change, countries do not necessarily agree to the same changes, depending on their own interests. However, I am confident that a more sensible fishing year will emerge from the process, with maximum periods between the receipt of the scientific advice, the Commission&#039;s proposals and the need to agree them in Council. We also need to bear in mind the need that some people perceive to inject some discipline into the process, which is one of the few advantages of having the Fisheries Council in the run-up to Christmas.

<p><a name="st_29"><a name="51207-07_spnew1"><b> Sir Robert Smith </b> 
: The Minister talks of building a better process, but does he agree that the RACs need to be allowed to grow and build so that eventually those affected by decisions in, say, the North sea are the ones who make the decisions about what happens there?

</p>








<p><a name="st_30"><a name="51207-07_spnew2"><b> Mr. Bradshaw: </b> 
 I hope that that will be the case. It is worth pointing out that those organisations are only a year old. Many people were cynical about how effective they would be, but they have been proved wrong. Already, for example, the North sea advisory council has done some excellent work, produced some very good papers, engaged constructively and effectively with the Commission and managed to keep together in one body diverse interest groups with, on the face of it, different views of what we should do in the North sea. That is no mean achievement.

<a name="51207-07_para0">
<a name="stpa_40">We also co-hosted a seminar with the Commission on fisheries partnership agreements with third countries&#151;often poor African countries&#151;and agreed a series of actions to ensure that those third countries&#039; fisheries are not unsustainably exploited. That is not a major issue of concern in this country, although it should be. My concern was that in the past many of those agreements were not properly monitored, with the result that a renewable resource for some of the poorest countries in the world was being unsustainably exploited by some of the wealthiest nations, including members of the EU.

We share the concern that he expresses about the effect of Irish drift-net fishing on salmon stocks and I have raised the issue personally with my Irish counterpart and the Commission.

We will aim to maximise economic opportunities for the UK industry within that context and seek to protect the viability of vulnerable sectors of the UK fleet and the interests of particularly fisheries-dependent communities. The latest scientific advice should mean that the Council can agree increased TACs for western monkfish and for nephrops. But there are likely to be some tough decisions needed on those stocks that are not doing so well, including North sea, west of Scotland and Irish sea cod, and a number of flatfish stocks. The scientific advice also highlighted the challenges faced in managing vulnerable deep-water species. Some industrial fisheries, such as North sea sand eels, continue to be severely depleted. Again, this year, I and my officials have gone to great lengths to ensure the active participation of the industry in discussions in the run-up to the Council. We have been ably assisted by my hon.

According to figures from the Maritime and Coastguard Agency, 24&nbsp;fishing vessels were lost and, sadly, nine crew members died last year. Preliminary figures for this year show that there have been five deaths.

It has been a huge pleasure and privilege to learn about the industry and the communities that depend on it, but it has also been deeply sad and depressing. Whether it was Whalsay in the far north of the Shetlands&#151;where the nearest railway station is Bergen&#151;Peterhead, Stornoway&#151;in the western isles&#151;Whitby, Hastings, Plymouth or Brixham, an appalling picture of the desolation of our marine environment and the destruction of our fishing communities emerged.

<a name="stpa_46">One example encapsulates the problem. In Fleetwood, which I have visited on several occasions, there was a fleet of 140&nbsp;vessels in the 1960s; today, there are five. I met an engineer who used to employ 60&nbsp;people; he now employs one fitter. There is no clearer example of the insanity of the current system than my experience when I sailed overnight in the trawler Kiroan. The owners fish for plaice in the Irish sea. They are allowed 22&nbsp;days fishing per month with 80&nbsp;mm mesh, at which they are viable, and only 17&nbsp;days if they use the more environmentally friendly 100&nbsp;mm mesh, at which they are unviable. I asked them to use both mesh sizes and they trawled twice during the night. The 100&nbsp;mm net came up twice with two thirds saleable adult fish. Twice, the 80&nbsp;mm net came up absolutely bursting&#151;almost too full to pull on board&#151;with 90&nbsp;to 95&nbsp;per cent. of tiny baby plaice, which were all dying.

We are confident that cod is recovering. Haddock is OK. There is very little grumbling amongst our fishermen. Fishermen&#039;s incomes are considerably improving. We expect to improve our tax due to higher volumes and higher prices. It is absolutely ludicrous for the EU to be cutting our capacity. Here, we are improving capacity and efficiency, discarding old vessels&quot;&#151;</p>

<a name="stpa_51">They are opening some areas near the shore to summer fishing of flatfish, as the fish were &quot;dying of old age&quot;, and using selective gear to let cod escape from the top. They maintain a discard ban and the most important thing is to land everything. The sand eel fishery has been stopped as the fishing industry did not want to restore it.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51207-07_para12">
<a name="stpa_52">Mr. Breckmann reckoned that fishing was responsible for about 10&nbsp;to 20&nbsp;per cent. of mortality in the Faroes and confirmed that the industry is self-regulating. That is popular with fishermen. There is collaboration between fishermen and scientists. Above all, they know that cod numbers are decided by phytoplankton and protoplankton, which depend in their turn on temperature and salinity.

<a name="51207-07_para14">
<a name="stpa_54">Yesterday, I talked to Paul Howard, executive director of the New England fishery management council. Their policies of days at sea in closed areas have led to a huge revival of fish stocks and improvement in the marine environment. I give one example that is easy to understand. Closed areas have led to scallop landings increasing from 12&nbsp;million lb in 1996&nbsp;to a projected 43&nbsp;million lb in 2005&nbsp;and 78&nbsp;million lb for 2007. In the USA, 20&nbsp;fish species have been removed from the over-fished list in recent years.

<p>
<a name="51207-07_para15">
<a name="stpa_55">On the basis of many weeks of travel and long hours of discussion with people who run successful fisheries that actually improve the marine environment, we published a Green Paper in January, describing how our seas should be managed for the benefit of the nation. There is not a single original idea from me in the paper; it is a compilation of the best practices that I have seen working in other fisheries. Our policy objectives are clearly set out:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_5">&quot;Our policy is to manage the sea fisheries in UK waters in such a manner as to safeguard the natural environment; to rebuild and preserve our fish stocks and wildlife; to maximise the economic value of exploitable stocks, both in the short and in the long term, commensurate with the natural resource available and the environmental impact of so doing; to create a stable, equitable framework within which the fishing and allied industries can operate, including the recreational fishing sector and tourism; generally to protect the interests of the United Kingdom.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="51207-07_para16">
<a name="stpa_56">We set out a management framework with a series of tools and controls that have worked effectively in successful fisheries. The most important is effort control 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>7 Dec 2005 : Column 886</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>based on days at sea instead of fixed quotas. The immediate effect of adopting an effort control system to conserve fish stocks is that Government bodies, scientists and fishermen will be relieved of having to administer the labour-intensive and unpopular system of quota control. For many fishermen, it also relieves them of the double burden of having to deal with the EU imposition of quota controls and days at sea, with a significant reduction in bureaucracy.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51207-07_para17">
<a name="stpa_57">The Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution, which reported a year ago, stated:

<a name="51207-07_para18">
<a name="stpa_58">The two best examples that I saw of such controls were in the Faroes and New England, where days at sea have completely rid fishermen of any incentive to cheat and land black fish and have broadly eliminated the hideous problem of discards. Above all, fishermen are co-operating with scientists. That is fundamental. In the UK, I am afraid that there is still a poisonous distrust in many areas between the scientific establishment, environmentalists and fishermen. The key gain is accurate data&#151;that is fundamental because there is such a high level of discards and black fish landings that neither the Government, ICES or the EU commission know exactly what is going on. They are flying blind.

 Will my hon. Friend confirm for the layman that discards do not amount to throwing back small fish that might grow into bigger ones, but that the great majority of discarded fish are dead? They pollute the environment and represent an environmental scandal.
</p>








<p><a name="st_35"><a name="51207-08_spnew1"><b> Mr. Paterson: </b> 
 My hon. Friend is right. This is a complete scandal, and the facts are unknown. I cited the example of Fleetwood, where I saw 90&nbsp;to 95&nbsp;per cent. of tiny baby plaice being discarded. If they had been allowed to grow, with sensible mesh size regulations, they would have become commercial fish. Most fishermen tell me that they believe that more fish is dumped as pollution than landed for human consumption, and a large number of those fish must be saleable, commercial fish. I have heard that some beam trawlers in the south-west dump 20&nbsp;boxes of cod a night because they do not have the quota for it. The lesson from the Faroes and New England is that if those fish are landed, we know what is going on. Bluntly, we do not know what is going on now because there is such a level of discard and black landings. Having accurate data is an absolute basis of any management system, and my contention is that we do not have accurate data.
</p>








<p><a name="st_36"><a name="51207-08_spnew2"><b> Mr. Carmichael </b> 
: I accept the hon. Gentleman&#039;s point about the importance of accurate data&#151;it is a very good one and we have all suffered over the years because of the lack of accurate data&#151;but he has twice mentioned that a lot of black landings are going on, although, as he says, we do not know that. I caution him that it does the interests of our industry and our Ministers in representing our industry no good to make such wide statements about the level of black fish landings.

<p><a name="st_37"><a name="51207-08_spnew3"><b> Mr. Paterson: </b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>inevitably lead to discards and black landings. That is an ineluctable fact. The point of our policy is that we have seen that where days at sea rules have been introduced&#151;I think that this is the third time that I have said so&#151;there are fewer black landings and fewer discards. That is the most fundamental gain, and accurate data are produced. The royal commission said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_7">&quot;Our view is that a discard ban should be introduced. Under such a scheme, all fish caught should be landed.&quot;</p>

From his travels or perhaps just from intuition, can he say what that might mean, for example, to the percentage of herring and mackerel going into such a Norwegian pelagic fish factory?
</p>








<p><a name="st_39"><a name="51207-08_spnew5"><b> Mr. Paterson: </b>

</p>

<p>

<a name="stpa_60">and they have been used successfully in each of the fisheries that I have mentioned. New England closes as much as 33&nbsp;per cent. of its fishing grounds&#151;an area of 8,000&nbsp;square miles. We would certainly encourage a system of no-take zones, particularly in spawning and nursery areas, which are biologically sensitive, or in areas with corals or reefs, which might be exploited by divers or those with tourism interests. There is also a case for temporary closed areas.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51207-08_para2">
<a name="stpa_61">Again, I have been struck by the speed of response that is available to those countries that run independent fisheries systems. In the Falklands, each vessel is required to report its catch every night by satellite. If a vessel that is after squid runs into too many hake, a message will be sent to it overnight requiring it to steam on for a few hours to avoid an excessive by-catch. In Iceland, messages are sent by radio within hours of a vessel reporting running into juvenile fish, and announcements are made on all the radio stations requiring vessels to stay clear. Such instant management is impossible under the system from which we currently suffer.

<p><a name="st_41"><a name="51207-08_spnew7"><b> Mr. Paterson: </b>

 It is very interesting that the first time that the Minister jumps up, he avoids the technical details that would improve our marine environment and gets into tittle-tattle. I was delighted by both of our leadership candidates. As Anatole Kaletsky reported last week in <i>The Times</i>, my right hon. Friend the Member for Haltemprice and Howden (David Davis) said that he

</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="51207-08_para4">
<a name="stpa_63">On numerous occasions during the campaign, my hon. Friend stressed employment and social policies&#151;and my word, fishing certainly comes into that category. I can assure the Minister that we are all Cameronistas now.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51207-08_para5">
<a name="stpa_64">The Minister does not want to talk about the detail, but I have often brought the use of selective gear and technical controls to the House&#039;s attention during our numerous sparring matches in European Standing Committee A and at other times. The obtuse attitude of the Commission and the Government to the possible gains from using selective gear is extraordinary. Selective gear is quite simple&#151;it is designed, to quote one scientist, to &quot;surgically extract&quot; a species from a mixed fishery without affecting any others, and many techniques can be used. As the hon. Member for Banff and Buchan (Mr. Salmond) has said many times, it is ludicrous that when our haddock stocks are at a 30-year high we are letting such catches go to waste and concentrating entirely on cod.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51207-08_para6">
<a name="stpa_65">I have visited Manomet in Massachusetts, which is the world&#039;s leading research centre for selective gear. I have told the Minister about the details when he asked me about them behind the Chair. We could use those techniques. The Manomet centre has managed to separate cod and haddock with an 81&nbsp;per cent. success rate. It has separated cod from flat fish with a 100&nbsp;per cent. success rate. When the Minister leads these discussions in Brussels, will he please get his colleagues to understand the environmental benefits of using selective gear, because many of those techniques are not allowed by EU regulation?
</p>

<p>
<a name="51207-08_para7">
<a name="stpa_66">We would also opt for a rigorous definition of minimum commercial sizes. Ideally, we would like a commercial size to be set to ensure that mature adults are able to survive at least one and preferably two breeding seasons without being caught. We would ban industrial fishing. I am pleased that that is one of the lessons that the Government and the Commission picked up and, very late in the day, the sand eel fishery was closed. However, as the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds has said, it was


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_11">&quot;unprecedented action to close the North Sea sand eel fishery .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. but this was not implemented until July, when the season was over and the Danish fleet .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. had already returned home.&quot;</p>

 I want to make a friendly intervention this time. Many hon.

Yet, year after year, ICES produces the most extraordinary figures&#151;many hundreds of thousands of tonnes&#151;for the permissible fishery. Is it not passing strange that, after all those years, the welcome decision has now been made to close the sand eel fishery? Does that not bring into question the nature of the scientific advice that, year after year, against all experience and all common sense, has suggested that hundreds of thousands of tonnes of fish could be swept from the North sea and elsewhere?

 I agree with the hon. Gentleman. It is extraordinary that it has taken so long for the message to get through, but we must be grateful that the authorities have got it at last. It is not just a question of depriving haddock and cod of a food source; there is a considerable by-catch of juvenile commercial species. The hon. Gentleman is absolutely right, but I will come later to the grave doubts that I have about the scientific basis for the whole policy.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51207-09_para0">
<a name="stpa_69">We would set up a completely different system for management and the creation of fishing plans. The idea is drawn from my experience in the States, where the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act sets the strategic framework. A diverse group of people serves on regional councils to devise the policy and, above all, enforce it. Commercial fishermen, recreational anglers and environmentalists&#151;all those with a local interest&#151;take decisions and debate matters. Apparently, the debates can get very rowdy and the police have been called on some occasions in New England. There is a strong tradition of local democracy and accountability there and, of course, the town meeting goes back to the 18th century.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51207-09_para1">
<a name="stpa_70">There is great merit in having the activity managed as locally as possible by those who really understand it. We would want all local producers, processors, marketers and, above all, recreational fishermen to be involved. It is extraordinary that although we have 1&nbsp;million recreational fishermen who spend &#163;1&nbsp;billion a year on their activity, they are totally excluded from making decisions on what could be a really exciting and expanding sector of the economy. We would expect such people to have full influence when recreational angling gives significant value to a fishery. There are 17&nbsp;million sea anglers in America who sustain nearly 350,000&nbsp;jobs. It is bizarre that this country excludes such an important group, which could grow and benefit our marine resources. We would like more to be done on marine ecosystems.

Perhaps he would like to associate himself with the proposed consultation on the increase in the minimum bass landing size as a sign of his commitment to recreational fishing.
</p>








<p><a name="st_47"><a name="51207-09_spnew2"><b> Mr. Paterson: </b> 
 We have made it absolutely clear in our discussions with recreational fishermen that we would not stop at bass. We would like minimum landing sizes for all species to be increased. I know that the focus&#151;the battering ram&#151;is bass because there will be great value in that. Decisions will be taken in Brussels, but I do not understand how the interests of recreational fishermen will be represented there. However, account is taken of such interests in America because of the regional councils. There are 5&nbsp;million recreational anglers in Florida and they are directly involved in submitting their own information and contributing to the debate. Above all, they are involved in enforcement. For example, it is compulsory there to report every landing&#151;hundreds of thousands of tonnes of fish are landed by recreational anglers. The current system does not allow such a thing to happen.

 I am delighted that my hon.

He is absolutely right that decisions will be taken at the Council by nation states with no real interest in fisheries, no real understanding of fisheries, or any background in fishing. Buccaneering countries with real agricultural interests, such as Hungary and Austria, will be present, but those interests will be traded off with deals on other people&#039;s fishing interests. That is not the way in which things should be run. In reality, there are 887&nbsp;pages of detail somewhere in the Commission, which, in fairness, the Minister cannot possibly understand. Last time there were two big slips, although I do not blame him for that.

<p>
<a name="51207-10_para2">
<a name="stpa_92">I thank my hon. Friend the Minister for recently meeting me and Steven Atkins, the chief executive of the North Western and North Wales sea fisheries committee, along with Margaret Owen and Mark Hamer, who sit on it. Margaret and her husband Trevor have fished in Morecambe bay for many years and are well aware of the dangers posed to inexperienced strangers who cockle out in the sands of the bay. I was grateful to my hon. Friend for the generous amount of time that he allowed for us to apprise him of our concerns about health and safety, damage to the natural environment of Morecambe bay, the loss of taxation revenue, and fishing and the depletion of stocks.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51207-10_para3">
<a name="stpa_93">My hon. Friend is aware of the dangers of Morecambe bay, with its fast rising tides and shifting sands. Indeed, he was the first politician to visit it after the terrible tragedy in February 2004&nbsp;when 23&nbsp;Chinese cockle pickers lost their lives in appalling circumstances. People who live around the bay value its beauty, but they are well aware of the need to take great care when venturing out on to the sands. It can be treacherous for those who do not have local knowledge of the tides and the shifting quicksands. Indeed, the Queen&#039;s sand pilot, Cedric Robinson, who has been leading walkers safely across the sands for more than 25&nbsp;years, recently told the BBC:

<a name="stpa_94">I share his view completely.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51207-10_para5">
<a name="stpa_95">The cockle beds that surround Morecambe have been closed since April 2005&nbsp;by the North Western and North Wales sea fisheries committee. Legislation allows it to close beds to protect cockle stocks, but not to close them to protect human lives. That is crazy and unacceptable. The law must be changed to take health and safety concerns into account.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51207-10_para6">
<a name="stpa_96">The closure of the cockle beds was warmly welcomed by me, the police, the coastguard, the lifeboat, the parish councils of Slyne with Hest and Bolton-le-Sands, Lancaster city council and, indeed, the local fishing community. I am pleased to note that the sea fisheries committee has not reopened the beds. However, a cockle bed further down the coast at Fleetwood reopened yesterday. My concern is that the beds will 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>7 Dec 2005 : Column 894</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>reopen and that, without proper regulation, they will once again put people&#039;s lives in danger. When the Morecambe bay beds were open for cockle fishing, the lifeboat had to be called out on numerous occasions to help cockle pickers who were in danger. In fact, the lifeboat locally became known as the &quot;cockle taxi&quot;. People cockling were taking serious risks with their lives and were often unaware of the danger in which they placed themselves.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51207-10_para7">
<a name="stpa_97">The problem is that Morecambe bay is a public fishery, so just about anyone can go cockling when the beds are open. A permit scheme is in operation across the bay, but again, anyone can apply for a permit by providing identity and a national insurance number. When the beds were open, hundreds of permits were issued. It is alleged that many people obtained permits to fish who were in receipt of state benefits and were not declaring their income, and that others gave bogus or fake national insurance numbers. Although several million pounds-worth of cockles were collected from the bay, I am sure that many cocklers did not pay taxation on their income.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51207-10_para8">
<a name="stpa_98">As the sea fisheries committee has limited resources and there is only a small number of fisheries offices to deal with enforcement for a huge area, proper checks on permits did not take place. There also appeared to be problems with sharing information across Departments as a result of the Data Protection Act 1998. The weakness of the permit scheme is that just about anyone with a national insurance number and identification can apply and be granted a permit, regardless of their total lack of knowledge of health and safety issues in the bay or, indeed, of any knowledge of fishing.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51207-10_para9">
<a name="stpa_99">The Minister knows that the situation is different for fishermen who go out on boats on Morecambe bay, because they require qualifications. There is, however, no restriction on the number of permits issued when the beds are open, which can lead to over-fishing and a depletion of stocks over a short time. Also, no charge is made for issuing a permit. The sea fisheries committee says that it is unable to charge, to restrict numbers or to link the permit to health and safety considerations because of the outdated fisheries legislation. The committee also voiced concerns to my hon. Friend and me about resourcing issues relating to law-enforcement activities in Morecambe bay.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51207-10_para10">
<a name="stpa_100">The solution is simple: we need to change the legislation, as I am sure my hon. Friend would agree, to allow a proper licensing scheme to operate. A restricted number of licences should be issued to the bona fide fishermen&#151;those who depend on fishing for their main source of income and who pay taxes on that. They should have first preference to hold licences for shellfishing. A charge should also be made for every licence issued. The fishing community supports that because if they paid for a licence, the regime would almost become self-policing because it would ensure that people who did not have licences were reported to the relevant authorities. That income could go towards employing more fisheries officers to deal with enforcement. A licence should not be issued to anyone who has not taken a short course on health and safety and obtained a certificate of competence. I understand that the sea fisheries committee could organise such courses relatively easily. Small changes to legislation are

</p>

<p>
<a name="51207-10_para11">
<a name="stpa_101">I have talked specifically about Morecambe bay because it is the public fishery about which I have the most knowledge and because it can be so dangerous. However, I am aware of similar problems in other coastal areas, such as the Dee estuary, where a licensing scheme could also be helpful.

</p>








<p><a name="st_54"><a name="51207-11_spnew1"><b> Geraldine Smith: </b> 
 Yes. Obviously, there would have to be consultation, but such a scheme would represent progress as it would ensure that people could work safely in the dangerous environment of Morecambe bay.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51207-11_para0">
<a name="stpa_102">As well as health and safety issues, many of my constituents have been appalled by the environmental damage to Morecambe bay. When the cockling beds were opened, they were fished on an industrial scale. Rubbish and netting were left behind by cocklers, and many old vehicles were abandoned in the middle of the bay. I went out with the lifeboat crews on the hovercraft, and saw the problem for myself. It is a beautiful bay, and in the middle of it are several vehicles. They are in the sand and covered by water. Those abandoned vehicles pollute the bay and present a hazard to fishermen who work in small boats should their nets become entangled with the vehicles.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51207-11_para1">
<a name="stpa_103">As my hon. Friend the Minister will be aware, the problem is that no agency or Government Department appears to accept responsibility for the removal of the vehicles from the bay. I have tabled several questions to various Government Departments but I have not been able to establish who is responsible for their removal. I would be most grateful if my hon. Friend were to make inquiries and write to tell me who has that responsibility. It may be helpful for him to know that so far the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, the Environment Agency, the police and the local authority have all denied any responsibility. I do not know which organisation will be the last to disclaim responsibility.

It is right that we record the many issues that are facing fishing communities in the UK, some of which have already been raised. Ministers will again decide on the quotas for commercial fish stocks in each and every member state. Too often in previous years decisions on quotas and total allowable catches have been more about short-term political priorities than about informed science and decisions reached after proper consideration and consultation involving the fishing industry.

He has not done so in the past, and I hope that that practice will continue. I also hope that he can assure us that he will go into the negotiations fighting for the UK&#039;s interests. Seemingly, other countries have had no embarrassment in doing so on behalf of their fishing industries when they have been in the chair.

We are mindful that stocks of many species remain at a critical level, despite a number of beneficial changes that have been introduced, including those relating to mesh sizes. Still, however, not enough young fish are being allowed to grow to maturity, with a consequent continuing decline in some fishing opportunities.

<a name="stpa_109">The penalties that are exacted upon those who buy and sell black fish are punitive, and this is having a real effect on the incidence of such fishing.

It is a practice that none of us can condone, and I am pleased to note that there is some evidence to suggest that that activity is beginning to be reduced.

<a name="stpa_110">The cod recovery plan was well-intentioned, and originally we all supported it, but it is not working. Before any further reductions in quotas or efforts are considered, I suggest to the Minister that there should be a full review of the current plan. It should address especially the issues of by-catch and discards, and data. Merely going on with more of the same, but at an even more draconian rate, is unlikely to improve stocks to the extent that we would all wish.

<a name="stpa_116">Given that the Minister will be chair the Council meeting, may I ask what the UK presidency has done in the past six months to ensure that TACs and quota decisions are made on the basis of sound science and in full consultation with the fishing industry? We hold a fisheries debate every year, and the Council meets every year so it is sensible for information to be made available over a reasonable period. However, at this time of year, things are squeezed into a few weeks, often resulting in some people being unable to provide the information that, quite properly, they want to contribute to the debate. I welcome the Minister&#039;s confirmation that a marine Bill will be introduced. It will be a significant piece of legislation for fishermen and will provide extremely important measures on use of the sea, including spatial planning and environmental degradation in some areas. We therefore hope that it will be introduced at the earliest opportunity. It would benefit significantly from pre-legislative scrutiny, as the Animal Welfare Bill has done.

As appears to be the case in other countries, sea anglers should be included in discussions so that they can play a role in the constructive governance of UK fishing. Once again, the Minister will have considerable responsibilities at the end of the month, and we wish him well. UK fishermen have responded to many challenges, including the recent hike in fuel charges and so on, that have been inflicted on them. However, I hope that he realises that there remains a genuine belief that other countries are less robust in their implementation of EU policy. We would not wish UK fishermen, particularly in the south-west&#151;I know they are very much in the Minister&#039;s sights&#151;to be penalised once again because of the inadequate enforcement by other European states of TACs and quotas, which constitute the only available framework to address both the environmental and commercial aspects of fishing.

After a suspension last year, those discussions were delayed this year so, in addition to the fact that Commissioner Borg&#039;s prediction has not been forthcoming, we have had to wait for a last-minute decision, which has put the industry and ourselves at a disadvantage.

<a name="stpa_120">Secondly, I fear that the British presidency has been a handicap in certain negotiations. We are so anxious to bend over backwards to secure an agreement and conciliate people that we do not assert our national demands and interests as vigorously as the Dutch did when they held the presidency. They used their position ruthlessly to gain what they wanted on fishing. Why do we not do the same? Our civil servants are brought up in the best tradition of British sportsmanship&#151;probably in an arcane game such as cricket&#151;and they always want to be fair to the poor continentals, particularly at a time when we have to show leadership. However, that is not what the industry wants or needs. We want a vigorous assertion of our demands and interests.

 I am not up to the clever techniques of Scottish politics because I am a decent, inhibited English Member.

I am not criticising the Minister, but I am criticising a position which makes a British Government who are in a difficult situation in Europe more accommodating than they might otherwise be, because they have the presidency and want to show responsibility.

The only support that was offered was for health and safety measures, which would have enabled the Grimsby industry to purchase millions and millions of plastic helmets for fishermen to wear. We saw the Minister in August and I hope that he has put that right. Yorkshire Forward, for instance, is still too slow to provide the help that is necessary, and is unadventurous in keeping catching capacity in the area so that we have no further shrinkage.

The Government reply to the report was lethargic and did not indicate that the issue was being pursued with the necessary dynamism. It did not address the concern that if we are not going to provide the direct aid that the industry wants&#151;I still think that the industry should receive it&#151;we must be vigilant in order to prevent others from providing it to their industries, which returns us to the Irish Republic and Spain.

They have been handicapped by the lack of advance information on the Commission&#039;s proposals. If they had received an indication of the Commission&#039;s proposals by the middle of the year, they would have been able to develop plans on how to apply them and to make suggestions on what should be done.

<p><a name="st_81"><a name="51207-13_spnew8"><b> Mr. Hayes: </b> 
 My hon. Friend the Member for North Shropshire (Mr. Paterson) is right about the difficulties for the industry in long-term business planning and investment, because the policies change year by year. Because the industry does not know where it stands, it cannot invest, but that does not seem to be the case in Ireland. In 1973, the total catch by the Irish fishing fleet was 78,068&nbsp;tonnes; by 2003, it had risen by 195&nbsp;per cent. Somebody is doing well within the EU, and it is not the UK&#151;it is, as the hon. Member for Strangford (Mrs. Robinson) has said, Ireland.
</p>








<p><a name="st_82"><a name="51207-13_spnew9"><b> Mr. Mitchell: </b> 
 The problem in this country is that the fishing industry has never been big enough to be a powerful influence on Government. It is more powerful in Scotland, and it exercises more influence on the Scottish Executive than it does on the UK Government. Smaller countries with bigger fishing industries focus more intensely on the issue and can achieve more.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51207-13_para6">
<a name="stpa_130">The building of ever bigger and more powerful vessels goes against conservation. We need older and less efficient vessels, such as those in Grimsby, because their catches are much less damaging environmentally. What has happened in Ireland is bad for the industry and bad for conservation. It is unfortunate that the machinery in Europe is so cumbersome that it does not allow us to stop such practices immediately.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51207-13_para7">
<a name="stpa_131">There is a case for re-organising the fishing year, which is out of kilter. We should bring forward what the Commission wants to achieve and hold earlier talks with Norway to set total allowable catches. We should also revise the scientific advice, which is increasingly questioned. It provides a freeze-frame of the previous year, so it may well be out of date by the time that judgments are made on it&#151;it is published in the middle of the year, and the decisions are made in December.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51207-13_para8">
<a name="stpa_132">I agree with the evidence put forward by the National Federation of Fishermen&#039;s Organisations, and the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea and&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;others have acknowledged that the scientific underpinning for the catch limits is wobbly. The number of times that the words &quot;uncertainty&quot; or &quot;unreliable data&quot; enter into those calculations means that we should not base tough judgments and restrictive measures on them.

That welcome innovation by the Government allows fisheries vessels to undertake DEFRA-funded research, which has been very successful in making the scientific advice more practical. Given the wobbly scientific underpinning, decisions on restrictions and cuts are based on inadequate information. The industry is right to protest against the proposals on cuts, because it has been slowly ratcheted downwards by that process. We need a better organisation of the year and more information to allow the industry to become more involved in taking the necessary decisions.

<a name="51207-13_para10">
<a name="stpa_134">We must take a long-term view of how to reach sustainable catch levels and a sustainable industry, but the Commission is still motivated by a short-term view. I was disappointed when Commissioner Borg&#039;s promise on advanced information about the Commission&#039;s objectives was not fulfilled. Unless we receive such information, the RACs cannot work effectively, because they need to take views on what the Commission is proposing in order to allow their own views to be taken into account. Those views should be enforceable, so we do not want advisory councils; we want regional managerial committees to determine the targets for their area and the means of reaching those targets&#151;in other words, how to limit catches, if they are to be limited. What the industry wants is right. We must move on to the future by co-operating with other countries, through the RACs and more powerful bodies that will succeed them, and with scientists and Government. That is the only way in which we will achieve a sustainable industry.

<a name="51207-13_para11">
<a name="stpa_135">I am grateful that some of the industry&#039;s demands have been taken into account and that it has been consulting so effectively. More power to that process, because the industry needs to be brought much more into it. The industry&#039;s aim, like that of the Government, is sustainability. It might be necessary to give it more financial support than the Government have been prepared to give. However, there is a common aim that will be achieved by better organisation of fishing in Europe, with more flexible management instead of blanket bans and the cod fish recovery programme.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51207-13_para12">
<a name="stpa_136">We need more temporary closures of areas and more selective measures taken vigorously through the RACs. We need the ban on industrial fishing for which we have been asking for years. I was delighted to hear from the Minister that the effective ban on sand eels and pout will close down much of the industrial fishing, which has been an abomination. I could never understand the scientific advice on which it was maintained. Licensing will deal effectively with the black fish industry. The industry grumbles about the regulation involved, but traceability and registration are the only effective way forward in that respect.

<a name="stpa_137">That brings me back to the main issue that faces us: cod recovery. It is clear that the cod recovery plan is not working, yet it inhibits the rest of the industry, because what it can catch is geared to it. Haddock is more plentiful and can still be caught, yet it is not allowed to be caught because of the coupling with the cod recovery programme. The industry wants a full review of the cod recovery programme in 2006. I would go further, although it grieves me to do so, because Grimsby has always been a cod port. The time may have come for us to recognise the fact that cod stocks are not going to

<br>&nbsp;<br>recover. In the North sea, the decline was mainly caused by over-catching. That has brought stocks to the point where it is questionable whether they will survive. There is also the problem of climatic effects and the warming of the waters, which was mentioned by the Opposition spokesman.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51207-13_para14">
<a name="stpa_138">Frankly, we do not know in scientific terms whether cod stocks will recover if the cod recovery programme is maintained. If they are not going to recover, that is an end of it. Let us remove that ratchet, which is screwing down on the rest of the industry, and give up on cod. Certainly, the Canadian experience indicates that there will not be a recovery. When cod stocks reach a particularly weak point, predators come in and eat the eggs and the whole environment becomes more hostile. We may have reached that point.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51207-13_para15">
<a name="stpa_139">I am not qualified to evaluate whether the warming of the waters will be countered by what is happening to the gulf stream. I am affected by that only to the extent of bathing from Cleethorpes beach, and I am not qualified to assess the effect on fishing. However, there is a process that is driving out the cod. It might be as well to recognise that and to say that we are not going to engage on a ratcheting process which is screwing the rest of the industry down on the basis of a cod recovery programme that will not succeed, especially as we could achieve the same objective by other means&#151; for instance, geographically focused measures on cod taken by the RACs.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51207-13_para16">
<a name="stpa_140">That brings me full circle to the argument on whether we are in or out of Europe. I hope that the Conservatives&#039; position is not changed by the rush to the middle ground&#151;or middle waters&#151;that the new leader seems to be embarked on, and that they will maintain a position that is important, because it is an assertion of our national rights. Whatever position is taken, the transfer of power needs to be away from Brussels and down to the national and regional levels so that the industry can shape its own future and has the necessary powers to do so. That is the only way in which to achieve the sustainable industry and sustainable targets that we really need and should be the basis of our discussions today.

I must make it clear that every one of my constituents matters, not least the fishermen. We have a vestige of a once-great industry, but we must hold on to it.

People from Scarborough rarely agree with people from Whitby, but one thing that they do agree on is that the fisheries policy promoted by this Government and, I am sad to say, the previous Government, has not worked. Last week, at Hull Crown court, 10&nbsp;Whitby skippers and two Whitby trawling companies pleaded guilty to 55&nbsp;charges of not properly recording fish landings. The accused represented 90&nbsp;per cent. of the Whitby fleet. For three months during the late summer and autumn of 2003, only 50&nbsp;per cent. of landings were recorded. They were fined &#163;122,800. I must make it clear that there was no suggestion of fraudulent activity in relation to the Inland Revenue; in fact, tax was paid on all the fish landed and harbour dues were paid on the fish that came into Whitby harbour. In fact, DEFRA spent &#163;21,000&nbsp;on forensic accountants to try to determine whether any fraud of that kind might have been committed.
</p>

<a name="stpa_144">I must stress that the people involved are not wealthy men. Evidence given to the court revealed that the income of the skippers was between &#163;8,000&nbsp;and &#163;20,000. The highest-paid skipper involved in the case earned one third of the salary of a Member of Parliament&#151;without the generous pension provisions, I hasten to add. The biggest fine was levied on Arnold Locker of Locker Trawlers. Twenty-one offences involving seven trawlers resulted in Mr. Locker being fined &#163;52,500. I am told that similar offences in French ports would have resulted in warnings being issued.

They faced a 65&nbsp;per cent. cut, due to the recovery plan, and they had already invested in more quota and new vessels. Mr. Locker had a &#163;1.5&nbsp;million overdraft because of such investments in the future of the industry. The Whitby fishermen have also invested in the young people there. We have the best training in the country for fishermen, because the Whitby fishermen have faith in the future. There are also problems relating to days at sea and the increasing pressure on them.
</p>

<a name="51207-14_para5">
<a name="stpa_146">I must stress that those fishermen are not dishonest men. They are decent men who have been driven to dishonesty by the common fisheries policy.

While I cannot condone anyone breaking the law, I think that we can all understand the desperation that they would feel when faced with the loss of their business and their home, and perhaps with the family breakdown that could result from that.

That worked out at &#163;14,000&nbsp;per vessel per month, or roughly &#163;50,000&nbsp;in cash to tide each skipper over. Skippers in the north-east of England got none of that money. In Northern Ireland, 16&nbsp;vessels together received &#163;900,000&nbsp;to tide them over, and fishermen in Wales also got assistance. But England, for once the poor relation&#151;

However, much of the light tackle that has been used for the past 40&nbsp;years to sample the stocks does not perform in the same way behind high-powered trawlers as the old tackle did. May I suggest to the Minister that we have a few years in which the two different types of tackle are used in parallel, so that we can also use modern fishing methods to sample the stocks? In that way, we would be able to pass the figures on from one year to the next.

<a name="stpa_149">I was going to say that the industry in the north-east had been decimated, but we know from our Roman history that decimation was what happened when a legion had not lived up to the standards of the empire and one in 10&nbsp;of its soldiers were taken out. The situation in the north-east is worse than that. I have here the employment figures in UK fishing for the two years in question: 2003&nbsp;and 2004. In Scotland in 2003, the figure stood at 5,276, and in 2004&nbsp;it was 5,275&#151;almost the same. In England and Wales, the figure for 2003&nbsp;was 6,270, and in 2004&nbsp;it was 5,665, a reduction of 9.6&nbsp;per cent. But in the north-east of England, the figure for 2003&nbsp;was 695, and for 2004&nbsp;it was 192. That represents a reduction of 72&nbsp;per cent. in employment in the east coast fishery. That is worse than decimation; that is one in three people going out of the industry in one year because of the effects of the cod recovery plan.

<a name="stpa_151">The meeting that the hon. Gentleman facilitated at DEFRA in August was attended by our fishing leaders, including Mr. Fred Normandale, a Scarborough fisherman, and we tried to come up with a way of facilitating some aid for the Yorkshire coast fishermen within the rules. Yorkshire Forward said that it would make &#163;500,000&nbsp;available to the industry over two years, and it was suggested that that money could be used to fund mandatory safety equipment. I understand the arguments of additionality in this context, because if something is mandatory, there is no real gain for the taxpayer in giving people money to do something that they have to do anyway. However, the industry and Yorkshire Forward thought that that would be at least one way of levering some money in to help the industry. The Minister was very helpful and listened to everything that we said at the meeting, but I am sad to say that, so far, no money has been made available.

<a name="51207-14_para11">
<a name="stpa_152">So, what is the future for the fishing industry on the east coast? Looking back over the debates on the issue, in which my predecessor spoke every year, I see that there was never any good news. I wonder whether there will be a future for the industry. On the bright side, we have seen a renaissance in shellfishing. The port of Bridlington is now entirely a shellfish port. It has been suggested that we are fishing our way down the food chain: we have caught all the big fish and now we are going for the small stuff. The fleet in Scarborough has been switching over to shellfish, and there has been some investment in jobs on shore. Whitby scampi is also becoming famous.

<a name="stpa_153">There is a company in Whitby run by a gentleman called Mike Russell, the coxswain of the Whitby lifeboat, and he knows everything there is to know about lobsters. Everything that I know about them I have learned from Mr. Russell, and he has not told me half of what he knows. Whitby has developed a thriving export market to Spain, but I was interested to hear that only the good lobsters go there. A lobster casts its shell because the meat inside its body is bursting to get out. Those are the lobsters that we send to Spain. When it has cast its shell, it goes off somewhere to hide for a couple of weeks because it is particularly vulnerable at that time. When it comes out again, it is very hungry, so it goes into the first lobster pot that it sees. However, at that stage, it is not crammed full of meat; its shell is in fact quite empty. Those are the lobsters that we tend to eat in Britain. It would be uneconomic to transport those lighter lobsters to Spain anyway. When right hon. and hon. Members visit Spain, they should make sure that they try the lobster, as there is a fair chance that it has come from my constituency. If they visit my constituency, however, they should not pay over the odds for a lobster, because the chances are that it will be one of the outgrades, which, although tasty, do not have as much meat in them as those that they will find in Spain.

<br>&nbsp;<br>on other species that fishermen wanted to catch. Before the election, there was an interesting culinary evening to which local people were invited to sample the velvet crab. I suspect that velvet crabs will not catch on in Whitby, however, because tackling one involves an awful lot of work for not too much meat.

<p>
<a name="51207-14_para14">
<a name="stpa_155">Until a lorry arrives from Spain that can carry a full load of 25&nbsp;tonnes, the problem posed by the velvet crab is storage. Currently, velvet crabs are being stored offshore in nets, which causes the problem of crabs predating on themselves. There is also the problem that if the seas are particularly rough when the lorry from Spain is scheduled to come, the fishermen cannot go out to retrieve the crabs. I am therefore pleased that Scarborough borough council and Yorkshire Forward are working together to get a quayside storage facility for velvet crabs, so that the fishermen can capitalise on something that they once thought worthless but is now becoming a useful source of income. I hope that that will go ahead in the next few months. I also hope that a local businessmen will get a franchise on that operation, because under the tendering rules it will have to go out to widespread tender. I am sure that we would all be disappointed to see that go to a large multinational company. I know that the borough council has that in mind.

<a name="51207-14_para15">
<a name="stpa_156">On the bright side, Whitby also has a vibrant shipbuilding industry. It has a long tradition of shipbuilding, going back to the days of Captain Cook and before. The Parcol yard, which is on the banks of the River Esk, run by a Mr. Jim Morrison, is doing a good trade selling boats, mainly for the shellfish industry, to the Shetlands and Scotland. It seems to be the Scots who have the money to buy the boats. I was pleased to visit the yard shortly after the election, to see the tremendous work going on there, and to see that the tradition of shipbuilding is being carried on in Whitby, which is not the case in many of our traditional shipbuilding ports. Several people have said to me that it detracts somewhat from the traditional, picturesque view of Whitby, but Whitby can be successful only if it is a truly working port, with working fishermen and people working in the shipyard.

<a name="stpa_157">I invite the Minister, when he has time on his hands, which I am sure is not too often, to come to my constituency. I assure him that he will get a warm welcome. If the weather is inclement, we will take him either to the famous Magpie restaurant, where the queues snake around the block, or to Trenchers restaurant, which, many people contend, serves better fish and chips, although it is not as famous. If the weather is clement, I am sure that we can sit on the quayside and eat fish and chips out of the paper in the traditional way. He will then be able to hear first hand what the Whitby fishermen have to say, and he will experience the frustration and anger that they feel. They are proud men, who have worked for many generations in the industry, and who would like their sons and grandsons to go into that industry. Their real concern is that no industry will be left in two, three or four years if assistance is not forthcoming.

We should also consider what Iceland did to take control of its waters and rebuild its industry. Norway, too, has a vibrant industry&#151;a couple of boats from Whitby fish in Norwegian waters and have seen how stocks are recovering there.

Surely now is the time for a different prescription, and for considering how we can take back control of our waters. I do not talk as a little Englander. I was, I am almost ashamed to say, a Member of the European Parliament for five years before entering this proper&#151;as the Chief Whip told me&#151;Parliament. I understand the difficulties of getting agreement in the Council. I understand how, with the presidency, the Minister&#039;s hands will be even more tied than normal. I understand the difficulties of trying to negotiate about fish with Czechs, Slovaks and Hungarians, who could not care less about the North sea or fishing in general, but who will negotiate and build coalitions with other countries, such as Spain and France, if they can get what they want on the agricultural front. It is somewhat bizarre that agriculture and fishing can be traded off against each other. I must declare an interest as a farmer&#151;I am responsible for supplying the chips to go with the fish. It is disappointing that the fishing industry often seems to be the poor relation when the Council decides the way forward, and that fishermen often get the rough end of the deal.

I am sure that they do not like throwing dead fish back into the sea&#151;we have heard about 90&nbsp;per cent. by-catches&#151;as they realise that by doing so they are polluting the marine environment, not contributing to it. If we had a system whereby days at sea were controlled, and fishermen had to land everything that they caught, the industry would feel confident that what it was doing would deliver a future and the sustainable fisheries that the common fisheries policy was meant to achieve.

<a name="stpa_161">I commend the programme set out by my hon. Friend the Member for North Shropshire, and I hope that it will at least form the basis of a way forward. While I know that it has been said that negotiating an opt-out would be impossible, surely, for the sake of fishermen in Scotland, Northern Ireland and the north-east of England, we must try to build a future based on the confidence of the people who must implement the rules, not on a plan in which, in my opinion, the industry has no confidence. It is no wonder that so many fishermen, unfortunately, are ignoring the rules.

It strikes me, however, that there are many physical similarities between him and Lawrie, and I do not think that I have seen them in the same room. Perhaps Lawrie is back in the House, in which case he is warmly welcomed. <i>[Laughter.]</i> He is on the wrong side of the House, but he is welcome.
</p>

<a name="stpa_162">I understand that Lawrie worked hard on behalf of the Scarborough and Whitby fishing industry and always participated in the annual fisheries debate.

That&#039;s not the way to do it.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51207-15_para1">
<a name="stpa_163">Like the hon. Member for Scarborough and Whitby (Mr. Goodwill), I am making my first contribution to the annual fisheries debate. I hope that it will be the first of many, and that during my time in the House the fishing industry of the United Kingdom, and that of Hartlepool in particular, will go from strength to strength. As it is my first fisheries debate I hope that, before I speak of the challenges facing the industry in Hartlepool, the House will indulge me for a moment so that I can briefly set out the history of the fishing industry in my constituency.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51207-15_para2">
<a name="stpa_164">Fishing has a long and proud history in Hartlepool. Before the industrial revolution and the rapid expansion of the town, it was predominantly a fishing settlement. The town received its charter in 1201&nbsp;from King John, not only because of its military and strategic importance as a port against the French, but because of the strength of its fishing fleets and the regular town market&#039;s influence on the commercial activity of the north of England.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51207-15_para3">
<a name="stpa_165">The harshness of the sea and the difficulty of making a living injected a great deal of character into the local people. In his &quot;A History of Hartlepool&quot;, written in the middle of the 19th century, Sir Cuthbert Sharp expressed himself vividly:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_27">&quot;The inhabitants of Hartlepool consist principally of fishermen, a hardy race: their manners are courteous and civil, especially towards strangers; their mode of life and thinking is characterised by stern and unbending independence. They are in general sober, and their luxuries seldom extend beyond the indulgence of fine white cakes. They marry early, have in general large families, and their wives are universally the purse bearers.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="51207-15_para4">
<a name="stpa_166">Reading that, I know that I have Hartlepool blood flowing through my veins.

<a name="stpa_167">Sir Cuthbert went on


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_28">&quot;The women perform the most laborious part of the occupation on shore. They are seen to be on the beach waiting the return of the cobles and carry the lines home; the task of baiting is performed by them, and they likewise have to procure the mussels from the scalps&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="51207-15_para6">
<a name="stpa_168">Within living memory&#151;although not mine&#151;it was possible to leave the pub, &quot;The Fisherman&#039;s Arms&quot;, and walk on to the fish quay, where a fishwife, shawl on her head and knife in her hand, would give people a cod slice from her pram while they waited. That was a good meal, certainly on a Friday.
</p>

<p>

<br>&nbsp;<br>and the growth of heavy manufacturing, we as a community have not been as reliant upon the sea and fishing as other constituencies may have been. Nevertheless, in the oldest part of Hartlepool, the headland, we still have a strong and proud fishing community that catches fish that is renowned for its quality. Not for nothing is Hartlepool fish served at the tables of the finest seafood restaurants in the north of England. Some, such as Ocean and Big Mussel&#151;along with Don Bee&#039;s and Verrall&#039;s fish-and-chip shops&#151;are in Hartlepool itself. We have a high quality industry with high added value, dating back for many centuries. I want to make sure, during my time in the House, that it remains sustainable and profitable in the long term.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51207-15_para8">
<a name="stpa_170">In the summer, I met representatives of the Hartlepool fishing community. They raised concerns with me, which I passed on to the Minister in the form of written parliamentary questions. The four broad themes that I raised in those questions form the basis of my speech.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51207-15_para9">
<a name="stpa_171">I asked the Minister about the use of larger mesh nets as a means of enabling younger fish to escape and repopulate the seas. I was trying to ascertain the long-term viability of fish stocks in the North sea, particularly cod. Cod has been the staple catch of Hartlepool fishermen for centuries, but today&#039;s fishermen confirm from experience that there has been a massive decline. That was reiterated by the Minister in a reply during last month&#039;s Environment, Food and Rural Affairs questions. I understand that if we take a baseline of 100&nbsp;for the year 1963&nbsp;in the North sea, current cod stocks amount to about 25.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51207-15_para10">
<a name="stpa_172">Fishermen in my constituency vehemently deny that the shortage has been caused by overfishing. Quotas have been too low for too long. The fishermen, many of whom have been at sea for decades, tell me that they detect a change in the habits of the cod. Essentially, they are migrating further north, presumably to find appropriate plankton for food. Evidence on the ground&#151;as it were&#151;seems to support research done in the past few years, which suggests that global warming, and a subsequent reduction in the supply of appropriate plankton, is having a knock-on effect on cod supply. I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Great Grimsby that the shortage has not necessarily been caused by overfishing; it could be due to environmental changes.
</p>








<p><a name="st_87"><a name="51207-15_spnew1"><b> Mr. Carmichael </b> 
: I am familiar with the arguments about environmental changes and their impacts, and indeed I have advanced many of them in the past. My difficulty, which the hon. Gentleman may now share, lies with increasing evidence of a growing stock of young cod along the east coast, such as we last saw in, I believe, 1996. That demonstrates that neither the hon. Gentleman nor I, nor even any of the clever scientists, really know what is happening. However, does the hon. Gentleman agree that it is now imperative for the spawning grounds to be protected at all costs?

<p><a name="st_88"><a name="51207-15_spnew2"><b> Mr. Wright: </b> 
 I entirely agree. I want to go on ensuring that the Hartlepool cod fishing industry has a vibrant future, and it is vital to protect as much of it as possible.

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_29">&quot;the UK whitefish fleet is too large to be profitable in the long term .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. we estimate that reductions of at least 13&nbsp;per cent. of whitefish capacity is needed to ensure long term profitability&quot;.</p>

<p>
<a name="51207-15_para13">
<a name="stpa_175">Given what has been said, I understand that fishermen cannot catch stock that is not there. That brings me to my next point, which concerns diversification&#151;not only in the industry, but in interests outside fishing. My fishermen tell me that there is a massive stock of shellfish, particularly prawns, in the North sea off the coast of Hartlepool. We are currently developing the velvet crab industry, which was mentioned by the hon. Member for Scarborough and Whitby. I hope that the Minister will take that into account when considering the negotiation of total allowable catches and quotas in Europe that will permit the fishermen in my constituency to continue to make a living.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51207-15_para14">
<a name="stpa_176">My area in the north-east is all too familiar with the dangers of failing to diversify. The collapse of heavy manufacturing industry in the 1980s, for example, had a devastating effect on communities in my region, and we are only now beginning to pick up the pieces. The town of Hartlepool is regenerating itself as a major tourist and leisure destination, supported by our jewel in the crown, a world-class marina. I do not wish to see the fishing industry in Hartlepool &quot;Disneyfied&quot;, as I want it to remain a true, real and vibrant industry, but I think there is an opportunity to expand the role of fishing within the leisure and tourism sectors. There are plans, for instance, for a fish restaurant on the Kafiga landings at the headland, which should give an additional boost to tourism.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51207-15_para15">
<a name="stpa_177">The Minister may recall that in his reply to my question about diversification in the summer, he mentioned that his Department tasked regional development agencies with boosting rural economic development. While I welcome that&#151;particularly as I was employed by One NorthEast&#151;I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Great Grimsby that RDAs could do more to stress the importance of fishing ports. Will the Minister tell us in his winding-up speech what additional pressure he is placing on relevant development agencies to boost the fishing industries in their areas?
</p>

<p>
<a name="51207-15_para16">
<a name="stpa_178">The Minister also mentioned in his reply that the new EU grant scheme for fisheries, under negotiation in the Agriculture and Fisheries Council, would from 2007&nbsp;include powers to grant aid for diversification from fisheries. I should like to know what progress is being made and whether the recent debate in Europe on the future of the EU budget has had any impact on that work.

<a name="stpa_179">May I mention the increase in fuel prices in recent months and years? Other Members have mentioned that, too. It is having a huge effect on fishermen, as well as others. When I raised the issue with the Minister, he mentioned that DEFRA officials have met representatives of the fishing industry to discuss the increases in fuel prices and how the industry can respond. I would be grateful if the Minister could give the House an update on those discussions.

<a name="stpa_180">The Chancellor&#039;s pre-Budget report this week mentioned an increase in tax rates on oil companies. I know that there will be a long queue of interested parties who would like to get their hands on that increased tax revenue, but does the Minister think that additional support will be provided to those in the fishing industry whose margins are extremely tight? Fluctuations in fuel prices can mean the difference between profit and loss.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51207-15_para19">
<a name="stpa_181">Another factor in ensuring profitability is bureaucracy. That is seen by the Hartlepool fishermen as a major concern and something that takes them an inordinate time to process.

He stated that reduction of bureaucracy and simplification of the legislation was a huge priority for his Department. I welcome the improvement in application procedures for the fisheries grant scheme.

<a name="stpa_182">The Minister also mentioned in his reply that work is going on between his Department and the National Federation of Fishermen&#039;s Organisations on a joint research project to identify specific reforms. I think that he mentioned that in his remarks today. I welcome that and look forward to the industry, particularly that in Hartlepool, reaping the rewards. Also, simplification of EU law is seen as a priority for this country&#039;s presidency of the EU, and I understand that an action plan is due by the end of the year.

<a name="stpa_186">Sea fishing is maintained all around Northern Ireland&#039;s coastline, but the main commercial activity is centred around three fishing villages, namely, Portavogie in the north, Ardglass in the middle and Kilkeel in the south of the County Down coast. The fishing industry is in reality the community in those villages, and the community is the fishing industry. The two are inextricably linked. Therefore, we can understand what a decline in that industry does to the community. Before I refer to some of the recommendations that those fishermen would like the Minister to take cognisance of, let me give hon. Members some background.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51207-16_para3">
<a name="stpa_187">Traditionally, the industry sustained itself and the fish stocks by being able to conduct what was known as a mixed fishery, targeting three main stock groups. For about a third of the year, the fleet would target herring; for another third of the year, it would target whitefish; and for the final third, it would target nephrops, or prawns. Then fisheries managers intervened. Back in 1980, temporary closed areas were introduced in the herring fishery. Twenty-five years later, those temporary closures are still with the industry. One might ask, what has resulted from those temporary closures? For the vast majority of fishermen, the herring fishery disappeared. The local fleet then had to divert its efforts to the remaining fisheries: whitefish and prawns.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51207-16_para4">
<a name="stpa_188">Then, at the beginning of the 1990s, the fisheries managers decided that too much effort was being exerted upon the whitefish stocks. Reduced TACs in the Irish sea were the order of the day, but those were compounded in 2000&nbsp;by the first so-called cod recovery programme to be implemented in EU waters. The temporary area closures were complemented by the imposition of effort controls in 2004. The Irish sea remains the only EU waters where so-called cod recovery combines area closures with effort control.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51207-16_para5">
<a name="stpa_189">In 1999, there was a fleet of over 40&nbsp;Northern Ireland trawlers targeting whitefish for most of the year. Today, the number of trawlers targeting whitefish can be measured in single figures. Consequently, white fisheries managers now give lip service to the mixed fishery model. In fact, the traditional mixed fishery in the Irish sea, which served both the stocks and the industry so well for decades, has been managed into a single species fishery.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51207-16_para6">
<a name="stpa_190">Prawns are by far the most important single species to the entire local fishing industry, both at sea and onshore, accounting for more than half the value of all fish and shellfish landed in the Province. Prawns are the bedrock of the local fish processing sector. They account for the vast majority of fishery exports to Europe. That sustains most of the processing sector jobs and has a worth of over &#163;70&nbsp;million annually to the local economy. Yet despite the fact that fishery managers have cornered the

<br>&nbsp;<br>industry into the single species fishery, they are still not happy&#151;they want to go further. How much further can they go?
</p>

<p>
<a name="51207-16_para7">
<a name="stpa_191">I am led to believe that the Commission is minded to impose additional management measures on that industry. There are rumours about further reductions in the number of days prawn boats spend at sea. Additional unproven technical conservation measures in the TAC persist and are counter to the science on that stock, which confirms what fishermen have said for years&#151;if anything, the size of the prawn stock is on the increase.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51207-16_para8">
<a name="stpa_192">Many fishermen hold out for the future; they look for a new dawn. Fishermen, it should be remembered, are just like everyone else&#151;they are business men; ordinary people desiring to make a living. Each owns assets worth several thousands, if not millions, of pounds. Does anyone really believe that if fishermen did not think that there was a future in fishing the Irish sea, they would be continuing to invest in the industry, despite the problems? I congratulate those who have maintained that hope and encourage Government to defend them in the negotiations in the Fisheries Council later in December.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51207-16_para9">
<a name="stpa_193">Fishermen want to safeguard fish stocks&#151;after all, they are their future. Our local fisheries organisation is currently managing various projects, utilising European Union and national funding, that are designed to improve the selectivity of fishing gear. In partnership with local fisheries scientists, they are conducting an attempt to identify simple measures that can be used by the local prawn fleet to minimise discards in its prawn trawls. Fishermen are developing a new partnership with local fisheries scientists to improve data, which, in turn, will improve the science and should improve fishery management in the area. Those are commendable exercises. Fishermen are working with scientists and others in the industry and the Department to try to achieve goals.I simply hope that, in the meantime, the forthcoming Fisheries Councils do not scuttle that work by imposing more meaningless measures on the local industry.

Two years ago, I was lobster fishing, which the hon. Member for Scarborough and Whitby (Mr. Goodwill) mentioned. When lobster fishing, if one sees a good lobster that is going to Spain and one knocks its claws off, it cannot be sold. We also fished brown crabs and the violent little velvet crab. I admire anybody who eats velvet crabs. I am sure that they are tasty and they should command a higher price. I hope that they will in the run-up to Christmas.

Many co-workers from the islands have been on holiday with their colleagues in the Czech Republic and Poland.

<a name="stpa_203">It is useful to highlight the problems that underpin our annual debates on fishing. Recently, the Prime Minister, while abandoning the rebate, has tried to attack and target the common agricultural policy. Perhaps he should have looked at the common fisheries policy. Have the Government looked seriously at the pros and cons of replacing the CFP, which has many problems, with other fishery structures? Of course, no one is saying that we should not have international negotiations on and co-operation between fisheries, but should it be on the current basis? Instead of this horse-trading, would it not be better for nations to be up-front with each other? For instance, why, west of the Hebrides, where there is no overlap, are France and Spain hoovering up many of our fish? I leave that with the Minister.

<br>&nbsp;<br>The demand for a 30&nbsp;per cent. increase is unrealistic, and if it is not achieved, cuts will come into play for other species. Now is definitely the time for a full re-evaluation. The Minister might say that it is tactically the wrong time, but it is strategically the right time for fishermen. We need to do away with the annual emotional rollercoaster ride that is caused, in the main, by the failure of the CFP. This year, there are projected cuts of 15&nbsp;per cent. for cod, 13&nbsp;per cent. for haddock, 15&nbsp;per cent. for saithe, 15&nbsp;per cent. for whiting and 2.5&nbsp;per cent. for plaice. The latter figure is attributable to the particular interest of the Dutch in plaice; they are lobbying quite fiercely in that regard. The CFP clearly has knock-on effects for many other fisheries.

 This is the fifth annual fishing debate that I have taken part in since being elected to the House and the issues raised are depressingly familiar. They include the usual background of the failure of the cod recovery plan and the knock-on effects for other species. The aims of our fisheries policy should be to create the conditions in which stocks at risk can recover, and to maintain stocks at safe biological limits, so that we avoid the need to take drastic measures to save a particular species. It is also important to ensure the continuing viability of the industry both at sea and on land, and in the many local communities that depend on it.

<a name="stpa_209">There is little doubt that the common fisheries policy as currently structured has failed. It has failed to achieve any of its key objectives or to conserve fish stocks, most obviously of cod. I agree with those Members who say that a full review of the cod recovery plan is required; imposing more of the same measures has little chance of success. We need to move away from the annual round of negotiations and horse-trading in Brussels at this time of year. Ideally, we should move toward a system of regional management committees.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51207-17_para1">
<a name="stpa_210">The current policy has failed mainly because it is far too centralised and run from Brussels. Decisions are taken in a forum that is far too remote from the fishermen and others affected by such decisions.

<br>&nbsp;<br>Whereas the Norwegian delegation at the EU-Norway talks allows its fishermen into those talks, other European fishermen are kept outside. Before Sweden joined the EU, Swedish fishermen were able to take part in the talks; once Sweden joined, they were ushered out of the room. We need to involve fishermen much more in these discussions. I also agree that we need to look at the fishing year; the current system leads to a very rushed series of negotiations at this time of year.

The main fishery in the waters off my constituency is prawns. In fact, the prawn fishery is now the most valuable fishery in Scotland. There is universal agreement that prawn stocks are healthy, although it is true that in certain areas, at certain times, there is a more than negligible cod by-catch. However, the cod spawning grounds have been identified and a box has been drawn at the entrance to Clyde, partly in Scottish waters and partly in Northern Ireland waters, in which trawling for prawns 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>7 Dec 2005 : Column 921</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>is prohibited during the cod spawning season from 14&nbsp;February until 30&nbsp;April. As long as the cod spawning box is avoided between those dates, the Clyde Fishermen&#039;s Association insists that the cod by-catch when fishing for prawns is negligible, but its fishing effort is restricted. This year the Commission has proposed further cuts in days at sea for nephrops trawlers in the west of Scotland area. The Clyde Fishermen&#039;s Association does not see the need for that further restriction because its cod by-catch is negligible as long as the box is avoided at the specific times of the year.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51207-17_para6">
<a name="stpa_215">The views of the CFA on the cod by-catch are backed up by a written answer that I received from the Minister&#039;s predecessor, now the Minister for Climate Change and the Environment, as long ago as 7&nbsp;November 2002. It stated:

<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_30">&quot;We have already reminded the Commission of our view&#151;substantiated last year by detailed scientific analysis&#151;that curbing nephrops fishing brings minimal benefit to cod.&quot;&#151;[<i>Official Report</i>, 7&nbsp;November 2002; Vol. 392, c. 584W.]</p>

<p>
<a name="51207-17_para8">
<a name="stpa_217">This year, there was some good news from the Commission in that it proposes an increase of 39&nbsp;per cent. in the west of Scotland nephrops TAC. It is very important that the Council agrees to that measure. Last year, the published scientific data showed that the nephrops TAC for the west of Scotland could be increased by 30&nbsp;per cent. without any risk to cod stocks, but only a much smaller increase was allowed. I am pleased that this year the Commission has taken the scientific advice and proposed a much larger increase.

The association makes a plea for simplicity and continuity in the regulations. Sometimes, due to their circumstances, individual fishermen suffer greatly from the regulations. The association gave me two examples of such hard-luck cases. I plan to write to the Minister about them in more detail, so I shall only summarise them.

<a name="stpa_219">The owner of a scallop boat wants to convert his vessel so that he can fish for queen scallops, but the scallop-fishing gear on his boat falls outside the regulations. Queen scallops also fall outside European regulations but the gear that he requires to fish for them is caught by European regulations designed to minimise cod by-catch. Because he has no record of prawn fishing in 2002, he cannot to convert his gear, yet the local association tells me that it would be almost impossible to catch a cod with that gear.

<a name="stpa_220">The second case involves a Campbeltown fisherman who bought a vessel from the North sea white fish fleet in 2002&nbsp;with the intention of converting it to a prawn trawler and using it in the west of Scotland zone. However, just after he bought the trawler the new days at sea regulations were published, whose effect is that the days at sea applying to that vessel are not the days at sea that apply to the west of Scotland nephrops fleet, but the

I am not sure of the logic of imposing days at sea restrictions for a species in one zone that were meant to apply to a different species in a different zone. That fisherman was caught out by regulations that did not apply when he bought the vessel, but had retrospective effect to the time before he bought it. That appears unfair to what must be only a small number of fishermen. The fishermen&#039;s association told me that as the regulations are European, the Scottish Executive have no flexibility, so I hope that the Minister will investigate those cases.

<br>&nbsp;<br>industry, but if there is any such effect, the situation will only get worse. Even if there is no such effect, the situation will not get any better. I contrast that, as other hon. Members have done, with the situation in France and Spain, whose Governments have been able to give their fishing industries some support by one means or another.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51207-17_para16">
<a name="stpa_225">I reiterate my concern, which I expressed to the Minister in an intervention, about the contract for search and rescue helicopters, one of which is based at Sumburgh airport in my constituency. I am now due to meet the director of the Maritime and Coastguard Agency tomorrow&#151;the meeting had been scheduled for 13&nbsp;December, but I then discovered that the contract was due to be placed on 12&nbsp;December&#151;and I shall put my concerns directly to him then. However, I can tell the Minister and the House that my concerns are very real.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51207-17_para17">
<a name="stpa_226">There are unresolved issues about the suitability of the aircraft, but I return to the point that I also made to the Minister that it is essential that the terms and conditions of the existing staff are transferred when the new contract is awarded. It is the skill, courage and expertise of the crews of those helicopters that is vital. The reason why that is of such concern to the fishing industry in particular is that barely a month goes by in my constituency without a fishing boat getting into trouble and ending up being towed into Lerwick harbour, and the helicopter at Sumburgh, Oscar Charlie, frequently plays a crucial role in the rescue. If we do not get that contract right, I very much fear that the commencement of these proceedings in future years will feature even more tales of loss of life and injury.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51207-17_para18">
<a name="stpa_227">I want to say a few words about the cod recovery programme, which has been with us for a number of years. Of course, on one side of the equation is the reduction in effort and on the other is a growth in cod stocks. We have met our targets on the reduction of effort. That has been an exceptionally painful process, especially in heavily fishing-dependent communities such as Shetland. I have lectured the Minister on the reduction in the Shetland white fish fleet in the past, so I shall spare him it today. The reduction has been massive, but there has not yet been any substantial evidence of a recovery in the stocks of cod. However, I enter the caveat that all hon. Members have applied today&#151;which is, of course, that exceptionally wobbly science seems to be associated with fisheries.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51207-17_para19">
<a name="stpa_228">I remind the Minister of the point that I made to the hon. Member for Hartlepool: there seems to be some evidence of a good recruitment of young cod along the east coast of the United Kingdom. That is not unknown; there was a similar situation in 1996, or perhaps 1995. Unfortunately, as a result of the fishing practices at the time that involved smaller mesh sizes, especially for the nephrop sector, the immature class was slaughtered. We now have a window of opportunity, albeit a small one. The spawning grounds with immature cod must be identified and protected, because this might be our last chance. We can only speculate on the impact of climate change on cod stocks, but if we have the opportunity to improve the situation, we must not allow it to pass.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51207-17_para20">
<a name="stpa_229">I add my voice to those of other hon. Members who have said that this is a point at which we should be reviewing the cod recovery programme. We must examine the targets that have been set. Is a 30&nbsp;per cent. increase in the spawning stock biomass year on year 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>7 Dec 2005 : Column 924</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>realistic or achievable? Is the time frame in which we should achieve the targets realistic? Should we now be considering a more evolutionary approach?
</p>

<p>
<a name="51207-17_para21">
<a name="stpa_230">When we review the cod recovery programme, there must be a central role for the regional advisory councils, especially the North sea regional advisory council. The Minister must be aware that when the RACs were set up, they were greeted with a degree of scepticism&#151;I think that he used the word &quot;cynicism&quot; earlier, but I hope that &quot;scepticism&quot; is nearer the mark. It is fair to say that the jury is still out on RACs in fishing communities and the fishing industry. However, there is a need to nurture the RACs for the benefit of those of us who hope for a regional or decentralised structure of fisheries management.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51207-17_para22">
<a name="stpa_231">I was most concerned to hear today from the lobby from the Scottish Fishermen&#039;s Federation and the National Federation of Fishermen&#039;s Organisations that the November meeting of the North sea regional advisory council was not given the figures on which the Council will make its judgment in December. There was not even an oral report to the Council from the Commission. If RACs such as that for the North sea are ever to do the job that the Minister and I would like them to do, they will need rather better treatment than that. I suggest that the first step towards giving them better treatment and improving their standing and stature would be to task them with the review of the cod recovery programme in the North sea.

<a name="51207-17_para23">
<a name="stpa_232">I want to say a few words about black fish landings. I note that the hon. Member for North Shropshire (Mr. Paterson) has returned to the Chamber, so I caution him about the terms in which we all should speak about the matter. It is exceptionally difficult to make estimates about the situation&#151;it is like proving a negative. The problem is more acute in different parts of the country at different times of year due to the circumstances that arise because of different quotas that are set. Any bold or sweeping statement will almost inevitably be out of date by the time that it is made, yet will be damaging to the wider interests of the fishing industries of the United Kingdom.

<p><a name="st_101"><a name="51207-18_spnew0"><b> Mr. Goodwill: </b> 
 Does the hon. Gentleman agree that the two Shetland-based fishermen who pleaded guilty to landing illegally 7,600&nbsp;tonnes of fish in Denmark without declaring it to fisheries officials, fixing log sheets and making &#163;3.4&nbsp;million in the process could be described as being involved in black fish?
</p>








<p><a name="st_102"><a name="51207-18_spnew1"><b> Mr. Carmichael: </b> 
 I have no difficulty in saying that that would generally come under the term of black fish landings. The hon. Gentleman refers to the Altaire case, which I have followed closely for obvious reasons as both gentlemen in question are my constituents.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51207-18_para0">
<a name="stpa_233">In the Altaire case, the criminal justice system and the confiscation procedures have been rigorous and have been followed. If that case is cast up to the Minister when he pleads our case in Brussels, he can point to our criminal justice system and confiscation procedures and say, &quot;We have been rigorous. We have made our policing work.&quot; If there is an absence of similar cases in other jurisdictions within the United Kingdom, that should not be taken as evidence of their not having a problem; rather, it should be evidence of the fact that 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>7 Dec 2005 : Column 925</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>they are less rigorous in policing fisheries. I asked the Minister about that not long ago in Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs questions, and he has spoken about it. I hope that the case in my constituency and that in the constituency of the hon. Member for Scarborough and Whitby will be taken as evidence of the fact that we are rigorous in our policing and that such cases are not necessarily indicative of any wider problem.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51207-18_para1">
<a name="stpa_234">It has long been my view that we are among the most enthusiastic of enforcers of fisheries law. I remember discussing that with the hon. Gentleman&#039;s predecessor, who took the same view. Having worked in the criminal courts as a solicitor and having acted in many fish landing cases, I have a great deal of sympathy for many of the skippers who get caught out. Very often, it is the result of mere sloppiness. On occasions, it is because the nature and complexity of the fisheries regulations with which skippers are expected to comply is such that it would be barely safe to set to sea without first completing an LLB; people need to be qualified lawyers before they can be expected to find their way around the full range and complexity of the regulations. However, I did not come across many solicitors queuing up to go to sea during my time as a practising solicitor&#151;indeed, I have not come across many since I came into the House. That might be why cases continue to arise.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51207-18_para2">
<a name="stpa_235">The Minister finished his speech more abruptly than I thought he would. I had hoped that he would come on to say a few more things about the upcoming Council. Again, I echo the comments of other hon. Members about the fishing year. I commend Commissioner Borg for being prepared to say that he will consider it. Along with that&#151;this thought came to my mind as I listened to the hon. Member for Great Grimsby (Mr. Mitchell)&#151;we should revisit the question of multi-annual quotas. No matter what point in the year we pick to set the quota for the next year, it still leaves the industry able only to plan one year ahead. I know of no other industry that would allow its businesses to organise things in that way. There has to be a longer-term vision for the industry, especially when&#151;hopefully&#151;stocks across the border are more stable. That will allow for proper financial planning, which, frankly, is next to impossible as things stand.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51207-18_para3">
<a name="stpa_236">I should also pay tribute to Commissioner Borg for his performance as commissioner, which is infinitely to be preferred to that of his predecessor. I was privileged to lead a delegation of fishermen from Shetland and Orkney to meet him in April&#151;I suspect that I would not have got within a country mile of his predecessor&#151;and he was open with them, he engaged with them, he listened, and he was sympathetic. That is a significant advance. He has undertaken to visit Shetland, or the northern isles, in the course of next year, and I hope to see him. I know that he will be most welcome. I am delighted that Ross Finnie will be visiting Shetland next week to take the soundings of the industry. I pay tribute to the way in which Mr. Finnie, my colleague, has taken the time and trouble to engage with, to listen to and to advance the case of Scotland&#039;s fishermen.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51207-18_para4">
<a name="stpa_237">The proposal to which we have not given sufficient attention is that of days at sea. As I understand it, the proposal of the Commission, in the round, is a reduction 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>7 Dec 2005 : Column 926</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>from 108&nbsp;days to 104. That in itself will be highly problematic for the white fish fleet in my constituency. The situation is even worse than it might at first have appeared. I am told that in the past year, fishermen in my constituency on white fish boats were able to take advantage of an extra 12&nbsp;days that was made available to them. That was one day a month, as a result of the elective measures on administrative penalties. We still have the administrative penalties as part of the regime, but there is no question about the days that go with them.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51207-18_para5">
<a name="stpa_238">When the Minister replies, will he tell me that he will give some priority to ensuring that the carrot-and-stick approach is still on offer and that he will not return home from Brussels without the extra 12&nbsp;days? If he fails to do so, the white fish industry in my constituency will be left 16&nbsp;days a year down from an already exceptionally low base. That threatens the viability of the more marginal boats in my constituency.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51207-18_para6">
<a name="stpa_239">May I strengthen the resolve of the Minister on the haddock quota? It is proposed that there should be a 13&nbsp;per cent. cut, which will cause severe hardship. I accept that some progress has already been made, but a 13&nbsp;per cent. cut&#151;an improved position though it may be&#151;will cause exceptional difficulty. There are the difficulties of science, and the haddock supply highlights that better than almost anything else. Last year, on the basis of the data available to ICES, the spawning stock biomass for haddock was calculated at about 400,000&nbsp;tonnes. At the EU-Norway talks earlier in the year, that same data was remodelled to give a spawning stock biomass of 280,000&nbsp;tonnes. That shows the exceptional difficulties that one experiences when assessing the credibility of the science that is available on fisheries stocks. When the remodelled figures were produced, one could hear in Shetland the glee from Norway. There was no doubt that Norway&#039;s hand would be significantly strengthened in the EU-Norway negotiations.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51207-18_para7">
<a name="stpa_240">My final substantive topic is industrial fishing. Like every other Member, I welcomed enthusiastically the closure of the industrial fishery this year. I note with exceptional pleasure the recommendation that there should be a zero total allowable catch for sand eel and pout. There is no doubt in my mind that industrial fishing of the sort that we have seen for so long is the antithesis of sustainable fishery. If evidence is needed of that, the Minister need not just have regard to fish stocks, where there has been an impact. Along the cliffs of Shetland and Orkney, the sea bird population has been decimated. I recall speaking to constituents on Foula earlier this year, who were broken-hearted given the way in which the breeding stock of the various seabirds has disappeared in recent years. Like fish stocks, breeding stocks for birds, once lost, are difficult to restore.

<a name="51207-18_para8">
<a name="stpa_241">Hon. Members have suggested that, as president, the UK is in danger of playing too fairly. There has been talk of cricket&#151;a game about which I know little and care less. I acknowledge that there is a balance to be struck when we assume the presidency, but we should not allow our role and fairness as president to damage our own industry and national interests. Instead of taking cricket as his model, may I commend to the Minister a splendid game that is played every year in my

<a name="stpa_242">Three hundred grown men&#151;perhaps more&#151;play a traditional ball game in which they take a ball from the market cross in the centre of Kirkwall either up the town or down the town, where the game ends in the harbour. It lasts for hours. When the Ba&#039; went up on new year&#039;s day, it was almost dark. It is a tremendously spirited game that is keenly contested. Less generous observers have described it as a rolling breach of the peace. May I suggest to the Minister that, if he wants to train his officials, he could send them to take part in this year&#039;s Ba&#039;, rather than sending them to play cricket? They would be most welcome&#151;I have no doubt that the fishermen in my constituency who play in the Ba&#039; every year would be most interested and would give them the closest possible attention in the middle of the scrum.

<p><a name="st_103"><a name="51207-18_spnew2"><b> Mr. Lindsay Hoyle  (Chorley) (Lab):</b> 
 This is an important debate. In case people are wondering, I do not represent a fishing port, but my constituency is dependent on good-quality fishing stocks. We have good fish and chip shops in Chorley and good restaurants that serve quality fish. We also have good supermarkets, as well as Chorley market, where the stalls specialise in wet fish. My constituency therefore has a great history of selling quality fish. We must ensure that there are fishing stocks around the UK and successful fishing ports, so that fishermen can go out and secure the catches that my constituents need.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51207-18_para10">
<a name="stpa_243">I have tabled early-day motions 945&nbsp;and 1108, which express concern about illegal fishing and other fishing practices. The cost of illegal fishing is about &#163;680&nbsp;million. Spanish fishing vessels buy a flag of convenience from a landlocked country&#151;other countries are involved, but Spain is one of the worst offenders&#151;and use it to get round the rules on trawling, which is not acceptable. The country of origin does not take action against such usage, so the problem must be dealt with quickly, as it is a major burden for our fishermen. They are playing cricket&#151;a great game&#151;but while they play by the rules, other countries, especially Spain, abuse them. We must stop that. We expect the Minister to take action against illegal fishing and abolish flags of convenience.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51207-18_para11">
<a name="stpa_244">Another problem is Spanish vessels putting out long lines and capturing sharks off the coast of Ireland, Scotland and Norway. That is a tragedy and is having a great effect on the sharks that used to live there quite happily. Spanish vessels put out a long line and, to get best value from it, the line can be out for weeks. Lines have even been known to be out for months. Not only does that devastate the shark stock in the area, but because the vessels do not come round often enough, half the catch is allowed to rot on the line and is eventually discarded. We must deal with that problem too.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51207-18_para12">
<a name="stpa_245">I hope the Minister will take action. We know that the fishing vessels in question are Spanish. We know that marine experts in the United Kingdom are concerned, as are their Norwegian and Irish counterparts. We have heard a great deal today and we expect a great deal. Progress can be achieved. I know the Minister takes on

<br>&nbsp;<br>board his responsibilities. When we go forward, I want to know that we will have a strong voice, a positive voice and a supportive voice for the fishing industry around the UK. We need to take action against other nations that are operating illegally.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51207-18_para13">
<a name="stpa_246">I want the Minister to ensure that the good people of Chorley can expect Chorley market to keep selling a variety of quality fish that has been landed legally by fishermen around the UK, and to ensure that we have long-term fish stocks. That is what it is about&#151;ensuring that we have a fishing industry for the long term. Let us not let other people plunder our stocks. Let us nurture them, and let us look after the fishing industry that has served us well for hundreds of years. Let us not lose that, and let us ensure that quality fish continues to come to Chorley.

<p><a name="st_104"><a name="51207-19_spnew0"><b> Mr. Alex Salmond  (Banff and Buchan) (SNP):</b> 
 I welcome the full-day fishing debate and congratulate the Minister on having secured it with the Whips. It has given us the opportunity to listen to the hon. Member for Great Grimsby (Mr. Mitchell) in full flight, and to the hon. Member for Orkney and Shetland (Mr. Carmichael), whose contributions to such debates are usually truncated, but on this occasion he managed to give us the full range of his extensive knowledge of the industry.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51207-19_para0">
<a name="stpa_247">The debate also allowed us to listen for the first time to my hon. Friend the Member for Na h-Eileanan an Iar (Mr. MacNeil)&#151;<i>[Interruption.]</i> That is the Western Isles, for the benefit of the hon. Member for Chorley (Mr. Hoyle). Na h-Eileanan an Iar is the parliamentary constituency. It is said that in the run-up to election night, I practised for some time in the expectation that we would win the constituency. Expecting to be challenged on its pronunciation, I am assured by my Gaelic friends that I managed to carry it off with reasonable aplomb, as though I had been doing it all my days.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51207-19_para1">
<a name="stpa_248">We welcome my hon. Friend to the proceedings. He is, as far as I know, the only working fisherman in the House. He is also the only working crofter in the House. Some people in the Western Isles would say he was the only worker in the House. It is useful to have in our debates someone who has done the job, done the business&#151;done the fishing that we debate and care about. All of us who represent fishing constituencies care about the industry. There is no prouder boast in politics than to say that one is a fishing MP. It is an industry to which we owe our dedication, not least because of the fatalities and casualties&#151;the real price of fish, as the Minister rightly reminded us as the start of the debate.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51207-19_para2">
<a name="stpa_249">I shall make five points of detail before drawing a few broad conclusions to reinforce some of the arguments that other hon. Members have made so expertly in the debate. First, as I have said to the Minister, I am concerned about the aggregation of white fish licences in the pelagic sector. The hon. Member for Chorley has discussed flagged boats, although I am not certain whether flags of convenience are the same in the fishing industry as they are in the merchant marine.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51207-19_para3">
<a name="stpa_250">The pelagic fleet in England is very small and consists of only two boats, both of which are flagged and both of which are Dutch owned. Given that we are generally 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>7 Dec 2005 : Column 929</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>hostile to flagged boats, it is amazing that such interests always seem to come out on the right side of any decisions. I have never understood why that outfit has such lobbying power&#151;perhaps it advances its arguments expertly or perhaps DEFRA officials listen especially acutely&#151;but it has come out on the right side of a change in the pelagic sector.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51207-19_para4">
<a name="stpa_251">I accept that there are other winners in the sector, but there are also potential losers. I know that the Minister will treat with great seriousness any change in regulation that might discriminate&#151;no doubt unintentionally&#151;against one fisherman as opposed to another, because the public purse has paid a heavy penalty for perceived discrimination in regulation. I hope that the Minister will examine the matter to see whether a measure can be found to ensure that all boats in the pelagic sector are&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;given equal opportunities in the changes on aggregation.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51207-19_para5">
<a name="stpa_252">Secondly, as the Minister has said, at a time of scarce fishing opportunities it is important to maximise any opportunities, so I am therefore puzzled by the western mackerel quota. After a few years of precautionary reductions, advice from the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea suggested that there was scope for a 15&nbsp;per cent. increase in catch, but the Commission advises a 5&nbsp;per cent. increase. Will the Minister elaborate on why that apparent opportunity has not been seized in a difficult year?
</p>

<p>
<a name="51207-19_para6">
<a name="stpa_253">Thirdly, there is the question of who holds quota in the industry. It is self-evident that at a time of economic pressure on the industry, we must ensure that all available returns from fishing are kept within the fishing sector and, so far as it is possible, that no finance leaks elsewhere. Because of the downturn in the white fish sector, decommissioning and the huge pressure experienced by my constituents and many others around the coastline of Scotland and elsewhere, the banks inherited a substantial part of the quota. Of course, the banks did not fish themselves and rented out the quota to working fisherman, which represents a further leakage of returns from the industry.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51207-19_para7">
<a name="stpa_254">Earlier this year, I joined a delegation from the producer organisations to visit the Royal Bank of Scotland, an organisation that has done incredibly well since I ceased to be its economist a number of years ago&#151;I am sure that I helped to build the foundations for its future success. In conversation with the Royal Bank of Scotland, I argued that it is not stable in the medium term for financial sector institutions to own quota and make revenue from renting it to the industry.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51207-19_para8">
<a name="stpa_255">I note with pleasure that the Royal Bank of Scotland recently sold its quota to fish-selling offices in Scotland. Personally, I would have preferred the quota to go the producer organisations, but none the less the quota is back within the fisheries sector. Some quota is still held outwith the fisheries sector, and people who are no longer working fisherman also hold a lot of it. Does the Minister have a view on whether it would be better consolidated with people who are pursuing a licence to fish, which would prevent the leakage of revenue out of the sector? Many other financial institutions still hold quota, and I also wonder whether the Minister has a view on that.


<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>7 Dec 2005 : Column 930</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>

<p>
<a name="51207-19_para9">
<a name="stpa_256">My fourth point has already been well made by the hon. Member for Orkney and Shetland (Mr. Carmichael), so I will not go through it again. However, I emphasise the importance of not cutting days at sea&#151;an effort limitation&#151;as a result of quota arrangements with Norway, because such a cut would be extremely prejudicial in the medium term. The Minister did not mention that point in his initial remarks, so perhaps he will let hon. Members know his attitude to potential restrictions on days at sea as a result of the negotiations.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51207-19_para10">
<a name="stpa_257">Finally, I turn to fuel costs. At the Fisheries Council earlier this year, before the UK took over the presidency, the vast majority of fishing countries expressed concern about fuel costs, and the Commission was asked to investigate the possibility of fuel price protection for the fishing fleet. Other fishing fleets have some degree of protection; France has been mentioned. After his latest oil tax hike, the Chancellor of the Exchequer expects to have &#163;12&nbsp;billion in revenue from the North sea. Next year, he may even surpass in cash terms the all-time record for that set by Lord Howe in 1984. I was with a delegation that went to see the Chancellor earlier this year, when we talked about this and other matters. In such circumstances, one might think that the fishing communities&#151;the people who sail round the oil rigs and platforms producing this enormous wealth and largesse for the Chancellor&#151;would be tiny beneficiaries of the enormous funds from the black black oil that are filling Brown&#039;s black hole. At the very least, the Minister should give a guarantee that our fishermen will not be at a competitive disadvantage in relation to other European fleets as regards fuel costs.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51207-19_para11">
<a name="stpa_258">I move on to some general observations. The hon. Member for Great Grimsby returned to one of his favourite themes in trying to explain the importance of the priority of fishing in negotiations. He does that extremely well. Over the years of the common fisheries policy, some negotiating countries have attached an enormous priority to fishing. One thinks of Spain and, more recently, of the Dutch. The hon. Gentleman mentioned the famous memo written in 1971&nbsp;by a Scottish Office civil servant, which says:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_31">&quot;In light of Britain&#039;s wider European interests they&quot;&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="51207-19_para12">
<a name="stpa_259">the Scottish fishermen&#151;


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_32">&quot;are expendable.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>

<p>
<a name="51207-19_para13">
<a name="stpa_260">That memo was released under the 30-year rule. It was written in the course of negotiations that took this country into the then Common Market. The fisheries policy emerged from those negotiations at the very last minute. It should be said in defence of that nameless civil servant that he was not saying that the interests of Scottish fishermen should be expendable, but commenting bitterly on the attitude of the Foreign Office in the negotiations.

Of course, we all offer him our best wishes for retaining his post over these next few desperate hours. No hon.

I am not making a personal criticism of this Minister or his predecessor, both of whom, on account of their longevity in post and knowledge of the industry, have been substantially preferable to many of the Ministers who came and went before them. I have always found the present Minister most amenable and co-operative when listening to the concerns of hon. Members.

 The hon.

I think I am right in saying that the first defeat of the

<b>7 Dec 2005 : Column 932</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>Scottish Executive in the Scottish Parliament was sustained on the fishing issue. It is difficult to imagine fishing severely denting, if not breaking, the Government in this House. None the less, it was the issue that mobilised people to defeat the Government in that first term of the Scottish Parliament. That shows the relative scale of the priorities involved.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51207-20_para3">
<a name="stpa_264">The hon. Member for Great Grimsby is the chair of the all-party fisheries group and has long experience of the industry. I am hoping to take part in enough of these fisheries debates to rival his record, but I think that he has made more contributions to them than the rest of us combined. He was absolutely right to make that point about priorities.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51207-20_para4">
<a name="stpa_265">I want to talk about the rebate that was agreed at Fontainebleau. There have been stages in the history of the fishing industry at which it has been quite clear that certain countries&#151;Spain, for example, but others as well&#151;were building up their fishing fleets. I must caution the Minister not to give us the impression that the Irish decommissioning scheme will result in the Irish capacity following the pattern of the capacity in the white fish fleet in the United Kingdom. When he publishes the figures, they will show that exactly the opposite is the case. Ireland was another country that managed to exercise a substantial ability to modernise its fleet. In this country, however, our white fish and nephrops fleets have gone from being the most modern in Europe 25&nbsp;years ago to being among the more elderly fleets over the piece, certainly in those sectors of the fishery.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51207-20_para5">
<a name="stpa_266">One of the reasons for certain countries building up their fleets was their ability to access European funding. However, when we, as fishing MPs, argued for parity and comparability, we were told that under the Fontainebleau agreement, such funding would not be cost-effective because 87p in every pound would come off the UK rebate. Fishing was not the only industry that came up against a Treasury blockage as a result of the Fontainebleau agreement; the rebate has been a two-edged sword for many industries in this country. Perhaps now that the agreement is under negotiation, DEFRA will find a way of unlocking the funding that has long been available to other countries.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51207-20_para6">
<a name="stpa_267">The Minister might say that this is not the time to build up capacity in the fleet. It might be the time, however, to make available grants for extremely fuel-efficient engines. That would be both environmentally friendly and extremely cost-effective at a time of high fuel prices. Other mechanisms apart from grants and help to build up capacity can therefore be used, and I hope that the Minister will explore them.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51207-20_para7">
<a name="stpa_268">Lastly, one of the nubs of the debate has been whether it is tactically inept, as the Minister claimed, or strategically necessary, as my hon. Friend the Member for Na h-Eileanan an Iar explained and argued, to revisit the cod recovery plan. I take the Minister&#039;s point that he is in the middle of the current negotiations. Many of us would make the point to him, however, that if we are signed up to the 30&nbsp;per cent. increase in cod, year on year, and if, as much of the scientific evidence accumulating tends to indicate, that will be extraordinarily difficult to achieve&#151;if it is correct that conditions in the central North sea are by and large no longer amenable to cod as a stock&#151;no amount of instruction from the European Commission will 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>7 Dec 2005 : Column 933</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>persuade cod to return in large numbers to that ground. That might or might not be the case, but there is a disconnection between the weight of building scientific evidence on this matter, the ICES and the cod recovery plan, which has apparently been set in total isolation, without reference to that body of evidence.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51207-20_para8">
<a name="stpa_269">If we cannot meet that 30&nbsp;per cent. target year on year, every single year, regardless of the state of other stocks, we will find ourselves negotiating from an extremely difficult position. Whether the haddock biomass is 300,000&nbsp;or 500,000&nbsp;tonnes, it will not matter in the sense that the quota suggested for haddock will be lower, not as a result of the haddock biomass but because of its attachment to cod in a mixed fishery. Many of us therefore think that revisiting the cod recovery plan&#151;in public not in private, with the weight of accumulated scientific evidence taken into consideration&#151;should be a strategic objective, to consider whether the variety of stocks can be detached from one another. Otherwise, I fear that Ministers will face an uphill battle for the foreseeable future when success is presented as turning a 20&nbsp;per cent. cut into a 10&nbsp;per cent. cut as opposed to allowing fishermen to exercise the full fishing opportunities that should be available to them.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51207-20_para9">
<a name="stpa_270">If the Conservative party has been caught amidships in the transition of its fisheries policy, that is a great pity. No one, if they were starting from now, would have devised the common fisheries policy that we have at present. It is self-evident that any fishing country will have to embark on national and international agreements. It is also self-evident, however, that those that do so&#151;the Faroes, Iceland and Norway&#151;are a great deal more successful than those that are locked into the common fisheries policy. Whether or not the Conservative party is departing from national control, neither I, nor the hon. Member for Great Grimsby, nor the hon. Member for Orkney and Shetland is doing so. Those of us who care about fishing have a substantial argument in that regard, and we shall continue to pursue it.

 It is an immense pleasure to speak once again in the annual fisheries debate, particularly as there are so many familiar faces. The debate has the feel of a reprise, with all the charm of familiarity if not the excitement of novelty.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51207-20_para10">
<a name="stpa_271">I begin where the hon. Member for Banff and Buchan (Mr. Salmond), who always speaks with great authority on these matters, ended&#151;to say boldly that the common fisheries policy has been a disaster.

<p>
<a name="51207-20_para13">
<a name="stpa_274">Whatever statistics we consult, and according to almost any criterion, the CFP&#039;s performance has been disastrous for the British fishing industry. I plucked some figures from the Library. Not 47&nbsp;but just 20&nbsp;years ago, there were 22,224&nbsp;fishermen in the United Kingdom. In 2004&#150;05, there were 11,559. During those 20&nbsp;years, the number has halved. As for the size of the fishing fleet, in 1985&nbsp;there were 7,920&nbsp;vessels; now there are a little over 6,500. Let us now consider employment in the fishing sector as a whole. A fall of 49.8&nbsp;per cent., almost 50&nbsp;per cent., has been disastrous for many east coast fishing ports, a number of which are no longer fishing ports. In many of those proud towns the deep sea fishing industry has all but collapsed, and on the Lincolnshire coast the fishing industry is in a sorry state compared with the position of earlier generations. It really is not good enough for the Minister to do what he will undoubtedly do when he sums up the debate and adopt the position adopted by his predecessors&#151;one of simply managing the decline.

 I was present for the speech of my hon. Friend the Member for North Shropshire (Mr. Paterson), and I shall refer to it shortly. The Minister was clearly not as observant as he thought.

<p><a name="st_115"><a name="51207-21_spnew3"><b> Mr. Hayes: </b> 
 It is hardly an example of discourtesy to point out that the fishing industry has declined&#151;in my judgment, tragically and profoundly&#151;over the past 20&nbsp;years. As I said earlier in an intervention, I do not entirely blame the Minister or his predecessors. I repeat that, too often, they have gone naked into the conference chamber because they have not had the support of the Government as a whole for the&nbsp;prioritisation of the fishing industry. I do not think that the Minister should be so defensive. He is saddled with a job in which he cannot achieve the objectives that he may well wish to achieve because of the prevailing policy, the CFP, and the stance of his party. As his hon. Friend the Member for Great Grimsby (Mr. Mitchell) observed, the fishing industry has never been a priority for the leading members of their party.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51207-21_para0">
<a name="stpa_275">The industry&#039;s decline has left it, in certain respects, beyond the point of regeneration. Some parts of it have declined to a point at which they will never be able to regain the momentum and scale that they once enjoyed. That would be bad enough but, as I have said, we have also seen an ecological disaster. The latest information 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>7 Dec 2005 : Column 935</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>that we have, which has been mentioned already, is that cod stocks in the North sea, the Irish sea and west of Scotland are set to remain well below minimum recommended levels, and the advice is therefore zero catch. We are told that whiting stocks in the Irish sea are also thought to be in poor condition, and the advice is that there should be the lowest possible catch until the stocks have a chance to recover. It is true that haddock stocks are in rather better shape, as the Minister knows, but there is the difficulty of mixed fisheries, to which the hon. Member for Banff and Buchan referred.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51207-21_para1">
<a name="stpa_276">No one would deny that the ecology of the North sea and the other seas around our coast have been severely damaged by the CFP, which for the great bulk of its life allowed industrial fishing, a subject that has been raised relentlessly in the House&#151;it is raised every year when we have this debate. I am pleased that the end of industrial fishing seems to be in sight&#151;it has finished temporarily and, we hope, for good&#151;but it may be too late. Some species may have gone beyond the point of recovery. The effects of industrial fishing may have been so profound as permanently to change the ecology of the seas that have been fished so ruthlessly.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51207-21_para2">
<a name="stpa_277">I know that there are other factors. Climate change, warmer waters and the movement of fish stocks have to be taken into consideration, but it is undeniable that the scandal of industrial fishing, which was allowed to continue within the framework of the CFP, has done untold damage and that the Minister and previous Ministers have been warned about that by hon. Members on both sides of the House, year on year.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51207-21_para3">
<a name="stpa_278">The criticism above all others that I have of the CFP is that it has been crude in the way it has balanced fish stocks and fish take. The principal instruments of control have been restrictions on effort and discards. My hon. Friend the Member for North Shropshire, to whose remarks I was listening attentively, suggested that there were better ways of dealing with the important balance between what we take from the sea and the maintenance of adequate and healthy stocks. He talked about the technical advances that have taken place and that can be applied, and about the need for effective science. We have heard again from the Minister that there is co-operation between the industry and the scientists and that needs to be built on. I would point to the virtues of closed areas, long recommended by some hon. Members. They were examined as long ago as 1998&nbsp;when I was on the Select Committee on Agriculture, and advocated by me when I was shadow Fisheries Minister, prior to my hon. Friend&#039;s tenure. However, they were never pursued with the vigour that they should have been under the CFP. There are many ways in which the balance between fish take and fish stocks can be achieved. We have not got that formula right.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51207-21_para4">
<a name="stpa_279">It appears that the best way of achieving that is by having more local control of fishing. I do not think that this has to be a dogmatic issue. We do not have to be myopic in our view of Europe to take that line. I think that most good Europeans now take the view that we need to deconstruct the CFP and examine other ways of dealing with the issue. On the grounds of practical considerations and evidence, we now need to think afresh and more laterally. We need to look at the experiences of countries that have had successful and thriving fishing industries, including the Faroe Islands,

<b>7 Dec 2005 : Column 936</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>Iceland and Norway, and to learn from what they have got right. Our industry, restricted as it has been by the CFP, has, sadly, got it wrong. That is not the fault of the fishing industry or fishermen. It has happened because of what they have been obliged to do, often against their instinct and knowledge. There is nothing that fishermen like less than discarding healthy fish. It is against all that is in their bones and breeding. A more lateral and imaginative approach, which my hon. Friend the Member for North Shropshire articulated so well, is therefore desirable.

We need to be more creative and imaginative about reversing the decline over which successive Ministers have presided. I hope that the Minister will accept that suggestion, which is made with the best possible will, and take it seriously as he goes to the Council. I hope that he tells the representatives of the other countries there that enough is enough. We cannot gain by pretending that the current system will work. We must be honest enough to accept that we must start again and return fishing to local and national control.

 I am pleased to make a short contribution to this important debate. My constituency has a long history of fishing through the fishing port of Arbroath and the small communities of Auchmithie, Lunan, Usan, Ferryden up to Montrose and across the border into Aberdeenshire.The history of Angus&#039;s association with fishing is reflected in the fact that we have two of the oldest lifeboat stations in the country. As the Minister rightly said at the beginning of the debate, fishing is dangerous and many people have lost their lives in the fishing industry.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51207-21_para8">
<a name="stpa_283">In Angus, the traditional industry concentrated on white fish, especially haddock, but was also involved with fishing for crabs and in fixed salmon netting, 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>7 Dec 2005 : Column 937</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>especially at the mouth of the River Southesk. Much of that industry has now disappeared. A fishing industry remains, especially in the port of Arbroath, with a smaller industry in Montrose, but the rest of it has largely vanished over the years.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51207-21_para9">
<a name="stpa_284">However, my area continues to have a strong fish processing industry, which is building up after many years in the doldrums. My hon. Friend the Member for Banff and Buchan (Mr. Salmond) visited my constituency shortly after the general election to open an extension to the fish factory of R. R. Spink and Sons, one of the manufacturers of the world-famous Arbroath smokie. For many years, the smokie was effectively not made because there was not enough haddock to do so. That has changed in recent years and the industry is expanding and finding new markets. If hon. Members go to Sainsbury&#039;s in Victoria, they will find some R. R. Spink products on its shelves. I thoroughly recommend that they do that and enjoy an Arbroath smokie for their tea.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51207-21_para10">
<a name="stpa_285">The hon. Member for Scarborough and Whitby (Mr. Goodwill) said that the Czech Republic, Poland and other eastern European nations have no interest in fisheries. Interestingly, in recent years many Czechs, Poles, Slovaks and other eastern Europeans have come to work in fish processing factories in Arbroath, Aberdeen and many other areas. They are making a significant and very welcome contribution to Scotland&#039;s fish processing industry. So although the Governments of the Czech Republic, Poland and Slovakia may not have a particular interest in the continuing strength and health of Scotland&#039;s fishing and fish processing industries, many of their citizens do.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51207-21_para11">
<a name="stpa_286">There are several issues that I should like to draw to the Minister&#039;s attention. In an earlier intervention, I raised with him the question&#151;it has been mentioned by several Members&#151;of the scientific evidence issued this year by the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea. As I pointed out, we were told that cod was in danger&#151;no great surprise there&#151;but that haddock stocks were healthy, as our fishermen have been arguing for many years. ICES had previously said for many years that haddock was in as much danger as cod, but our fishermen challenged that advice; they said that it was not true and that there were plenty of haddock in the sea.

</p>

<p>
<a name="51207-21_para12">
<a name="stpa_287">When ICES scientists finally accepted that point of view and said for the first time that haddock were plentiful, that was a cause for some joy among Scotland&#039;s fishing communities, for whom haddock, not cod, is their main catch. They were very pleased that the scientists seem finally to have seen the light. Imagine their horror, therefore, when the ICES recommendations for quotas for the coming year were released a week later. It recommended a 40&nbsp;per cent. cut in the haddock quota, which would be absolutely disastrous for the Scottish fishing fleet. I accept that during subsequent negotiations the recommendation was reduced to 13&nbsp;per cent., but such a cut will still cause a great deal of difficulty for our fishing fleet.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51207-21_para13">
<a name="stpa_288">The point is that there is growing cynicism among fishing communities. They feel that a game is being played with this scientific evidence. Scientists know perfectly well that whatever they recommend will be 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>7 Dec 2005 : Column 938</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>negotiated down by the Fisheries Council. They are deliberately recommending cuts that they know will never happen, and which are much greater than are needed. However, that causes huge anxiety in fishing communities and it is perhaps time for some transparency in this regard. This time of year is a rollercoaster ride for fishing communities. In the run-up to each Christmas&#151;as ICES releases a report and we negotiate with Norway before the Fisheries Council meeting&#151;a cloud of black depression descends on those communities. They do not know what position they will be in by the new year, or whether they will even have an industry by then. The recommendation for a reduction in days at sea will also create many problems for our fishing fleet, which is already working to very tight margins.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51207-21_para14">
<a name="stpa_289">The situation is not helped by the fact that there is much misunderstanding of the nature of such scientific evidence. Greenpeace, an organisation that I normally have a great deal of time for, issued a report on fishing and, as a result of it, some Members&#151;led, I believe, by the hon. Member for Lewes (Norman Baker)&#151;tabled an early-day motion calling for fish to be removed from the House of Commons menu. Among the species specifically mentioned was haddock, but as I have pointed out, haddock is plentiful. Such misinformation&#151;the assumption that all species are in danger&#151;is causing a lot of the difficulties. We have to accept that in certain areas there is a problem with some species, particularly cod. As has been pointed out, there is a lot of evidence showing that climate change, rather than overfishing, is responsible, and that the fish have moved to the colder waters of the north. In fact, the Icelanders and the Faroese do not seem to be having the same problem with cod.

There is a lot of frozen cod, in all shapes and forms, from nice pieces to fish fingers containing a little cod. However, we must also look at eating habits. If some species are in danger, we should point out that others are not. I appreciate that much of the cod in the freezer may not be sourced from UK waters, but that is still an interesting point.

<a name="stpa_291">I mentioned that fishing was once a strong industry in my constituency. I grew up in Arbroath and I remember a teeming port and fish market. It is all gone now. At the last count, only six or so boats operated out of Arbroath. However, as the hon. Member for Hartlepool (Mr. Wright) mentioned earlier&#151;he is no longer in his place&#151;many fishermen have diversified into other areas. In my area, the council has turned part of the port into a marina for yachting, and it is very successful. Many of the smaller fishermen have diversified into pleasure trips or chartering out their boats. However, they have run into another problem. Under the EU rebated fuels directive, there is an issue of how often the boat is used for commercial and other purposes. I took that matter up with the Inland Revenue and the particular problem that my constituents had was solved, but if we are to encourage fishermen to diversify such matters have to be sorted out, so that they do not jump out of the frying pan into the fire.

<a name="stpa_292">As the hon. Member for Orkney and Shetland (Mr. Carmichael) mentioned, fishermen are having great difficulty with the cost of fuel. They are working on tight margins and the ever-increasing cost of fuel impinges on those margins. For once, it is not the fuel duty that is the problem because they can use rebated fuel&#151;red diesel. The problem is the cost of the actual fuel. To be fair, most of the recent rise in fuel prices has not been in fuel duty, but the fuel itself, and that has caused great problems. There is a large fish processing industry in my constituency, but the markets are mostly in the large urban areas. The cost of fuel works through the chain. The fishermen have to get their fish to market&#151;very quickly in the case of fresh fish&#151;to ensure that it is still saleable. In areas such as Na h-Eileanan an Iar, the lobsters and crabs that are caught have to reach the market very quickly and the cost of fuel is a huge burden on the industry. It is the same for those who make smokies and other prepared fish in my constituency. They have to get them to Sainsbury&#039;s in Victoria, and that adds to the cost. The cost of fuel has a serious impact on fishing and fish-related industries, especially those in rural areas, which is where most of them are situated.

Much has been said with more eloquence than I could put it about the failures of the CFP. Members have told us that after decades of the CFP there are fewer fish and fewer fishermen, and that fishing fleets have dwindled. Other Members spoke about the high cost of the CFP to the taxpayer. By almost any measure the policy has been a failure.

That is the fundamental reason why the common fisheries policy has failed. We can talk about the detail, the quotas and the changes that can be made; we can tinker and try to improve things, but without that democratic scrutiny, the CFP will always get it wrong.

We need to push power away from the unelected quangos in Brussels and move it down not simply to the member state but beyond. Again, there is agreement about that.

<a name="stpa_306">I often say to the minority of Norwegians who want to join the European Union, &quot;Given that you have enormous fish stocks that are being well husbanded and oil as well, why do you want to join because there is no doubt that the European Union would want your oil and fish, and it would not last very long if you did join?&quot; People might challenge my view, but I have not received a good answer to that question during my many discussions with Norwegian colleagues&#151;I am vice-chair of the all-party group on Norway.

There will always be ups and downs if we carry on in such a way. I am pleased that there have been improvements in fish catches recently, as my hon.

 One of the challenges for Governments around the world who wish to establish good and sustainable fishing policy is that there is uncertainty about the science. The overwhelming bulk of science, with the exception of a small number of mavericks, accepts that the single biggest impact on cod is over-fishing. There is no doubt about that. A role may be played by climate, and the hon. Gentleman is right that there has been a northward shift in species&#151;it is not just cod that we are talking about&#151;as we are now catching more exotic species off the south-west coast. However, just because climate is impacting on a species, it does not necessarily mean that one can fish it harder and solve the problem. That is not the case&#151;proper controls are needed on over-fishing, otherwise stock will be written off.
</p>








<p><a name="st_140"><a name="51207-24_spnew4"><b> Mr. Salmond: </b> 
 If over-fishing is the explanation, how, in a mixed cod and haddock fishery in the same area of the sea, can there be a record low for cod and a record biomass high for haddock? Would over-fishing not affect both species, rather than just one?
</p>








<p><a name="st_141"><a name="51207-24_spnew5"><b> Mr. Bradshaw: </b> 
 The hon. Gentleman will be aware that it is not a record high any more. That was the case a year or two ago, and it was dependent on a single year class. Recruitment to such a class can make a huge difference to the biomass. I do not want to go into further technical detail, as I do not wish to detain the House much longer, and I wish to respond to many points made by hon. Members.
</p>








<p><a name="st_142"><a name="51207-24_spnew6"><b> Mr. MacNeil: </b> 
 Has the Minister not made the case for environmental effects by highlighting the appearance of species in the south that are not usually seen there? Does that not underline the argument that the cod are migrating north?
</p>








<p><a name="st_143"><a name="51207-24_spnew7"><b> Mr. Bradshaw: </b> 
 I was not arguing that there was a lack of evidence that the cod were migrating north. Fisheries scientists would agree that an overwhelming body of evidence suggests that over-fishing has had the biggest single impact on fish stocks. We need to inject some reality into our debate. Hon. Members who have participated today tend to represent fishing communities, but there are other interests that wish to protect the marine environment. While it is important that they talk to their fishermen, they should also talk to environmental organisations and the scientists who wrote the Royal Commission report, which is an important international report on the state of our seas in this country and elsewhere. They will find that there is general global consensus, with the exception, as I said, of one or two mavericks, that the single biggest impact on fish stocks is over-fishing by human beings.

 I am grateful for the Minister&#039;s measured response to my initial intervention, which led to further interventions. If over-fishing, or what I described more generously as inadequate conservation measures, is responsible, can we conclude that the approach of the CFP, which has largely been about effort management and discard has been ineffective for conservation? Should we not have looked long ago at the proposals advocated by my hon. Friend the Member for North Shropshire (Mr. Paterson), including technical changes, closed areas and a different approach to spawning grounds, as they would have been more effective? According to the Minister, what he calls over-fishing is the problem, but is that not the responsibility of the CFP?
</p>








<p><a name="st_145"><a name="51207-24_spnew9"><b> Mr. Bradshaw: </b> 
 I shall come on to that later. The hon. Gentleman is wrong to suggest that the existing system is based on effort control. In fact, that is the system advocated by the hon. Member for North Shropshire (Mr. Paterson). There is some effort control in the current system, but it is mainly based on quotas. There is a debate about whether that is the best system, and we will discuss that later.

<a name="51207-24_para2">
<a name="stpa_320">The hon. Member for Banff and Buchan asked a number of specific questions. I shall write to him about the aggregation of licences, as I am afraid that I have not been able to obtain the information that he requested. However, to repeat my earlier assurance, this is an issue on which there has been consultation, and the industry has been involved. He asked about the proposed increase in the mackerel TAC, and wondered why there was a difference between the scientific advice and the increases of 15&nbsp;per cent. and 5&nbsp;per cent. That TAC was the result of the EU-Norway agreement, so it is now fixed. Some TACs&#151;I shall come on to haddock in a minute&#151;are officially agreed in December, but are effectively dependent on the EU-Norway agreement. That TAC was the result of the negotiating of Norway, which did not want an increase in the TAC at all.

<a name="stpa_321">On the question whether quota should be released by banks, we are, as the hon.

That will be an important element in putting our fishing industry on a sustainable footing in the long term.

There may be scope for further tightening of the cod recovery regime in respect of such countries. Any impact that that may have on the UK fleet will, I hope, be more than offset by the very large TAC increase that we expect to get for prawns. I shall come to the details of that shortly. I know it is of great interest to the hon. Gentleman and other hon. Members.

<a name="stpa_325">The hon. Member for Orkney and Shetland mentioned frontloading, as did my hon. Friend the Member for Great Grimsby (Mr. Mitchell).

<a name="stpa_326">I accept the criticism made by my hon. Friend the Member for Great Grimsby and the hon. Member for Orkney and Shetland that there has not been as much frontloading this autumn as we had hoped, but there has been some and it has made a difference. For example, we have managed to secure agreement on technical measures in the Baltic, which will be significant for the long-term sustainability of the fisheries there. We have also had useful policy discussions on principles in advance of the December Council. The timetable for the science reporting, the Commission&#039;s proposals being made, and Governments, industry and other bodies being able to make representations about those has improved somewhat.

<a name="stpa_327">As was pointed out, we are not in a position this year where we do not have an EU/Norway agreement. We have one, and it is a very good agreement. I congratulate my officials, as I should have done earlier, on their hard work. Still acting as UK fisheries officials under the presidency, they have also had to deal with difficult technical negotiations in Brussels involving all the other 24&nbsp;member states. Some hon. Members have covered fisheries issues for a long time in the House. It would be a brave hon. Member who described himself as an

</p>








<p><a name="st_150"><a name="51207-25_spnew3"><b> Sir Robert Smith: </b> 
 The Minister has pointed out that the negotiations are detailed and technical. Does he therefore feel that there is scope to involve fishermen&#039;s representatives on the EU side in those negotiations? The Norwegians directly involve their fishermen in their negotiating team, and bringing the expertise of those who must cope with whatever is agreed with Norway into the negotiations might help to bring fishermen onside and engage them in the process.
</p>








<p><a name="st_151"><a name="51207-25_spnew4"><b> Mr. Bradshaw: </b> 
 There is always scope to consider whether we can do a better job involving the industry and other interested parties early in the process, which is one of the rationales behind our putting the matter on the agenda, getting it debated and obtaining a commitment from Commissioner Borg to publish in April an action plan on the review of the fisheries year.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51207-25_para4">
<a name="stpa_328">The hon. Member for Argyll and Bute (Mr. Reid) has mentioned including representatives of the fishing industry in the negotiating team, but I am not a great fan of sub-contracting such negotiations to anybody. In September, we failed to reach an agreement on conservation in the Mediterranean, and one of the member states with a strong interest had its industry representatives in the salle d&#039;&#233;coute watching proceedings. Such negotiations are supposed to take place between Ministers and behind closed doors, so that horse-trading can go on. Such negotiations can be reduced to Ministers with no officials, which happened in the sugar negotiations in the week before last. It sometimes takes political will and courage to reach an agreement on a difficult subject, and it is not necessarily sensible to conduct negotiations with people who have a strong interest one way or the other looking over one&#039;s shoulder or even watching on television.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51207-25_para5">
<a name="stpa_329">It is important that we keep in close touch with our industry, and there has been a sea change in DEFRA&#039;s approach. The Scottish Executive Environment and Rural Affairs Department has also improved its act in recent years on involving and informing the industry. It works closely with the industry to establish the industry&#039;s priorities and to deal with the Commission&#039;s proposals as they are made, so that we can get the best possible deal for the UK industry that is also based on sustainability.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51207-25_para6">
<a name="stpa_330">The hon. Member for Orkney and Shetland also raised the issue of industrial fisheries. The current recommendation is for a continued closure, which has been welcomed on both sides of the House, with a monitoring catch of around 25,000&nbsp;tonnes and a review part of the way through next year&#151;25,000&nbsp;tonnes might sound like a lot, but last year&#039;s TAC was 660,000&nbsp;tonnes. The new quota is a huge improvement, and it has been a long-term aim of successive UK Governments. It is nice that it has been achieved, although I wish that it had happened a little bit sooner.

<a name="51207-25_para9">
<a name="stpa_333">Like a number of other hon. Members, the hon. Gentleman raised the importance of nephrops and prawns. Twenty years ago, few people would have said that the UK nephrops industry would easily be the most valuable part of our fishing industry in 2005. The health of the nephrops stock, which is being exploited sustainably, is one reason why the fishing industry is doing well. Thanks to some chivvying by the hon. Member for Banff and Buchan, other SNP Members and others, we have established fisheries science partnerships to evaluate the evidence, which the hon. Member for Banff and Buchan always said was there, on an increase in the TAC. My officials have been very successful in doing that this year. The Commission proposes a 39&nbsp;per cent. increase in the TAC in the west of Scotland and a 31&nbsp;per cent. increase in the North sea. I am sure that that will be welcomed by fishermen and their parliamentary representatives in all constituencies with an interest in the matter. It will also be of great interest to Northern Ireland Members, who are no longer present, because some Northern Irish fishermen fish in the west of Scotland.

</p>

<p>
<a name="51207-25_para10">
<a name="stpa_334">We are also arguing for an increase in the TAC in the Irish sea. As there has not been a similar fisheries science partnership there, the Commission does not propose any increase; indeed, it proposes a decrease. We will argue against that. It does not make sense to argue that the stock in the west of Scotland is doing well enough to allow a 39&nbsp;per cent. increase but say that there should be no increase at all in the Irish sea. We will also argue for an increase in the plaice TAC in the Irish sea. One of the reasons why the Commission is recommending a reduction, despite the fact that that stock is in extremely good shape at the moment, is that it argues that there is a relationship with cod. We do not accept that. We will argue for a 20&nbsp;per cent. increase, which will be of great benefit to the industry, not least in places such as Fleetwood, where people feel that they have had a very raw deal in recent years.

<a name="stpa_335">The hon. Member for Angus (Mr. Weir) made some sensible remarks about scientific evidence. I have already described some of the ways in which we have been working with the industry. In recent years, we have spent about &#163;5&nbsp;million on fisheries science partnerships.

He is right to point out

<br>&nbsp;<br>the error of whoever suggested that haddock should be taken off the House of Commons menu. Anyone who knows anything about fisheries could have told the person who made that decision that haddock is in good shape. Indeed, we should be encouraging people to eat a lot more of it. I sometimes wish that my kith and kin in the south of England had the same taste for haddock as people in the north and in Scotland. It would help cod if we southerners were automatically served haddock with our chips instead of cod&#151;although most of the cod that we eat comes from sustainable fisheries in other parts of the world.

<a name="stpa_345">It is important that we learn from good practice in other countries, but it is not always easy to make direct comparisons between countries such as New Zealand or Iceland, which basically lie surrounded by large expanses of ocean, and the United Kingdom, which is close to the rest of the continent and has fisheries that we have traditionally shared with other countries, long before the common fisheries policy and the European Union were invented. We have had wars with some of those countries over fisheries, which hon. Members often forget. If there are no rules or means for negotiation and agreement in relation to the exploitation of such a valuable resource, and no institution to apply those rules when some countries do not obey them, to which I referred in relation to the huge fines being levied on France, all sorts of new challenges are faced.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51207-26_para7">
<a name="stpa_346">I am still not convinced by the attraction of the hon. Member for North Shropshire to the Faroese system, which relies solely on effort control. I do not want to bore the House again, but were we to introduce effort control in the North sea now to protect cod, no fishing would go on, because the effort would have to be set so low, because cod stocks are so low, that fishermen would not be able to catch any of the other species. In the highly complex, mixed fishery of the United Kingdom, we need to be cannier about our system. As I said, a review is going on, and a mixture of effort control and quota management, perhaps with individual tradeable quotas, might be the answer, although we have not made a firm and fast decision on that yet. We need to be a little more imaginative and canny, as we have a more complex fisheries reality than some of the countries to which he referred.

 I know that the Prime Minister&#039;s review, for instance, mentioned the background to individual transferable quotas approvingly, but before proceeding along those lines will the Minister consider the concentration of the industry that has resulted in just about every fishery where the system has been introduced? Will he reflect on whether it is compatible with the family-based companies that exist in many areas on the coastline?
</p>








<p><a name="st_170"><a name="51207-27_spnew1"><b> Mr. Bradshaw: </b> 
 That is an important point, and we will certainly include it in our discussions with the industry. The hon. Gentleman may wish to talk to officials about it, or bring others to discuss it with them. That need not happen, however. Iceland, for example, has introduced measures to protect small boats. In Iceland there has been consolidation between the big boats and the small boats; it is the boats in between that have tended to go. However, there are mechanisms to prevent the consolidation to which the hon. Gentleman has referred, and to protect fishing in vulnerable communities. We have said repeatedly that those are two of our objectives. We do not want a system that resulted in a few big boats in small fishing ports that then died out.

<a name="51207-27_para0">
<a name="stpa_347">I take issue, slightly, with the way in which the hon. Gentleman reported what was going on in the Faroes. I am advised by officials that the official view of the Faroese Government is that the cod stock is not in very good shape at present. It is as low as it was before its collapse in 1990, and is considered to be &quot;at risk of reduced reproduction&quot;. The official view of the Faroese Government is that effort has remained too high, and will have to be reduced.

<a name="51207-27_para1">
<a name="stpa_348">I do not think that there are simple solutions to fisheries management. I think that there will always be difficulties and challenges, because there are difficulties and challenges in all systems. One aspect of the debate that I welcome is the fact that, by and large, it has been so informed, and that views have been expressed that can be fed into the Government&#039;s review of quota management. I hope that Members on both sides of the House will continue to show an interest.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51207-27_para2">
<a name="stpa_349">I now come to the thorny issue of the common fisheries policy, which was raised by members of all parties, including mine. Unlike the hon. Member for Banff and Buchan, I had hoped that a new Leader of the official Opposition committed to fighting the Government on the centre ground and to jettisoning eccentric policies based on dogma&#151;the hon. Member for Witney (Mr. Cameron)&#151;would have taken the opportunity to send his fisheries spokesman to the House to announce a rethink. The hon. Member for North Shropshire did not quite do that. Like some of his hon. Friends, he repeated his party&#039;s official commitment to trying to withdraw the UK unilaterally from the CFP, a policy described by the right hon. Member for Skipton and Ripon (Mr. Curry) as &quot;unwise and undeliverable&quot;. When the former Conservative party chairman Chris Patten was asked about it, his response was

<a name="51207-27_para4">
<a name="stpa_351">I have studied the quotation from <i>The Times</i> to which the hon. Gentleman referred, and other comments that the new leader of his party has made about the issue. They are slightly different from a commitment to trying to negotiate unilateral withdrawal from the CFP. The hon. Member for Witney told Anatole Kaletsky that his party wanted to

 In a sense, my hon. Friend has half-answered the question that I was going to put. He elides the two issues&#151;the irrationality of the common fisheries policy, which is undoubted, as it is not a sensible policy, and the difficulty of withdrawing from it. That may be a politically serious problem but one cannot argue that the CFP was and is still a sensible policy.
</p>








<p><a name="st_174"><a name="51207-27_spnew5"><b> Mr. Bradshaw: </b> 
 I just said that I did not think that anyone in the House would describe the CFP as having always been successful. It has got better. The reforms of 2002&nbsp;have been a significant improvement. As I said, in the past two years, they have led to growth in the fishing industry in this country, to increased incomes, and to better landings for most species, but there is always room for improvement.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51207-27_para7">
<a name="stpa_354">I do not think that the official Opposition&#039;s policy is sensible. I hope, and expect, if the hon. Member for Witney is serious, that they will review it. A policy that is futile is never a sensible policy. As my hon. Friend the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Member for Luton, North (Kelvin Hopkins) acknowledged, it would not be possible to withdraw from the common fisheries policy without withdrawing from the European Union. We would have to persuade every other member of the EU to support us&#151;the decision would require unanimity. Repeatedly, when we have asked the Opposition to name a single country&#151;not all of them, but a single one&#151;that would support the UK&#039;s withdrawal from the CFP, they have not been able to do so. That indicates the futility of their policy. It is never sensible for a party that has ambitions to govern, as the official Opposition now apparently do, to hang on to futile and ridiculous policies.
</p>








<p><a name="st_175"><a name="51207-27_spnew6"><b> Mr. MacNeil: </b> 
 Is not Norway a great example of how to deal with the common fisheries policy? I am dismayed to hear the Minister say that the CFP is not ideal but we are stuck, that is it and we are just going to accept it.
</p>








<p><a name="st_176"><a name="51207-27_spnew7"><b> Mr. Bradshaw: </b> 
 I did not say that. I said that it is important that we reform the common fisheries policy. It is being reformed and it can be reformed further. I also quoted a gentleman who is not naturally a Labour supporter, who writes for <i>The Daily Telegraph</i> and who wrote an important book on fisheries a year or so ago. He went through all those arguments, listened carefully to the views of the official Opposition and concluded that, if the CFP did not exist, we would have to invent something like it and that, if we want to manage our fisheries sustainably off the north-western coast of Europe, with many nations with differing fishing interests in a complex mixed fishery, we have to have some institution where those deals can be made and enforced.
</p>








<p><a name="st_177"><a name="51207-27_spnew8"><b> Mr. Hayes: </b> 
 The hon. Gentleman generously, I think, given the position of his Government, has said that the common fisheries policy has not been a success and is in need of reform. How would he measure success? What criteria would he use to judge whether it had become

<b>7 Dec 2005 : Column 957</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>successful? When does he expect it to become successful? Is success the regeneration of the British fishing industry, not to the degree that we have seen in the past couple of years, but to a significant degree? Is success a proper balance in the ecology of the North sea and the other seas around us? What is his measure of success and when does he expect to bring us the good news in a fisheries debate that it is a success?
</p>








<p><a name="st_178"><a name="51207-27_spnew9"><b> Mr. Bradshaw: </b> 
 I am reluctant to give the hon. Gentleman a history lesson on the common fisheries policy but, briefly, the biggest mistake that it made was to coincide with the so-called &quot;gadoid outburst&quot;. The hon. Gentleman nods, so he knows what I am talking about. That led to a massive expansion of the fishing fleet not just in this country but in all the EU countries, often, as hon. Members have pointed out, funded by the taxpayer. That was a huge strategic error. We have been paying the price for that ever since.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51207-27_para8">
<a name="stpa_355">The reform that we agreed in 2002&nbsp;was significant. It did not go as far as we would have liked. The UK constantly pushes for more reforms, but the ultimate test of whether the CFP is a success is to get our fisheries on to a sustainable level for the long term. That is the objective of this Government, and I do not think that having a futile debate about the legality of withdrawal from the CFP is the way to do it.
</p>








<p><a name="st_179"><a name="51207-27_spnew10"><b> Sir Robert Smith: </b> 
 The Minister when he opened the debate recognised that there would be far more efficient management of this complex fishery if only those countries that had a direct interest in fishing in the North sea were involved in the final negotiations.

 That is exactly why the UK has supported the regional advisory councils. We want their role to grow. By the end of our presidency, we will have successfully established two or three. However, the hon. Gentleman should not get the impression that landlocked countries such as Hungary play a major role in the Fisheries Council. The other member states would not take it well if Hungary or another landlocked country without any obvious interest in fisheries scuppered a deal. They tend to go with the presidency compromise.

<p><a name="st_181"><a name="51207-28_spnew1"><b> Mr. Salmond: </b> 
 We must have international agreements on fisheries and therefore there will be a common fisheries policy&#151;that does not follow.

Friend agree that one of the problems with the growth of the Tesco Express and Metro convenience stores, which drive out small convenience shops, is that the consultants&#039; reports that the planning committees see before they make their decisions bear no resemblance to reality? The reports make wild assumptions about the low level of spend, but as soon as the Tesco store opens, there is a high level of expenditure and that drives out and closes the small convenience stores. Does my hon. Friend agree that something needs to be done to tighten up those consultants&#039; reports, perhaps through audits after planning decisions?
</p>








<p><a name="st_197"><a name="51207-29_spnew4"><b> Keith Vaz: </b> 
 My hon. Friend is right. He highlights an important area that also affected the establishment of the Tesco store in my constituency in Hamilton. Promises were made and experts produced before the planning permission was granted, but as soon as it was granted they all disappeared. Local residents are left to face the inconvenience.

<a name="51207-29_para2">
<a name="stpa_372">The Office of Fair Trading has been wavering on the dominance of supermarkets in the grocery sector. The OFT&#039;s goal is to make markets work well for consumers. Markets work well when there is vigorous competition between fair-dealing businesses. When markets work well, enterprise flourishes. In regard to supermarkets, that is clearly not the case. It has been difficult to make the OFT look into the matter and provide an adequate response and analysis of the situation. Indeed, the OFT has often been dubbed &quot;Only Fair to Tesco&quot;.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51207-29_para3">
<a name="stpa_373">In August, the OFT came to the conclusion that there was no need for supermarkets to be subject to a full review by the Competition Commission, which conducts in-depth inquiries into mergers, markets and the regulation of the major industries. The evidence presented by, among others, the Association of Convenience Stores was not considered to be compelling enough to warrant a further investigation. It is commonly agreed that there were large holes in the OFT&#039;s explanation for why it had decided not to refer the grocery market to competition regulators. However, on 28&nbsp;October, there was a welcome U-turn. After heavy criticism, the OFT reconsidered its decision and said that it would consider investigating the four giants of the grocery market.

<a name="stpa_374">That programme was on BBC Radio 4&nbsp;on 8&nbsp;March 1998. Does the hon. Gentleman agree that matters have got considerably worse in the past eight years?

<p><a name="st_199"><a name="51207-29_spnew6"><b> Keith Vaz: </b> 
 The hon. Gentleman is absolutely right: things have got considerably worse. Evidence has been produced, which is why there is a need for action.

<a name="51207-29_para5">
<a name="stpa_375">As well as the organisations referred to in the hon. Gentleman&#039;s report and the ACS, several other interest groups have growing concerns about supermarket expansion. The ACS is backed by consumer and campaign groups from the women&#039;s institute to Friends of the Earth, and even the New Economics Foundation. On 2&nbsp;August 2005, the ACS launched its formal appeal to the competition appeals tribunal, arguing that the OFT did not give proper consideration to the evidence presented to it, especially on below-cost selling and the effects of buyer power on the grocery market. At the end of this week, the ACS will respond to the OFT with further detailed evidence covering all grounds&#151;enough in my view and that of others to warrant a thorough investigation into the grocery market.

The year 2015&nbsp;is the 200th anniversary of the battle of Waterloo, and Napoleon said that England was a nation of small shopkeepers. Does the hon.

<p><a name="st_201"><a name="51207-29_spnew8"><b> Keith Vaz: </b> 
 The hon. Gentleman is absolutely right. I do not often visit his constituency, but sometimes I pass through Kettering on my way to Leicester when the M1&nbsp;is blocked, and over the 18&nbsp;years since I became a Member I have seen the changes there.

 I, too, congratulate the hon. Gentleman on securing such an important debate. He is presenting the case very well, and I support what he has said. To add weight to his argument, not only small shops suffer from the buying power of supermarkets; suppliers often suffer, too. Dairy farmers receive a farm-gate price for milk that is below the cost of production, yet supermarkets benefit from a huge mark-up when the milk is on their shelves. Suppliers as well as shops are suffering.

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>7 Dec 2005 : Column 963</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>easier confidential complaint mechanisms for businesses; a ban on price flexing; transparency of buying prices; a market share cap; implementation of local competition policies; and initiating an independent proactive retail ombudsman to investigate supermarket dealings with suppliers.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51207-29_para7">
<a name="stpa_377">Under UK law, the function of the competition appeals tribunal&#151;CAT&#151;is to hear and decide appeals and other applications or claims involving competition or economic regulatory issues. The CAT is a specialist judicial body, with cross-disciplinary expertise in law, economics, business and accountancy. It is currently investigating the Association of Convenience Stores <i>v.</i> Office of Fair Trading, case number 1052/6/1/05. At a case management conference on 1&nbsp;November 2005, and in the light of the OFT&#039;s indication that it wanted to withdraw its decision of 3&nbsp;August, the OFT decision was formally quashed by the tribunal and referred back to the OFT, with a direction to reconsider the matter and make a new decision.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51207-29_para8">
<a name="stpa_378">I turn to the issue of Tesco, which is by far the largest player in the market. Tesco controls more than 30&nbsp;per cent. of the overall British grocery market, worth &#163;80&nbsp;billion. One in every eight pounds spent in retail is spent in Tesco. By 2010, the firm&#039;s share of the grocery market is predicted to be 45&nbsp;per cent. Tesco has the largest market share in 67&nbsp;of the 120&nbsp;postal districts in the country, while Asda controls 23, Sainsbury&#039;s 14&nbsp;and Morrisons 13. In 14&nbsp;districts, Tesco has more than 40&nbsp;per cent. of the market. In five towns, it has more than 45&nbsp;per cent. of the market. That is a rather substantial domination, and we have not seen the end of it.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51207-29_para9">
<a name="stpa_379">It would be wise to examine Tesco&#039;s expansion plans in yet more detail, as Tesco has accumulated enough land to develop up to 180&nbsp;new stores and it plans to expand abroad. Tesco will open 150&nbsp;stores abroad in the second half of this year. Its overseas operation, from Japan to the Czech Republic, now accounts for 20&nbsp;per cent. of its turnover.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51207-29_para10">
<a name="stpa_380">Of course it is important to note Tesco&#039;s contribution to the development of popular retailing in the United Kingdom in the past decade. Sir Terry Leahy, the chief executive of Tesco&#151;a world-class entrepreneur&#151;has led the retailer&#039;s extraordinary success. Sir Terry&#039;s management method and clarity of thought has created a modern-day company that leads the UK market and ranks No. 3&nbsp;in the world.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51207-29_para11">
<a name="stpa_381">Shopping at Tesco&#151;I declare an interest in that I shop at Tesco&#151;and other supermarkets is a wonderful experience. We all love the convenience of having a wide selection of choice under one roof, but there is a line to be drawn between innovation and dominance and between competition and monopoly. Sir Terry&#039;s visit to Bangalore in a bid to launch Tesco into the Indian market is worth noting. I admire his enterprise in seeking to sell basmati rice to the Indian population. I suppose that that is the retail equivalent of selling sand to Saudi Arabia.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51207-29_para12">
<a name="stpa_382">It has been suggested that Tesco&#039;s expansion abroad is a masterstroke to draw attention from the controversy of the domestic market, so that it can continue to expand.

If Tesco does not buy them, the distributors are out of business.

Given the lack of transparency, it is very difficult to issue formal complaints and suppliers are left absolutely powerless.

<p><a name="st_204"><a name="51207-30_spnew0"><b> David Taylor </b> 
: My hon. Friend rightly pays tribute to the quality, range and price successes that Tesco has enjoyed. He noted that Tesco is the third largest retailer in the world, but does any other retailer in that top 10&nbsp;have such a dominant position in its home market?
</p>








<p><a name="st_205"><a name="51207-30_spnew1"><b> Keith Vaz: </b> 
 That is an easy question: the answer is no, not as far as I am aware. It is a unique form of domination. As hon. Members have noted this evening, the relationship between the dominant supermarket, Tesco, and the suppliers is a source of concern. In today&#039;s <i>Financial Times</i>, it is reported that supermarkets rely on their suppliers for free finance to fuel their growth. An investigation into the accounts of supermarkets in today&#039;s paper shows that the amount owed to Tesco&#039;s creditors has risen by &#163;2.2&nbsp;billion in the past five years, compared with a &#163;700&nbsp;million increase in stocks, giving Tesco &#163;1.15&nbsp;billion to help to fund its business. There are no written contracts between supermarkets and suppliers, which means that supermarkets have the power to refuse stock at their convenience. Those in the bakery industry have suffered especially greatly.
</p>








<p><a name="st_206"><a name="51207-30_spnew2"><b> Mr. Breed: </b> 
 Will the hon. Gentleman confirm that dominance is unfortunately not illegal? Abuse of dominance is illegal, but it is difficult to prove that there has been abuse under the present system.
</p>








<p><a name="st_207"><a name="51207-30_spnew3"><b> Keith Vaz: </b> 
 The hon. Gentleman is absolutely right. Suppliers are terrified about making a complaint. Ministers say to me, &quot;Where is the evidence? Bring it on.&quot; However, suppliers do not want to complain because if they do so, they will not be able to sell their goods in the shops, which will create problems for their businesses.
</p>








<p><a name="st_208"><a name="51207-30_spnew4"><b> Mr. Hoyle: </b> 
 The dominance of supermarkets keeps the farming industry on edge all the time, so its survival is touch and go. It is the same story for the beef and dairy industries. They are teetering on the edge because they cannot get sustained long-term agreements.
</p>








<p><a name="st_209"><a name="51207-30_spnew5"><b> Keith Vaz: </b> 
 My hon. Friend is absolutely right. This is not just a question of the nervousness of the industry and its inability to plan, because as suppliers try to meet

<p><a name="st_210"><a name="51207-30_spnew6"><b> Mr. Michael Foster: </b> 
 I am sure that the Minister fully appreciates that my hon. Friend is being generous with his time. Dairy farmers face a problem because as they try to compete and produce at a cost that is effective for them, the size of their herds is growing at a phenomenal rate. A former chairman of the National Farmers Union from my constituency tells me that a dairy herd of 1,000&nbsp;cattle is not unheard of. A herd of such a size means that huge environmental problems must be dealt with, including just disposing of the huge quantity of manure that the cattle create.

<p><a name="st_211"><a name="51207-30_spnew7"><b> Keith Vaz: </b>

Small businesses are finding it difficult to compete on price to offer the variety of goods that citizens want. I quote Mrs. D. Raj, who owns a business in Rushey Mead in Leicester, which is in my constituency. She said:

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_49">&quot;While supermarkets may be creating jobs on the one hand, they cause businesses to lose their livelihoods so that they can make .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. profits. We have to make sure that Leicester offers variety&quot;</p>

<a name="stpa_388">Consumers are spending on average 25&nbsp;per cent. more on identical goods in supermarkets than they would on the street market. The street market is a popular option among my constituents because they enjoy the personal service. The street market allows one to get to know people, enjoy that personal relationship and get to know the traders. One can also get products in the packaging and size that one wants, whereas everything in supermarkets is pre-packaged. Pre-packaging limits choice and is wasteful.

<a name="51207-30_para3">
<a name="stpa_389">My hon. Friend the Member for North-West Leicestershire (David Taylor) raised the problem of out-of-town shopping centres. I shall cite one example tonight: Tesco and its development at the Hamilton district shopping centre in my constituency. My predecessor as Member of Parliament for Leicester, East, Mr. Peter Bruinvels, and I were united by our concern about the way in which the Hamilton estate was developing. Tesco wanted to build a superstore. As soon as it received planning permission, it dug in its heels and delayed other shops from being established. It wanted to dominate; it did not want a partnership. A review of the planning laws, which my hon. Friend the Member for Worcester (Mr. Foster) mentioned, would prevent people and businesses from operating in such a way and disrupting the process for others.
</p>








<p><a name="st_212"><a name="51207-30_spnew8"><b> David Taylor: </b> 
 Until this evening, I thought that my hon. Friend had nothing in common with his predecessor. However, in relation to town-fringe stores, is not it the case, as my hon. Friend the Member for Worcester (Mr. Foster) said, that the picture painted in 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>7 Dec 2005 : Column 966</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>the planning application&#151;especially in economic terms&#151;is often seriously adrift a year down the line? The jobs that the supermarket said it would create may well be in place, but jobs will be lost, not just in the small shops that might otherwise have sold the goods concerned, but in other shops in the town centre, because people are less likely to go there to buy their newspaper, have their shoes repaired and so on. Let us have a post-planning permission audit in economic terms as well.
</p>








<p><a name="st_213"><a name="51207-30_spnew9"><b> Keith Vaz: </b> 
 My hon. Friend is right. That would be most helpful and welcome, and perhaps one of the things that the independent regulator could do.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51207-30_para4">
<a name="stpa_390">What would the independent regulator do? He or she would be able to take independent confidential evidence, which Ministers cannot do because every day they have to deal with both sides of industry. It is important that we have a figure and a body that is seen to act with integrity when dealing with such situations. The supermarket regulator could consider loyalty payments, slotting fees, which are charged to buy shelf space, fees charged for artwork and the repackaging of products, and the way in which supermarkets like to manage the public statements of their suppliers.
</p>

<p>
<a name="51207-30_para5">
<a name="stpa_391">A supermarket regulator could consider the concept of &quot;reasonableness&quot; in the contract terms that are agreed&#151;if any are&#151;between the suppliers and the supermarkets. The renegotiation of those contracts should be determined absolutely by price and quality of service. The president of the National Farmers Union Scotland, John Kinnaird, said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_50">&quot;The public silence amongst supermarket&#039;s suppliers speaks volumes. It is of absolutely no surprise that the OFT has received virtually no evidence of breaches of the Supermarkets Code of Practice. Many of the companies that we contacted required repeated assurances from us that any comments they made would never be attributed to them. That kind of fear within the food supply chain is totally unacceptable. An independent regulator is required to police the trading environment. It needs power to act&quot;.</p>

He also said that he saw what was happening from his experience in Bradford and that his Department had been dealing with the issue for 25&nbsp;years. That honesty and openness is refreshing among Ministers. I believe that, after 25&nbsp;years, it is time to act. I had a good meeting with my hon. Friend, and he was prepared to listen.

<a name="stpa_397">We need to see this debate partly in the context of the Government&#039;s determination to achieve better regulation in Britain. There is always a tension between understandable demands from hon. Members for more regulation and a more generic concern that British business should not be over-regulated. Given that supermarkets are already subject to independent regulators in a number of areas, and given the importance, which I have just highlighted, of not over-regulating any sector of the economy, the Government do not think that there is any case for the creation of a supermarket ombudsman or regulator. I accept, however, that discussion will continue. I have been warned not to make a quip, but as Minister for Energy I deal with Ofgem, so it would be fun to establish &quot;Off-trolley&quot;. Perhaps that will have to wait for another occasion, as I am arguing that the Government do not think that there is any case for an off-the-trolley regulator.

<p>
<a name="51207-31_para2">
<a name="stpa_398">We do not accept that a new supermarket regulator would add any value without duplicating regulatory processes and imposing increased burdens, not only on supermarkets but on the companies that supply them. It would wrong to regulate in that way, and the Government would set a dangerous precedent if we created a regulator to oversee contracts between businesses. Unless unfair, anti-competitive or illegal practices are taking place there is no place for interference from regulatory bodies. British businesses would lose any competitive advantage over their competitors and the country as a whole would be poorer for it. I will deal later with the current state of play.

I have listened carefully to that concern. Farmers and suppliers have indicated that they would be more likely to make formal complaints to the OFT if the OFT could guarantee anonymity for complainants. However, any complaint system will require the supermarkets to be made aware of the details of the complaint. An ombudsman or independent regulator would normally need to share complaints with operators, so that the circumstances and legitimacy of the allegations could be verified and the complaint addressed. Clearly, there are some difficulties here.

Introducing anonymity to the complaints process under the code would run counter to one of the code&#039;s main objectives&#151;to put relations between supermarkets and their suppliers on a clearer and more predictable basis. In pursuit of that objective, the OFT has encouraged supermarkets to put more of their dealings with suppliers in writing. Of course, suppliers have a right

We welcome the OFT&#039;s commitment to continue to monitor the operation of the code proactively. That is to be achieved through a number of measures, including encouraging greater use of written terms between suppliers and supermarkets.

 That is an example showing how debates such as this can get the Government to make a statement on these matters. Does the Minister agree that the OFT has been weak in dealing with that aspect? We welcome the change of heart. Will he address suppliers&#039; fear of coming out with the information and the evidence? There is anecdotal evidence, but nobody wants to come up front because of the fear that they will lose business.

 That has been a powerful theme of my hon. Friend&#039;s remarks. Notwithstanding what I have said about that and about the difficulty of considering complaints in a transparent way and the consequent need to know more about the complaint and the complainant, I know that my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary will reflect on what my hon. Friend the Member for Leicester, East has said.

<a name="stpa_401">The Office of Fair Trading is committed to checking the supermarkets regularly for compliance and, most importantly, checking how suppliers who raise code issues are treated by the supermarkets afterwards. By monitoring in that way, the OFT can ensure that they are not be subject to any discrimination or sanctions. We are aware of the concerns of some sectors of the supermarket supply chain. The Government agree that supermarkets should deal fairly with suppliers, and we want to see good working relations between them.

<a name="51207-31_para6">
<a name="stpa_402">My ministerial colleagues and I remain keen to encourage dialogue between supermarkets and suppliers to ensure fair and effective resolutions to disputes. Suppliers are encouraged to approach the OFT at any time to discuss any concerns that they may have in confidence. We may need to publicise that possibility more. The OFT will investigate any complaints that it receives and take appropriate action where necessary. The OFT has not yet received any substantiated claims of breaches. It cannot be expected to take action based on unsubstantiated claims, as such action would seriously undermine the credibility of the code.

<a name="51207-31_para7">
<a name="stpa_403">I appreciate that another matter of concern to my hon. Friend are the moves by some of the supermarket chains, in particular Tesco and Sainsbury, into the convenience store sector. According to figures from the Institute for Grocery Distribution, published in May this year, Tesco and Sainsbury currently have a small share&#151;11&nbsp;per cent.&#151;of convenience retailing. We can debate how small or large a share that is. The merger control regime takes into account whether there is a substantial lessening of competition in any merger situation, in which case the OFT has the power to refer the case to the Competition Commission for further analysis. That was not found to be the situation regarding the Tesco-Adminstore or Sainsbury&#039;s-Bells acquisitions.

<a name="stpa_404">There has been some consolidation in the convenience store sector, but a number of successful independent groups have managed to take on and compete with the multiples. Institute for Grocery Distribution figures predict that symbol groups such as Spar, Costcutter and Londis will increase sales from &#163;8.7&nbsp;billion in 2006&nbsp;to &#163;11.6&nbsp;billion in 2010&nbsp;and that the number of convenience stores will increase from 12,693&nbsp;to 13,865. Following an appeal by the Association of Convenience Stores to the competition appeals tribunal&#151;my hon. Friend the Member for Leicester, East mentioned the tribunal&#151;the OFT is reviewing afresh its decision not to refer the grocery market to the Competition Commission. The CAT has asked for that to be done as quickly as possible, and in the circumstances the OFT should be left to complete its work unimpeded.

<a name="stpa_405">My Department has received a large amount of correspondence in relation to the so-called &quot;Tescopoly&quot; campaign instigated by Friends of the Earth. I do not want to do any more than note the points made in that campaign, because of the work that the OFT is now undertaking on the grocery market. I expect the OFT to come up with a view on the state of competition in that market and on whether the market is working well for consumers in the context of its new decision whether to make a market investigation reference.

 Will the Minister have a word with his colleagues in the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister to see whether they will introduce a post-planning permission audit of decisions on Tesco Express versus convenience stores? That would allow us to learn from real data, which would help to inform us on future decisions.

 Petrol is a subject that is closer to the Minister&#039;s heart&#151;he is the Minister for Energy. Has he seen for himself in Croydon the growth of mini-supermarkets situated next to petrol stations? It is no longer the case that people go into petrol stations and buy a few goods. If the Minister passes a Tesco Express attached to an Esso filling station when he returns to his constituency on Friday, he will see people come out with bags and bags of shopping, which even happens after 5&nbsp;o&#039;clock on a Sunday.

I think that it is a wonderful experience being able to walk down Uppingham road, where my constituency office and home are, and meet people who have been trading there for years and years. This is about the integrity and character of our town centres. We do not want them disfigured with huge glass monoliths with the word &quot;Express&quot; written all over them.

 Of course, I understand that. We all want that balance in our lives. However, I remember the debate about small post offices, which still rages. I heard a story from an hon. Gentleman who campaigned for a post office to be kept open and was told by the postmaster that some 6,000&nbsp;people had signed the petition to keep it open. When he asked how many regular customers he had, the answer was 200. We must practise what we preach. There are many excellent small stores selling a range of goods&#151;for example, cheese shops, many of which, unlike the one in the John Cleese sketch, have cheese. We need to get the balance right between the small shops and a sensible approach to the Tesco&#039;s, Sainsbury&#039;s and Co-op&#039;s of this world.
