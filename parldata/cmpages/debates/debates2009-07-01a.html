Will the Constitutional Renewal Bill contain provisions on special advisers? Given the corrosive effect of some special advisers on the quality and integrity of government, should the Bill not place a cap on their number and reassert in law that their role is to advise Ministers and not to direct the civil service&#151;or does the fact that Damian McBride is apparently still in contact with Ministers just go to show that a change of culture within Whitehall will not happen without a change of Government?</p>

 The Civil Contingencies Act 2004 places a duty on local authorities to provide business continuity advice, which ensures that advice reflects local conditions at times of emergency and meets local needs. To support that work, the Government have set up a business continuity advice line and in 2008 we published a national risk register to encourage organisations to prepare for the impact of business disruption.

 I refer my hon. Friend to the answer I gave to my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, North-West (John Robertson). The recession affects different organisations in many different ways, and that is why we have provided a significant package of support that has different elements to it&#151;support for volunteers, grants for small organisations, social enterprises and support for jobs, as well as loans to assist partnership working.</p>

 I thank the Minister for her reply. On Monday, Cancer Care Cymru, which is a local charity based in my constituency and which funds specialist cancer nurses to work closely with people who are suffering from cancer and receiving treatment in the NHS, announced that it was closing because of a slump in fundraising. That is a terrible loss for people suffering from cancer in the Cardiff area. What can we do on a general level to help to stop such closures?</p>

 My hon. Friend has raised a very serious issue, which could be happening in different places, but I recommend that she looks at the different funding that is available. First, I recommend the hardship fund that will be in place at the end of this month. I also suggest that she looks at the package of &#163;42 million that is available to provide real help now, and she might find that there is a way there to help the local community. Support is also being given through the National Council for Voluntary Organisations to help organisations with things such as fundraising, because that is key for things such as cancer care. She might find that there is some support there that she can talk to the NCVO about, so that her charity can get some extra support with fundraising, too.</p>

 Is the Minister aware that the very hardest hit in the charitable sector are the small charities that provide services that are much valued locally and that will not be provided by any of the statutory or larger organisations? I am referring to small charities such as the young mental health charity in my constituency. What advice can she give Members of Parliament and others to try to help these small charities to survive the present recession?</p>

 The hon. Lady makes a significant point. It is often the smallest charities that make a real difference to people&#146;s lives on the ground. May I direct her to the funding that is available through the grassroots grants? About &#163;130 million is available that is issued locally. In her area, there will be a department of a third sector organisation issuing those funds in sums of anything from &#163;5,000 to a few hundred pounds. On the ground, that can make a real difference. If she has any problems, I ask her please to come to me, and we can direct her to the funding in her area.</p>

 The stronger and more sustainable third sector organisations are, the better they can help to build stronger and more resilient communities. To that end, my Department is funding a &#163;30 million community assets programme and we are working with the Big Lottery Fund to refurbish underused buildings in 38 communities across England.

 My hon. Friend raises an issue that concerns many people. When we talk about community asset transfers, we are talking about the Government putting in money to support organisations and communities. The will to do that has come from the communities themselves. With community asset transfers, the liability is transferred not to the community but to an asset. Local councils must realise that the scheme is funded by the Government for local communities. It must not be forced on local communities, but should be carried out with their co-operation and direction.</p>

So far, almost 10,000 grants have been awarded, to the benefit of many organisations that had not benefited before. The only criteria set by the Government are that the recipients are bona fide third sector organisations with an income below &#163;30,000.

His shadow Chancellor should explain why he was going into television studios yesterday saying that he was going to cut schools now, cut Sure Start now, cut the September guarantee for school leavers now, and do nothing about unemployment. That is surely the issue: we cannot get out of recession unless we spend now on the services that we need.</p>

 Today we see a Prime Minister in full retreat. In the first answer, he says that we are going to get a zero per cent. increase in public spending&#151;that is a new one. In the second answer, he finally admits that he is going to cut, and cut deeply, capital spending. He talks about the debate about public spending: the debate is about whether the Prime Minister can be straight with the British public. Let me ask him again. He stood at the Dispatch Box, and talked about total spending year after year&#151;that is the figure that people are interested in. As the Treasury itself says, when it comes to total spending, there is a reduction, not a freeze, in medium-term spending&#151;I am glad that the Prime Minister is talking to the Chancellor for the first time in weeks&#151;and given that it is talking about a cut, will the Prime Minister stand there, give a straight answer and say that once we allow for inflation, total spending is being cut?</p>

I have already made it clear that for health, education and for all these public services, current spending will continue to rise. The issue is surely this: in 2009-10, we are raising spending substantially. We are doing so in 2010-11, and we are doing it to take us out of recession. There is only one serious party in the world that is trying to tell us that we should cut spending now&#151;the Conservative party. The right hon. Gentleman must therefore admit that under his proposals, schools would lose money now, teachers would be made unemployed, Sure Start services would go, child care services would be at risk, and no teenager would get a guarantee for jobs.

 The first thing that the right hon. Gentleman said was that unemployment is going to continue to go up. That is the Conservative policy. It is a prediction. That is when they say that unemployment is a price worth paying. Is he basing his assumptions on unemployment rising to 2014? No wonder he wants to cut public services. He is basing his assumptions on unemployment continuing to rise, because he will do absolutely nothing about it. We have taken action that is preserving 500,000 jobs. A quarter of a million people are leaving the unemployment register every month. We put in extra money on Monday so that there is more for young people who are unemployed and for summer school leavers. We will not forecast our spending plans on unemployment being higher in 2014 and rising every year, but if that is what the right hon. Gentleman wants to do, he cannot afford public services.

Gentleman has been referring to are likely to be in 2012, 2013 and 2014. We have got to the heart of the Conservative position today. They are the party of unemployment. They are premising all their spending plans on unemployment continuing to rise. He said himself that unemployment will keep on rising. If that is the basis of their spending plans, people can look forward, under a Conservative Government, not just to 10 per cent. cuts, but to rising unemployment. Why do they want these public spending cuts? To pay for inheritance tax cuts for the very rich. We see once again that they are the party of the few, and we are the party of the many.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o15"><a name="90701-0004.htm_para6"><a name="09070159000206">Why does the law need changing? At the moment, if a dog attacks in a public place, the owner can be prosecuted. However, this is not the case if the attack takes place on private property, yet there is clearly a problem as far as such attacks are concerned. Let us look at the statistics. Around 6,000 postal workers are attacked by dogs every year, with 70 per cent. of those attacks taking place on private property. In one instance, at Christmas 2007, Paul Coleman, a postal worker in Sheffield, was attacked so badly that he needed skin grafts and plastic surgery. At Christmas 2008, Keith Davies nearly lost a leg in a horrific attack in Cambridge. Of course, we all hear about the horrific attacks on children, who sometimes suffer from awful lifelong disfigurements as a consequence, and sometimes we hear about the terrible deaths that occur when children are attacked in the home by dogs.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o16"><a name="90701-0004.htm_para7"><a name="09070159000207">Clause 1 would therefore aim to extend the offence of having a dog dangerously out of control, so that it applied not only to attacks in public places, but to those in private places, such as homes and gardens. For instance, where postmen and women or other workers have to visit properties and are attacked in the gardens or within the dwelling, section 3 of the Dangerous Dogs Act 1991 would apply. It would also cover instances where children are injured and/or killed in the home.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o17"><a name="90701-0004.htm_para8"><a name="09070159000208">Such a measure is commanding support from diverse quarters. The Dogs Trust says:</p>
<a name="90701-0004.htm_brev1"><a name="09070159001575"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;This Bill... places additional emphasis on dog owners to take responsibility for their dog&#146;s behaviour at all times&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o18"><a name="90701-0004.htm_para9"><a name="09070159000209">That is an important point. At the moment, if there is an attack on a child or adult by a dog, more often than not, that dog is destroyed, but it is the owner who needs to be the focus of attention and who needs to face the consequences. That point is also supported by the Kennel Club, which says that this part of the Bill is warmly welcomed because greater responsibility is being placed on the owners to ensure that their dogs are not out of control.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o19"><a name="90701-0004.htm_para10"><a name="09070159000210">Thanks to a campaign by the RSPCA, nearly 4,000 members of the public contacted their MPs to support the Bill. One comment is particularly worthy of mention. It comes from a mother whose own child was attacked by her own dogs some years ago and who has been campaigning for a change in the law since then. She said to me:</p>
<a name="90701-0004.htm_brev2"><a name="09070159001576"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;I wholeheartedly support any moves for safety and find the current situation regarding postal workers and dog aggression wholly unacceptable. The consequences are devastating and life-changing.&#148;</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o20"><a name="90701-0005.htm_para0"><a name="09070159000211">I have met this mother and I can assure the House that, every week, she has to live with what happened&#151;week-in, week-out; year-in, year-out. Her view is that education is the key to changing attitudes towards dog ownership. Dogs need to be properly trained and owners need to understand that sensible precautions should be followed to protect visitors and children in the home.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o21"><a name="90701-0005.htm_para1"><a name="09070159000212">It is common sense that a child should never be left unsupervised in the company of a dog and it is surely not too difficult for dog owners to protect health visitors, meter readers, social workers or even the people who deliver parcels to the door by putting the dog in another room for the duration of a visit or while the door is being opened to a visitor. Surely such simple measures as a post box on the gate or a cage around the letter box in the door would do a great deal to protect postal workers. In that context, the ability to prosecute would be a useful tool for the police to employ in the most extreme cases and it could act as an important deterrent, helping to reinforce the message that education programmes are designed to convey.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o22"><a name="90701-0005.htm_para2"><a name="09070159000213">Many other organisations support the measure. The Royal Mail, crucially, is giving it full support, as are the International Institute of Risk and Safety Management, Prospect and the Union of Construction, Allied Trades and Technicians. Unison also supports the measure because of concerns for its members who regularly visit patients and clients at home; while the group safety, health and environment manager of Scottish and Southern Energy has also pledged support. The legal department of the Union of Shop, Distributive and Allied Workers has received 30 claims for dog bites from members over the past two years, the bulk of which were from home delivery workers. In one case, a worker was so severely traumatised by a dog&#146;s attack on her as she delivered goods to a private address that she gave up her job.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o23"><a name="90701-0005.htm_para3"><a name="09070159000214">The case for change is clear and the range of public bodies and members of the public supporting the Bill is growing by the day. The Bill proposes to take the emphasis away from the breed and focus on the deed. Currently, all dogs classified under section 1 of the 1991 Act as belonging to a breed dedicated to fighting are subject to seizure by the police, but on many occasions they are seized only to be registered and handed back to the owners on the grounds that those dogs are responsibly owned and managed. This practice ties up valuable police resources and time, which could be put to better use in tackling the growing problem of so-called status dogs.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o24"><a name="90701-0005.htm_para4"><a name="09070159000215">The current law is not working. RSPCA inspectors, many police officers and local authority wardens are seeing many more different types of large powerful dogs on the streets, and section 1 of the 1991 Act has not had the desired result of preventing the four named types of dogs from becoming established in the UK. It has just not worked. It is the view of the RSPCA, the Dogs Trust and the Kennel Club that it really is time to change the Act in order to allow section 1 dogs to be exempted and added to the register without necessarily being seized&#151;if it is the police&#146;s judgment that that is appropriate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o25"><a name="90701-0005.htm_para5"><a name="09070159000216">As I mentioned earlier, the Bill will focus attention on the deed rather than the breed. It is the action of owners&#151;what they encourage or allow their dogs to do&#151;that is important, rather than the breed or type of  <br>

dog involved. This measure in my Bill is designed to give the police discretion to act accordingly.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o26"><a name="90701-0005.htm_para6"><a name="09070159000217">It is time to take action. Support for these measures is widespread. Furthermore, the Scottish Parliament is legislating on the issue in the Control of Dogs (Scotland) Bill, which was introduced on Monday 22 June. It proposes that warning notices be issued to owners of dogs whose behaviour is deemed to be unacceptable. We should consider doing the same in England as part of a process beginning with education and ending, in the worst cases, with prosecution backed by the appropriate penalties.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o27"><a name="90701-0005.htm_para7"><a name="09070159000218">I understand that Northern Ireland is considering legislative change, as is the Welsh Assembly. England cannot afford to be left out. Its residents deserve the extra protection offered to their Welsh, Scottish and Irish neighbours, and the Bill provides the means to deliver it.</p>

 On a point of order, Sir Michael. There has been a most extraordinary development since we met yesterday. The Justice Committee produced a report to the House this very morning in which it has recommended that clause 10 be not proceeded with. That was decided unanimously, and with a majority of Labour Members present. The Justice Secretary has already indicated that he will not proceed with clause 6, and I am sure that it would assist this Committee&#146;s deliberations considerably if he indicated now whether he is minded to accept the unanimous report of a Select Committee of the House.</p>

Member for North-West Hampshire (Sir George Young) on his amendment. If we are lucky enough, in terms of the timetable and in other respects, we shall deal later with new clauses 7 and 8, which will help to clarify issues relating to the application of article IX of the Bill of Rights 1689 and the supremacy of Parliament. However, I think that we can leave that debate until later.</p>

<p><a name="st_o142"><a name="09070159000235"><a name="90701-0005.htm_spnew3"><a name="09070159001812"><b>Alan Duncan (Rutland and Melton) (Con):</b>
 We are, of course, pleased that the Government have decided to remove clause 6. However, we wish to make clear that that is not because we do not approve of the idea of a code&#151;indeed, we already have one&#151;but because, as the Clerk of the House made clear, the clause would have put us on a collision course with the courts.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o39"><a name="90701-0005.htm_para19"><a name="09070159000236">While I welcome what I expect the Secretary of State for Justice to tell us in a moment, this does rather take us back to the future. I will not rehearse all the arguments that were in my Second Reading speech, but I will say that if clause 6 had remained in the Bill, the legitimate concerns of constituents would have been replaced by the vexatious concerns of litigants.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o40"><a name="90701-0005.htm_para20"><a name="09070159000237">We are, however, disappointed that yesterday, having delighted us by saying that they would withdraw the clause, the Government brought it in again through the back door, in a slightly watered-down form, by changing all the language of clause 5 from the word &#147;rules&#148; to the word &#147;code&#148;. That, in our view, has introduced a new element of confusion. Before the amendments were passed, there was a welcome hint of clarity. The word &#147;code&#148; now refers only to financial interests. It is to some extent sub-divided in the language of clause 5, but, as with the use of the word &#147;standards&#148;, the Government have introduced that element of confusion, which could otherwise have been avoided.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o41"><a name="90701-0005.htm_para21"><a name="09070159000238">I think that the origin is, once again, interference by the Prime Minister.

<p><a name="stpa_o43"><a name="90701-0005.htm_para23"><a name="09070159000240">We are not clear&#151;I am convinced that there is still confusion&#151;about whether that will create the problems surrounding justiciability that the Clerk of the House has already highlighted, but I am afraid that our pleasure at the removal of the clause has been tainted by our disappointment that many of its disadvantageous elements have crept into the Bill elsewhere.</p>

Member for Rutland and Melton (Alan Duncan) that the provisions of clause 5 are completely different from those of clause 6, which we hope will be excised in its entirety in a few seconds. Clause 5 deals with the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority&#151;and, for sure, various statutory duties are imposed on that. The fact that what was previously referred to as financial rules is now defined as a code relating to finance is a rose by any other name in that it does not make any substantive difference. I think I can see a twinkle in the hon. Gentleman&#146;s eye as he understands that point.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o45"><a name="90701-0005.htm_para25"><a name="09070159000244">We will remove clause 6 because we have recognised the serious anxieties expressed, not least by the learned Clerk, and because, as the hon. Gentleman said, it could have encouraged litigious constituents. I might just add, however, that that prospect remains. It happens to be the case that I was the first Member of this House to be subject to legal action from a constituent who believed that they had been badly served by me. That happened at the end of the 2000-01 Session, and a resolution of the House was tabled on that. A completely inadvertent error was made, compounding one made by the local authority, in which the name of an innocent constituent who lived at No. 9 in a street was transposed to the address of a drug dealer against whom the constituent was complaining who lived at No. 11. The local authority transposed the two addresses. My very good member of staff did the same on the basis of the mistake by the local authority, and I was the subject of legal action. The House very kindly decided to indemnify me against the &#163;33,000 that that mistake cost. That risk remains, but I have no wish to compound it.</p>

Investigations. The Bill thus removes a facility that is currently available to Members and which has been used on several occasions in the past couple of years. Amendment 9 would restore that facility.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o57"><a name="90701-0006.htm_para0"><a name="09070159000259">I think it is right that there should be no automatic entitlement for Members to refer their own cases. Currently, the commissioner seeks the agreement of my Select Committee on Standards and Privileges before he proceeds with an investigation into a matter that has been self-referred. In my view, it would be appropriate for the procedures that will be drawn up under this clause to prescribe a similar process whereby a self-referral leads to an investigation only if IPSA gives its assent. For example, there may be allegations made about a Member which receive widespread publicity but nobody actually makes a complaint. The only way in which that Member can have his name cleared is to refer himself, currently to the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards, go round the course and then, hopefully, be cleared. Amendment 9 would replicate that facility in the proposed new regime.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o58"><a name="90701-0006.htm_para1"><a name="09070159000260">Amendment 10 deals with a different point, but it is similar in that the purpose is again to restore a feature of the current system that will otherwise be lost, and which in the opinion of my Committee has worked well. I am referring to the rectification procedure. The amendment allows the new commissioner to rectify certain cases without making a formal report to IPSA. It closely replicates the language of Standing Order No. 150. Typically, cases suited to rectification involve the misuse of a few prepaid envelopes, or an inadvertent and relatively minor error in the content of a letter sent out using the communications allowance. Where the Member accepts that such a relatively minor error has been made and makes the appropriate restitution, the matter can be regarded as dealt with. I fear that if no provision of this kind is made, IPSA will find that it is kept very busy considering reports on relatively minor and inconsequential breaches of the rules.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o59"><a name="90701-0006.htm_para2"><a name="09070159000261">Subsection (4) states:</p>

</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o60"><a name="90701-0006.htm_para3"><a name="09070159000262">If the reports are to be substantive they will, again, involve a lot of work about very little. It would be helpful if the Secretary of State could say something about how that unqualified requirement to report might work in practice.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o61"><a name="90701-0006.htm_para4"><a name="09070159000263">Finally in this group, amendment 11 would require IPSA to consult before it determined a set of procedures applying to the treatment of complaints, the conduct of investigations by the new commissioner and the publication of the commissioner&#146;s reports. The procedures will be of considerable importance to the House, and I am surprised that no provision for consultation was included in the Bill, especially as it very commendably includes consultation provisions in clauses 3, 5 and 11&#151;a fact that should make it easy for the Government to accept this amendment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o62"><a name="90701-0006.htm_para5"><a name="09070159000264">I would have preferred the new commissioner rather than IPSA to be in the driving seat when it comes to drawing up the investigation procedures, and my failure to table an amendment to that effect is but one more symptom of the haste with which this Bill is being put through. I have, however, tabled such an amendment for Report, and it would be helpful if the Secretary of State could comment now on whether he will accept it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o63"><a name="90701-0006.htm_para6"><a name="09070159000265">A further question arises on this clause: its relationship with clause 9. Given that all the alleged breaches of the rules that the commissioner may investigate under clause 7 will also be offences under subsections (1) or (2) of clause 9, do the Government expect the commissioner to be at all busy, because these will now be criminal offences&#151;and is it not the case that all serious breaches will be handled by the police, leaving only relatively minor cases such as the misuse of prepaid envelopes and the inadvertent inclusion of a party logo in a letter funded by the communications allowance to be investigated by the commissioner? Therefore, what exactly will the work load be?</p>

 I will not detain the House for long, and I apologise for not having been present at the beginning of our proceedings&#151;although not so that I could have moved the amendment in my name in the previous group; I had no intention of wasting the House&#146;s time on that, given the Secretary of State&#146;s statement that he was withdrawing the clause concerned.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o66"><a name="90701-0006.htm_para9"><a name="09070159000269">My particular concern relates to a personal experience, which I discussed in abstract terms with the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards, so as to avoid lobbying him about a complaint that might arrive in his in-tray. I had found that I had inadvertently breached the rules, so I went to him to present him with a letter, which was, in effect, a self-referral. He said that he was minded not to accept it, but when I asked him what action he would take, he said that he would wait for a complaint. I then asked him what he would advise me to do, to which he said that he could not advise me, because he might receive a complaint and have to adjudicate on the case. I asked him which servant of the House of Commons could advise me on the matter, but he told me that nobody could. I then asked whether I should seek legal advice&#151;that seems to relate to the import of my right hon. Friend&#146;s amendment&#151;but he said that his body discourages from people taking legal advice because it makes its proceedings so much more protracted.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o67"><a name="90701-0006.htm_para10"><a name="09070159000270">I have great sympathy with that view, and now that, between IPSA and the commissioner, we are having a separation between the management of rules, and the investigation of and adjudication on breaches, it should be simple for IPSA and/or the commissioner&#151;here I link my amendment 45 with my amendment 46, which seeks to amend clause 8&#151;to ensure that a servant of IPSA or a Clerk in the service of the House, which means someone who does not cost the Member money and does not cost the House of Commons additional money, is made available to the Member who is subject  <br>

to an investigation or to a direction by the commissioner under clause 8. There should be an informal way of ensuring that right hon. and hon. Members have access to independent advice without having to resort to expensive lawyers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o68"><a name="90701-0006.htm_para11"><a name="09070159000271">That would be simple to arrange, and my two amendments seek to put those obligations on IPSA and the commissioner to ensure that that advice is afforded to Members without additional and unnecessary expense. That would avoid the situation wherein hon. Members are left completely isolated in a system that they are fighting. The accusations may be unjust or arise out of a misunderstanding, but we still ought to have a means of providing, in a fairly relaxed way, relatively informal advice. Obviously it remains open to a Member of Parliament to obtain formal legal advice if he or she so chooses, but I hope that my proposal would save right hon. and hon. Members a great deal of anxiety, while also giving comfort to IPSA and the commissioner that the Member was capable of dealing with the matter in a informed and practical way, and was not being left on his own or facing huge legal expenses.</p>

 I shall speak to amendment 48 and new clauses 5 and 11, which I have tabled to give effect to recommendations made in the report of the Joint Committee on Human Rights. The Committee&#146;s concern was about the need to ensure that Members receive a fair hearing throughout this process. It is often said that human rights are all about unpopular causes and, as I said on Second Reading, there cannot be many more unpopular causes around at the moment than us.

 I can well understand that it may be necessary to require discovery of documents, but as clause 7(3) is drafted, it would enable a Member to be required to produce &#147;any information&#148;, and that raises issues of self-incrimination. Perhaps we should look carefully at the clause to see whether it can be tightened to apply only to the disclosure of appropriate documents, and does not require Members to incriminate themselves.</p>

 My hon. Friend is right, and it is a scandal that we did not even discuss such a vital protection yesterday. The theme running through the whole of these proceedings is that there is no case for treating this Bill as an emergency.

As I understand it&#151;if I am wrong, I trust that the Justice Secretary will correct me&#151;the same rules will apply to trivial or inadvertent offences. Many such offences will be referred to the commissioner as part of the party political contests in each constituency. Many people are itching to refer to the new commissioner matters that may be important locally but which, in the great scheme of things, are oversights that could be easily corrected. The commissioner will have to investigate all such matters, in order to decide whether they are unimportant or trivial, and will then have no option but to make a report to IPSA on his findings, under clause 7(4). The very fact of making any inquiry&#151;even if the conclusion is that no action need be taken&#151;must lead to a report. That will be immensely bureaucratic, and it is likely that in the intervening weeks the Member&#146;s local paper will highlight the fact that he or she is under investigation by the commissioner.

Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed (Sir Alan Beith) about the possible role of the courts in this matter. Serious offences will of course be subject to the criminal law on fraud, theft and false accounting. In addition, and unnecessarily, we will also import some more criminal offences into the Bill. I am especially concerned by the word &#147;reasonably&#148; in clause 7(3). It could be judiciable&#151;it will, after all, appear in statute law. I can imagine a case in which the commissioner gets into a dispute with a Member under investigation&#151;for what may well be a serious matter&#151;who resists having to disclose personal tax records. The commissioner may demand those records, on the grounds that that is the only way in which the evidence can be found for income received that should have been disclosed. Or the financial disclosure requirements could require the production of names and addresses of professional clients or customers, in the case of a business. The Member concerned may consider, reasonably, that that would be improper and that he owes a duty of confidentiality to his customers or clients. So there may be a genuine dispute between a Member and the commissioner&#151;an external person, appointed by the Crown and therefore with no particular duty to or affection for the House, and driven by public opinion. The Member concerned may feel that he is on the receiving end of unfair inquiries.</p>

Experience teaches me, however, that legal advice is never informal. One either gets legal advice or one does not. It seems to me that his suggestion, superficially attractive though it is, is a parliamentary equivalent of the legal aid duty solicitor scheme. For many years, I trawled around the police cells of the north and north-east of Scotland as part of that admirable scheme, and although I find the proposal not unattractive, even a legal aid duty solicitor has a direct lawyer-client relationship from which there can be no departure. The standard of service and care, as well as the duty of care, that is owed by the legal aid duty solicitor to the client in the cells is exactly the same as that which would be owed by any City solicitor to a blue-chip client.</p>

 I did not say &#147;informal legal advice&#148;, but &#147;advice&#148;. In fact, my amendment referred to &#147;advice and counsel&#148;. Let us suppose a Clerk of the House was allocated the duty of advising Members who were the subject of complaints, or of advising Members on how to conduct themselves if they believe that they have broken the rules. It seems quite reasonable that an hon. Member should have someone in the House to turn to. They might well say, &#147;Well, in your circumstances you should go and get legal advice,&#148; but we should avoid somebody&#146;s having to take that step initially as it might be quite a low-level complaint. There should be some way of dealing with low-level complaints without resorting to lawyers.</p>

 Although one might argue about the legalities, surely the proper position is to say that the hon. Member should have an opportunity to take legal advice. It would be for the hon.

It is a basic statement of best practice and I do not see what part of it could be objected to. I, too, will listen to the Secretary of State when he responds on that point.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o91"><a name="90701-0007.htm_para6"><a name="09070159000311">Let me return to the practicalities of all this. The hon. Member for Hendon has tabled a new clause that will rebalance the rights and obligations under the Bill in a way that is very necessary. However, if we go down that track, what is there by way of effective investigation? It is in the nature of investigation that we do not always know what we are looking for when we start. Although much of what we have here provides necessary protection for the rights of the person being investigated, as consequences could subsequently flow to him, will we have an inquisitorial process that achieves the objective that we aim it to have at this stage?</p>

 It is a question of checks and balances. The system at the moment is reasonably well balanced because the consequences that can flow from an investigation are that much more restrictive. It is clear from the Bill, and from clause 9 in particular, that a lot more could follow by way of consequences in the future. That is where the inquisitorial element, I fear, could become deficient at the end of the day. The hon. Gentleman&#146;s amendments are good, well founded and necessary. However, I fear that as a consequence of the effectiveness of the Bill as a whole, we will be left with a system that will not work as well as it ought to. That is the consequence of the Government&#146;s having proceeded in the way in which they have.

within what we like to call parliamentary privilege, it certainly happens in-House.

<p><a name="stpa_o105"><a name="90701-0007.htm_para20"><a name="09070159000335">I have the most serious concerns about what we are doing. If we confine the commissioner&#146;s activities to looking at our expenses and salaries, there will be no great difficulty, and that was exemplified in the evidence given yesterday by the Clerk of the House to the Justice Committee. However, conflicts will start to arise once we stray outside of that, and the potential will grow for the courts to intrude into the House&#146;s affairs in ways that touch on our constitutional responsibilities. I hope that the Secretary of State will be open minded now&#151;I suspect that he will be, as it has been hinted that he may accept some of the amendments&#151;and that he will also bear what I have said in mind when we consider later amendments.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o106"><a name="90701-0007.htm_para21"><a name="09070159000336">Finally, my hon. Friend the Member for North Essex (Mr. Jenkin) has also tabled some amendments that highlight areas of anxiety in exactly the same way. I hope that the Secretary of State will be able to provide some reassurance that those problems will be addressed. It may be that they can be addressed now, but they could also be dealt with by looking at the matter in its totality. We need a proper set of rules to govern investigation and inquiry, and those rules should also cover hon. Members&#146; ability to get proper advice as an investigation proceeds.</p>

 I shall be brief, but there are two points that I would like to put to the House. Parliaments tend to get known by particular names. The other week in the Chamber, the hon. Member for Cannock Chase (Dr. Wright) talked about how this Parliament would come to be known in the future. I fear that it may go down as the tarnished or tainted Parliament. Among those of us who have sat in this Chamber in the past few weeks, it will certainly go down as the depressed Parliament. I look forward to the next Parliament and hope that its Members can perform their duties untrammelled, both here and in their constituencies.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o107"><a name="90701-0007.htm_para22"><a name="09070159000338">However, we must have regard to one overriding fact in that context. The new Parliament, no matter who decides to go or stay, will contain many new Members. Some papers calculate that half the new Parliament could be composed of Members who have never sat here before. However many new Members there are, it will be a lot. Those new Members will come here, as we all did at one stage, somewhat overwhelmed by the honour of being here, I trust, and somewhat perplexed by the rules of our procedures, which we all have to try to learn. There will be a new dimension, too, provided by the Bill, which the House is rushing through this week. It worries me very much that that new Parliament could come to be known as the frightened Parliament, or the blighted Parliament.</p>

We all know from our constituencies that if we read that somebody has been arrested on a particular charge, a question mark automatically flashes up in our minds about the integrity of that person, even though we all subscribe to &#147;innocent until proven guilty&#148;. How dreadful it would be if 50 or 60&#151;the number could even run to three figures&#151;new colleagues in a new Parliament were subject to some form of orchestrated complaint, or to a series of complaints.

I didn&#146;t look sufficiently carefully at that, and now I have signed it off and all those letters have gone out.

By the time that it is fully in force, it will probably be the turn of the year; the Justice Secretary made that point. However, by May or June next year, there will be a new Parliament. If the Act, as it will then be, hangs above that Parliament like the sword of Damocles, just think of the effect that that could have. I therefore beg the Secretary of State to accept the amendments&#151;or, at the very least, their spirit&#151;and to try to inject into the Bill a note of discernment and discrimination between the trivial and the serious. If he does not, we will pass an Act that will have a very bad effect on the next Parliament.</p>

Friend the Member for North-West Hampshire (Sir George Young), for the reasons that were advanced by my hon. Friend the Member for South Staffordshire (Sir Patrick Cormack). It is entirely right to say that individual Members could face vexatious complaints, and that would be very bad because it would put the hon.

report. It also has the support of the Committee on Standards in Public Life. Those are two all-party committees of considerable authority, and the fact that they are both signed up to the new clause seems to be of considerable importance. As the hon. Gentleman said, the commissioner&#146;s report could have dire consequences for the future of any right hon. or hon. Member affected by that report. That is even more true of the IPSA report. It is therefore important that the House should try to ensure that the process is conducted in accordance with the rules of natural justice. The hon. Gentleman&#146;s new clause ensures that that happens.</p>

The process has two stages&#151;at least, it does at the moment, but there may be more later. The first stage is the investigation by the commissioner, leading to a report to IPSA. IPSA is then obliged to enable the right hon. or hon. Member to make representations, so there is a second stage. I am not entirely clear&#151;this is a matter for further consideration&#151;about whether all the protection afforded by new clause 11 should apply to both stages or one stage. That is a matter on which there needs to be some reflection. My feeling, at this stage, is that the full panoply of the protections should apply to the hearing of the representations by IPSA, and that there should be a lesser stage of protection relating to the inquiry undertaken by the commissioner. The commissioner should be obliged to accord quite a lot of protection to the hon. Member concerned, but not the full panoply that is contemplated in new clause 11. That full panoply should be confined to the IPSA hearing.</p>

Gentleman about this, but if a member of the public&#151;and we are not talking about vexatious complaints; if they are vexatious, hopefully they can be dismissed at an early stage&#151;makes a genuine complaint it is important that even if there is no formal report by the commissioner, they are told what has happened.

It made a difference to me to be able to spell out the conclusion, which was that I could continue to be a Member of Parliament. The most recent complaint was about my repetition of an entirely inadvertent error by my constituency party treasurer, who received a donation that he misrecorded, without misleading anybody&#151;it was from one of two companies owned by the same person&#151;and I repeated the error, because I obtained the information from him. How else could I have obtained it? The newspapers made quite a lot of the fact that I had been referred to the Electoral Commission by a Member of the House, and it took a bit of work to get them to accept that there was a further story, and that I had been cleared by the Electoral Commission.

Friend the Member for Middlesbrough have continued their clean sweep&#151;every one a winner&#151;so I shall now turn to the other amendments. The hon. Member for North Essex (Mr. Jenkin) tabled amendment 45, which states:</p>

stage, there should be provision for some advice.

 I remember the generality of discussions on the Scotland Act, but I certainly would not be able to recall exactly what I said in the course of that debate. The Secretary of State must accept that since I have been in the House I have said pretty consistently that the tendency of the House, and particularly the Government, to impose new criminal sanctions&#151;I think that more than 3,000 have been created since 1997, mostly of a regulatory nature&#151;appears to have done nothing to benefit our country whatsoever, and is a habit that we would do well to cease.</p>

 We try not to have criminal offences unless they are necessary. The hon. and learned Gentleman makes a nice rhetorical point, but when one goes into the detail of those offences, one discovers far less enthusiasm for removing them from the statute book. I have had a lot of correspondence from the leader of the Liberal Democrats, who has waxed eloquent on those 3,000 offences. I have asked him to name which of them he would repeal, were he ever in a position to do so. We have got it down to two out of 3,000. I also set that homework to the hon. and learned Gentleman. I accept that Members will need advice, but provision does not necessarily need to be made in the Bill. They ought to receive advice&#151;indeed, advice is available&#151;here, but I will certainly take the proposal away and think about it. I promise the hon.

It is probably sensible to look at the more comprehensive new clause 11 first.

Clause 7(6) seeks to capture that injunction, and I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for Hendon (Mr. Dismore) and his Committee for their further, rapid consideration of the matter. However, there are some issues that we need to think about. I invite my hon. Friend to accept that we do not have a vote on the matter, and I in turn will accept that what is in subsection (6) will need to be added to, though perhaps not in the detail he proposes.  <br>

There is one point that I need to raise in respect of subsection (g), which is the standard of proof, but I accept that there should be greater clarity about the rights of those who are subject to a report by the commissioner.</p>

He argued&#151;I paraphrase&#151;that the commissioner carries out a preliminary investigation, which must of course be fair. Now that we have accepted amendment 10, the commissioner, if he so judges, makes a report to the authority. Plainly, less elaborate processes can apply in respect of that initial consideration by the commissioner.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o122"><a name="90701-0008.htm_para14"><a name="09070159000363">I emphasise the point that, paradoxically, the overall process that we are providing under the Bill is more substantial and provides more inbuilt protections for Members&#151;<i> [Interruption.]</i> Yes, it does, I say to my hon.

Because there will be a complaint, whether it is a self-referral or an external complaint, to the commissioner and an investigation by the commissioner. The commissioner then produces a report, which goes to the authority. We are making extensive provision for an arm&#146;s length relationship between the authority and the commissioner.</p>

When the matter goes to the Committee, the normal rights of Members before the Standards and Privileges Committee, and from there to the Floor of the House, apply. Although under our current proposals the authority may recommend that a Member be suspended or expelled, the decision on that or a further recommendation is for the Standards and Privileges Committee and then for the Floor of the House.</p>

I want to think about the matter. I also want the opportunity to go through the drafting of the new clause in more detail. That is not in the least a complaint to my hon. Friend.

 I want to remind the House of this, and it is fundamental: it is astonishing how quickly the focus of a debate and of concern in the House can move, but there is a public outside that remains highly sceptical, as well as cynical, about the way we have operated our affairs up to now. We must bear that in mind all the time. One of the major problems that has been faced in this terrible expenses scandal is that no one outside the House accepted the legitimacy of decisions made by the Fees Office or any other part of the House about whether an expenses claim was or was not acceptable. That is why there must be an external adjudication of such decisions.</p>

We need to end up with a situation where, if there were misconduct&#151;not inadvertence, error or light negligence, but misconduct&#151;by a Member, that could lead to a criminal prosecution and/or discipline in the House, and equally, where there is an allegation against a Member, but that allegation falls to be dismissed by the authority&#151;or subsequently by the Standards and Privileges Committee, but let us leave it at the authority&#151;that is accepted as having authority behind it.</p>

One of the serious concerns that I have about a raft of amendments that have been tabled&#151;not, I may say, by the right hon.

hon. Member for Hendon (Mr. Dismore) clarified that it would apply only to the authority stage because it refers specifically to subsection (5). But let us remember that subsection (5) states:</p>
<a name="90701-0008.htm_brev1"><a name="09070159001592"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;The IPSA must determine&#151;</p>

</ul><a name="90701-0008.htm_brev3"><a name="09070159001594"><ul><p class="tabletext">(b) procedures in relation to complaints under subsection (2)(c);</p>
</ul><a name="90701-0008.htm_brev4"><a name="09070159001595"><ul><p class="tabletext">(c) procedures in relation to the circumstances in which a report under subsection (4) is to be published.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o127"><a name="90701-0008.htm_para19"><a name="09070159000373">So IPSA clearly applies to two stages in relation to the investigation, and proposed new paragraphs (a) to (g) of subsection (5) would apply separately in relation to the procedures, because new clause 11 begins with:</p>


<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090701/debtext/90701-0009.htm"/>

Clearly, something needs to be remedied and clarified if we are to get the measure right.</p>

 I accept that new clause 11, in relation to where it fits in the jigsaw of the process, might need tidying up. That is a fair point, but I am more concerned about the principle of the requirement for a fair hearing, and my right hon. Friend still has not said whether he objects in principle to proposed new paragraphs (a) to (f) as far as IPSA is concerned. They are the minimum requirements of natural justice and of article 6.</p>

Member is dealt with in respect of a transgression. That, I assume, includes everything from an apology in the Chamber, through a suspension from the service of the House, to&#151;the House has exercised this once since the second world war&#151;the expulsion of a Member.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o157"><a name="90701-0009.htm_para29"><a name="09070159000415">The problem is that the Standards and Privileges Committee will then have to consider whether it agrees with IPSA&#146;s recommendation. If the Committee decides to agree, any public perception that it has been influenced by an outside body in reaching its own decision will be unfortunate. Of course, the Committee might decide for whatever reason that it wants to impose a different penalty, which need not be less severe than that which IPSA recommends. However, as the clause stands, it will embody in statute a specific reference to the Standards and Privileges Committee and to its powers, and they would then be judicially reviewable through the courts.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o158"><a name="90701-0009.htm_para30"><a name="09070159000416">The consequence of the Committee&#146;s powers being judicially reviewable through the courts goes to the absolute heart of Parliament&#146;s independence and what the Bill of Rights of 1689 was all about, given its insistence that what this Parliament does cannot be called into question elsewhere. From the current drafting of subsection (2), I really do not see how we can escape that conclusion. Indeed, it is noteworthy that witnesses who submitted either written or oral evidence to the Justice Committee stated very clearly that that outcome was undesirable. Professor Dawn Oliver said:</p>

I wonder why some of the subsections are there at all. They start dealing with issues relating to the punishment of Members by the House itself. Subsection (6) mentions an agreement between IPSA and the Speaker&#146;s Committee on the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority on a protocol that requires a number of different people to work together. That protocol includes the Committee on Standards and Privileges.</p>

Committee on Standards and Privileges. I have never heard of a great public controversy because it was doing its job badly. We have not been told that its justice has been inadequate. We have not felt that people have been hard done by under it. We have not felt that those who deserved to be punished have gone unpunished. It is not an issue. It is extraordinary that we are being asked to overturn that and to make the Committee subsidiary to an outside body when there is no case against it and no charge sheet that anyone has heard about. I would like to concentrate on the need, as my hon. and learned Friend said, to recast the clause, if it has to stay at all, in a way that deals with the big issue of how IPSA appears to be superior to the Committee on Standards and Privileges and how it seems to have overturned the Bill of Rights.</p>

As currently drafted, it does not make clear the relative powers and responsibilities of IPSA vis- -vis the commissioner or the House of Commons Committee on Standards and Privileges. The subsection invites us to agree to a form of words whereby, although we know as legislators that it will not work in its current form and that the Government have not had time to work out how it might function, we would ask IPSA to consult the Speaker&#146;s Committee on the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority in preparing a statement saying how all these different bodies could work together smoothly and harmoniously in a way that ensured that no difficult case fell between the gaps and that people were not put through double and triple jeopardy for no good reason. Under the list in that subsection, IPSA has to consult the commissioner, the House of Commons Committee on Standards and Privileges, the Director of Public Prosecutions, the Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis, the Speaker&#146;s Committee on the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority, and any other person that they may have forgotten about. We can see what an absurd, burgeoning bureaucracy this is.</p>

 The right hon. Gentleman raises an important point about clause 8(6). Surely the crucial question is this: could the protocol that is drawn up by IPSA end up giving obligations to everybody else on the list?

IPSA could publish and try to assert its view regardless, because it appears that it is primus inter pares in these matters. No procedure is set down for reconciling disputes between the Speaker&#146;s Committee and IPSA. The implication is that once IPSA has published, preferably with the agreement of the Speaker&#146;s Committee, then that is the statement from which not only this House but the courts, if they become involved, will have to operate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o177"><a name="90701-0010.htm_para11"><a name="09070159000452">That is totally unacceptable. We are being asked to override not only the Standards and Privileges Committee but our own law-making powers by delegating a crucial element in how this complex and bureaucratic system is going to work to a draft from IPSA that it could not possibly undertake for several months until we know who the chief executive is and that person has a staff who can get to work and take advice. Presumably they would then come to see right hon. and hon. Members from the Standards and Privileges Committee. However, as the drafting makes clear, they do not have to take the view of those Members&#151;they can come up with their own independent view and assert that.</p>

Over a period of 20, 30 or possibly more years we have all seen, and those of us with experience in local government have felt at the sharp end, what has happened to our local government. Those who care about our democracy have seen it, too. Through perhaps 40 or 50 Acts of Parliament, the ability of local government to act independently has been stripped or sliced away.

 Indeed, and the louder the Government talk about democratising the House of Commons, the more careful we ought to be to study the legislation that comes forward. There is talk about reforming the House through a Select Committee, for example, but at the moment there is no resolution to establish such a Committee, and no terms of reference that command agreement throughout the House have yet been on the Order Paper.</p>

 I pay tribute to the hon. Gentleman for his work over a sustained period to try to get the House to take more power over the Executive.

 That is a measure of the fear with which Governments unnecessarily view this House. If we have a strong House of Commons and a strong Parliament, Government themselves are the main beneficiary. We have better value for money, better legislation and more public involvement, and it does not require eight efforts to get child support legislation right. At least once a year we try to get the criminal justice system right. We should have proper pre-legislative and post-legislative scrutiny, yet there are those in government who run in fear of that, wishing instead to have legislation drafted by unelected officials in their Departments and rubber-stamped by the House. We all lose in that deal, and we could all win in a deal whereby a strong Executive had self-confidence and the judgment to take the view of the House when it had been properly and responsibly expressed. The only greater beneficiary than the Government would be the British people.</p>

 I do not want to stray too far from the clause, but one day, when we have a self-respecting and self-confident Parliament, we will have our own parliamentary draftspeople and our own right to legal advice on going to war or whatever it may be. We will have our own capabilities to transform the legislative framework. At the moment, we have an Executive who are not directly elected by the British people taking the advice of a civil service that has no familiarity whatever with the ballot box. Members of this House are being overseen by people who have no understanding of electoral politics and our democracy, but who decide on the rights of Members. Those rights have been sacred&#151;perhaps too sacred, but they have been in place for many years. I hope that colleagues will press their case to the Secretary of State, and that he will take away the expressions of anxiety that he has heard in the past day or so&#151;and will hear until the end of the day&#151;and rework the Bill so that it does what we all thought it intended to do: create a strong parliamentary standards authority to ensure that abuses that have happened in the past cannot happen in future. As part of that, it should construct a much broader framework, so that our legislature, rather than becoming a quango, an advisory body or a quaint but withered part of our constitutional arrangements, can play not only the role that it fulfilled in years gone by, but an important role in rebuilding our democracy and people&#146;s trust, which has been so sorely tested in the past month or two.</p>

 The shadow of the guillotine is beginning to fall over our debate, so I will not follow up the very interesting speech of the hon. Member for Nottingham, North (Mr. Allen), with whom I agree about many parliamentary matters, but focus on issues that directly concern the Committee on Standards and Privileges and enforcement.</p>

Friend the Member for Wokingham (Mr. Redwood), who said that the aspect of the Bill that we are considering is not the problem. The problem has not been the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards and the Standards and Privileges Committee. We operate downstream, and the problems have been upstream, with processing and making claims. We do not process claims; we process complaints, and I believe that that part of the system has operated well.</p>

The House has been well served by Philip Mawer and now by John Lyon. The Committee on which I serve has tried to operate the rules of the House dispassionately and fairly. In his evidence to the Committee on Standards in Public Life, which is now sitting, Anthony King said that that part of the system works quite well. Clause 8 would dismantle it at breakneck speed and try to replace it. By doing that at speed, one may not get it right.</p>

tough enough. In the speech that the Leader of the House made a few days ago, she referred to the long time that had elapsed since someone was expelled. My hon. and learned Friend the Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Grieve) did not make it clear that the Standards and Privileges Committee simply makes recommendations on the tariff to the House. It is open to any Member and to the Government to amend the tariffs recommended by the Standards and Privileges Committee if they think that they are too lenient or too tough.</p>

For that, it substitutes a power to refer its findings to the Committee. That would broadly replicate the current position, whereby the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards reports his findings to the Standards and Privileges Committee, which then determines the appropriate sanction. I support that amendment because it replicates, as far as possible, the current position. I remind the House that my Committee has said that it would be prepared to have lay members serving on it if that helped solve the problem that the Government identified of our being somehow out of touch with the outside world.</p>

Member for Castle Point (Bob Spink) made a point about that&#151;while leaving in place the provision that allows him to carry out an investigation into a case that has already been the subject of such proceedings. That is crucial. We cannot have a position whereby a Member is subject to competing jurisdictions for the same offence.

We claim that we want to create an independent parliamentary standards authority, yet, at every turn, we assert the sovereignty of Parliament and say that there must be a dual control brake on anything that IPSA or an investigator might do. We need to get real. The public feel little about the sovereignty of Parliament, which we value and discuss here, but are very angry about the avarice of parliamentarians, as they perceive it and as has been represented over past months. People want to know that we will allow any independent standards authority that we create to be independent. Yes, we should ensure that there cannot be excesses and that there are limits. We must also ensure protection for Members&#146; rights and reputations, individually and collectively.

 We all understand the public anger, but we cannot simply have a knee-jerk reaction&#151;I see the Justice Secretary frowning, unusually. If we understand the significance of parliamentary sovereignty and the public do not, and we knowingly impair it, we will damage hugely the interests of our constituents and our ability to serve them. It is nothing to do with protecting us, but with safeguarding the fundamental rights of the British people and our powers in this place to represent them. We must not allow the Bill to impair that fundamental principle. If we do so, we do grave damage to our constituents.</p>

 I thank the hon. Gentleman for that point. None of us wants to do damage to the sovereignty of Parliament.

I have heard more from some hon. Members about the sovereignty of Parliament and about standing up to the Executive and not being cowed in relation to this Bill than I heard in relation to measures such as the Counter-Terrorism Act 2008, when Parliament really should have asserted itself and when a lot of people should, in good conscience, have known that something was wrong. The same goes for identity cards.

sovereignty of Parliament in relation to parliamentary standards and the privileges and rights of Members than they have been in relation to the wider interests of their constituents and the citizens of the United Kingdom. So let us get real all round. It is not just the Executive who have questions to answer; all of us have questions that we should perhaps ask of ourselves and that we should answer.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o194"><a name="90701-0011.htm_para10"><a name="09070159000484">Amendment 32 is sensible. The idea of the authority making recommendations and just giving them to the Standards and Privileges Committee on a hand-me-down basis seems crude and excessive. Amendment 32 would deal with that, thereby obviating the need for amendments 17 and 65, which would seem to be sensible. Some of the other amendments, however, I am not so sure about. Amendment 34 would mean leaving out clause 8(4), which would in turn mean leaving out subsection (5). I do not know that it would be right to leave those two subsections out. There would then be a hole in the procedures and a hole in the Bill, although some fine-tuning may still be needed.</p>

 It is very simple: if the hon. Gentleman reads the report of the Select Committee on Justice, he will see that everything after clause 8(4) does nothing to add to the regulatory powers of the IPSA, but everything to undermine the independence of this House. By taking out one, the rest fall down like a domino, and that is why it should go.</p>

 That is also why, if people think that we have to be cautious, because the legislation has been brought forward in haste, I would be cautious about demolishing parts of it in haste. We need to consider whether we are getting the tuning of the Bill exactly right.</p>

 I can understand the hon. Gentleman&#146;s caution. In particular, he was right to remind the House of the importance of the independent handling of expenses, salaries and finances. However, if we are cautious about what we allow to go through in the Bill, so that it focuses on that core function, but then decide after more consideration that there are other functions or ways in which we want to go further, that it is surely safer than allowing things to creep through in the Bill that are dangerous or have risks attached, and then repenting at leisure as we try to sort them all out.</p>

 I fully agree. Indeed, I have supported a number of amendments and, even in this bunch, there are a number that I would support and some that, if adopted, would make the need for others disappear. However, I worry that some of the amendments would go so far as to leave a significant hole in the Bill. That might provide a site for which planning permission could be given to do more things in relation to other issues.

should have amended subsection (6), so that it said that IPSA and the Speaker&#146;s committee or the Standards and Privileges Committee would seek to agree protocols with &#147;the following&#148;. Instead, subsection (6) says that IPSA will prepare a statement or a protocol on how &#147;the following&#148; will work together.

What has been a cause for concern is the determination of privilege in this House, and particularly whether it should stay within its precincts or whether, in line with Congress in the US, it can be subordinated to the Supreme Court in that case, or to the courts of law in our case. It has always been my view that conveying parliamentary privileges to the courts for them to determine our actions, our speeches, our proceedings in Committee and the like not only destroys the essential pillar of our democracy&#151;the pillar that protects to the Member of Parliament on the Floor of this House&#151;but prevents a Member from seeking to defend the constituents who sent him here.

of redress would be somewhat diminished if our proceedings were to be interpreted elsewhere and a determination of them made elsewhere. That would certainly destroy the essence and basis of the House of Commons as we know it, which would do a great disservice to past generations and also to future generations of parliamentarians.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o217"><a name="90701-0012.htm_para3"><a name="09070159000521">I am grateful to Dr. Malcolm Jack and the Clerks for putting together a very important and significant document to deal with the problem. If I may, I will happily paraphrase liberally what it says. As I understand clause 8, which deals with enforcement, it raises a number of questions of principle relating to privilege. Clause 8(2) identifies recommendations to the Committee on Standards and Privileges that would be covered by parliamentary privilege, but if the Committee declined to act on a recommendation, it could presumably become the basis of legal proceedings in which the Commissioner, or someone else, sought to require the Committee to comply. In my humble and respectful submission, Mrs. Heal, it is not enough to argue that clause 8(2) speaks only of a recommendation, as the extent to which a reasonable recommendation should be accepted would itself become a matter for determination by the courts and a matter of interpretation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o218"><a name="90701-0012.htm_para4"><a name="09070159000522">Clause 8(5) appears to make the exercise by the House of its disciplinary powers a matter of statute, since it seems to confer on the House a statutory permission to exercise those powers in the circumstances provided for in the subsection. If the circumstances in which the House may exercise disciplinary powers became a question of law, it would then be open to challenge before the courts. There are a number of examples that I could provide here, but I am aware of the guillotine on our proceedings and I would not wish to delay the Committee in its consideration of my amendments and others. It could be argued, however, that it is only the &#147;failure&#148; under clause 8(4) and no other, that may be punishable by the House. That would be a question requiring determination by the courts.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o219"><a name="90701-0012.htm_para5"><a name="09070159000523">Clause 8(6) requires IPSA to prepare a protocol on how IPSA, the Commissioner, the House of Commons Committee on Standards and Privileges, the Director of Public Prosecutions, the Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis, and any other person whom IPSA considers appropriate, are going to work with each other. Given the various examples of the intervention of the police in our precincts and their involvement in politics over the last few years, I am not entirely sure that the Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis will be very enthusiastic about embracing that concept. I would not imagine, or dare to suppose, what the Director of Public Prosecutions would say to that, either. It is not clear to me whether this is meant to impose any obligation on any of the parties to observe the protocol. Again, this will be a question of law to be determined by the courts. If it imposes an obligation&#151;and there seems little point in having such a protocol unless it does impose some sort of obligation&#151;it raises the question of whether IPSA should be entitled to bind a Committee of the House as to how it is to conduct its own work. An analogous issue arises for the DPP in the exercise of his discretions as to whether proceedings should be fettered.</p>

 Hon. Members in all parts of the House are making valiant attempts to improve this part of the Bill. I support most of the amendments, but this is essentially a fruitless exercise because we are trying to improve a Bill that is irretrievably broken. The debate we have had on this clause highlights that; it shows the problems caused when an attempt to fix the allowances system becomes, during the course of the Bill&#146;s passage, an attempt to reform large chunks of the British constitution. If that was the aim, it should have been admitted right at the start, and the attempt to achieve it should have been approached with due humility and after a good deal of deliberation. Instead, we are now stumbling around the constitution, touching on very delicate matters of immunities, rights and privileges. If such reforms are necessary, they should be the subject of an entirely different piece of legislation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o232"><a name="90701-0012.htm_para18"><a name="09070159000541">What we are doing in this Bill is setting up new bodies and creating new appointments with new powers and responsibilities, but the relationships between them all are very unclear. They overlap, and they conflict in a number of important respects. That is very well illustrated by subsection (6), under which this entire matter is to be postponed to a &#147;protocol&#148; to be drawn up by one of the new bodies&#151;the super-quango itself, IPSA&#151;to try to find a way of ordering the relationships between the bodies, both old and new. If the protocol is to be effective, it will have to be an extraordinarily long document.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o233"><a name="90701-0012.htm_para19"><a name="09070159000542">I do not know who in IPSA will do this work, as I do not know what the staffing arrangements will be, but they are going to have to try to order the relationship between the police and this House, for instance. We all know that that is a very difficult matter and we glimpsed that in the police raid on an hon. Member&#146;s office. One aspect of that was that a computer that was seized probably contained material that touched on matters of the House and proceedings in the House; it certainly contained files that held material relating to other hon. Members. Wisely, the police did not proceed with that prosecution, but that matter of privilege was said to be the subject of an extensive document&#151;which I have not seen yet. That is just one tiny example of the problems under an unwritten constitution of ordering the relationships between the external enforcement authorities&#151;the police&#151;and this House and its Committees. So if we are to codify the entire relationship, not only the one between the House and the police, but the one between the Director of Public Prosecutions and other persons unknown, and the relationships involving IPSA and the commissioner, that will require a real volume in itself and it is all unnecessary.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o234"><a name="90701-0012.htm_para20"><a name="09070159000543">The dangerous part is that the protocol will, by definition, restrict this House. If it were not to do so, it would be a completely pointless document. There is no point having a protocol that does not do something, because it, thus, merely becomes a declaration. It becomes a bit of a new Labour totemic label: something that is desirable but has no effect. If something is in an Act of Parliament, it is designed to bind and to impose obligations,  <br>

and one of the bodies on which this Bill will impose obligations is the Standards and Privileges Committee. It is wrong that that should be done in a protocol drawn up by an external body. If the Bill is intended to bind this House in this way, that should be openly admitted by those on the Treasury Bench. Of course, our Committees work to rules in Standing Orders, but this Bill means that they will obtain instructions in a protocol drawn up by other people. If that is intended, it should be admitted. If it is not intended, it should be withdrawn.</p>

The key point is that nothing in the Bill takes away the inherent powers of the House to discipline its Members as it thinks fit. In fact, there is a provision that makes it clear that nothing in the Bill prevents the House from exercising its disciplinary functions other than following an IPSA process.

I understand that amendment 65 concerns fears about how the courts will react to a new regulatory scheme. In particular, there is a concern that the Standards and Privileges Committee could be subject to judicial review for failing to follow a recommendation. The Bill does not repeal article IX of the Bill of Rights&#151;nor does it disapply it. In the absence of an explicit provision or necessary implication, a court will continue to read article IX as applying. There is clearly no necessary implication in these provisions that article IX should be taken to be amended in any way. That would mean that it is more likely that a court will consider that any proceedings of the Standards and Privileges Committee would remain within the protection of article IX.</p>

We have deliberately devised a scheme in the Bill so that the House retains the power to discipline its Members. Apart from the criminal offences in clause 9, the ultimate decision about what action to take against an MP remains with the House. It will be for the House to decide whether to punish a Member for not supplying information or for failing to comply with a direction, and it will be for the House to decide what to do with a recommendation from IPSA for other sanctions.</p>

 I think that the Minister is confusing things that involve proceedings in this House and things that do not. The payment of allowances is not a proceeding in this House. It is possible to deal with it through measures that do not impinge on parliamentary privilege. They may give rise to the problem of justiciability, but they do not raise issues of privilege. If the Government recognised that they can deal with pay and allowances without interfering with privilege, they would not have to disapply article IX of the Bill of Rights&#151;as, contrary to what she said earlier, clause 10 does.</p>

 No. I will not lengthen the debate by that method. Given that amendment 64 is about a simple statement of fact that is included in the Bill, for the avoidance of doubt, I urge the hon. Gentleman to withdraw it. Amendment 67 is, again, on a matter that is linked to protocol. We have decided during this debate that there are a number of matters that should be looked at. We can support the principle behind the amendment, and can look to make some drafting changes as the Bill progresses, if that is acceptable to the hon. Gentleman.</p>

If we have not got it right, we need to do so, and I hope that the right hon. Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed (Sir Alan Beith) will accept the assurance that we will ensure that we get it right. We accept the principle behind amendment 12, and will look at the matter later in the Bill&#146;s passage.</p>

The powers of the House to discipline its Members are inherent in its jurisdiction&#151;a point that I made earlier&#151;so the powers set out in the clauses are all powers that the House already possesses. There is no suggestion that the powers will be limited in any way in future, or that the list of powers is exhaustive. Nor is there any suggestion that the powers are conferred by the Bill.

make it clear that we are talking about, and recognising, powers of the House that already exist. Clause 8(10) makes it clear that the range of sanctions that IPSA can recommend include withholding salary, suspension and expulsion. That is a clear indication of the range of sanctions that a Member who has broken the rules might expect to have imposed, including the most serious sanctions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o253"><a name="90701-0013.htm_para18"><a name="09070159000598">We feel that it would be unacceptable if IPSA had the power to recommend sanctions when there was no public indication of what they might be. The public, to whom I keep referring, need to know such things. We feel that that approach best treads the path between responding to public anger and respecting the position of the House. Given my comments on those amendments, I commend clause 8 to the House.</p>

 If the Bill goes on the statute book and does not get repealed or altered soon, I think that the Minister&#146;s speech in response to the debate will stand as an absolute monument to the way in which the Executive now treat this place. She was unable to answer any of the questions about the maintenance of our independence. The high point of the Government&#146;s position was their telling us that their own analysis was that it was more likely than not that our independence would not be undermined as a result of the proposals in clause 8, yet she was unable to provide any coherent argument on why amendment 32 would not improve the Bill.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o254"><a name="90701-0013.htm_para19"><a name="09070159000600">As the right hon. Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed (Sir Alan Beith) rightly says, let us start moving the process in a direction that provides clarity to the role of IPSA, while protecting our independence in matters that concern the internal discipline of this House and that ultimately touch on the way the House operates. That is the point where justiciability and privilege start to run together. If we could just keep that in mind, the Minister would find there was widespread consensus across the House on the changes that the Government have tried to introduce. Instead, every time we look as though we are about to approach that consensus, we get diverted into a strange, nightmarish regulatory regime that will stand us in endless discredit with the public and undermine our ability to do our job. In those circumstances, I believe that amendment 32 has real benefit, although it is just a small step in the right direction, and I wish to put it to a vote.</p>

 Let me refute what the hon. and learned Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Grieve) said in an unusually temperate set of remarks. My hon. Friend the Deputy Leader of the House dealt carefully with each amendment. The hon. and learned Gentleman&#146;s implication was that we have simply sat here and resisted all the amendments, but he knows very well that that is the reverse of the truth. I am not supposed to talk about this but, as the record of the notes going backwards and forwards between Ministers and the official Box will disclose, what I have sought to do with my hon. Friend is listen to the debate. On a number of occasions, I have come to the Chamber with one view, but I have changed it in the light of debate, which is the purpose of parliamentary debate. There is a legitimate argument to be had about amendment 32, but I have to tell the hon. and learned Gentleman and the Committee that the Bill is not remotely about undermining the independence of the House, something for which I have stood&#151;</p>

 Nor is it an unintended consequence. I am ready to accept the amendment that the right hon. Member for North-West Hampshire and my hon. Friend the Member for Middlesbrough have tabled to clause 10. Furthermore, we will continue to examine it, and that will not necessarily be the end of the matter. I recognise the sensitivity of the matter of privilege but, to pick up a point made by my hon. Friend, privilege at its best is not about our privilege but about the privileges of our electors, and through that, the rights of this House. The hon. Member for Gainsborough (Mr. Leigh) is no longer in his place. <i> [</i><i> Interruption.</i><i> ]</i> I am sorry, he is. I am looking at him; usually, he sits somewhere else. He spoke eloquently on the subject, but we must all understand that the term, which means many things, can also become self-serving. I think it was the hon. Member for North Essex who described it as trust.</p>

 I listen to him all the time, and I compliment him on what he said. However, there was a breach of trust by the House in the way it dealt with the expenses regime, which is why we are in this mess. Certain consequences, I am afraid, must follow. Second Reading was approved on a vote of 291:1. It was open to the House to vote the Bill down, but it decided not to do so. The measure involves a modification not of privilege as privilege but of powers previously exercised directly by the House. What we are doing, by the authority of the House, if the measure is approved&#151;</p>

 On a point of order, Sir Alan. I wonder whether you would advise me. We are very short of time but we are now having a second Government winding-up speech on the debate. I fully appreciate the fact that the Secretary of State is loyally defending the junior Minister, but he is eating into our time.

 We now have to consider the criminal offences that the Government think it right to create and to impose on Members of this House if they transgress.

There is nothing new about that: it has been the position for hundreds of years.

House is taking them seriously when the offence that we have created for ourselves appears to be a much lesser one than that under the general criminal law? I would have thought that the Secretary of State for Justice, with his knowledge of the criminal law, would acknowledge that it is much better that this House should be subject to exactly the same criminal law as would be visited on anybody else who behaved in this way by obtaining their allowances fraudulently.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o272"><a name="90701-0015.htm_para1"><a name="09070159001151">There are already two such offences on the statute book: the offence in section 17 of the Theft Act 1968, which is about false accounting and carries a sentence of seven years; and the offence in the Fraud Act 2006, which attracts 10 years&#146; imprisonment. Both fulfil exactly the same criteria as the offence in clause 9(1). The Secretary of State has told me informally&#151;I am sure he will not mind my telling the Committee&#151;that there are differences. Well, there are some minor differences in wording, but as regards what has to be proved against the individual concerned&#151;namely, the provision of information in the knowledge that that information is false or misleading, which implies dishonesty on the part of the person concerned&#151;I cannot see any distinction, in terms of ease of conviction or otherwise, between the more general offences and this offence.</p>

 Does my hon. and learned Friend share my surprise at the intervention by the Secretary of State on Second Reading, when he chided me for misconstruing clause 9, which I said, on any view, imputes a test of dishonesty? He said it did not and that was one of the distinctions between it and the Fraud Act 2006. I do not think that he had in mind section 17 of the Theft Act 1968, albeit I am sure that he is a highly experienced criminal practitioner. Does my hon. and learned Friend agree that clause 9(1), if it does nothing else, at least imputes a test of dishonesty?</p>

 I agree entirely with my hon. and learned Friend. Indeed, although I know we are supposed to be in a process of general atonement for our misdeeds, if the Government had suggested to me that we ought to have a criminal offence that did not involve a test of dishonesty, I would have suggested to the Secretary of State that prison capacity would have had to be considerably expanded. It is quite clear, as I think the Secretary of State has acknowledged, that MPs can make mistakes, like everybody else. The test of dishonesty is clearly fundamental to the offence.</p>

I wonder whether we are using a sledgehammer to crack a nut. This is a straightforward regulatory offence that we seem in the past to have succeeded in dealing with quite satisfactorily through the sanctions imposed in this House. It is odd that, because the new offence can be visited with only a fine as its penalty, if a conviction were obtained it would not disqualify a Member from serving in this place. I simply ask whether the offence is strictly necessary.</p>

 The hon. and learned Gentleman must read clause 9 in conjunction with clause 10, one of the consequences of which is that if a Member said in a debate, as the right hon. Member for Birkenhead (Mr. Field) did openly yesterday, &#147;I do not approve of this legislation, I do not see how it can work and I will probably be subject to an offence under it. If I am, I will not pay the fine and I will go prison&#148;, those words could be adduced in court proceedings. Prosecuting counsel could say, &#147;You say that this was an accidental mistake, but in fact your own words, as reported in <i> Hansard</i>, incriminate you.&#148;</p>

 Yes, the right hon. Gentleman makes a good point, which features in the comments of the Speaker&#146;s Counsel, at page 13 of the evidence that he gave to the right hon. Gentleman&#146;s Committee, the Select Committee on Justice. I agree that that could give rise to serious difficulties. Whether it touches on the core areas of the House&#146;s privilege is an open question, but the Secretary of State will have to answer that point.</p>

Apart from anything else, I think it is unnecessary. I am mindful of the fact that the Secretary of State keeps telling the House that we have fallen so low in the public&#146;s estimation that unless we make a few rods for own back and go out for some public flagellation, we will never restore their trust. I understand that point, but it is important also that we do not make fools of ourselves. If the problem that the right hon. Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed (Sir Alan Beith) identifies were to come to pass, it would have a chilling effect on how MPs express themselves here.</p>

 Is not the position compounded by the fact that we effectively have no de minimis rule in relation to outside earnings? The advice that we have had in the Standards and Privileges Committee from the registrar is that if somebody makes a speech and gets a bunch of flowers, they should register it. If they do not, they are potentially in jeopardy. It is really right that somebody should face a criminal sanction for failing to declare a bunch of flowers?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o279"><a name="90701-0015.htm_para8"><a name="09070159001164">A bribery Bill is currently out to scrutiny. In view of the House&#146;s current rules, I do not understand how it is possible to commit the offence in subsection (3) without committing an offence of bribery. The Government offered to consult in great detail&#151;in fairness, they are doing that&#151;about how a bribery charge can properly be brought against a Member of Parliament, while not removing the protection of the Bill of Rights for speeches in the House. We have indicated our intention to support that because bribery is a serious offence. What, in those circumstances, is the point of the offence in subsection (3)? If we have only one opportunity to vote, the offence in subsection (3) is perhaps the most important for us to consider. However, I fully accept that the offence for which subsection (2) provides is also important because it could also cause hon. Members difficulties.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o280"><a name="90701-0015.htm_para9"><a name="09070159001165">I agree with the hon. Member for Hendon (Mr. Dismore) who said, as I did yesterday, that we cannot consider the Bill without taking into account the infamous regulations, which the House has produced for itself. We acknowledged in the regulations that the boundary between a gift and a benefit in kind is unclear. If a Member of Parliament attends a dinner given by an organisation&#151;the views of which he supports and for which he is promoting legislation in the House&#151;speaks at the function and does not pay for his dinner, as almost always happens when hon. Members attend such events, he will be in serious difficulty. He will find it difficult to know what to put in the register and whether, thereafter, he is engaging in paid advocacy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o281"><a name="90701-0015.htm_para10"><a name="09070159001166">It will be completely unsatisfactory if, with 20 minutes to go before we get to Report, and the Bill set to leave the House at 7 o&#146;clock this evening, potentially never to return, we do not clear up the problems, given the sword of Damocles that the measure hangs over every hon. Member. My amendments are designed to try to tackle the problems and stimulate debate. Some are probing, but the subject needs to be examined in its entirety. I remain unconvinced.</p>

 I am sure that the Government will say, in answer to the point made by the hon. Member for Hendon (Mr. Dismore), that the prosecution has discretion and that trivial prosecutions will not be brought. However, there is a fundamental problem with that because the prosecution service is superintended by the Attorney-General&#151;a Minister. The Government promised to remove that problem by introducing a constitutional renewal Bill, but they have so far failed to do that. We are doing things in the wrong order.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman makes an interesting point. There are systems in place for ensuring that the Attorney-General is not involved in prosecutorial decisions about Members of Parliament.

 I entirely agree with my hon. and learned Friend about clause 9. However, despite the recent furore, particularly in relation to phantom mortgages, the general public will see that not a single charge has been laid against any Member in relation to either the Theft Act 1968 or the Fraud Act 2006. They may conclude that we therefore need new offences. Will my hon. and learned Friend turn his mind to the rather terrifying prospect that the Government are quite deliberately bringing forward clause 9 in order to place Members of Parliament under a different set of values from that which should apply to the public at large?</p>

However, if there is one that the Secretary of State feels particularly passionately about, and if it happens to be clause 9(1), then, although I feel slightly embarrassed about this, because I cannot for the life of me see why there should be a special regime for MPs, I do not think that it will cause any wider harm to the independence of this House.

Just as there is no such thing as a half-pregnant person, so clause 9 is a bad piece of drafting and it is unnecessary. We should have the courage to say so and make clear our views.

 I hope that I am not reaching a false conclusion. I hope that I have highlighted, as best I can, those aspects of the proposals that, in my view, are either silly or have a sinister consequence for the House, which it must consider. Broadly speaking, I think clause 9(1) is a bit silly&#151;that is my reaction to it&#151;but the other two subsections are much more serious. That is a distinction that can properly be made.</p>

There is nothing unusual about having general provisions with specific parallels for specific purposes; I have plenty of examples, including what is now section 2 of the Fraud Act 2006 and section 17 of the Theft Act 1968, which apply generally to members of the public. The Local Government and Housing Act 1989 and the Social Security Administration Act 1992&#151;not our legislation,  <br>

but the Conservatives&#146; legislation&#151;have specific offences for knowingly making a false declaration. Why did the previous Conservative Administration&#151;in my view correctly&#151;make those offences? It is because in practice it is sometimes easier to prosecute. One can have a jurisprudential argument about the difference between &#147;falsely&#148;, which involves a clear level of knowledge, and &#147;dishonestly&#148;, but there is a difference between those offences for which, in practice, it is on the whole easier to prosecute and gain a conviction, and the wider Fraud Act and Theft Act provisions.</p>

 If the Secretary of State looks back at the Scotland Bill, he will find&#151;my memory goes back that far&#151;that I was very concerned about ensuring that the Scottish Parliament had proper sovereignty. I remember expressing concerns about the criminal offences, as I raised the question of whether they should be left to the internal regulation of that institution. That is my first point. My second is that the Fraud Act 2006 was not in existence then and it commanded widespread support in the House for simplifying the fraud law. I have here the particulars of an offence relating to the charge of fraud, which could be that a person between a day and another day dishonestly and intending to make a gain for himself failed to disclose to IPSA what he was under a legal duty to disclose&#151;he was double-claiming an allowance. That is all one has to prove. In those circumstances, I am afraid that I simply cannot accept the Secretary of State&#146;s contention that the new offence under subsection (1) will be easier to prove.</p>

that an additional criminal sanction is included in the Scotland Act 1998, which, as far as I am aware, was not opposed by any members of the Conservative, Labour or Liberal Democrat parties during the passage of that Bill. It relates to the issue of declarations of interest. That is the gold standard. The Justice Secretary said that what was good for the goose was good for the gander, and I entirely agree with him.

It strikes me that the points that my hon. and learned Friend made in relation to the Fraud Act 2006 and, for example, section 17 of the Theft Act 1968 are unassailable. No one who has had a look at the relevant statutes and then compared them with clause 9(1) can reach any conclusion other than that we are creating a law for Members of Parliament who commit fraud which is special and lenient and different from that which applies to ordinary members of the public. I take the view&#151;it may be thought to be rather old-fashioned&#151;that the common law should be universally and uniformly applied.

There are other professions&#151;lawyers called to the Bar, solicitors, architects&#151;where perfectly acceptable disciplinary rules apply that are dealt with by their disciplinary bodies, and where those who break them are not required to go to prison or to be fined. Just because we are in a lather about expenses does not mean that those who are guilty of contravening the rules of the House or of IPSA should be treated in such a way. The rules of IPSA are yet to be defined and set out; we do not know what rules clause 9(2) and (3) refer to, because they have yet to be written under the provisions of clause 5.

 On a point of order, Sir Alan. Notwithstanding the splendid outcome of that Division, which surely represents the passion of the House on this matter and is a serious affront to the Justice Secretary, I believe that it is a constitutional outrage that a clause described by the learned Clerk as possibly having</p>

Members having voted against the clause by three votes, despite the Government Whips&#146; attempts to stop them, we would not be able to debate it.</p>

 On a point of order, Sir Alan. I wonder whether I might give you notice that I am very happy that my amendment on Report, amendment 16, now falls, because it was an amendment to leave out clause 10. I hope that the Justice Secretary, rather than treating the situation as an affront, will take it as a recognition that the primary purpose of the Bill did not require clause 10, that we can set up the necessary body without it, and that he should now get on and do so to the general satisfaction of the House.</p>

 On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker. In 1993, Speaker Boothroyd gave a warning that, in respect of article IX of the Bill of Rights, the courts should not interfere in the proceedings of the House. New clause 7 deals with article IX of the Bill of Rights and new clause 8 deals with the supremacy of Parliament. They go to the very heart of how we are governed in this country. Some 40 Members of Parliament have signed the new clauses, which are, furthermore, in the name of the official Opposition. Against that background, may I ask for your ruling on how it can be that those two new clauses have not been selected for debate, as a result of which the House has been put in peril?</p>

 I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o317"><a name="90701-0017.htm_para12"><a name="09070178001068">I wish to make reference to the significance of what we are doing in creating the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority in terms of the law that will affect us and our expenses under the Data Protection Act 1998. Very simply, one of the most important elements of the Data Protection Act is who is responsible for holding the data and therefore who is responsible for answering freedom of information requests&#151;and ultimately, I suppose, for making decisions along the lines of what is published and whether it has to be redacted and, to our great embarrassment, how.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o318"><a name="90701-0017.htm_para13"><a name="09070178001069">The Bill will set up IPSA, but it remains unclear as to when responsibility for controlling and holding the data will pass to it. It is obviously absurd to assume that that responsibility can pass on the day that the Bill receives Royal Assent, because the apparatus to handle it will simply not exist. It therefore makes good sense, in order to have an orderly transition, to try to specify a date on which the baton of responsibility is passed from this House to the new independent body, perhaps with an enormous collective parliamentary sigh of relief, leaving it to others to decide how data relating to our expenses can be handled, published and released.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o319"><a name="90701-0017.htm_para14"><a name="09070178001070">The new clause suggests that there should be a period of two months between the Bill receiving Royal Assent and the date on which the responsibility should formally pass. It is a very simple, uncontroversial proposal. If, for any reason, the Government believe that it should be, say, three months, we would not argue strongly about that. However, the principle of making it absolutely clear when this House relinquishes responsibility for the administration of our expenses is essential if we are to avoid more of the calamitous coverage that we have suffered from over the past few weeks.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o320"><a name="90701-0017.htm_para15"><a name="09070178001071">I merely ask the Minister to tell the House whether the Government are prepared to accept the new clause, in whole or in principle. Depending on the reply, we can either decide to withdraw it, and perhaps let the other place table another one, or to press ahead with it.</p>

The hon. Member for Rutland and Melton (Alan Duncan) makes an important point about the transition of responsibility and clarifying when and how it happens. The Government&#146;s reply may deal with the practicalities of whether two months is the appropriate period. I agree with him that the Government should explain how they plan to do this and when, and make it clear, perhaps in another place, exactly what the date should be.</p>

 One of the many muddles that the Bill is getting Parliament into is the muddle over how staff will transfer and when the body will be established. I am pleased that my hon.

However, it is not possible to put a time on when that could take place unless we know how long it will take to set up the body and to appoint all the relevant staff.</p>

about how they are going to be treated. Does he know when the Bill might be enacted? Is it possible that we can do this quickly, perhaps within two months? It will be easier to do it if the current arrangements for staff transfer, under the Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) Regulations 1981 or some similar arrangement, apply and if staff have been told that they will transfer so that the system can continue much as it has up to this point. If that is not the intention, a good employer would warn staff and start consulting on what the arrangements will be, and it might be quite difficult to hit this particular deadline.</p>

 Yes, and some of us made that point in previous debates, when it was more relevant. The relevance of timing here, as I am sure my hon.

As he and I are trying to point out, the duty cannot be transferred until the body has been set up and is working. We need to be satisfied that it is working competently and sensibly.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o323"><a name="90701-0018.htm_para2"><a name="09070178001078">There are a lot of people involved, and the way in which they have been treated is shoddy and appalling.

 It is a matter of regrettable record that in the past 18 months or so, this House in its various guises has been in dispute with the Information Commissioner about applications in relation to the Freedom of Information Act 2000, the keeping of our expenses records and so forth. That has led to matters being taken to the High Court on two occasions, at considerable public expense. None of us&#151;or at least only a very few of us, and I was not one of them&#151;was asked for our view on that matter, but we are now none the less staring at the consequences of the High Court&#146;s decision. <i> [Interruption.] </i>It is interesting how one gets conflicting instructions from time to time.

 I am grateful to the hon. Member for Rutland and Melton (Alan Duncan) for raising this matter. It may help if I explain how the Data Protection Act 1998 and the Freedom of Information Act 2000 will work in respect of the new authority.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o329"><a name="90701-0018.htm_para8"><a name="09070178001087">Section 1 of the Data Protection Act defines a data controller as</p>

Member for Wokingham (Mr. Redwood) raised, we are aiming for Sir Christopher Kelly&#146;s proposals, and the new authority, to start operating on 1 January next year. It is not remotely likely that the authority will be up and running in two months.

<p><a name="stpa_o338"><a name="90701-0018.htm_para17"><a name="09070178001102">Government amendments 8, 9 and 10 are relatively minor, and I commend them to the House. As for Government amendment 12, the hon. and learned Member for Harborough (Mr. Garnier) will recall that he asked whether a serving member of the senior judiciary could be appointed. We are now making that clear in the Bill, and I am happy to oblige.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o339"><a name="90701-0018.htm_para18"><a name="09070178001103">Government amendments 13, 14 and 15 will require the Speaker, rather than the IPSA, to lay the relevant notices and orders before the House, which is important. That is consistent with, for example, the arrangements in respect of the Boundary Commission. As the Secretary of State for Justice, I am the conduit for orders from the Boundary Commission for changes to boundaries, but I am required to lay the order before the House and ensure that it is put to a vote. Our amendments square the circle, in that there has to be a sponsor for the provisions, namely the Speaker, but they have to come before the House. However, what it does with those orders is entirely a matter for the House.</p>

 I welcome the Government&#146;s amendments. Government amendment 7 clearly reflects the comments that were made on an earlier occasion about the reality of how our allowances work in this place. Amendment 12, which takes on board the concerns that were expressed about members of the judiciary, also seems sensible.</p>

 Does my hon. and learned Friend not agree that amendment 7 is a classic illustration of what happens when we try to rush such legislation through? That such a basic reality had been missed in the original drafting makes one&#146;s jaw drop at the bad legislation that we are now witnessing.</p>

 I agree entirely with my right hon. Friend. At some point in the next hour, we may or may not get Third Reading. However, the reality is that the Bill in its present form is incoherent and filleted. It will have to be put back together again, but it is extraordinary that it is in another place that that will happen. Yet again, a Bill that intimately concerns this House will, at the end of the day, leave this House in a form in which it could never go on the statute book. If ever there was a lesson to be learned about the failings of our procedures, which, as has rightly been said, are just as important as any other failings in our allowances in diminishing the standing of this place, it is that. Although I welcome the one or two amendments that we are dealing with to tidy things up, the truth is that we are tidying something up that, at the moment, is a hovel of a piece of legislation. A great deal will have to be done to it before it is inflicted on the world outside.</p>

 I am grateful for Government amendment 7, which reproduces, at 10 times the length, the four words that I had drafted as amendment 6 to clause 4 yesterday. I want briefly to speak to amendment 2, in the hope that the hon. Member for Middlesbrough (Sir Stuart Bell) and I might score a final quick single before stumps are finally drawn.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o340"><a name="90701-0018.htm_para19"><a name="09070178001109">The order-making power in clause 13 is wide-ranging and substantial. It provides for the Government and the Speaker to draw up a scheme for transferring property rights and liabilities of the House to IPSA and for the order containing such a scheme to be subject to annulment by either House of Parliament, which may or may not lead to a debate and a vote.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o341"><a name="90701-0018.htm_para20"><a name="09070178001110">As drafted, the clause is objectionable on two grounds. First, it does not guarantee proper scrutiny of such orders; secondly, it gives the other place power to annul a scheme that affects only this House. The amendment tabled by the hon. Member for Middlesbrough would deal with both objections by requiring all orders containing transitional provision to be laid in draft before the Commons only and by making them subject to the affirmative procedure order, thus obliging the Government to make time available either on the Floor of the House or Upstairs to provide the opportunity for a vote to take place. I hope that the amendment will find favour with Government Front Benchers.</p>

 Amendment 7 is obviously necessary, but I am afraid that it will never be sufficient to disabuse sections of the press of the view that MPs claim, personally collect and leave in their bank accounts a wide range of allowances for constituency office rents and staff wages. Numerous newspaper stories still appear implying that those allowances, which are actually transferred on to other people, are for the personal profit of the Member. I have often thought that a similar analysis of the salary of the editor of a newspaper that attributed to him the wages of that newspaper&#146;s staff and the rent of the building would produce similarly bizarre effects. I am glad that the Government have realised that direct payment is a valuable part of the system.</p>

 Let me explain that this relates to the definition clause and particularly to the tenure period for members of IPSA and the commissioner. It was agreed without argument across the Chamber that the commissioner or members of the authority could be removed only on the basis of an address from both Houses of Parliament, but there was a restriction on how that address could get on to the Floor of either House: it had to be moved either by the Leader of the House of Commons or by the Leader of the House of Lords. We agreed to take that out. That being the case, and with no substantive reference to the Leader of the House of Lords anywhere else in the Bill, the definition could be dropped as completely redundant.

<p><a name="stpa_o350"><a name="90701-0019.htm_para2"><a name="09070178001128">It was never expected that the Bill would be retrospective, but it is important for us to put the question of allowances behind us, and it is important for the Bill to assist in that procedure. I can tell the House that the review of allowances that has been authorised over the last four years has been put in train, that the House of Commons Commission, with the approval of all party leaders and Members on both sides of the House, has begun its work, and that the terms of reference have been agreed. Sir Thomas Legg is the distinguished chairman of the review body; his independence is absolute and sacrosanct, and must be seen to be so by the public. The review will cover four years of receipts, and it will be minute and thorough.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o351"><a name="90701-0019.htm_para3"><a name="09070178001129">My amendment is intended to remove any prospect, should it exist, of a further review. I believe that a sword of Damocles would have been held over each and every Member if retrospection had operated, whether rightly or wrongly. It has been suggested to me that there might be a gap between the independent standards authority&#146;s taking over and Sir Thomas Legg&#146;s review, and that a mishap in the interstices&#151;perhaps relating to misbehaviour&#151;might not be brought to the attention of the new body, which might cause a vacuum in the proceedings. As we know, however, the Committee on Standards and Privileges is still there, will continue to be there, and can exercise its own authority and powers should anything fall within those interstices.</p>

 It seems to me that amendment 6 is affected by the decision to remove clause 10, which means that, as we understand it, the Bill of Rights 1689 will apply. The amendment would ensure that any investigations under clause 7 were deemed to be proceedings under that Bill. It occurs to me that the commissioner may not be able to conduct his investigations, because he constitutes a body outside Parliament.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o352"><a name="90701-0019.htm_para4"><a name="09070178001131">The Bill states that proceedings in Parliament, which will now include the investigations under clause 7, cannot be</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o353"><a name="90701-0019.htm_para5"><a name="09070178001132">It seems to me that the commissioner, and indeed IPSA, will constitute a &#147;place out of Parliament&#148;, because, unlike the Committee on Standards and Privileges or the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards, they will be independent and outside the jurisdiction of Parliament. That is the whole point of making them independent, and that may reinforce the case for retaining a central role for the Committee on Standards and Privileges, which, being a parliamentary body, can quite properly investigate proceedings that take place in the House.</p>

 I am grateful for that intervention because that is exactly my experience. We have all been on the receiving end of a great deal of criticism about the expenses regime, and it is essential that we reform that quickly, but, like my right hon. Friend, I have not received any criticism that the House Select Committee on Standards and Privileges is not doing, and has not done, its job well. The Committee and its Chairman, my right hon.

 I understand the position to be that the commissioner will be unable to adduce proceedings in Parliament in pursuit of a matter relating to Members&#146; interests, and will therefore find himself concentrating on the expenses issue, which is the primary reason for creating this body in the first place. It would be illogical to leave Members&#146; interests matters with the standards committee.

 That is a helpful intervention.

 I rise to speak on amendments 4 and 3, as realistically this is the only occasion when I can raise the question of the lack of a right to appeal as they deal with issues relating to procedure and the setting of those procedures. I do not want to repeat at length what I said about this on Second Reading, because that would be going back over old ground, but I think it is important to recognise that there is no right of appeal for any Member in this process. If we are going to start looking at having outside regulation&#151;whether through the commissioner setting his own process or, as the Bill stands, through IPSA&#151;to whom can a Member appeal? If amendment 4 passes, a report will not have to be made.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o356"><a name="90701-0019.htm_para8"><a name="09070178001142">The Government argue that the Bill is compatible with the right to a fair hearing because IPSA is independent, but my Committee report tagged to the debate does not accept that in respect of IPSA&#146;s functions, the rules devised, the procedural safeguards designed and the various investigation and enforcement powers. All that adds up to saying that IPSA is not an independent and impartial tribunal as required by article 6 of the European convention on human rights. Lord Bingham, in his evidence to the Joint Committee on Parliamentary Privilege said:</p>
<a name="90701-0019.htm_brev2"><a name="09070178001182"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;I am always rather uneasy if any decision by anybody, however wise and authoritative, is final and immune from any challenge, and therefore the reason why I think it would be desirable to have a route of challenge available is simply to eliminate that situation.</p>

He went on to say that the way to deal with this matter would be to have a right of appeal from the House to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council. I had tabled an amendment to that effect, but that was, unfortunately, not reached because of the guillotine&#151;that is another example of the problems that we have been experiencing.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o358"><a name="90701-0019.htm_para10"><a name="09070178001144">If an outside body is to carry out our regulation and we are, thus, trying to externalise all this, we must have the same protections as any other professional body in those circumstances. Until recently, the General Medical Council and the General Dental Council both had rights of appeal to the Privy Council for matters resulting from their determinations. That position has changed slightly, but the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council has developed expertise in determining such matters. It has learned to use this power sparingly and appropriately, and it would therefore be appropriate to consider that body as an option. The Judicial Committee of the Privy Council already has a role in determining whether a Member of the House is subject to a statutory disqualification under section 7 of the House of Commons Disqualification Act 1975, so no great new principle is involved.

 I, too, wish to see the House move on as quickly as possible to the sunset clause, but the points raised by my hon. Friend the Member for North Essex (Mr. Jenkin) merit consideration. In the vote that we have just had, whereby clause 10 was removed from the Bill, the Committee made it transparently clear that whatever regime is set up to deal with our finances and allowances externally, it cannot and must not infringe article IX of the Bill of Rights. I therefore hope that the Secretary of State, in his reply to even this short debate, will assure us that the Government recognise what the Committee was saying in that decision and will ensure that whatever is put together in the House of Lords to rebuild this Bill will be done in a way that achieves that objective.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o359"><a name="90701-0019.htm_para11"><a name="09070178001146">I say that because although we have removed the clause that said that the Bill of Rights does not apply, we have not secured anything that expressly says that it does apply. I hope that the Secretary of State will, in the spirit of the vote that took place&#151;the Committee was trying hard to reach a consensus&#151;indicate that he fully appreciates what that message was. It is clear that it is possible to have a regulatory regime in which our allowances and salaries are dealt with externally to this House without intruding on the Bill of Rights. That can happen only if the Secretary of State is prepared to re-examine clauses 7, 8 and 9&#151;some other areas may also need to be examined in a bit of detail&#151;in order to ensure that what is put together conforms with the protection that the Bill of Rights affords to our independence, and freedom of speech and action.</p>

I hope that the Government will co-operate in this process. Mindful of that, I hope that when the Secretary of State responds to the points that have been made, particularly those raised by my hon. Friend the Member for North Essex, who has performed such a sterling role in the passage of this legislation, he will provide the assurance that he recognises that the Bill of Rights will not be infringed upon in this legislation.</p>

Ironically, for those of us involved in the cross-party conversations, it was originally suggested that there were two ways to handle the issue of privilege as far as IPSA and the commissioner were concerned. I leave aside the issue of evidence of paid advocacy&#151;how to deal with obtaining evidence when a charge under clause 9(3) is being pursued&#151;for the moment. As far as the other two limbs of what was clause 10 are concerned&#151;it is, of course, now dead&#151;the original proposal was that we brought IPSA and the commissioner into the ring of privilege, and it was drafted to that effect. At that stage, there was no market for that because, as we were trying to create a body independent of Parliament, it might look as though we were trying to have our cake and eat it by providing that statutory and arm&#146;s length body with privileges and even immunities that did not apply to any other body. That was dropped in favour of carving privilege out of the operation of IPSA and the commissioner.</p>

We do not rule out the proposal in amendment 6&#151;indeed, it was in play at one point. I see the hon. and learned Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Grieve) smiling in agreement. However, it will require some thought. Although we are anxious to get the Bill through&#151;that is certainly the explicit commitment of the Government and the Liberal Democrats and, by implication, of the Conservatives&#151;I hope that the hon. Member for North Essex will join me and others to consider it. Contrary to the myth that this is some kind of supine Parliament, Parliaments since 1997 have been more assertive of opinion in the House against the Government of the day than any other. There is good research evidence to that effect from the professor of politics at Nottingham, whose name escapes me at the moment.</p>

 The Justice Secretary heard what I said earlier, and I hope that he will be able to give some comfort to the House, especially as we are about to lose control of this Bill.

 I want to get on, but I think that I made the position quite clear. I see paid advocacy as bribery and the draft Bribery Bill provides the perfect vehicle for dealing with that and for ensuring that Members of Parliament are not exempt by virtue of the Bill of Rights. It seems to me that what was clearly stated in the way in which the Committee voted to get rid of clause 10 was that, for the purposes of the regulation of the House and any criminal offences that might be thought to be relevant, the Bill of Rights would continue to apply. I think that if the Secretary of State tries to do something else in the other place, he will find, in the light of that vote, that he will face serious difficulty.</p>

We on this side of the House have sat through many discussions over the past few days and we are very grateful for the courtesy and reasonableness with which the right hon. Gentleman has treated us and entered into those discussions. It has been an exemplary way of handling what has been a difficult and controversial Bill. We and others believe that it has been hurried through but, given all those pressures, we could not have asked for more courtesy and reasonableness in the manner of its handling.</p>
<a name="09070183000587">
<p>Colloquially, this amendment is a sunset clause&#151;a notion often discussed in this House, but insufficiently and rarely applied to legislation. Variations of the amendment were used for emergency powers granted by the House to deal with issues such as terrorism. It is a very sensible instrument for any piece of legislation that is unduly controversial and which may have unforeseen consequences.</p>
<a name="09070183000588">
<p>This is such a Bill. There can be no doubt that it has been hurriedly cobbled together, and perhaps even more hurriedly rushed through this House. It is very rare to have Second Reading, Committee and Report on three consecutive days. A Bill of this magnitude and consequence will have effects that none of us will have been able properly to understand, even after the vigorous debate that we have enjoyed. It therefore makes good sense to put a natural expiry date on it, so that in a year or so the House is required to come back and take a look at how it has worked.</p>

Members, and possibly even our staff, that we have not envisaged. It is simply sensible and uncontroversial to allow us to look at the Bill in the cold light of day after it has been in place for a year, and so inevitably after there has been a general election. Nothing could be worse than making bad law and letting it lie on the statute book. The surest way of making sure that bad legislation comes back before this House is to make its return automatic by passing a sunset clause. That way, if the Government of the day wish to renew the Bill, believe that it has been of value and is working, or believe that it should be amended, the Bill can be started again, have its sunset clause triggered, or be brought back for amendment.</p>

 The hon.

Of course, one of the reasons why that legislation is deemed to be temporary is that it is hoped that the conditions and requirements demanding the legislation are temporary. Sunset clauses have been used in various bits of Northern Ireland legislation during the peace process, as institutions were established, different arrangements were put in place, and safeguards were introduced that it was hoped could later be disposed of.

I do not think any of us believe that the fundamental credibility question, and the issue of having independently verified and monitored standards in relation to parliamentary expenses and financial probity, will pass or be temporary. We are not talking about just a wee 2009 affair, courtesy of <i> The Daily Telegraph</i>; the situation goes deeper than that, and we are kidding ourselves if we think we can deal with that in a sunset clause. We are in danger of undermining the authority and standing of IPSA if we say we are setting it up on approval for a year. We have already inserted parliamentary control into an awful lot of what IPSA does.</p>

 That is what the hon. and learned Gentleman says, but when is another matter. Let us be clear: we have already made sure that the involvement of Parliament has been inserted into all sorts of controls, checks and brakes in relation to the conduct, performance and investigations of the authority. Earlier, I referred to the conundrum of the &#147;There&#146;s a hole in my bucket, dear Liza&#148; syndrome; IPSA is independent, but parliamentary sovereignty is asserted over it.</p>

 I want to finish and let other people speak. The situation is something of a hologram. We are saying that IPSA is independent, but for other purposes we are saying that there is parliamentary control. We are also saying that IPSA will have a shelf-life of one year, and if we do not like what it does, we can dispose of it completely. How we are meant to recruit people of competence and credibility to the authority on that basis I do not know. With a sunset clause, there is the danger that we might be saying, &#147;This is temporary for a year.

We are now seeing clauses knocked out at the last moment, and promises made across the Floor of the House that in the other place&#151;the unelected Chamber&#151;changes will have to be made. That is not right. The hon. Member for Nottingham, North (Mr. Allen) made a powerful speech, in which he talked about our taking control of the affairs of the House. What we have shown in the past two days is that we are not fit to take control of anything, because we would rather have an unelected House do our work for us&#151;that work is relevant to us, not to them&#151;which is absurd. The reason for the sunset clause is clear: we need to revisit the measure in time to make sure that any mistakes can be rectified.</p>

It is simply that our expenses system has been abused and is weak, but we could change it in short order. We did not need a series of major changes to our rights, responsibilities and privileges, cobbled together on the back of that requirement. What has happened, on the whim of the Prime Minister, is that we now have this extraordinary piece of legislation, which is ill-thought-through and liable to major change in another place. Surely the purpose tonight is not to be party political. The purpose&#151;<i> [</i><i> Interruption.</i><i> ]</i> People may laugh about that, but this is not party political. If the hon. Gentleman had an iota of courage&#151;and he does not need to look at me like that, because I voted against my Government on many occasions&#151;instead of sneering he would vote for the amendment, knowing that he voted for those who come after him to take control of this place. Surely this is the point: let us make sure that we have a chance to revisit the measure, and overturn it if necessary.</p>

I agree that it should not be seen as a party political issue, and I remind the House that all three party leaders backed the establishment of a parliamentary standards authority. <i> [</i><i> Interruption.</i><i> ]</i> Okay, that was the view of the Leader of the Opposition, and it was also the view of the leader of the Liberal Democrats.</p>

 Very nice try, but it does not wash. As someone who has run organisations and set them up, I appreciate that the Secretary of State is quite right to say that the staff need some sort of continuity, but we are considering not just the staff but the significance of the legislation that we are passing. It is not the independent fees office that is in any way controversial&#151;the Secretary of State is right; we all support that; it is all the surrounding implications for privilege and so on that matter, and they may well need revisiting.

It was a crucial part of the Bill and a crucial reason for its urgency.

 Lords amendments 1 and 2 would make all recipients of carer&#146;s allowance eligible for the saving gateway.

 On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker. I understand that the statement is now due to follow the business that we are considering. I wonder whether the Speaker has taken it into consideration that, during earlier points of order about the Government&#146;s not coming to the House to discuss the nationalisation of a particular rail franchise and our having to wait for the statement to be made in the other place first, the Leader of the House was signalling to him, for all to see, that the statement would not be made at 7 o&#146;clock, as he proposed, but at 5 o&#146;clock. We had no statement at 5 or at 7 and we still await it.</p>

 Perhaps I could deal with those matters in reverse order. On the second point, it is not for me to try to explain to the right hon. Gentleman what the Speaker has in mind. The statement will made later this evening, and the Chair has played no part in that decision&#151;the Government are producing the statement.</p>

 As I was saying, the Government intended to table amendments in the other place, and my noble Friend Lord Myners did that at the first opportunity. I should like again to place on record our thanks to all those with caring responsibilities. We will continue to do all we can to help and support them, and I am glad that we have been able to find a mechanism to do that while staying within our original policy objectives.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o409"><a name="90701-0022.htm_para0"><a name="09070186000046">As hon. Members know, the saving gateway is targeted at working age people on lower incomes. As the then Economic Secretary explained, carer&#146;s allowance can be claimed by anyone of 16 or older, as long as they meet the various requirements, and there is no upper age limit. Indeed, 375,000 of the 880,000 claimants of pension age. Making everyone who is entitled to carer&#146;s allowance eligible for the saving gateway would extend eligibility to a large number of people from outside our target group.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o410"><a name="90701-0022.htm_para1"><a name="09070186000047">We have therefore looked for a more targeted option. The amendments would make those receiving carer&#146;s allowance eligible for the saving gateway, rather than everyone who is entitled to receive it. Even without the amendments, around 225,000 claimants of carer&#146;s allowance would be eligible for the saving gateway through qualifying benefits. The amendments will add a further 300,000 carers to that number, taking the total to more than 500,000. I commend the amendments to the House.</p>

 As the Minister said, the issue has been discussed at length in the Commons. The Government&#146;s late conversion to the cause may come as a surprise to those who took part in the debates in Committee, as the then Minister did not greet the probing amendments that were moved with any great enthusiasm. Indeed, she used some of the statistics that the Minister has now used as a reason not to extend the scheme to carers. That said, we should not be too churlish when the Government listen to the views of hon. Members in all parts of the House, so we welcome the measure.</p>

It would be helpful for the House to know the additional financial commitment that has been entered into as a consequence of the Government&#146;s accepting the Lords amendment.</p>

 I rise briefly to thank the Minister for accepting the amendment, which was tabled in my name in Committee. We support the overall principle of the Bill, which is to give people of working age on very low incomes greater opportunities and incentives to save, and the benefits that will flow from that. Our feeling was that carers as a group were worthy of consideration. I am therefore grateful to the Minister for slightly belatedly accepting the merits of that argument, which, as the hon. Member for Fareham (Mr. Hoban) said, it would be churlish not to recognise as a positive development.</p>

However, unless the amendments are prohibitive&#151;I assume that they are not, because the Minister does not appear to regard them as such&#151;we would be enthusiastic in supporting them.</p>

 When we last considered the Bill, I asked the Minister to tell us something about what kind of interest rate would be made available and how much good news there would be for savers under the scheme.

 I quite agree with my right hon. Friend. We would like the scheme to work, because we agree with the broad aim and we would like to assist people who could qualify under it, but throughout the process Ministers have been completely wooden. They will not tell us who will introduce the scheme, how much the fees and costs will be, what the interest rate would be if it were launched today or how much the amendment will cost, because they clearly do not know whether the scheme will be popular and take off. Indeed, how can they know that if they have done none of the homework on whether the scheme makes sense for the people concerned?</p>

 I am grateful for the comments of the Opposition Front-Bench spokesmen, who said that they thought that the Bill was a good measure.

That will not affect our overall estimates of the numbers eligible for the scheme or its costs. We have always said that we expect about 8 million people to be eligible for the saving gateway; previously, our exact estimate was &#163;7.7 million, which the amendments will increase to &#163;8 million.

 The amendments achieve three separate things, which I shall set out in turn. First, Lords amendments 3, 4 and 5 relate to the maturity period of the saving gateway accounts&#151;in other words, how long each account will last. As hon. Members will know, we intend to set the maturity period at two years or 24 months. These amendments would prevent regulations from setting a maturity period of less than 12 months. It was suggested in the other place that a maturity period of less than a year would not encourage saving, as it would not be long enough for saving gateway account holders to develop a strong savings habit.</p>

<p><a name="st_o458"><a name="09070186000065"><a name="90701-0022.htm_spnew10"><a name="09070186001737"><b>Mr. Hoban:</b>
 Given that the regulations are intended to have a maturity period of two years, why are the Government tabling amendments in the Lords to restrict that maturity period to 12 months? Why not have the primary and secondary legislation instead?</p>

<p><a name="st_o459"><a name="09070186000066"><a name="90701-0022.htm_spnew11"><a name="09070186001738"><b>Sarah McCarthy-Fry:</b>
 We cannot foresee a period in which a maturity period of less than 12 months would be desirable, which is why we are setting the bar at 12 months. That does not prevent the period from being longer. As I said, we envisage setting the maturity period at two years, but the regulations put the minimum bar at 12 months because we believe a lesser period is not sufficient to encourage the saving habit.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o419"><a name="90701-0022.htm_para10"><a name="09070186000067">Lords amendment 6 is intended to correct a minor error in drafting. The Bill provides that the Northern Ireland social security commissioner will hear certain saving gateway appeals on non-tax matters in Northern Ireland. Clause 25(7)(b) originally provided that a tribunal of three or more commissioners would fall within the Bill&#146;s definition of a Northern Ireland social security commissioner. That would be unnecessarily restrictive in comparison with the position for appeals on comparable matters such as the child trust fund, where only two such commissioners are sufficient. The amendment would mean that only two were required, which would make the provision consistent with the relevant Northern Ireland social security legislation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o420"><a name="90701-0022.htm_para11"><a name="09070186000068">Finally, Lords amendment 8 would increase parliamentary scrutiny of the use of the regulation-making powers provided by the Bill.

negative procedure on subsequent uses. As the Bill stands, there are four exceptions in which every use of the power will be subject to the affirmative procedure: the three delegated powers relating to eligibility for the saving gateway, and the power for regulations to set the match rate. As those delegated powers relate to central features of the gateway, it is right for any changes to be subject to full parliamentary scrutiny.</p>

Members for Fareham (Mr. Hoban) and for Taunton (Mr. Browne), along with some in another place, have suggested that parliamentary scrutiny of the delegated powers in the Bill should be strengthened further, and the Bill responds to that. It will make three more regulation-making powers subject to the affirmative order on each use rather than just on the first use: the powers to set the monthly deposit limit, the maturity period, and the number of accounts that people can hold either at the same time or during their lifetimes. As changes in those areas could significantly affect the cost of the saving gateway, we agree that the affirmative procedure is appropriate.</p>

 I still do not quite understand why the Government have decided to specify in the Bill that the maturity period should be no less than 12 months, given that their intention from the outset has been for it to be two years and the Minister has confirmed that the regulation will provide for it to be two years. It will just add to the confusion if one period is specified in primary legislation and a different period is specified in secondary legislation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o423"><a name="90701-0022.htm_para14"><a name="09070186000072">As was pointed out in Committee, one reason why the maturity period is important is that it establishes a time during which someone with a saving gateway account will develop a saving culture. It was argued then that a reasonable period of maturity would give people time to develop the practice of putting money aside regularly. During the public evidence sessions that preceded detailed scrutiny of the Bill, Teresa Perchard of Citizens Advice supported a two-year period, and the Economic Secretary agreed when he was leading on the issue. We tabled an amendment to that effect in Committee, but, while accepting the strength of our argument, the then Minister was not very keen for any particular period to be specified in the Bill.</p>

They seem willing to move some way in recognising the Opposition&#146;s view, but not willing enough to go further, have the courage of their convictions and specify in the Bill what they believe to be the right period in the context of secondary legislation. I hope that, when she winds up this relatively short debate, the Minister will explain why she considers it appropriate for two different periods to be specified.</p>

than the negative procedure in three areas because of the impact on costs. We felt that changes relating to entitlement and maturity payments needed proper parliamentary scrutiny rather than being rushed through without proper debate in the House.

<p><a name="stpa_o426"><a name="90701-0022.htm_para17"><a name="09070186000075">In the House of Lords, my noble Friend Lady Noakes tabled amendments to extend the affirmative resolution to powers to set the monthly deposit limit, to set the maturity period, and to set the number of accounts that people could hold. They affect the cost of the scheme, and we are pleased that the Government eventually succumbed to pressure in the other place to reflect those changes. The Government are very keen to talk about democratic renewal and the role of the House of Commons, yet it appears that the only amendments they are prepared to accept are those made in the other place. If the Government are genuine in wanting to embrace the views and reflect the opinions of this House, they should accept more amendments tabled in this place when they are tabled, rather than waiting for pressure from the other place to get them to change their mind.</p>

 At the risk of sounding somewhat graceless, I, too, wish the Government had gone a little bit further and had done this with a little less reluctance, but having said that, I am pleased that the amendments are in place and that this degree of progress has been made.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o427"><a name="90701-0022.htm_para18"><a name="09070186000077">The Bill itself says very little. Anybody who picks up a copy from the Vote Office will not necessarily be very well informed about the nature of the scheme. There are 29 delegated powers in a Bill that has only 32 clauses. I will not give an exhaustive list as I did that in Committee, but the Government are, for example, able to do the following: change the rules governing the issuance of a notice of eligibility; change the rules governing the approved institutional criteria used by HMRC; limit the size of monthly deposits; decide the level of the maturity payment; and impose requirements relating to statements. There is a whole list of criteria that the House is being asked to nod through and to allow the Government to make those changes as they see fit at a later date. The fact is that those changes are substantial to the scheme. We do not have the ability we might wish to influence the details, as they are left out of the Bill.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o428"><a name="90701-0022.htm_para19"><a name="09070186000078">Having said that, some progress is clearly better than no progress. Lords amendment 8 asserts the use of the affirmative procedure to decide the maturity period, the definition of an eligible person, and the requirements for opening an account. That is definitely going in the right direction, because without proper discussion of such details in the House we would be asked to approve a shell of a proposal with very little meat inside it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o429"><a name="90701-0022.htm_para20"><a name="09070186000079">It is, however, a shame that we are not being asked to vote for a Bill which has specific measures such as the 50p rate, the two-year maturity period and the &#163;25 a month deposit limit. That is not treating the House in the way that it should be treated. I am enthusiastic about the amendments as they are preferable to what existed before, but the Government could have gone further still.</p>

will support them. I think that the only point I need to come back to is the reason why the maturity period in the Bill is not less than 12 months and the rest is in regulations. As I have said, we believe that less than 12 months would not represent saving, and that is why we are stating that minimum in the Bill. We want to leave flexibility for regulations to set the minimum period. Leaving that in secondary legislation provides the flexibility to alter that feature of the accounts if, for example, the experience of operating the national scheme suggested a different account length would better achieve the aims of the saving gateway. That is why we want to put that in regulations. Under Lords amendment 8, the maturity period would be subject to the affirmative procedure and to parliamentary scrutiny in this House.</p>

Therefore, the matters addressed in subsections 1(a) to (d) of the proposed new clause directly relate to the development of a saving habit among account holders, account holders&#146; engagement with mainstream financial services and barriers to the opening of saving gateway accounts.

<p><a name="stpa_o437"><a name="90701-0023.htm_para0"><a name="09070186000091">During the intervening period a significant amount of taxpayers&#146; money will be spent supporting this scheme. I hope that the Government see the seven-year period not as a time scale within which the report will be brought before this House; I hope that they do not wait until the seventh anniversary and then report. The sooner we know how effective the scheme is, the better it will be. We will then be able to consider whether it is a good use of taxpayers&#146; money or whether changes need to be made to the matching payment, the maturity period or the range of eligibility to make it more effective in encouraging the savings culture.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o438"><a name="90701-0023.htm_para1"><a name="09070186000092">The first of the two areas omitted from the Government&#146;s amendment but addressed in that of my noble Friend relates to take-up. The Government amendment talks about the effect of saving gateway accounts on attitudes to saving, the behavioural impact of the accounts, the involvement of people who use them with the institutions offering the financial services and the barriers to opening the accounts, but it does not mention take-up, whether the take-up rate is adequate and whether that rate should be improved. I understand that an annual report will be made on the number of people who open these accounts, in line with similar statistics produced on the child trust fund, but it would be helpful to have an independent review of the level of take-up and of whether that rate is sufficient to justify the existence of the saving gateway account. The Minister will point out that subsection (e) of the new clause includes the opportunity to add other areas to the review and I hope that she will confirm that she will ensure&#151;should she be in a position to do so in seven years&#146; time&#151;that the take-up rate would be included.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o439"><a name="90701-0023.htm_para2"><a name="09070186000093">The second area omitted is financial education. A series of pilots took place as part of the long evaluation of this idea, and they suggested that account opening should happen in conjunction with financial education. We are talking about a group of people who do not necessarily have bank accounts, and they may be sceptical about, or uncomfortable with, dealing with financial institutions. Support may be needed for people opening these accounts.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o440"><a name="90701-0023.htm_para3"><a name="09070186000094">If we are to encourage a savings culture, we need to provide incentives to save and accounts that people are happy to save in, and we must provide financial education  <br>

in parallel with that, to persuade people of the long-term benefits of saving. I am disappointed that the Government have not taken the opportunity to include explicit reference to monitoring the financial education that is provided alongside the opening of the accounts. Perhaps the Minister can say whether financial education will be covered in the independent review and should be taken up under subsection (e).</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o441"><a name="90701-0023.htm_para4"><a name="09070186000095">We have called for independent reviews of the system, so we will not oppose the amendment, but the Government could have thought more broadly about what the independent review will cover and have been more timely about when it will be laid before Parliament.</p>

 My party, for the reasons that have just been outlined by the hon. Member for Fareham (Mr. Hoban), supports this legislation, partly because it encourages self-reliance in people on very low incomes. It will encourage them to save in a way that gives them a greater stake in society and to interact with financial constitutions in a way that, in many cases, they do not feel able to do. Both of those objectives are laudable, and that is why we support the legislation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o442"><a name="90701-0023.htm_para5"><a name="09070186000097">Even though there have been pilot studies, we have had to made educated guesses about how the system will work in practice. We cannot be certain, for example, that the 50p matching rate will not be excessive and, therefore, place too great a burden on the taxpayer in achieving the scheme&#146;s objective. On the other hand, it might not be a sufficient inducement for people who will be encouraged to take it up. We do not know whether the two-year period will be successful. We do not know whether the maximum contribution is set at an appropriate level&#151;too high or too low. We cannot be certain about the cost or the penetration of the scheme&#151;the two are linked. We may wish to increase the inducements, because the people whom the scheme is meant to attract are not sufficiently attracted on the existing terms. Or it may be that the costs prove to be prohibitive and the Government wish to scale back the scheme in the future.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o443"><a name="90701-0023.htm_para6"><a name="09070186000098">It is important that the Minister makes a commitment that when this review comes to this House, it will be debated, not just noted. More importantly, the seven-year period is excessive. We will have at least two general elections between now and then. I do not mean to be unkind, but the Minister&#146;s predecessor was in office for nine days, so while it is possible that she will be in post in seven years&#146; time, it is not unreasonable to expect some ministerial changes in the Treasury in that time. More importantly, we will have had more than enough time to review the issues that I have raised and for a reasonable opinion to be formed about the workability or otherwise of the legislation. Like the hon. Member for Fareham (Mr. Hoban), I would encourage the Government to think about the lifetime of a Parliament  <br>

as being a reasonable scale. Four years would be an appropriate amount of time to make a reasonable assessment, would fit into a natural political cycle and would also be sufficient to gauge the success or otherwise of the scheme.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o444"><a name="90701-0023.htm_para7"><a name="09070186000099">As I have made the case previously for such a measure, like the hon. Member for Fareham we will not oppose the measure before us although it is not precisely that which we would have introduced had it been left in our hands. On that basis, and with those caveats, we are happy to support Lords amendment 7.</p>

 I welcome the support from both hon. Gentlemen for the amendment. Let me pick up on a couple of the points that were made. Both hon. Gentlemen made a point about the seven years. We must take into account the fact that any review of the effect of the saving gateways accounts will have to consider account holders&#146; attitudes and behaviour during the two years that the account will last and for a reasonable period afterwards. It would also be desirable for the research sample of participants to include both those people who opened their saving gateway account when the scheme was launched and those who opened theirs later, once the scheme was up and running.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o445"><a name="90701-0023.htm_para8"><a name="09070186000101">We also have to bear in mind that within that seven year period, the researchers must have appropriate time to prepare their conclusions and findings and HMRC and HM Treasury must have time to consider those findings carefully and to prepare a report. We must remember that that is the latest time at which a report can be published, not the earliest. If there are benefits to conducting and publishing the review earlier, the new clause provides sufficient flexibility for that to happen.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o446"><a name="90701-0023.htm_para9"><a name="09070186000102">The hon. Member for Fareham (Mr. Hoban) asked about take-up. My noble Friend Lord Myners announced in the other place that HMRC would be publishing data on the saving gateway at least annually. That will include data on the number of notices of eligibility issued by HMRC and the number of accounts opened, so take-up rates will be clear. The independent review can also consider that in the context of barriers to the opening of accounts under subsection (1)(d) of the new clause.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o447"><a name="90701-0023.htm_para10"><a name="09070186000103">Finally, on financial education, the advice, information and education available to people who are seeking to open an account or whose account is nearing maturity can also be considered by the review when it considers barriers to the opening of accounts and the effects of the scheme on participants&#146; saving behaviour and their involvement with financial institutions. If a more detailed focus on advice and information on the saving gateway is considered appropriate, the new clause has the flexibility to allow that as part of the review. I hope that we will be able to agree to Lords amendment 7.</p>

 With permission, Mr. Speaker, I wish to repeat a statement made a little earlier by my noble Friend the Secretary of State for Transport about the National Express east coast franchise.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o450"><a name="90701-0023.htm_para13"><a name="09070186000108">&#147;I will make a statement about rail services on the east coast main line. The House will understand that, because of the imperative for the Government to respond immediately to the trading statement made by National Express when the markets opened this morning, it was also essential for me to make a written ministerial statement earlier.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o451"><a name="90701-0023.htm_para14"><a name="09070186000109">For some months now, National Express has been seeking to renegotiate the terms of the franchise agreement to operate services on the east coast main line between London, west Yorkshire, the north-east and Scotland that it signed in 2007. My position has been consistently clear&#151;that the Government do not renegotiate rail franchises. That remains the position today.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o452"><a name="90701-0023.htm_para15"><a name="09070186000110">This morning, National Express Group announced that it will not provide the further financial support necessary to ensure that its subsidiary, National Express East Coast, remains solvent. As a consequence, National Express East Coast is no longer able to continue operations to the full term of its franchise, and expects to become insolvent later this year.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o453"><a name="90701-0023.htm_para16"><a name="09070186000111">The decision of National Express to break the contract is regrettable and disappointing. All other rail companies are fulfilling their contracts, despite the economic downturn. It is simply unacceptable to reap the benefits of contracts when times are good only to walk away from them when times become more challenging.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o454"><a name="90701-0023.htm_para17"><a name="09070186000112">My first and overriding obligation in this situation is to ensure continuity of service to passengers, with no disruption or diminution of service standards. When the Government have had to step in to protect rail services in the past, there has been no such impact on passengers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o455"><a name="90701-0023.htm_para18"><a name="09070186000113">I have therefore established a publicly owned company that will take over this franchise from the point at which National Express East Coast ceases to operate. We will agree an orderly handover with National Express. Until that date, National Express will operate services on the current basis; after that date, the new public company will do so. There will be no interruption of services. Existing operational staff&#151;who continue to provide a good service&#151;will transfer to the new East Coast Main Line Company, and so will the assets necessary for the continuation of the service. I can assure the travelling public that services will continue without disruption and that all tickets will be honoured. I have today appointed Elaine Holt, until recently managing director of First Capital Connect, a major train operating company, as chief executive designate of the new East Coast Main Line Company.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o456"><a name="90701-0023.htm_para19"><a name="09070186000114">The failure of National Express East Coast obviously entails the loss of some future premium payments to which the company was contractually committed. However, while the franchise is under public control, the Government will receive the full revenues of a business that continues to make an operating profit. We will also gain the  <br>

benefit of any premium payments from the new franchise once it is re-let. This represents a far better deal for the taxpayer than the only alternative course of action, which was to renegotiate the franchise in an exclusive manner with National Express, with no recourse to what is a highly competitive market for rail franchises. The cost of re-letting the franchise will be met from the performance bond of &#163;32 million, to which the company is contractually bound in the event of termination.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o457"><a name="90701-0023.htm_para20"><a name="09070186000115">National Express also operates rail services on the East Anglia main line and associated commuter routes. The company has said that it does not intend to default on its obligations in respect of these franchises. Notwithstanding this, the Government believe that we may have grounds to terminate these franchises, and we are exploring all options in the light of the group&#146;s statement this morning. In the meantime, we expect National Express to meet its obligations on these franchises in full.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o458"><a name="90701-0023.htm_para21"><a name="09070186000116">The Department&#146;s procurement procedures test a company&#146;s track record and its ability to deliver a franchise and to demonstrate value for money in doing so. It would clearly be reasonable not to invite a company to bid for future franchises in circumstances where it had recently failed to deliver on a previous franchise. A company that had defaulted in the way that National Express now intends would not have pre-qualified for any previous franchises let by the Department. I note that the parent groups of previous franchise failures are no longer in the UK rail business.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o459"><a name="90701-0023.htm_para22"><a name="09070186000117">It is the Government&#146;s intention to tender for a new east coast franchise operator from the end of 2010. The specification of the new franchise will reflect my concern to secure better passenger services and facilities. In particular, I will be seeking to secure significant further improvements to service quality, including to station security, bike and car parking facilities at stations, bus interchange facilities and train catering. This will ensure a step change improvement for passengers from a new east coast franchise. I intend to consult fully on the new franchise specification, including with passenger groups, parliamentarians and the Scottish Executive.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o460"><a name="90701-0023.htm_para23"><a name="09070186000118">I have explained the action that I have taken to ensure that passengers are not affected by the decision of the National Express Group, and have explained the consequences for that group of its decision. Let me also put the events in a wider context. No other train operator has defaulted on its franchise or indicated to us any intention to do so. Nor has any other company sought to renegotiate its franchise. Today&#146;s events do not represent the failure of the system, but the failure of one company. The rail franchising system was examined by the National Audit Office last year, and was found to deliver good value for money. The NAO also concluded:</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o462"><a name="90701-0023.htm_para25"><a name="09070186000120">Rail services at large are steadily improving.

national passenger survey, published yesterday. Moreover, the revenue from rail franchises is enabling us to make record investment in upgrading the network and services on it. We saw that as recently as last month, in the award of the new south central franchise for services on lines through south London, Surrey and Sussex. That process was conducted during the recession, yet it yielded a winning franchise bidder&#151;the existing operator&#151;that is committed to paying a premium of &#163;534 million to the taxpayer over nearly six years. That will be in place of the previous contract, under which the operator was subsidised by the taxpayer. That bodes well for future franchise awards, including for services on the east coast main line.&#148;</p>

 Twelve hours after the stock exchange, 11 and a half hours after &#147;Today&#148; programme listeners, and some four hours after the House of Lords, we finally get to hear the news officially. What we have heard is evidence of the incompetence and failure that has characterised the Government&#146;s handling of the rail franchising system. Two franchises have collapsed in the space of two and a half years on one of the nation&#146;s most important transport corridors, on which millions of people and businesses rely, both in England and Scotland. To borrow a well-known phrase, to lose one east coast franchise might be said to be unfortunate; to lose two looks like carelessness.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o463"><a name="90701-0023.htm_para26"><a name="09070186000122">The Secretary of State told their lordships that he hoped that the next franchise would be better than the last. Clearly, for Labour, it is third time lucky, or so it hopes. On the &#147;Today&#148; programme, the Secretary of State seemed to be saying that National Express East Coast was already in default of its contracts, yet that allegation was not repeated in the written statement, or the statement from the Minister today. Does the Minister stand by the statement made by his boss this morning?</p>

Does the Minister regret that his Government signed up to a deal that caps the liability of the holding company, and apparently entitles it just to walk away when the going gets tough? Does he accept that the incredibly detailed&#151;even invasive, some would say&#151;due diligence process that the Department for Transport carries out in relation to the credibility of franchise bids and bidders has wholly failed in this case? How much will re-letting the franchise cost? How much did the original franchise process cost? What assessment has the Minister made of alternative solutions to direct Government control, such as getting another operator to run the line under a management contract? How much will the fiasco cost the taxpayer in total? Will the money come out of the control period 4 funding settlement? If not, which part of the DFT budget will be raided to cover it? National Express East Coast was due to pay &#163;1.4 billion over the lifetime of the franchise to help fund CP4. What will be the shortfall on that income? How will the Minister plug the resulting black hole in the funding for CP4?</p>

it is just a &#147;Nat Ex&#148; problem, when everyone knows that there is a red-light list of other franchises? Will the Minister come clean and tell us which franchises are on it?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o466"><a name="90701-0023.htm_para29"><a name="09070186000125">In conclusion, this debacle shows that Labour learned nothing from the collapse of the Great North Eastern Railway franchise. It has continued to press train operators to make wildly over-optimistic bids. It has wholly failed to get a grip on rising costs in the rail industry and in Network Rail. It has tried to plug the gap by squeezing passengers for higher and higher fares. It cut a deal that capped the liability of holding companies and allows them to walk away from their subsidiaries with impunity. They cannot wash their hands of the problem by saying that &#147;Nat Ex&#148; got its numbers wrong. The extensive risk assessment by the Department for Transport of the business case underlying the franchise bid has wholly failed, and as a result we have had a yet another accidental renationalisation by Labour to add to the lengthening list that began with Network Rail. It is yet another blow to the public finances, and yet another bill for Labour failure has landed with the long-suffering taxpayers, who have already received such punishment at the hands of this increasingly incompetent Government.</p>

Will my right hon.

However, there will be a cost&#151;&#163;1.4 billion was the premium that was to be paid. There will now be a loss of that premium payment, although a profit will be made from the operation in the private sector. However, there will be a gap. Can the Minister tell us what the gap will be between what National Express would have paid and what will now be recouped from the public purse?</p>

Under those circumstances, would it not be right for the two other franchises that it holds to be removed from it? After all, why should National Express keep the franchises that it deems to be in its interest and lose the one that it wants to hand back to the public?</p>

Can the Minister tell us what that legal advice is and whether it is possible, should the Secretary of State wish to do so, for the companies to be taken back into the public sector, or has that not yet been decided? If the Department ends up with all three franchises, can the Minister assure the House that it has enough qualified management to hand in order to run all three competently?</p>

I am delighted by the comments of the Chair of the Transport Committee. Instead of retaining the franchise temporarily before re-letting it, what consideration has the Minister given to retaining it for a much longer period as a public interest comparator driven by passenger-oriented targets, instead of the pure financial considerations of the Treasury? Would not such an approach provide a passenger-friendly benchmark that would drive up performance in the other franchise areas? Will he consider that proposal?</p>

 Why have the Government effectively served notice on National Express with regard to the East Anglia franchise and told the country, &#147;I note that the parent groups of previous franchise failures are no longer in the UK rail business&#148;, when it is obvious that the Government do not have the power to terminate that franchise, and are going to get locked into a legal dispute? Having created maximum uncertainty for passengers on the East Anglia franchise, will the Government be able to deliver the coup de gr&#226;ce to National Express or will there be a long period of protracted dispute and uncertainty for passengers?</p>

We should welcome the Government&#146;s intervention, but may I put it to him that the key thing is to sustain this service? Will he do all he can to maintain it and go forward and build on it for the future? We have had a statement today, but we need more statements in future, because we are all concerned not only about the lines that we use regularly&#151;many of us use this line regularly, and we have to maintain the quality of service, frequency and everything else&#151;but the railway network generally.</p>

 My right hon. Friend, who is clearly an expert in this area, understands and confirms what we all know&#151;that this is a prestige line. That is why there was huge interest in it when it was last up for tender. It is why, as those who read newspapers will know, takeover attempts were reported in the press in relation to the company. I am sure that there will be a lot of interest when the contract comes up for re-tender towards the end of next year.

In July 2007, the OFT entered into a written litigation agreement with seven banks, one building society and the Financial Services Authority, with a view to bringing a test case to ensure an orderly and efficient process for the resolution of the legal issues.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o489"><a name="90701-0025.htm_para8"><a name="09070186000210">At that time, the FSA issued what is known as a waiver. Essentially, the FSA, as the regulator, was waiving the rules that specify time limits for dealing with any complaint about the level, fairness or lawfulness of unauthorised overdraft charges. The managing director of retail markets at the FSA said:</p>
<a name="90701-0025.htm_brev13"><a name="09070186001692"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;We have granted the waiver to help facilitate this test case. We believe it is not in the interests of all consumers for complaints to continue to be dealt with in the current inconsistent way&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o490"><a name="90701-0025.htm_para9"><a name="09070186000211">Before the test case agreement was reached and the waiver was invoked, we were in the scandalous position in 2007 where banks had paid out a staggering &#163;784 million to approximately 378,000 customers. Rather than defend their untenable position in the courts, banks paid out when challenged. We can take it as read that some of the banks would not pay out a single penny if they did not need to.</p>

As a matter of proof, I have in my possession a letter that I wrote to the OFT on 15 August 2007 and another one that I wrote to the FSA on 20 August 2007, along with other representations. In both letters, I questioned the tactics being deployed and the wisdom of both organisations in dealing with the vexed issue of bank charges.</p>

Where is the fairness for consumers who will now have to wait until the High Court decision before being reimbursed? What financial protection measures are in place to safeguard consumers, as that court action means that the banks will be able to hold on to consumers&#146; money even longer? Among the many questions that I asked the FSA were these. Was there any consultation with an appropriate parliamentary Committee before  <br>

proceeding to grant a waiver? Why was a decision taken to allow banks that waiver while still allowing the contested charges to remain in place? Can the FSA confirm that the waiver will not affect charges being taken from account holders whose income comprises social security benefits? Finally, what protection is available to consumers who are exempt from arrestment in terms of section 187 of the Social Security Administration Act 1992 and section 45 of the Tax Credits Act 2002?</p>

It will mean repaying millions of customers billions of pounds because the ruling must be retrospective; it will go back at least six years, and perhaps more. The Court of Appeal confirmed on 26 February 2009 the OFT&#146;s view that unarranged overdraft charging terms can be assessed for fairness. The court found that those terms were not part of the core or essential bargain between consumers and their banks, and that therefore consumers had protection under the Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts Regulations 1999.

The bank requested that she return her account to credit, which she did by paying &#163;72 on 21 May. After that financially punitive experience, she was advised by a friend to open an account with another bank, and she arranged to have her pension paid into the new account. However, the bank that she was leaving applied a further &#163;60 in charges to her account. On 1 June, the bank refused to close that account until she paid the additional &#163;60.

the banks and the public. This relationship is important, and it is important that we get it right. The answer for today&#146;s problems lies partly in the deregulation of global banking in the 1980s, which was followed by huge financial innovation in the 1990s. This, combined with low interest rates around the world&#151;particularly in the last 10 years&#151;set the scene for one of the biggest expansions, and one of the biggest crashes, of global credit in history.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o518"><a name="90701-0026.htm_para26"><a name="09070186000246">I do not believe the answer is to divide investment banking from &#147;core&#148; deposit taking and lending.

<p><a name="stpa_o519"><a name="90701-0026.htm_para27"><a name="09070186000247">The Government are taking action on bank charges. The Office of Fair Trading is pursuing its test case against a group of banks about charges for unauthorised overdrafts and items that are returned unpaid. As my right hon. Friend pointed out, in April 2008 the High Court ruled that certain terms in the contract governing personal current accounts could be assessed for fairness under the unfair terms in consumer contracts regulations. That was upheld by the Appeal Court on 26 February 2009, and a further appeal was heard recently by the House of Lords between 22 and 24 June&#151;a ruling is expected in the autumn. Subject to the House of Lords decision, the OFT has written to the banks with a preliminary view on the fairness of the charges and embarked on a data-gathering exercise to provide the material on which to base a final decision.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o520"><a name="90701-0026.htm_para28"><a name="09070186000248">On 3 April, the OFT announced that it would streamline its investigation by focusing on the terms of three banks in particular. The aim is to progress the case in the shortest and most efficient way possible. The OFT believes that the terms of the three selected banks provide the best representative selection of all the banks&#146; unarranged overdraft charging terms, and therefore the outcome of this more focused investigation will be relevant to the assessment of other banks&#146; terms. The investigation will concentrate initially on the charging terms of Lloyds TSB, HSBC and Clydesdale, and the OFT has written to all the banks under investigation to outline that decision.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o521"><a name="90701-0026.htm_para29"><a name="09070186000249">It should not be assumed that the OFT is more or less likely to find those banks&#146; terms unfair. The investigation into the other banks&#146; terms is merely on hold and the OFT has stressed that no bank&#146;s terms have been given a clean bill of health. The OFT expects to reach final conclusions on fairness later this year, subject to any further legal challenges. Once the application of the regulations is clarified, customers will be able to pursue their complaints against the banks if the outcome of the case is in their favour.</p>

One way to determine the fairness of the bank charges is for litigation to continue until it reaches a conclusion, which may take some years. An alternative negotiated solution could be in the interests of customers, the banks and the regulators. As we have heard, until there is a resolution the Financial Services Authority and the courts have decided that complaints about bank charges should be put on hold.

waiver from its rules about complaints handling in respect of charges, subject to a number of conditions. One is that complaints from customers suffering hardship will continue to be heard. The banking code commits the banks to identify and resolve situations involving a customer experiencing financial difficulty. The waiver is a matter for the independent regulator and it is subject to a number of conditions. For example, the FSA may revoke it if the duration of the test case is likely to cause undue risk to consumers or if no material progress is made in the test case without good reason.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o523"><a name="90701-0026.htm_para31"><a name="09070186000251">Looking ahead, I believe there should be a new compact between the people and the banks. Put simply, people need to have confidence that when they open an account they will be treated fairly, their savings will be safe and they will not be overcharged. Opening an account should not expose customers to the risk that they will suffer detriment. It is a compact built on responsibility, fairness and choice, and it involves shared responsibility between the banks, the regulators, and bank customers themselves; fairness, whereby banks and financial institutions operate to benefit consumers, businesses and the wider economy, not just their shareholders or their employees; and choice, in properly regulated banking markets that are founded on competition, openness and efficiency.</p>

Banks, and in particular their boards, need to recognise that their duty to shareholders is best fulfilled by acting in the interests of their customers and in the interests of not only some but all their employees. Banks&#146; boards need to focus not on short-term profits but on long-term wealth creation, which is best served by meeting the service needs of all their customers.</p>

Regulation, like governance, must be designed in a way that recognises the importance of the financial sector to the economy as a whole. It should reinforce good behaviour and act as a check against bad practices&#151;that should be self-evident. We have already consolidated seven different regulatory  <br>

agencies into one&#151;that was a significant step&#151;but more is needed. For example, a new conduct of business regime, covering all retail banking services within the FSA&#146;s remit, will take effect from 1 November 2009. It will introduce a new, principles-based approach to regulation and detailed conduct rules for pre and post-sale requirements affecting retail deposit taking. I also look forward to the outcome of the work the OFT has been doing with stakeholders to address the concerns identified in its market study of the operation of the market for personal current accounts.</p>

We must all work together to ensure that we learn the lessons. It will take time, but if we clean up and reform the banks, change their culture, and strengthen regulation, people can begin to regain their trust in them. That includes ensuring that the regulatory framework protects customers from excessive charges. We also need to look at where improvements can be made to banks&#146; corporate governance and business conduct, and ensure that charges are simple, proportionate and transparent, and we must do this in a way that supports the flow of credit to consumers and business.</p>
