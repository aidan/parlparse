 May I inform the right hon. Gentleman that the Secretary of State has had no recent discussions with police forces specifically on motorway congestion? The Highways Agency takes managing the motorway network seriously. In the event of a serious accident, the police are supported by traffic officers to ensure that delays are minimised and motorways are reopened promptly.</p>

<p><a name="st_o41"><a name="09062552000097"><a name="90625-0002.htm_spnew7"><a name="09062552003147"><b>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</b>
 The Minister mentions serious accidents, but is he aware that after quite minor accidents, the police are inclined to regard the accident as a scene of crime and to cordon off long sections of motorway, causing immense tailbacks, frustration, economic loss, and motorists trying to find alternatives through small towns and along small roads? Will he have a word with the Highways Agency and the police? It is a particular problem at the Bristol end of the M5 during a busy holiday period, when the motorway is already congested. There must be a better way of dealing with those accidents, such as photographing them, getting the vehicles off the scene and getting the traffic moving.</p>

 The right hon. Gentleman will be pleased to hear that I spoke to the chief executive of the Highways Agency about the matter yesterday. He informed me that a joint strategic agreement on traffic incident management has been in existence since 2006, and that one of its aims is to improve clear-up times. The police must take as long as it takes to deal with what may be a potential crime scene, but the Highways Agency has helped them with technology that can rapidly determine and record evidence such as the position of vehicles. As I said earlier, following the completion of police work, traffic officers take over to ensure that the motorway is open as soon as possible.</p>

Friend is aware that one of the most congested parts of the motorway network is the M1 south of Sheffield, where a large number of accidents occur. Steps are being taken to widen the M1 between junctions 25 and 28, and consideration is being given to either widening it or introducing hard-shoulder running up to junction 34. Will my hon. Friend assure me that whatever scheme is adopted, variable speed limits will be introduced on that section of the motorway so that we can reduce congestion, ensure smoother running at peak periods and, in particular, lower the high levels of pollution around Tinsley, in my constituency?</p>

 The Government have no comprehension of the huge cost impact of these closures. They have broken their promises on congestion again and again.

 That was a somewhat surprising response from Her Majesty&#146;s official Opposition, who once told us to vote blue and go green.

 I am, of course, happy to speak to my hon.

 The Equality Bill is a great piece of legislation, but it would be even better if under-18s were included. The Young Equals campaign has been mentioned, and young people are saying powerfully that they feel discriminated against and excluded. Is there any way in which we can make them feel part of the Bill?</p>

 As my hon. Friend suggests, most of the arguments in favour of extending age provisions to under-18s seem to arise due to negative attitudes and opinions about young people and mistrust of them. It is important that that be dealt with, but attitudes alone are not the basis of discrimination under the Bill, so we would not solve the problem simply by including under-18s in its measures.</p>

<i> (Urgent Question)</i>: To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department if he will make a statement on updates to the national security strategy, including policy on cybersecurity.</p>

<p><a name="st_o120"><a name="09062552000198"><a name="90625-0004.htm_spmin4"><a name="09062552003242"><b>The Minister of State, Home Department (Mr. David Hanson):</b>
 At 10 o&#146;clock this morning, my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister made a written ministerial statement, in which he laid before the House this year&#146;s update to the national security strategy. Accompanying the strategy was the first national cybersecurity strategy for the United Kingdom. Last week, the Government presented to the House the &#147;Digital Britain&#148; strategy. This country is well placed to take advantage of the opportunities of the digital age, but we can seize those opportunities only if people are confident that they can operate safely in cyberspace.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o11"><a name="90625-0004.htm_para1"><a name="09062552000199">Every day, millions of people across the UK&#151;our constituents&#151;rely on the services and information that make up cyberspace. Indeed, 65 per cent. of UK households have access to the internet, and the figure is growing by about 8 per cent. a year. The national security strategy, published for the first time by the Government last March and updated this year, sets out an honest and transparent appraisal of the risks that we face, including the threat that organised crime poses to our country. Organised crime costs us around &#163;20 billion a year, and we have a duty to the British public and to British industry to take measures dramatically to reduce that cost.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o12"><a name="90625-0004.htm_para2"><a name="09062552000200">The Government also need to assess the threats from terrorist organisations and prepare our response to them; the public would expect no less. All those threats can arise in cyberspace. As the director general of the Security Service has said, a number of nations and organisations are</p>
<a name="90625-0004.htm_brev1"><a name="09062552002980"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;trying to obtain political and economic intelligence at our expense&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o13"><a name="90625-0004.htm_para3"><a name="09062552000201">and</p>
<a name="90625-0004.htm_brev2"><a name="09062552002981"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;increasingly deploy sophisticated technical attacks, using the internet to penetrate computer networks.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o14"><a name="90625-0004.htm_para4"><a name="09062552000202">We know the importance that terrorist groups, notably al-Qaeda and its affiliates, place on the internet and cyberspace, which are particularly important for propaganda reasons. We know that terrorists would like to be able to operate more effectively in cyberspace. I am not scaremongering, but we need to look at the issues. Our assessment at present is not that terrorists have the capability to mount attacks imminently, but that we must honourably prepare as terrorists become more sophisticated.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o15"><a name="90625-0004.htm_para5"><a name="09062552000203">Such threats from states or terrorists could affect critical national systems, but there is also a real threat to millions of ordinary citizens&#151;our constituents&#151;as well as their transactions and the businesses for which they work. Online fraud generated some &#163;52 billion worldwide in 2007. The average cost to companies of information security incidents is in the range of &#163;10,000 to &#163;20,000. For a large company, the cost can be as high as &#163;1 million to &#163;2 million. As the dependence on cyberspace grows, we need to ensure security, which is critical to the health of the nation.</p>

Friend the Prime Minister, the first cybersecurity strategy. As a result, we will establish an office of cybersecurity in the Cabinet Office to lead on cybersecurity policy issues, and a cybersecurity operations centre, a multi-agency body, based alongside GCHQ in Cheltenham. That organisation will lead on operations and technical capabilities, which we will examine.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o17"><a name="90625-0004.htm_para7"><a name="09062552000205">As a result of the new strategy, we will develop a cyber industrial strategy for the UK&#146;s critical security needs, in the same way as we have a defence industrial strategy; we will develop cybersecurity skills for the UK, plugging existing gaps and creating more high-tech employment opportunities; we will make critical systems in the public and private sectors more resilient and enhance our ability to detect attack; we will develop international law and doctrines of national defence in cyberspace, working with other countries; we will consider better advice to business and citizens about the security-risk picture and the steps that they need to take to address it; and we will develop new strategies for tackling terrorist and criminal use of cyberspace with our colleagues in the Association of Chief Police Officers and its strategy on cybercrime, which is due out shortly.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o18"><a name="90625-0004.htm_para8"><a name="09062552000206">We plan emergency responses, and the new centre will test the UK&#146;s ability to respond to major attacks, which we obviously believe that we can prevent, but which we need to consider. As with our national security, it will be important that the Government&#146;s powers are used proportionately and in a way that is consistent with civil liberty issues, as I know the hon. Member for Reigate (Mr. Blunt) would wish. So, from today, we will establish an ethics advisory group to advise on that issue, and I shall update the House on its membership when it is formed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o19"><a name="90625-0004.htm_para9"><a name="09062552000207">The centres will be operational in September, and new funding will be announced before then to meet their obligations, building on existing resources that were allocated largely to intelligence agencies. Again, I shall report back to the House on those matters.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o20"><a name="90625-0004.htm_para10"><a name="09062552000208">The wider national security debate is important, and the Government have taken forward the good start that was made last year. We look ahead to the broad range of national security threats, and we look at how we can prevent them. Today, we have set out in the documents an updated analysis of the threats that we face, made commitments on what drives insecurity in the world&#151;on conflict, energy, poverty and the impact of climate change&#151;and published the cybersecurity strategy, which I hope will be the subject of some debate and interest.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o21"><a name="90625-0004.htm_para11"><a name="09062552000209">Britain depends very strongly on the dedicated work of the armed forces, the intelligence services, the police and other services in the support of those strategies. I pay tribute to them all for the courage that they display every day of the week in often very difficult circumstances. I commend the document to the House and hope that the written ministerial statement from my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister will be read with interest by right hon. and hon.

development in the critical area of cybersecurity to be trailed as it has, leading to the first occasion that you, Mr. Speaker, have granted an urgent question, is not only disgraceful but, more alarmingly, shambolic. The Ministers directing the strategy, who are supposed to keep us safe, cannot even manage the orderly public release of new policy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o22"><a name="90625-0004.htm_para12"><a name="09062552000211">The lack of detail on cybersecurity in the national security strategy, which the Prime Minister presented last year, was an obvious area of weakness. The security industry publicly warned that the Government had severely underestimated the dangers that cyber attack poses and had accorded cybersecurity insufficient priority and budget. What has galvanised the Government into action? Has the threat from cyber attack grown in the past year, or has the swift and comprehensive response of the new American Administration made them realise that their priorities were wrong? It was an immediate priority for President Obama and, only four months into his Administration he was reporting on the results. How can we be confident that the strategy before us reflects the proper American sense of priority, rather than being only a pale imitation?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o23"><a name="90625-0004.htm_para13"><a name="09062552000212">How will the new office of cybersecurity and the new cybersecurity operations centre fit with the work of existing agencies? We already have a number of different agencies working in the area: the Centre for the Protection of National Infrastructure, the wider information assurance centre and the Communications Electronic Security Group, being the national technical authority for information assurance, which is based at GCHQ. All the above are already co-ordinated by a Cabinet Office-unit sponsor for information assurance. The Serious Organised Crime Agency and the police e-crime unit, based in the Metropolitan police, are responsible specifically for cybercrime.</p>

The Government are in danger of presiding over a patchwork muddle of different agencies and mandates, to which they have now added an ethics advisory group. It is sad that Ministers now need advice on ethics. Will the new director instigate an immediate review of the mandates and achievements of all the different agencies involved in cybersecurity, to avoid overlap and ensure the best use of resources?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o25"><a name="90625-0004.htm_para15"><a name="09062552000214">There is wholly insufficient time to examine the strategy through the means of an urgent question, but I am grateful to you, Mr. Speaker, for commanding the Minister here today. Will the Government commit, at the earliest opportunity, to a full debate on the strategy, led by the Prime Minister and in Government time? We need a national security council with a dedicated staff and decision-making powers at the heart of the Government. We are not there yet.</p>

co-ordinate correctly the organisations that can make a difference, but resource them effectively. My right hon. Friend will know that it is crucial to put resources into workstreams 3 and 5, on awareness and cultural change and on technical development, research and capability. We must also put resources into the e-crime unit, run by the Metropolitan police, which has already shown how effective it can be. As my right hon. Friend updates the House on resources in the summer, will he tell us that those specific areas will be resourced adequately so that the job can be done?</p>

 I am grateful to my right hon. Friend for his work as Home Secretary in preparing the ground for some of these issues. Several hundred million pounds are already being spent, mostly by organisations that are part of the GCHQ complex and the Centre for the Protection of National Infrastructure, which is part of the Security Service. That money comes out of a single intelligence account. With my colleague Lord West of Spithead, I will examine the funding of new organisations before we establish this process in September, and I will report back to the House on the details of the work streams that my right hon.

 I support the official Opposition&#146;s tabling of an urgent question on this matter. Without it, we would not have been able to have a timely debate on the national security strategy or an opportunity to examine its implications. That would have been a major problem for the House.</p>

We have to take the Minister&#146;s word for it that what happened was a breach of an embargo, or possibly a leak, but I am sure that Members will be concerned that there has been a leak about the cybersecurity strategy, of all things.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o31"><a name="90625-0004.htm_para21"><a name="09062552000228">One reason that the Government have given for bringing forward the strategy is the growing threat posed by hostile states, terrorists and criminals. We do not deny that that threat exists and is growing, but they are described in very broad terms. What criteria have the Government used to define hostile states, terrorists and criminals? To give us an idea of the scale of the threat that is posed, can the Minister tell us anything about how many attacks there have been on our networks, for instance over the past 12 months?</p>

Can the Minister give us some assurance that the cybersecurity operations centre will not just be used for snooping on British citizens&#146; internet use? In the cyber strategy, there is mention that the Government will work closely with civil liberties groups. Which groups does the Minister have in mind, and at what point are they likely to be involved in the process?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o33"><a name="90625-0004.htm_para23"><a name="09062552000230">Finally, as far as I can tell there is no impact assessment in relation to the proposals.

That is the reassurance that we are seeking from the Minister today.</p>

 I share the concern of the hon. Member for Reigate (Mr. Blunt) about the way in which the Government have handled this matter. Perhaps it would have been more appropriate if the Minister had made an oral statement. However, my right hon. Friend mentioned organised crime in his answer to the urgent question. The director and the chairman of SOCA gave evidence to the Select Committee on Home Affairs this week, but no mention was made about the urgency of the cyber threat from organised crime. Can the Minister confirm that there have been discussions with the chairman and director of SOCA and that any concerns raised with him have been taken on board?</p>

 We have had discussions across government about the implications of the strategy. We are working on crime issues in particular, given my responsibilities, and they are important issues. With regard to the oral statement, my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister laid the issues before the House this morning in a written ministerial statement. As I have mentioned, the problem with the breaches arose in relation to the D notice that was issued. Initially, our mistake was that we did not put it under embargo, as we should have. It was later put under embargo, but unfortunately the press published that D notice and made a story around it, without knowing what was in the document, which was published to the House at 10 am today.</p>

things that the hon. Gentleman mentions are put in place. We need to ensure not just that Departments and the organisations within them are operating individually in their silos, but that we have co-operation across the board.

The internet and cyber security do not end at the boundaries of the United Kingdom. They are international and European issues, and ones on which we need to work closely with our allies in the American Administration.

 If I may, I would like to come back to the hon. Gentleman on the detail of that point. Let me re-emphasise, however, that the whole purpose of the ethics committee that we are establishing is to look at the liberty issues surrounding internet activity under the cyber strategy. We are working through the detail of how we will do that, but I will certainly respond to the hon. Gentleman after this statement. However, the key thing, which those in all parts of the House need to know, is that the liberty of individuals to enjoy their business, their communities and their private lives on the internet is important to the Government, as is, equally, the ability to ensure that they are not subject to crime, terrorist threats or distraction by people who have alternative methods to hand.</p>

Will she advise us as to quite what is happening? If, as I suspect, the Government were embarrassed by the gulf between the Prime Minister&#146;s announcement and the proposed remit of the Committee, which was so narrow as to render the whole exercise absurd, why did not the Government simply support the amendments on the Order Paper that would have widened the Committee&#146;s scope and spared the right hon. and learned Lady&#146;s blushes?

Repossessions, although rising, are still way below the level in the previous recession, and we are taking all the action that we can to prevent them from rising faster.</p>

 I will do both those things. The hon. Gentleman&#146;s point has some validity. It is usual for Government to divide the House&#146;s work into Government and non-Government business, but the hon. Gentleman is right to point out that Government Bills are House business and the distinction is therefore somewhat artificial. I hope that the Wright commission will be able to examine those issues.</p>

 About 15 minutes ago, Corus issued a statement confirming its proposal to cut more than 2,000 jobs in its long products section, including 500 white-collar managerial jobs. Most of those jobs will be lost at the Scunthorpe works in north Lincolnshire. Given all that the work force have done to try to weather the storm and stay together during the recession, will my right hon.

Across the north of England and throughout Wales, more than 1,500 farmers are suffering as a result of not having received their full milk cheques for May.

 I want to test how closely the right hon. and learned Lady has been listening. I raised with her on 30 April the issue of Ministers&#151;indeed, herself&#151;commenting in the media about the publication of Bills before they are made available to Members of the House. Yesterday, my hon. Friend the Member for South-West Bedfordshire (Andrew Selous) raised a point of order with Mr. Speaker, and the right hon. and learned Lady was in her place. Mr. Speaker said that the thrust of his remarks about Ministers coming to this House first were clear. Has the right hon. and learned Lady thought about that, and is she prepared to say that Ministers will not speak to the media about the publication of Bills until they are available to Members of this House? Mr. Speaker&#146;s statement was very clear.</p>

 If notice is given of a ministerial statement and Members come to the House to hear that, it is very important that the first people who are able to ask questions about that statement are Members of this House, not journalists, and therefore it is important that the statement to the House comes first, before it is put into the newspapers or broadcast on radio or television. The matter of Bills is slightly different. I heard what the Speaker said yesterday, and it goes without saying that what he said is, by definition, correct, but, by the time that we reach the presentation of a Bill, there has, usually, been extensive consultation. For instance, I had already made a statement to the House setting out the bones of the Parliamentary Standards Bill before the details of it were published. It is important to try to ensure that the House is respected and that it gets to hear about matters first, but in respect of the publication of Bills there has often already been a consultation process and it is not quite so easy to draw the line. Wherever the line is drawn, however, I hope that I and other Members will stay on the right side of it.</p>

 On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker. As you will know, on today&#146;s Order Paper there are a series of motions, beginning with motion 6, relating to the timing and holding of regional Grand Committees. Item five of the agenda for the Chairmen&#146;s Panel next week states that the panel may wish to discuss the planned meetings of regional Grand Committees debated in the House on Thursday 25 June. You will be aware, Mr. Deputy Speaker, that we are not able to debate these motions because the Government have said they should not be subject to debate, notwithstanding the fact that there will be plenty of time today for such a debate. I also understand that it is not even possible for us to seek to amend these motions, notwithstanding that there has not been any consultation with any members of those Committees on the proposed dates for those meetings. In the case of the South West Regional Grand Committee, of which I am a member by virtue of having been elected to represent Christchurch, the meeting is due to take place during the family school holidays and that has not been the subject of any consultation.

If the Deputy Leader of the House is too stubborn to admit that she has made a mistake on this occasion, perhaps she will reflect on the fact that this is causing immense disquiet among Back Benchers, who feel left out of the loop. They have been presented with a fait accompli&#151;the motions that cannot be amended&#151;and are frustrated to note that the Government are wasting the House&#146;s time at the same time as they are forcing legislation through on tight timetables.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o84"><a name="90625-0008.htm_para8"><a name="09062552000400">The establishment of Regional Select Committees has been the topic of extensive debate and consideration in this House, and this is a planned addition to those Committees that are already up and running on an experimental basis for the remainder of this Parliament. The background is that in November 2008, the House decided to put in place an effective and visible improvement in the scrutiny and democratic accountability of the public agencies and public policies that operate in the eight English regions outside London.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o85"><a name="90625-0008.htm_para9"><a name="09062552000401">In Scotland and Wales, and in every region in England there are important public agencies spending billions of pounds. These are public bodies spending public money in the public interest, and it is right that they should be publicly accountable, through this House, to the region they serve.</p>

 Does the Leader of the House not understand that many Members of Parliament, on both sides of the House, who represent seats in the capital&#151;as we both do&#151;feel that this Committee will be a ludicrous talking shop? We already have full scrutiny by 33 local authorities, the Greater London assembly and the Mayor. In one sense, we also have scrutiny by the Government office for London, which still exists, more than nine years into the mayoralty. What purpose can a Select Committee really have?</p>

 As I shall say as I proceed with my comments, although there are different levels of accountability&#151;the London boroughs, the Mayor and the London assembly&#151;there is also an accountability gap, which this Select Committee is necessary to fill. To put it honestly, it was the Conservatives who thought there should be no London-wide accountability at all and abolished the Greater London council. This Government brought accountability back to London through the London assembly, and strengthened it still further with the Mayor. We still think there is an accountability gap, which the Select Committee is necessary to fill.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o88"><a name="90625-0009.htm_para2"><a name="09062552000414">On 12 November 2008, the House agreed that there should be a Regional Select Committee for each of the administrative regions in England, except for London. London has been treated differently because London has different governance from the other regions, including different levels of accountability to elected representatives. I point out to London Members that Wales and Scotland also have Select Committees and Grand Committees in addition to their devolved Assemblies.</p>

<p><a name="st_o259"><a name="09062552000415"><a name="90625-0009.htm_spnew5"><a name="09062552003381"><b>Justine Greening (Putney) (Con):</b>

 If a London Grand Committee is established in addition, it will certainly be possible to hold the Minister for London to account. Indeed, it is possible for all London Members to ask questions of Government Ministers about London issues&#151;whether those Ministers are in the Home Office or the Department of Health&#151;and they do.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o89"><a name="90625-0009.htm_para3"><a name="09062552000417">We took the view that the different governance arrangements in London warranted further consideration in the light of the experience of the other Regional Select Committees. We felt that that consideration and further consultation should take place before we came to the House with this proposal. Before and during the debate, Members, as well as those outside the House, made representations to me for a London Select Committee and I committed to bringing forward proposals to the House, following further consultation.</p>

 I welcome this initiative. Does my right hon. and learned Friend agree that it is important that a Regional Select Committee should not attempt to cover the same ground as the Greater London authority, which has an important scrutiny role in relation to the Mayor? London has some very definite regional characteristics relating to its public services and labour market, and it is very important that we should be able not just to question the Minister, but to do some in-depth work to investigate these problems and to make representations about regional interests.</p>

 My hon. Friend is absolutely right. The Select Committee needs to fill that accountability gap. Of course, we support the work of the London boroughs and they should be working actively on the economy and employment issues that she mentioned. We set up the Greater London authority and we brought forward the legislation for a Mayor for London. Far from undermining their roles, we want to strengthen accountability in London. There remains a gap, and the Select Committee will fill it.</p>

Following the agreement of the House, all the Committees have been set up, they have members and they have selected Chairs. All have announced their first inquiries. All are considering some aspect of the recession&#146;s effect on the regional economy, and the response of Government and agencies to that. They have completed the written evidence stages and are now hearing oral evidence. By the summer recess, the Committees will have held some 20 public evidence sessions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o91"><a name="90625-0009.htm_para5"><a name="09062552000423">One important aspect of the work of these Committees is their capacity to take evidence from a wide range of stakeholders in the specific region, achieving important locally focused engagement. Meetings have taken place across the English regions under the purview of the Regional Select Committees&#151;for example, in Barnsley, Liverpool, Reading, Gateshead and Swindon.</p>

Key Government agencies with a role in delivering the Government response to the recession, such as the regional development agencies and Government offices, and regional Ministers, have also contributed to the investigations undertaken by the Committees.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o94"><a name="90625-0009.htm_para8"><a name="09062552000426">In light of the experience of the Committees, it is now right to bring forward the motion to establish a Select Committee for London. We propose that the London Select Committee should have the same powers and composition as those of the other Select Committees for the regions. As I said, there are different governance arrangements in London, such as an elected Mayor and the London assembly. Some of the regional bodies, such as Transport for London and the London Development Agency, are accountable to the Mayor and subject to scrutiny from the assembly. However, there are many important areas of national policy on public services that impact on London&#151;including health, and crime reduction&#151;and are the responsibility of Ministers as well as the London boroughs.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o95"><a name="90625-0009.htm_para9"><a name="09062552000427">The Government retain considerable responsibility for delivery by many key agencies and non-departmental public bodies operating in London, including NHS London, the learning and skills council, Jobcentre Plus and Her Majesty&#146;s Courts Service and Prison Service. Although we acknowledge the differences between London and other regions, London should not be denied the opportunity afforded to other regions to hold such bodies to account, on Londoners&#146; behalf, through their Members of Parliament.</p>

 A very good example of that is the current review of acute stroke and major trauma services going on within NHS London, in which the boroughs are advancing different positions. As a regional issue that is below the radar of the Select Committee on Health, is that not an ideal example of how a London Committee could do some value-added work to hold NHS London to account and check whether those proposals are indeed in the interests of Londoners?</p>

 I absolutely agree with my hon. Friend. As a Member of Parliament for a London constituency, I know that there are issues on which London MPs, working through a Select Committee, could achieve greater accountability on my constituents&#146; behalf. Health issues, for example, inevitably cross constituency boundaries. They do not fall within the purview of the London boroughs and are not the responsibility of the assembly. On their own, they would justify the work of a Regional Select Committee, so I strongly agree with my hon. Friend.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o96"><a name="90625-0009.htm_para10"><a name="09062552000430">The motion has been subject to consultation with hon.

It is clear that there is no consensus about the value of a London Select Committee, even though it would not duplicate the scrutiny that already exists. Instead, it would complement that scrutiny by focusing on the impact of Government policies in London, including the work of the Government office for London and the regional bodies.</p>

 The motion returns us to a subject&#151;the establishment of Regional Select Committees&#151;that the House has debated at some length already. My hon. Friend the Member for Christchurch (Mr. Chope) is no longer in his place, but we heard his concerns about how these proposals are being rolled out. I do not want to reprise the earlier debate about establishing Regional Select Committees across the rest of the country, as I want to focus on London, but I shall give a brief rundown of the various concerns expressed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o99"><a name="90625-0009.htm_para13"><a name="09062552000434">The first concern was that Regional Select Committees would cost a lot of money and that there were better alternatives. Secondly, concerns were expressed about their composition and the fact that there was no mechanism allowing MPs not from a particular region to be on that region&#146;s Committee. The same concern has been expressed in respect of London, but people were worried above all that the Regional Select Committees&#146; work would duplicate the important work done by the 41 Select Committees that already exist. We have similar concerns about a London Regional Select Committee.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o100"><a name="90625-0009.htm_para14"><a name="09062552000435">The Leader of the House said that the objective was to fill an accountability gap. We all recognise London&#146;s unique devolution settlement, and we agreed that there was an accountability gap in other parts of the country, but we did not believe that that problem could be solved by setting up a new Regional Select Committee to go alongside the unaccountable regional development agencies, regional assemblies and all the other quangos that we have at regional level. We believe that the solution is to make sure that all the decisions taken by those bodies should be taken further down in local government. Regional Select Committees would not then have to look at those matters, as they would be scrutinised and decided at a much more local level than is currently the case.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o101"><a name="90625-0009.htm_para15"><a name="09062552000436">As the Leader of the House said, London has a unique devolution settlement. We are now on our second directly elected Mayor, and the London assembly has its own elected members. They must feel that the move to set up a London Regional Select Committee is a vote of no confidence by Ministers in the assembly&#146;s ability to scrutinise London and its Mayor.</p>

 We have spent the past few weeks in an intense debate about how to strengthen the scrutiny role of Members of Parliament and this Chamber. I fail to understand how the hon.

 I suppose that I have two responses to that. First, Back Benchers can hold Ministers to account: as an Opposition Back Bencher, I think that I can hold Ministers to account on London issues such as Heathrow as well as anyone. Secondly, although the hon. Lady is right that we need more accountability, why can we not get that through having London questions? Why spend several hundred thousand pounds on a Regional Select Committee for London when, as my hon. Friend the Member for Cities of London and Westminster (Mr. Field) said, when people want not another talking shop but direct and immediate representation, with hon. Members being able to ask questions and get answers? Surely we should be trying that first to see whether it works.</p>

 An example was given earlier about health and London&#146;s stroke services. Does my hon.

 The hon.

A good contrast to illustrate the point is provided by the Liaison Committee&#146;s questioning of the Prime Minister. Instead of the half-hour bun fight that we have on Wednesday afternoons, the Liaison Committee gets the Prime Minister for two and a half hours, which means that we can develop themes in great detail and question him at length. We simply could not do the same in a London Question Time.</p>

 Approximately 60-plus MPs will not be able to be part of any London Regional Select Committee because it will have only nine members. A London MP who does not belong to that Regional Select Committee will not have the same opportunities as would be provided by a London Question Time.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o102"><a name="90625-0009.htm_para16"><a name="09062552000443">If the objective is to scrutinise policy as it affects London, that is already fulfilled by existing Select Committees, as some of the reports undertaken over the past five years or so demonstrate. For example, the Transport Committee has produced reports on the London congestion charge and the performance of London Underground, while the Culture, Media and Sport Committee has done one on the London Olympics. The former Education and Skills Committee did a report on skills in London, while the Home Affairs Committee has produced a report on counterterrorism and community relations in the aftermath of the London bombings. Only a couple of weeks ago, we were in this Chamber debating the report from the Home Affairs Committee on knife crime that had a clear resonance for London.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o103"><a name="90625-0009.htm_para17"><a name="09062552000444">There is nothing to prevent Select Committees from looking at London issues where they are of real importance, and they do that already.</p>

 Does not the intervention by the hon. Member for Hendon (Mr. Dismore) illustrate the Government&#146;s wrong-headed approach to the proposal for a London Regional Select Committee? Mention has been made of having a London Question Time, but should not any concern about scrutiny be addressed by the London assembly, which should ensure that its structures and procedures in that regard are robust? If scrutiny in areas such as health needs to be improved, should that not be devolved to the London boroughs?</p>

 My hon. Friend is absolutely right. That is another option for tackling the problem that the Government say exists, but is not the Mayor already accountable to Parliament? He is directly accountable to Londoners, of course, and he is also scrutinised by the London assembly, but he is also summoned here regularly to be held to account by Select Committees. Even the previous Mayor was up in front of Select Committees seven times in eight years, when he was asked about a whole range of issues. The new Mayor has been in place for just over a year, but in that short period he has already appeared before five Select Committees. Clearly, therefore, MPs can scrutinise what the Mayor is doing through topical investigations by existing Select Committees, and they can also question him directly.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o104"><a name="90625-0009.htm_para18"><a name="09062552000447">People in city hall will probably look at this debate and feel that it is a little top down. A lot of debate goes on here about issues that really matter to London, and yet the assembly and the Mayor must wonder why they cannot summon MPs. For example, we voted here about post office closures after Londoners had made it clear that they wanted the closure programme to end. The Mayor and London assembly must wonder why they cannot summon MPs and relevant Ministers about such matters, or why the Secretary of State for Transport cannot be summoned to explain the decision to go ahead with the expansion of Heathrow, even though it goes against what Londoners want.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o105"><a name="90625-0009.htm_para19"><a name="09062552000448">Why are Ministers trying to undermine the London assembly? As my hon. Friend the Member for Enfield, Southgate (Mr. Burrowes) says, one of the options should be further to strengthen the London assembly, but we hear no discussion of that&#151;everything is top-down.</p>

 One of the arguments that the hon. Lady puts for a London Committee is based on the inaccurate information she has just given about post office closures across London. If we had had the opportunity to scrutinise such proposals as a London-wide body, we might have had more success in protecting post offices. Is she seriously saying that as a London Member of Parliament she does not want a say on strategic issues that involve a number of Departments, and possibly the Mayor and city hall as well, and to come up with reports to try to guide the Government and the Mayor in the direction the people we represent want us to take?</p>

 The hon. Gentleman seeks to create a mish-mash of democracy where MPs would be attempting slightly to play the role of London assembly members. London assembly members are unable ultimately to scrutinise all the matters that affect London, but what we need to do is make the existing structure work better.  <br>

Ministers must realise that the electorate&#146;s concern right now is not just about the quality of government, and its quantity&#151;of course there is too much of that; a plethora of unaccountable regional government tiers has been set up. There is also concern about the quality of our democracy.</p>

 My hon. Friend is making a powerful case. One of the things I have tried to get the Leader of the House to do is to hold an annual debate on London, just as we have a debate on Wales on St. David&#146;s day. Would that not be another way for us to raise London issues and put our concerns on record, rather than having the costs and administration of a new Committee?</p>

 My hon. Friend is quite right. That would be yet another option for ensuring that London MPs could hold to account people who are taking decisions that affect Londoners, but of course it is probably too good an idea to be considered by the Government because they are so wedded to their costly, duplicative and interfering Regional Select Committee approach that they seem hell-bent on taking it no matter how much it costs and how ineffective it will be.</p>

 I feel entitled to participate in the debate because I was born in Putney and was a great supporter of the abolition of the Greater London council. Does my hon.

 I did not want to make the debate excessively political because I think that at heart the approach is structurally wrong for accountability whichever Mayor and whichever Government are in power. However, my hon. Friend is right to touch on that point. What concerns me about the proposals is that they feel like the politicisation of Select Committees, which have always been independent of the Executive. That has always been their biggest strength.</p>

The biggest danger is that the proposals could undermine the effectiveness of our local devolution in London, through the Mayor and the London assembly. As my hon. Friend the Member for Christchurch (Mr. Chope) said, Londoners had their say in the mayoral election last year. Now, like the rest of the country, we want to have our say about the accountability gap, which is real, but a general election will fill that gap, not a London Regional Select Committee. We have elected our Mayor, now we want the chance to elect new MPs and a Prime Minister who actually has a real mandate.</p>

 I certainly welcome the proposals, which are long overdue. We should have considered them six months ago when the other Regional Select Committees were being proposed. It is a regrettable oversight that the London Committee was not proposed at the time, and I am grateful to my right hon. and learned Friend the Leader of the House for listening to the representations made by my hon.

From my point of view, the more we scrutinise the activities of the Government and Government bodies, the better. I see no objection to a London Question Time; it is a good idea. I see no objection to an annual debate on London; that is a good idea, too. Indeed, when I was first elected, we used to have an annual debate on policing in London&#151;usually on a Friday morning, but it was welcome nevertheless. However, there is no reason why, having accepted and indeed agreed with those propositions, we should not also have a Select Committee for London, because there is no doubt that there is a significant accountability gap for various bodies for which the Government are responsible.</p>

 Can the hon. Gentleman envisage the London Select Committee, were it to be in place, considering a matter that had been devolved to the London assembly and reaching a different conclusion from the assembly? There would thus be two separate bodies with different conclusions about how a policy should be set, or how a matter should be resolved. What would be the pecking order between the London Select Committee and the London assembly?</p>

 It would be most unlikely that the Select Committee would want to look at something that was entirely devolved to the London assembly, although we might find that there were areas of joint or overlapping responsibility. Of course, it is possible to come to a different conclusion, but that does not necessarily mean that different conclusions should not be reached or considered. Think-tanks in the outside world come to different conclusions. There is nothing wrong with that; it helps to inform debate and, ultimately, leads to better decision making when different points of view are expressed after detailed consideration.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o110"><a name="90625-0010.htm_para4"><a name="09062552000462">The hon. Lady is right; there may be different conclusions. For example, there are significant overlapping responsibilities on housing policy. There are the Mayor&#146;s responsibilities. He has just published his draft housing strategy, with which I profoundly disagree, signally on the abolition of targets for affordable homes. The boroughs have housing policies, some of which are in conflict with the Mayor because the boroughs are trying to negotiate different numbers. There is the Government&#146;s overarching strategy to try to provide decent, affordable homes for the people of London. The role of the Homes and Communities Agency, a central Government body, is vital in that operation. Indeed, a round of negotiations is going on between my borough and the HCA to try to get the money needed to support some of the regeneration schemes, which have run into the sand for reasons that I will not go into now. It would be helpful if a London Select Committee could call Mr. Bob  <br>

The proposals were of major interest in each of our boroughs, which have advanced different positions. For example, there are proposals for four major trauma units. The fourth will be at either the Royal Free or St. Mary&#146;s, and there are significant differences across London about which should be chosen. Indeed, some people argue whether four is the right number.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o112"><a name="90625-0010.htm_para6"><a name="09062552000464">Similarly, in relation to stroke services, there is a strong argument about whether the eight places selected are the right ones for hyper-units and, again, whether eight is the right number. The best way of dealing with that issue would be to call Ruth Carnall and the other people at the top of NHS London who are involved to give evidence to a London Select Committee and answer those very detailed questions.</p>

 Because the NHS is a central Government service&#151;I would have thought that that answer was self-evident. The NHS is accountable to the House, like the Government, but it is only indirectly accountable to the GLA and the London assembly. Borough scrutiny committees will of course examine health issues, but only from the perspective of their individual borough. The hon. Lady will know that Barnet, which we represent, has formed a particular view, but that is very different from Hammersmith&#146;s view. How can those differences of view be reconciled except through an overarching inquiry by a pan-London Select Committee of the House that scrutinises officials and holds them to account? Such a Committee will be able to call officials such as Ruth Carnall and the medical experts who have been giving opinions as part of the consultation. Indeed, they could be held to account for the appalling way in which the consultation has been conducted.</p>

 The hon. Lady knows that that is not the constitutional position. Members of the House are not the Executive, but the legislature. In that context, London&#146;s SHA is part of government and must be held to account for the decisions that it makes. It would not be for the Select Committee to overrule the SHA, but it would be able to express its views and opinions to influence the debate and the decision-making process. The ultimate decision would be taken by Health Ministers and the SHA, but it would be the job of London Members&#151;collectively, through the Select Committee&#151;to inform the debate.</p>

I have no axe to grind because I was one of the rebels on post office closure, but it is important to bear it in mind that responsibility for post offices lay with Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform Ministers at that time. The London Committee could have held BERR Ministers to account and discussed policies on post office closures with them, and then the Committee could have formed a view. That could not have been achieved in any other way except through the much wider debate on post office closures, which was very difficult to participate in because many Members wished to speak.</p>

We all accept that London&#146;s economy is different from the rest of the country&#146;s. London faces challenging economic circumstances and, in the light of what has happened in the City, the problems facing its labour market are completely different from those in other parts of the country. Neither the Treasury Committee nor the Work and Pensions Committee is holding an inquiry into London&#146;s job market, but the London Committee would probably want to examine the way in which Government policy affects London&#146;s labour market in the City and throughout the wider city. To pick up the point made by the hon. Member for Upminster (Angela Watkinson), such an inquiry could involve working with the London Development Agency and the GLA, but given that economic policy is a matter for central Government, a London Committee should hold central Government Ministers to account on their policy for London.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman makes an interesting case. He says that economic policy in London is fairly and squarely a matter for the House, so he must be unaware of the huge amount of work being done under the Mayor&#146;s auspices in city hall to determine what can be done to help Londoners and London&#146;s economy to navigate their way through the recession.

something that is central Government&#146;s responsibility, but I was picking up the point made by the hon. Member for Upminster and setting out an area of overlap. I fully accept that the GLA and the Mayor&#146;s office are examining some of these policies, but responsibility for the economy lies with Treasury Ministers, and we can hold Ministers to account through the Select Committee process in a way that the GLA cannot. That is why it is important that we establish the Committee although, of course, there would be no reason why the Committee could not take account of work carried out elsewhere. We must, however, recognise where the responsibility lies.</p>

 I take the hon. Gentleman&#146;s point, but I think that he is forgetting to whom he is accountable. If we asked any owner of a small shop whether they would prefer money to be spent on a Regional Committee that reports on the recession in London, but duplicates all the work of the Mayor and the GLA, or spent on directly supporting shops, they would probably go for the latter. He talks about this as though it is an interest point and a study programme, but we are meant to be representing our constituents and working alongside other tiers of government. He suggests going far beyond that with a structure that will be sheer duplication and will cost taxpayers money that they cannot afford.</p>

that Minister to account. That is not a way of ensuring that regional quangos and other bodies are scrutinised effectively, as it clearly involves a significant conflict of interest. The Leader of the House talks about Opposition intransigence, but she would do better to consider whether there is intransigence on the part of the Government and an unwillingness to be flexible about the composition of the Regional Committees. The Liberal Democrats therefore cannot agree to the establishment of the London Regional Committee. As I have stated, I acknowledge that the composition of the London Committee would roughly reflect the number of MPs of different parties across London, but that has happened by accident, rather than design.</p>

Indeed, we wanted a more significant transfer of powers to the Mayor and the London assembly than there has been. In many ways, that would have done away with the need for a Regional Select Committee, because the Mayor and the assembly would have held more powers, so the scrutiny role would have been undertaken by the assembly. It would have had a wider range of powers and responsibilities to consider, so there would have been even less demand for a London Regional Select Committee. However, I accept that certain areas of Government policy would remain within the remit or control of the national Government, rather than the London government. Hon. Members have referred to health; there is no reason why significant health powers could not be delivered at a London region level, rather than provided by national Government locally in London. If so, it would have made sense for the assembly to conduct scrutiny at that London level.</p>

When the London assembly and the Mayor&#146;s powers were set up, the expectation was that the Government office for London would go, but its powers and budget seem to have increased, rather than decreased. There is no end in sight to the duplication that arises as a result of the Government office for London remaining in place after the creation of the assembly and of the London Mayor&#146;s powers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o119"><a name="90625-0010.htm_para13"><a name="09062552000482">If there is an issue relating to scrutiny, by all means let us look at whether the assembly needs additional powers; it could also propose additional powers itself. There may be issues to do with the extent to which it carries out its scrutiny role, particularly as regards the London Development Agency and the &#163;100 million that may or may not be missing. If there are issues, I am sure that they can be addressed. Other hon. Members have made sensible suggestions about having a London Question Time or an annual debate in the House about London.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o120"><a name="90625-0010.htm_para14"><a name="09062552000483">Members who have been in the House as long as I have, or roughly as long, will know that in earlier years, but not so much in the past couple of years, we had a series of one-and-a-half-hour Adjournment debates on London issues, on subjects such as the police or health. That seems to have died down, partly, I suspect, as a result of the transfer of powers to the London assembly  <br>

and the Mayor. London Members do not feel quite as engaged, or that they have as much responsibility, as they did prior to the implementation of the Greater London Authority Act 1999. However, there are other ways in which we can boost scrutiny, and give Members greater oversight of the matters that are still of interest to them in London, without setting up a London Regional Select Committee.</p>

<p><a name="st_o296"><a name="09062552000484"><a name="90625-0010.htm_spnew18"><a name="09062552003418"><b>Angela Watkinson (Upminster) (Con):</b>
 The hon. Gentleman referred to the scrutiny role, and to the role of powers. It is not clear whether the London Select Committee would have any powers at all, or whether it would simply be a scrutiny body. It is difficult to see how it could influence decision making in this place, in the London assembly, or in any other public body, unless it had powers. However, if it had powers it would be creating duplication, as he rightly said.</p>

<p><a name="st_o297"><a name="09062552000485"><a name="90625-0010.htm_spnew19"><a name="09062552003419"><b>Tom Brake:</b>
 I thank the hon. Lady for that intervention. My assumption is that the London Select Committee would have the same powers as every other Select Committee; in other words, it would have the power to make recommendations and to bring Ministers to appear before it. However, in practice, as we Members all know, if the Government, or possibly the Mayor or the London assembly, choose to disregard those recommendations, there is nothing that we Members can do about it, apart from draw attention to it in debate and so on. I agree that that is a valid point to which Ministers need to respond.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o121"><a name="90625-0010.htm_para15"><a name="09062552000486">To conclude, there are no guarantees about the London Select Committee&#146;s composition, and there is not clarity about what scrutiny it will provide that is not provided by the London assembly. Until that clarity is there, the proposal cannot be allowed to proceed.</p>

 On the machinery of Government changes, the House will be aware that when changes are made to the structure of Departments, a Government motion is needed to make the necessary consequential changes to the structure of departmental Select Committees. The motion therefore reflects the creation on 5 June of the new Department for Business, Innovation and Skills, which takes on the responsibilities of the former Departments for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform and for Innovation, Universities and Skills. Shortly after the new Department was created, the Select Committee on Innovation, Universities, Science and Skills published a report recommending the re-establishment of a Select Committee on Science and Technology. That reflected the final recommendation of the former Science and Technology Committee, which was abolished in 2007, when the Department for Innovation, Universities and Skills was created.</p>

I am pleased to say that the Government accept the Committee&#146;s recommendation. The motion provides for the re-establishment of a Science and Technology Committee as part of the family of departmental Select Committees and it has a remit to examine the expenditure, administration and policy of the Government Office for Science.</p>

It is being re-established today, however, as a departmental Select Committee, whereas it was a free-standing Committee before, with cross-cutting oversight of all Departments, including outside agencies.

The role of the Government Office for Science is somewhat narrower than that of the old Office of Science and Technology. Although the interpretation of the Committee&#146;s terms of reference is a matter for the Committee itself, the Government hope that it will take a wide-ranging approach to its remit, examining the full scope of science policy and related matters across the Government.

 No doubt my hon. Friend the Member for Christchurch (Mr. Chope) will pursue the matter of the police pension. I had correspondence with the Minister&#146;s predecessor, the hon.

She has replied on his behalf, confirming that the Treasury, as the employer of Members of Parliament, took a contribution holiday of 14 years from the parliamentary contributory pension scheme.

How much has that holiday affected the deficit that the pension fund has recently faced?</p>

 We can look at that issue in the wider debate as we go forward. However, as I have to keep emphasising, the key thing is not to go back in time. We are where we are in terms of the pension scheme. The real factor is that its cost is escalating because of longevity. There were both Labour and Conservative Governments between 1989 and 2003. The question was not about a pensions holiday, but about reducing the Exchequer contribution when there was a surplus. That situation does not pertain now. The key thing is for us to focus on the feelings of the public about their funding of our scheme. That is what I am really talking about today.</p>

On 24 January 2008, the House endorsed the recommendation of the Senior Salaries Review Body that the cost to the Exchequer of the accrual of benefits should be limited to 20 per cent. of payroll. That figure excludes payments to pay off the deficit identified in the 2005 valuation of the fund; the two elements have been treated separately.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o132"><a name="90625-0011.htm_para9"><a name="09062552000882">The Government Actuary published his valuation of the scheme in March 2009, and he advised that the Exchequer contribution would need to increase from 26.8 per cent. to 31.6 per cent. of payroll if no other action was taken. As I mentioned, that is primarily because members of the scheme are living longer and pensions are therefore payable for longer. On 31 March this year, my right hon. and learned Friend the Leader of the House announced in a written statement that the Exchequer contribution would be capped at 28.7 per cent. of payroll. That was in line with the recommendation of the Senior Salaries Review Body, as already endorsed by the House. My right hon. and learned Friend proposed a set of changes that would make the necessary savings of 2.9 per cent. of payroll, and proposed that those be backdated to 1 April 2009.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o133"><a name="90625-0011.htm_para10"><a name="09062552000883">The changes consist, first, of an increase in member contribution rates, which will yield a saving of 1.7 per cent. of payroll. Secondly, the scheme&#146;s maximum pension limit of two thirds of final salary is to be applied to all scheme members in future. That change will yield savings of 1.2 per cent. of payroll. The increase in member contribution rates will mean that scheme members will have a choice of paying 11.9 per cent. of salary for an accrual rate of one fortieth; 7.9 per cent. for an accrual rate of one fiftieth; or 5.9 per cent. for the new accrual rate of one sixtieth, which is coming in shortly. All those are laid out in the motion.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o134"><a name="90625-0011.htm_para11"><a name="09062552000884">The other proposed change will mean that, from 1 April 2009, no member of the scheme will be able to build up further benefits in excess of the two-thirds limit. Only a small number of scheme members can currently do so. It is important to make the point that, on average, an MP in the House serves just over 12 years. The motion therefore brings forward the interim measures necessary to cap the Exchequer contribution immediately, in line with the January 2008 resolution of the House.</p>

 The point is to set a limit so that people in that situation will not be able to accrue further benefits. The vast bulk of members of the scheme are those who have entered the House newly or in the past couple of Parliaments. The average service of an MP is just over 12 years, so as I have said, only a small number of members of the scheme are in that situation. <i> [Interruption.] </i>I can get the hon.

My right hon. Friend the Leader of the House is therefore content to return with further proposals to ensure that the Exchequer&#146;s contribution this year does not exceed that of last year.

Minister did not have the power to change his top team as he wished, he had to satisfy a clash of ministerial egos by carving up a Department completely on the hoof&#151;so much so that some civil servants returned to their desks after lunch to find that their Department had been abolished in the meantime. As I am afraid is often the case in reshuffles, no serious thought was given to the implications for hugely important areas of policy on the back of the reshuffle that was suddenly conducted.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o140"><a name="90625-0012.htm_para4"><a name="09062552000895">In this case, I think we all accept that the biggest loser, apart from some individuals, was science. When the Prime Minister took up his post in July 2007, he broke up the Department for Trade and Industry and shoved science into the Department for Innovation, Universities and Skills. As a result, the Science and Technology Committee was abolished and subsumed into the wider Committee on that Department, despite the serious protestations and concerns of the science community.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o141"><a name="90625-0012.htm_para5"><a name="09062552000896">In the Prime Minister&#146;s latest Cabinet reshuffle, science became a bit of a plaything of the noble Lord Mandelson, and was seen right from the start as being just one part of an over-inflated and largely unaccountable department. The Department for Business, Innovation and Skills has 12 Ministers in all, half of whom&#151;including the supposed science Minister&#151;are not in this House. The latest report of the Select Committee on Innovation, Universities, Science and Skills made it clear that because the Committee&#146;s remit was stretched so wide, it had struggled to give Government science policy the level of scrutiny that it deserved. The new DBIS Committee, being even larger, would have been totally unable to handle the scale of the issues at hand, as it will already have to deal with the Royal Mail and EU regulation, along with universities and measures to stimulate manufacturing.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o142"><a name="90625-0012.htm_para6"><a name="09062552000897">There are two reasons why it is particularly important at this time to scrutinise the Government&#146;s spending and activity on science and technology. First, as the Innovation, Universities, Science and Skills Committee said, there is a widespread view that British technology and its research and innovation can help us climb out of this recession. The weakness of the pound is providing a much needed boost for manufacturing opportunities. Although a weak pound is not good for everyone, the Government should be encouraging manufacturers to seize the initiative by investing in research and development. Secondly, science will be central to Britain&#146;s ability to respond to the major challenges of the future, from climate change to tackling swine flu or any other form of pandemic flu.</p>

the private sector, which used to have many amply funded final salary schemes, the vast majority of schemes, if they have not closed already, are heading towards the closure that their funding now requires. In the middle of all that and all the difficulties that we have faced over the past few weeks, this House looks as though it has one of the most protected and generous schemes, compared with anybody else. We have the trustee of the scheme on our Benches this afternoon, my hon. Friend the Member for Bournemouth, West (Sir John Butterfill), who will go into the details more than me.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman has put his finger on it: our pension scheme looks as though it is one of the most generous, but when we look into it, we see that it is no more generous than many other public sector schemes. If I was to retire at 60, I would receive no more money from the parliamentary scheme than I would have received from my other pension scheme, as a classroom teacher. We do ourselves a disservice by making it appear as though we have a very good, copper-bottomed pension scheme. It is a good scheme, but it is no better than many others in the public sector.</p>

 The House will have heard what the hon. Gentleman has said. There are many arguments surrounding the scheme, many of which are difficult to put in the current climate of public opinion. By and large, the scheme would have been totally self-funding, had the Government not taken such a long contributions holiday. The Minister has today made the point that the tenure of Members, unlike others in the public sector, is quite short, at only 10 or 11 years. Indeed, the final salary is exactly the same in one&#146;s 30th year in this place as it is on the day one is first elected. In that sense, there is no progression through the ranks of seniority, which would otherwise dramatically add to the pay-out made.</p>

The policy of my right hon. Friend the Leader of the Opposition is to wind up the scheme for new entrants. In the mean time, however, we have to look at its funding, its benefits and its terms and conditions, to which end the Government have tabled their motion today.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o146"><a name="90625-0012.htm_para10"><a name="09062552000903">One element will be welcomed by the public, which is that we are going to contribute more out of our pay packets. However, there is another, unfortunate aspect, which is that we are in the middle of a number of changing forces, which would have made it better for the Government not to have tabled anything at all just at the moment. The trustees are looking at the scheme in detail, as is the Senior Salaries Review Body. In the middle of all that, the Government have tabled today&#146;s motion, but at the same time, they are asking the Exchequer to contribute more. That is what people find difficult.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o147"><a name="90625-0012.htm_para11"><a name="09062552000904">The Government could have looked at alternatives. The main reason, above all others, why the actuaries looked at the arithmetic and decided that the fund needs more money is that former members&#151;and, as the predictions of the actuaries go, existing and future members&#151;are living longer. The issue is longevity much  <br>

more than it is the value of the fund. At a time when the Government intend to raise the state pension age, it looks odd that they have not considered, as their first priority, raising the age at which former members can benefit from the pay-out.</p>

 The key point is that all those things were looked at, but two points pertain to today&#146;s debate. One is that we needed a simple interim measure to cap the Exchequer contribution, and that is what we have in today&#146;s motion. The Government have to enact the decision made earlier by the House. The second and most important point is that there was already a review&#151;the Prime Minister asked the Senior Salaries Review Body for a review in February&#151;so in some ways we are moving ahead on things ourselves, even though there is parallel action outside this place. I can tell the hon. Gentleman that a great deal of work has been done, and that it will be possible to present a spread of options for hon. Members to review. We are aware that the SSRB is also undertaking its own review and taking evidence from hon. Members, and we would not wish to prejudge any recommendations that it might make.</p>

 Despite what the Deputy Leader of the House says, she should, in all honesty, admit that the Government have been rather clumsy about this. If he catches your eye, Madam Deputy Speaker, the chairman of the trustees, my hon. Friend the Member for Bournemouth, West will be able to explain this in detail, but I am not confident that we have been consulted in the depth that the issue merits. So, something that was sprung on us by the Government has rather backfired, leading to their having to face the full wrath of the newspapers last night, and seeing what they were planning to write the next day&#151;that is, today&#151;forced them to change their mind about their attitude to this issue.</p>

I served on it for three years in what I like to think of as its golden age. It was a wonderful Committee, precisely because it did not have to spend all its time looking at the activities of a particular Department and because it could range so widely over the scientific and technological aspects of the way in which the Government operate and pick out the areas in which it had particular expertise, or draw on such expertise, in order to inform the House and the Government. That is why the terms of reference are so important. I am pleased that the Deputy Leader of the House expanded on the Committee&#146;s role in her own words as it is not said on paper. I hope that some sort of Pepper <i> v.</i><i> </i>Hart procedure will be adopted in the House, so that there is no misunderstanding on the part of the Government as to the range of the Committee&#146;s activities.</p>

He not only discouraged us from looking at what the Home Office was doing, but he actually put pressure on the Department for Transport to ensure that we did not know what that Department was doing either.</p>

That is why the amendment is so important. Is there a deficit? I understand that deficits are reported by actuaries, but I have no confidence in actuarial science. I suspect that exam papers for actuarial science are very similar to exam papers in economics; as it used to be said, the questions are the same each year, it is just the answers that change. Actuaries never seem to be consistent for more than one year, but there we are.</p>

 My hon. Friend reads my mind perfectly. Longevity is something we have to live with&#151;<i> [Interruption.] </i>I am sorry.

<p><a name="stpa_o158"><a name="90625-0013.htm_para0"><a name="09062552000926">We must take careful cognisance of a further reason: there is a problem with all public sector pensions. Unless we in the House can clearly demonstrate that we are taking a lead, we will not be able to introduce the necessary reforms to public sector pension schemes. Public sector pensions are not constructed in the same way as private sector pensions now are. There is an unsustainable difference, and unless we are prepared to take difficult decisions, we will not be able to square that circle. We will not persuade a single person working in the public sector that there is a necessity to reform pension schemes if we are unable to reform our own.</p>

 There are real problems with the police scheme. As the hon. Gentleman might recall, I used to be chairman of the Avon and Somerset police authority. One of our recurrent problems in balancing our budget each year was the difficulty of paying for the police pension scheme. Many things are not clearly understood about the police pension scheme, not least the contribution made by police officers, but the difficulty has never been resolved.</p>

When I was leader of Somerset county council, I worked out that the council was sustaining in work or pension 10 chief fire officers, who tend to retire early and who had schemes that cost a lot of money. I do not resent public sector workers having adequate pensions, but we must accept that there will be increasing difficulties in paying for some of those pension arrangements out of the public purse. We must be honest about that, as we must be honest about all our difficulties with the national Exchequer and the deficits that we are building up. We must work out how to do so with respect for the individuals concerned, understanding the circumstances of those who work in the public sector while recognising that the current position is increasingly unsustainable.</p>

Therefore, I am slightly puzzled by his argument. He seems to be saying that for people with a poor pension record who come into Parliament, the parliamentary scheme should make up for lost time. That would apply to people who have had nothing before and those who have very generous provision, because the same rules apply to all of us. Surely he is not saying that our scheme should make up for the mess of the rest of our pension rights, whether we have them or not.</p>

As we heard from the hon. Member for Christchurch (Mr. Chope), many other people in the public sector receive better pensions than we do, and that may be a good thing. The hon. Member for Northavon (Steve Webb) shakes his head. He ought to talk to some chief police officers and chief fire officers. If they were honest, they would say that their pensions were far better than ours. They have security, which is the one thing that we never have in this place.

<p><a name="stpa_o164"><a name="90625-0013.htm_para6"><a name="09062552000944">The hon. Member for Macclesfield (Sir Nicholas Winterton)&#151;I might call him my hon. Friend in this context&#151;made a useful observation. We are in our present mess because, as has happened with so many other pensions, we allowed an undue holiday to arise, with the result that the pot is far less full than it should be. Let me reinforce the hon. Gentleman&#146;s point by saying to the Minister that it would be good to see the figures. If nothing else, that would enable us to hold our heads a little higher and to say, &#147;Yes, this is the additional Treasury support for which we have asked&#151;after all, the Treasury is our employer whether we like it or not&#151;but the Treasury gained throughout the period during which there was either no contribution or no additional contribution, as there should have been, because of the holiday.&#148;</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o165"><a name="90625-0013.htm_para7"><a name="09062552000945">Notwithstanding what has been said about the so-called &#163;5 billion raid, I have always been adamant in my belief that one of the two greatest problems in the public sector is the pension holiday. That is certainly true in much of the private sector, but anyone who considers some of the ways in which local authorities have manipulated pension funds over the years will see what I mean. The other great problem is the mania for early retirement. In the Equality Bill Committee on Tuesday, I argued against what is lovingly described as &#147;the national default retirement age&#148;, which I used to call &#147;65&#148;, because I consider it to be a form of discrimination. As I said then, one of the things on which we ought to pride ourselves&#151;I will cast no aspersions&#151;is the fact that no such discrimination exists in the House of Commons. Many Members remain here until they are well past 65 and there is no pressure for them to go any earlier, other than what the electorate might do to them. The early retirement mania has never affected this place in terms of its representation.</p>

 I have some information that may help my hon. Friend and others who have referred to the pension holiday, as the reduction in Exchequer contributions has been described. This year&#146;s increase is entirely due to higher costs caused by the longevity to which Members have referred. It is possible that the years of reduced Exchequer contributions led to increased contributions in 2003 and 2006, but it remains the case that the Government do not pursue a policy of overfunding during a period of surplus. Whatever Members may think about actuarial science, the Government have to follow the guidance of the Government Actuary.</p>

 I hear what my hon. Friend says, but I always thought it the epitome of madness that when more money was available, we imposed a cap, so that when we were then in a time of difficulty, we never had enough money because no surplus had been built up in the better times. I never saw the logic in that, but that is a piece of history.</p>

<p><a name="st_o350"><a name="09062552000948"><a name="90625-0013.htm_spnew18"><a name="09062552003832"><b>Sir Nicholas Winterton:</b>
 The hon. Gentleman is making an excellent and informative speech. Does he know whether any inquiry or survey has been conducted into how much early retirement, particularly in local government but also in other areas, may have cost pension funds, because people have been able to retire from 50 onwards? I am not referring only to Sir Fred Goodwin and his pension, and the &#163;17 billion pension pot. Is it not true that indulging in early retirement has been very costly for pension funds, because people are drawing a pension very early and living to a ripe old age?</p>

<p><a name="st_o351"><a name="09062552000949"><a name="90625-0013.htm_spnew19"><a name="09062552003833"><b>Mr. Drew:</b>
 I am beginning to think that we are a double act&#151;but of course we are not. Some years ago I put a number of parliamentary questions to the Treasury because I wanted an estimate of those figures, to which the answer was, sadly, &#147;We cannot, and we won&#146;t.&#148; I think that does us all a great disservice, because I believe this issue should be debated. I argue strongly with my colleagues in the public sector that they have a duty in respect of their retirement age. If I were still a teacher, I would be retiring in a couple of years&#146; time, but I think I would be fairly useful as a classroom teacher beyond that age. Thankfully, many teachers carry on working beyond that age, but there is still a belief that 60 is the retirement age&#151;that that is the age at which people should go, come what may. I shall park that point now, but I feel strongly about it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o166"><a name="90625-0013.htm_para8"><a name="09062552000950">I want to make two further points. We talk about longevity being the cause of the problem. I cannot prove this, but I have been told by more than one Minister that one reason why the parliamentary scheme was always so robust was that until comparatively recently, being an MP was not the best line of work to be in for having a long and deserving retirement. It may well be that we are becoming more like those in all other walks of life, and are beginning to have a quality of life after we leave this place, but it is important that we look at the reasons for the particular nature of any scheme and argue the case for its special qualities and characteristics.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o167"><a name="90625-0013.htm_para9"><a name="09062552000951">Let me turn to my second point. The Labour party has a benevolent fund, because until comparatively recently many people retired from this House in a very poor state. We rightly continue to support those people, as those of us who are much better off with a much higher standard of pension provision have an obligation to support those who are not. Again, I want to put on the record that, in contrast with the message that has often been put across, it is not true that we have done much better over a long period than others in the public sector, many of whom we represent. The parliamentary scheme has evolved over time. It is a good scheme now, but it was not always so. Many people have suffered, and we must learn the lessons from that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o168"><a name="90625-0013.htm_para10"><a name="09062552000952">This is not special pleading. I absolutely would have supported the amendment of the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome (Mr. Heath)&#151;I was going to refer to him as &#147;right hon.&#148;, but that is only a matter of time&#151;because I agree with him that we must give such a lead. However, it annoys me&#151;occasionally my blood does boil&#151;that whenever the BBC or Sky or the papers are talking about &#147;greedy MPs&#148;, they always have the throwaway line, &#147;who have gold-plated pensions.&#148;</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o169"><a name="90625-0013.htm_para11"><a name="09062552000953">We should at least put on the record that those pensions are not quite as good as some suggest. I have been fortunate because I have been able to conflate my teacher&#146;s pension with the parliamentary scheme, which puts me in a better position. But as I said to the hon. Member for Rutland and Melton (Alan Duncan), we have achieved the position that many schemes should be in&#151;a claw-back, so if someone retires before 65, they are seriously penalised.</p>

 If we really want to get across the message that our pensions are not as gold-plated as is often assumed, we are the last people who should make that case. We need someone independent, such as the SSRB, to make that case for us.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o170"><a name="90625-0013.htm_para12"><a name="09062552000955">The House appears to be relatively unanimous about the motion, but behind it is a much larger debate about whether we should continue with a defined benefit contribution scheme, like most of the public sector. Does my hon. Friend think that that is something that we should protect?</p>

<p><a name="st_o353"><a name="09062552000956"><a name="90625-0013.htm_spnew21"><a name="09062552003835"><b>Mr. Drew:</b>
 My hon. Friend always asks me easy questions. It is worth fighting for a defined benefit scheme, because that is the gold standard that has been created over a long period of time. However, I accept that we cannot have the public sector doing one thing and the private sector doing something else entirely. That is hypocritical and unfair, and we have to have the debate. However, in the public sector, the debate would be much more reasonable if people accepted that 65 was the normal retirement age. In that case, they would make contributions up to that age, which would deal with many of the problems arising from unfair demands on the fund.</p>

<p><a name="st_o354"><a name="09062552000957"><a name="90625-0013.htm_spnew22"><a name="09062552003836"><b>Kelvin Hopkins:</b>
 My hon. Friend has drawn a contrast between the public and private sectors, and it is unfair to the private sector. Does he agree that in the longer term we should look to a universal pension arrangement for employees, under which we all have defined benefit schemes with the heavy involvement of the state, as necessary?</p>

<p><a name="st_o355"><a name="09062552000958"><a name="90625-0013.htm_spnew23"><a name="09062552003837"><b>Mr. Drew:</b>
 Yes, and we have to make the argument that people will have to make reasonable contributions. We are supposed to take the lead on this, but we have let people down by allowing them to believe that their contributions can remain the same even if they live longer and retire earlier. That does not add up, and it has brought many funds crashing down.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o171"><a name="90625-0013.htm_para13"><a name="09062552000959">I shall conclude my remarks on that gloomy note, but I hope that the next time a journalist makes the throwaway observation that MPs&#146; pensions are gold-plated, they will also publish their own pension arrangements and what they have managed to get out of the system. They might discover that they are somewhat better off than MPs.</p>

 In the debate so far, there has been a lot of conjecture and of looking back to the past, and I wish to try to put it into context.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o172"><a name="90625-0013.htm_para14"><a name="09062552000961">There was indeed a considerable period during which the Treasury did not contribute the correct amount to the parliamentary scheme. If one looks back to the previous valuation that was conducted by the Government Actuary, one clearly sees that the deficit was approaching &#163;50 million, all of which was attributable to the Government failing to pay the employer&#146;s contribution, which is, of course, funded by the taxpayer. That might or might not have been a correct decision, but it did mean that there was a deficit that had to be covered. The Government suggested that it should be covered by increased Government payments over 15 years.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o173"><a name="90625-0013.htm_para15"><a name="09062552000962">That has been part of the problem in the perception of where we are going now. The Government&#146;s contribution now looks unreasonably high, whereas a high proportion of it is related to their failure to contribute in the past. That is not just a criticism of the present Government; it also applies to the previous Government.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman is absolutely right&#151;I do not demur from what he has just said. However, can he help me to understand something that is puzzling me about the motion? The combined contribution, including the deficit contribution to which he refers, is 28.7 per cent., but the Government Actuary says that, per year, 8.5 per cent. is the cost of servicing the deficit&#151;that is the figure in the most recent review. So, 28.7 minus 8.5 is 20.2. The Government are trying to cap at 20 per cent. Does he understand why the Government have made proposals that do not achieve the 20 per cent. cap but bring it to 20.2 per cent.? I do not understand it, and wonder whether he can explain it to me.</p>

 I think I do. May I come to that in due course? I shall try to be helpful to the hon. Gentleman, and if he does not understand when I explain it then I shall have to apologise to him at that time.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o174"><a name="90625-0014.htm_para0"><a name="09062552000965">A very substantial Government contribution was necessary to bring a deficit back in line with where it should have been. It arose from the failure to contribute the correct amount, as originally advised by the Government Actuary. The Government Actuary, to be fair to the Government, said, &#147;Well, things are going rather well. The stock market is looking pretty good, so you can probably tolerate not paying in.&#148; That is one of the problems with the way in which pensions have been funded in the past, and I want to expand on that point a little further, if I may.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o175"><a name="90625-0014.htm_para1"><a name="09062552000966">If, at the previous valuation, the Government had been making the correct contributions, the Members&#146; scheme would have been about &#163;5 million in surplus rather than nearly &#163;50 million in deficit. That, I think, is worth bearing in mind as background. Today, the Government Actuary is saying, &#147;Now we have to take into account longevity. We have reviewed the problems of longevity and we have found that we probably have not made enough allowance for the improvement in people&#146;s lives over many years. We need to adjust for the fact that people are likely to live longer.&#148; The impact of that is to reverse the situation. We now need to raise, probably, another &#163;50 million or thereabouts. There will have to be increased contributions to cover that element. That problem would not be there if we had dealt with it earlier.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o176"><a name="90625-0014.htm_para2"><a name="09062552000967">My view is that the present system of valuing pensions, whether in the public sector or the private sector, is stark raving bonkers. We ask actuaries, every three years, to value each scheme and to try to see where the pitfalls or benefits might lie. When times are really good and stock markets are going up, they say that we should not bother to put any money in because we will come through with a surplus. When times get bad, they say, &#147;Gosh, you&#146;ve got to put a shedload of money in. Times are terrible, and you have to put more money in.&#148; That is at a time when most schemes&#151;certainly those in the private sector&#151;have not got any money, because times are bad.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o177"><a name="90625-0014.htm_para3"><a name="09062552000968">That has to be a crazy way of dealing with final salary pension schemes. It seems to me that the actuarial profession should, over many years, have been taking a long-term view. Pensions do not go from year to year&#151;they cover 30 or 40 years at a time. We should therefore establish what the appropriate contribution should be from the scheme sponsor&#151;and, indeed, from the scheme members if they also contribute, as we do&#151;over a period of 30 years or more.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o178"><a name="90625-0014.htm_para4"><a name="09062552000969">Those figures are available. Quite a few analyses have been performed over the past 30 or 40 years that make it clear what has been going on, despite all the huge ups and downs in the markets. They show that schemes that have invested in shares have gone up by about 8 per cent. per annum, while those that have invested in property have gone up by about 7 per cent. and those in Government bonds have risen by about 6.5 per cent.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o179"><a name="90625-0014.htm_para5"><a name="09062552000970">That is what has happened over a 30 or 40-year horizon. There have been wild variations within that, but the people who run pension schemes should fund for long-term liabilities. At the moment, people in both the public and private sectors are paying the price for tolerating wild valuations that are merely snapshots in time and bear no relation to what is likely to happen over a long period.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o180"><a name="90625-0014.htm_para6"><a name="09062552000971">The adverse effect of longevity means that schemes must be adjusted for the increase in people&#146;s lifetimes. That can achieved in only one logical way, and that is by increasing retirement ages in line with the increase in longevity so that people who live a long time fund the cost of receiving their pension provision over a longer time than was originally anticipated. They will have to wait a little longer before they draw their pensions and if they choose, for whatever reason, to take their pensions early they will suffer a diminution in what they get. Obviously, people who are seriously ill can take sickness retirement, which can be covered through insurance.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o181"><a name="90625-0014.htm_para7"><a name="09062552000972">That is how schemes should be structured. Our scheme is not so structured, however, and neither are most private sector schemes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o182"><a name="90625-0014.htm_para8"><a name="09062552000973">Last year, the Government said that costs were rising and might rise still further. Without taking into account what they were having to pay to make up the deficits that had been allowed to accrue, they sought to cap the Government contribution at 20 per cent. The House debated that proposal, and accepted that there would have to be some capping of the Government contribution to protect the taxpayer. We then had to look at what we might do thereafter.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o183"><a name="90625-0014.htm_para9"><a name="09062552000974">More than a year ago the Government said that they would instruct the Senior Salaries Review Body to look at the issue, and to make recommendations to the Government and the House about how the scheme might be amended for the future. If they had issued that instruction, we might have had the SSRB report before us today, as we debate what is almost a crisis adjustment. Sadly, for reasons that I can only begin to guess at, the Government did not in fact instruct the SSRB until earlier this year.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o184"><a name="90625-0014.htm_para10"><a name="09062552000975">The Government&#146;s proposal before the House today has an air of crisis about it, in that it says that, if something is not done, they will go over the 20 per cent. limit, backdated to 1 April. The amendment takes a further step backwards, and adopts the approach that we would have had were we looking at the matter a year ago. It will not solve the problem that I have identified, for which the Government will have to come up with something after the end of the debate today.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o186"><a name="90625-0014.htm_para12"><a name="09062552000977">The trustees have considered that point, as we have considered many other proposals&#151;largely produced by us&#151;to reduce the cost of the scheme. It was at the initiative of the trustees that the right to retire before 65 without penalty was removed. We have also considerably tightened the rules on early retirement for ill health. We think that in the past there may have been some abuses, which were expensive, although nothing like the abuses in some other areas of the public sector. Nevertheless, the change will produce significant savings. We are still waiting for the Government to implement it and we are slightly surprised that it was not included in the motion.</p>

 Will my hon.

Would we lose benefits if we discontinued our payments to the scheme? Can my hon. Friend help me on that point? Clearly, we have to give the Department of Resources instructions as to whether to continue paying contributions to the pension fund.</p>

 It is my understanding that Members affected by the change would not be able to continue making contributions, but their rights under the scheme will continue to be safeguarded. The only change for my hon. Friend would be that if he wished to continue saving for his retirement, he would be unable to do it through the parliamentary scheme but there would be opportunities for him to do so elsewhere without losing his rights as a member of the scheme.</p>

That is all fairly transparent, and means that Members will be paying considerably more this year, because the change will be backdated to last April. On that basis, for those on the upper level scheme, the net cost would have been about &#163;60 a month. If the Government accept the Liberal Democrat proposal or something similar, the amount could double and the cost would be about &#163;120 a month to Members.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o190"><a name="90625-0014.htm_para16"><a name="09062552000983">There is a significant read-on to other defined benefit schemes, whether in the private or public sector.

<p><a name="stpa_o191"><a name="90625-0014.htm_para17"><a name="09062552000984">Let me say a few other things about the scheme because all sorts of aspects of its nature are misunderstood by not only the general public, but even apparently well-informed members of the actuarial profession. Most members of the public think that ordinary Back Benchers retire on the basis of the Back-Bench salary, but they also think that Ministers and other office holders in the House will enjoy a pension based on their increased salaries. They think that the Chancellor of the Exchequer will retire on a pension that is two thirds of his salary as Chancellor, but that is totally untrue. The Chancellor&#146;s pension will be the same as that of the humblest Member, except that the additional 10 per cent. contributions that he pays while he is a Minister will be reflected in a modest supplement to the pension.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o192"><a name="90625-0014.htm_para18"><a name="09062552000985">The only exceptions to that arrangement have been Prime Ministers, Lord Chancellors and the Speaker, although I gather that some of them have said that they will not take the extra money. That is an honourable position, but individuals must make up their own minds. The public assume that our scheme is the same as every other and that as we rise up the ladder and reach more senior positions, we get a bigger pension, but we do not. That point needs to be clearly made because it addresses the biggest misunderstanding about the parliamentary scheme. That is not to say, however, that our scheme is not better than that of many of our constituents, but it is not quite as gold-plated as the media have led the public to believe, so it is important to get that on record.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o193"><a name="90625-0014.htm_para19"><a name="09062552000986">It is also important to put it on record that the level of the contributions made by Members&#151;10 per cent. with the 1/40th scheme for which most hon. Members opt&#151;is almost unprecedented. I think that only the police pay more, but their payments reflect the fact that they can retire at least 10 years earlier than we can.</p>

to the House over many years through his chairmanship of the parliamentary pension fund. I was privileged to serve on the fund for a good six or seven years after 1997 and I saw the skilful way in which he steered the fund and coped with the problems that were faced.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o195"><a name="90625-0014.htm_para21"><a name="09062552000991">The hon. Gentleman said that the average term of a Member of Parliament was now considered to be 12 years. I am sure that he recalls that one of the first things that we did after 1997 was to review the average span of time spent as a Member of Parliament, and it was eight years in those days. To draw on the remarks made by my hon. Friend the Member for Stroud (Mr. Drew), who made an excellent speech, that shows that many Members leave the House in what would otherwise be the middle of their career. They then find it difficult to resume the career that they had before entering Parliament. Often, their income, and their pension in particular, suffers as a result, because they can never return to the position they would have had if they had not entered Parliament. I take issue with my hon. Friend the Member for Stroud on one point. He talked about the pension scheme being a perk. It is always wrong to think of pension schemes as a perk. In any walk of life, a pension scheme is one thing and one thing only: it is wages deferred, and we must always regard it as such.</p>

<p><a name="st_o364"><a name="09062552000992"><a name="90625-0014.htm_spnew7"><a name="09062552003846"><b>Mr. Drew:</b>

 I entirely accept my hon. Friend&#146;s correction. He is right that the pension is often perceived as a perk, but it is wages deferred. It should always be considered as such in calculations of the whole remuneration package. That is true whether we are talking about Members of Parliament or any person in the public or private sector work force. It is absolutely right that we should contribute to the costs imposed on the fund as a result of longevity. In so far as the proposals seek to achieve that, they should be accepted by Members in all parts of the House.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o196"><a name="90625-0014.htm_para22"><a name="09062552000994">I should like to reinforce the remarks of the hon. Member for Bournemouth, West. He said that actuarial calculations are a snapshot. It is particularly ridiculous for a snapshot taken at a time of global shares meltdown in 2008-09 to set the pattern for the future. Of course, the previous actuarial calculations related to 2005. He made the point very well that had the employer&#146;s contributions been maintained over that period, the fund would, in 2005, have been in a &#163;5 million surplus, rather than the &#163;50 million deficit that it found itself in. It is important to recognise that actuaries looking at pension funds always seem to take account of the good times, in terms of stopping putting contributions in, but of course it is precisely at the bad times that they reassess, look at the stock market and say that the fund has a much lower valuation than they believed it would have, so extra money has to be put in. Usually, that demand falls not only on the employer&#146;s part of the contribution, but on the employees&#146; part, too. That is a way in which employees&#151;I am referring not simply to Members in this House, but to employees who contribute to any pension fund&#151;end up being short-changed by that method of valuation.</p>

earlier. I will try to make my point more clearly now. She will note that whether the accrual rate is 1/40th or 1/50th of final salary, the increase in percentage contribution demanded is 1.9 per cent. In paragraph (1)(c) of the motion, which relates to an accrual rate of 1/60th of final salary, the increase in percentage contribution is simply 0.4 per cent. My question does not relate simply to the disparity between those percentage rates. It is based on a calculation of the respective total percentage contributions, which are 5.9, 7.9 and 11.9 per cent.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o198"><a name="90625-0014.htm_para24"><a name="09062552000996">I know that my hon.

On a &#163;64,000 salary, those percentages represent respectively &#163;3,776, &#163;5,056 and &#163;7,616. If she then calculates what 1/40th, 1/50th and 1/60th of that salary is, she will find that it equates respectively to &#163;1,066, &#163;1,280 and &#163;1,600 in retirement.</p>

That is the way it always works with such schemes, but the move to 67 years old, which I have suggested, is in line with what we are doing on national insurance-based pensions, whose starting age will go up over the years to 68.

I would like to seek clarification from the Deputy Leader of the House, who I hope has had the chance to seek inspiration, on the issue that I raised in intervening on the hon.

<p><a name="stpa_o205"><a name="90625-0015.htm_para1"><a name="09062552001013">The motion in front of us says that the Exchequer contribution will be 28.7 per cent.; that much seems unambiguous. However, page 25 of the Government Actuary&#146;s report published in March 2009 says that the amount needed to clear the deficit is 8.5 per cent. per year; there are two components&#151;the amount for the recurring liabilities and the amount to clear the historic deficit, and the second of those is 8.5 per cent. According to my maths, if we take 8.5 per cent. from 28.7 per cent., we end up with 20.2 per cent. I am aware that that 8.5 per cent. was 8.7 per cent. last year&#151;and 28.7 minus 8.7 is 20, so I can see why that would have appeared to be the right number. This year, however, it does not appear to be the right number, as 28.7 minus 8.5 is 20.2.</p>

sympathy for what the hon. Member for Bournemouth, West said about increasing retirement ages; that is a good direction in which to go. Pending that, however, what should we be doing for 2009-10?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o207"><a name="90625-0015.htm_para3"><a name="09062552001015">We are all aware that the world has moved on. A 20 per cent. Exchequer contribution was first mooted two years ago, in 2007. That has been the backdrop to our deliberations for a two-year period, but we would all accept that the world of 2007 was very different from ours today. What seemed appropriate then as a cap on the Treasury contribution does not seem so now. It was a very different economic environment. That was not quite so before the crash, but we were certainly not in the full depths of the economic problems. The position of people in many other pension schemes was not as apparent as it is now, and public attitudes to the House were obviously different then.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o208"><a name="90625-0015.htm_para4"><a name="09062552001016">I accept the point made by the hon. Member for Stroud (Mr. Drew). We should not apologise for existing or for the work that we do, and we should not give an inappropriate impression of the pensions and benefits that we receive. However, many of us feel that the world has simply moved on so much that it is inappropriate in 2009-10 to ask the taxpayer to make any additional contribution to our pensions in comparison with 2008-09.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o209"><a name="90625-0015.htm_para5"><a name="09062552001017">It is sometimes suggested that that is a hair-shirt approach, but it is worth putting the issue in context. We are talking about the difference between an employer contribution of 28.7 per cent&#151;or 20.2 per cent., which takes away the deficit bit for the sake of comparability; that is how I think it should be&#151;and 18.1 per cent. or 18.3 per cent., depending on what people think the right number is. In other words, we are arguing about whether the taxpayer should put 20 per cent. or so or 18 per cent. or so of our salary into our pensions. Such figures would be beyond the dreams of avarice for anybody in the private sector and for quite a number of people in the public sector. Occasionally we need to remind ourselves that although, as the hon. Member for Stroud said, some people right at the top of the public sector in certain professions have exceptionally generous pensions, their numbers are relatively small. The vast swathe of public sector workers retire on vastly less generous pensions than we do.</p>

sector pensions and the wider economy are moving on. We in this House should therefore have discretion not always to have to wait for the next independent review, which might take 18 months or might not be due to report for another year.

 That is a very thoughtful comment. In my view, we have to be a leading indicator. We must be able to consider what is happening in the public sector with some credibility. Public sector pensions are very diverse, and I do not have a blanket view about them. The amount that workers put in, the salary that they get, their job security and the physical demands on them are different, and there is not a one-size-fits-all answer to the public sector pension issue.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o215"><a name="90625-0015.htm_para11"><a name="09062552001025">That is why our party believes in having, perhaps as the first act of a new Government, an independent commission, ideally with buy-in across the political spectrum, to review public sector pensions urgently. It could ensure that they are fair to the taxpayer, who makes a substantial contribution to them, and to public sector workers. Some of them at the top do extraordinarily well, but some at the bottom have pretty rotten jobs with pretty poor salaries and end up with pretty poor pensions. There is a balance to be struck, and if we want to say anything about later retirement ages, for example, it would be appropriate for us to have examined our own scheme first and been willing to take the relevant conclusions on the chin ourselves.</p>

 One point that must be addressed is that those who leave a scheme early often receive enhancements. There is a belief that those enhancements come almost from outer space, but in fact they come from the scheme. They have a disproportionate effect on lower-paid people who serve their full term and then end up with an even poorer pension.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman makes a powerful point. We have been doing some research on local authority chief executives and senior officers, for example, who seem to retire very early and get substantial boosts to their pension on leaving.

Member for Bournemouth, West, the chairman of the trustees, and with the Leader of the House and her colleagues. Assuming that the amendment is passed, I will be happy to discuss with them how to achieve the right mixture in a way that deals with taxpayers&#146; concerns but is fair to hon. Members.</p>

 I thank the hon. Gentleman for being liberal in taking interventions. Is not the weakness of both the amendment and the motion that these ideas have been brought forward by Members of Parliament, for Members of Parliament? There is little or no trust outside in MPs taking decisions about themselves. Would it not therefore be better to refer all this to an independent body? I submit that the SSRB has not always been seen to be independent on public sector issues, so perhaps we should roll the whole thing into the Kelly review, which appears to have the confidence of the public and which will report later this year.</p>

 One of my concerns about that suggestion is that it would mean yet more delay. As our debate has illustrated, these are complex matters. Bringing the review under a different review body, which would not quite have to start from scratch, but which would have to get up to speed quickly, could delay things further. Either way, we need a decision for 2009-10, and as I have said, we are already nearly three months late in making it. Until we have heard the views of independent experts, the public will expect us to make a decision now. They will judge what we do, and to go by the indications that we have been given in the past 24 hours, and certainly the feedback that I have received, the public welcome what we have done.</p>

Members might be interested to learn that some of the media comment about the amendment has almost been saying that this might be the moment when people finally get it. I would not be so arrogant as to suggest that that was down to me, but there is a sense of the commentators saying, &#147;Perhaps we&#146;re seeing a change in mood.&#148; Given everything that we have been through, it might be helpful to us to send a signal that we are looking at things differently. I hope that that will be constructive, rather than to the detriment of other colleagues in the House.</p>

 Perhaps my hon. Friend will answer on the record a question that I have asked him privately: what independent authority or body supports the amendment? In other words, is there a case for his proposal being agreed to now, on the basis that people outside this place have said, &#147;This is the right thing to do; therefore we should get on and do it&#148;?</p>

He was talking about what the independent review bodies should do, but as we have to take an interim decision for ourselves, he has given us the authority to look at what is happening in the wider economy. That substantiates the case for saying that it is entirely appropriate for us to take into account, in our interim decision making, what is happening to public sector pensions, where retirement ages are rising, and what is happening in the private sector, where there are some dreadful things. That is only right and proper.</p>

Member for Worthing, West (Peter Bottomley), who was the one Conservative MP to give his support, four weeks ago. I was grateful for the support of the other 197 last night, which was obviously what clinched things. However, I am also grateful to those hon. Members who were willing to go out on a limb, because I am aware that I probably lost my copy of &#147;How to Win Friends and Influence People&#148; in raising the matter in the first place.</p>

I hope that we can reach that point after this interim year. I also hope that in responding to this debate the Deputy Leader of the House will say whether she feels that the substantive motion hits the 20 per cent., because I do not believe that it does. However, I would also commend amendment (a) to the House.</p>

 Perhaps it is time for a change of mood. I have listened to most of this debate, which has been about the changes to Members&#146; pensions, and I agree with the hon. Member for Edmonton (Mr. Love). I have listened to the hon. Member for Bournemouth, West (Sir John Butterfill) and my hon. Friend the Member for Northavon (Steve Webb), who bring incredible expertise to this area, for which the whole House will thank them, but at the end of the day, unless things are done independently of the House of Commons, I suspect that the headlines that the hon.

changes that took place when the present Prime Minister took over; the speed with which the Departments were reorganised took everyone by surprise. He certainly did not consult me at the time; had he done so, I would have told him that certain responsibilities needed to be protected.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o223"><a name="90625-0015.htm_para19"><a name="09062552001040">I am grateful for the speedy way in which the science Minister, Lord Drayson, responded within three days to the Leader of the House to say that our idea clearly needed support and that he supported it. I cannot remember a Minister responding to the Leader of the House in such a clear way before. That spoke volumes about how the House and the broader science community view the importance of science in tackling all the great global challenges that we face. It would be inconceivable for a Department the size of the new Department for Business, Innovation and Skills, with all its responsibilities, not to have anyone examining the very machinery that will deliver the changes. The changes could involve the environment, energy, the green technologies or the plethora of health reforms coming out of our laboratories and our pharmaceutical and technology companies. Without being able to scrutinise all those matters, the House, the Government and our nation would all be the poorer. I want to put on record our genuine thanks to the science Minister.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o224"><a name="90625-0015.htm_para20"><a name="09062552001041">I also want to put on record my thanks to the many learned societies and organisations&#151;including the Royal Society of Chemistry, the Royal Academy of Engineering, the Royal Society, the Institute of Biology, the Institute of Physics, the Campaign for Science and Engineering and many others&#151;that did not just sit and say, &#147;Woe is us!&#148;, but wrote and lobbied the Government about the changes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o225"><a name="90625-0015.htm_para21"><a name="09062552001042">Above all, I want to thank the members of my present Committee, the Committee on Innovation, Universities, Science and Skills, including the hon. Member for Bolton, South-East (Dr. Iddon), who was in his place earlier, for the enormous job of work that they have done over many years&#151;in some cases, since before I arrived here. We heard earlier about the distinguished contribution of my hon. Friend the Member for Somerton and Frome (Mr. Heath) to the Committee in its halcyon days.</p>

I do not wish to comment on the circumstances in which he left the House, but it is important to put on record his enormous contribution to the House and to science, including his work in supporting cancer charities. He encouraged the Government to introduce cancer plans and followed that up. He also worked on embryology, and we should acknowledge that the draft Human Tissue and Embryos Bill was largely a result of his early work. I want to put on record my thanks to him, along with those of our Committee and, I hope, of the House, and to wish him well in his early retirement.</p>

I understand perfectly well why she does not wish to introduce new Standing Orders for a new Committee and instead to make all those arrangements under Standing Order No. 152, but for the Science and Technology Committee to work effectively, it is important that it has the power to scrutinise science budgets. The research councils spend the majority of the Government&#146;s money for pure science, and it is in respect of the protection of pure science that there is the greatest concern that the move into the new Department for Business, Innovation and Skills might see a shift towards greater transactional science and the use of science for business at the expense of basic pure science. I hope that the Deputy Leader of the House will be able to reassure me on that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o230"><a name="90625-0015.htm_para26"><a name="09062552001047">On the plight of universities, I am not betraying a confidence when I say that I had discussions this morning with the Vice-Chancellor of Cambridge university, Alison Richard. She expressed very real concerns about how universities are going to be scrutinised within this massive new Department. I fully accept that my Committee will be able to look at the research elements of universities&#151;that is right and proper&#151;but issues related to teaching, undergraduate work, access to universities, how we keep our universities world class and so forth is a job for a Committee on its own, particularly given that a review of fees will take place and that the former Secretary of State for Innovation, Universities and Skills has committed to reviewing the form and function of higher education in the future.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o231"><a name="90625-0015.htm_para27"><a name="09062552001048">As for the structure, the new Committee will have 14 members. I smiled earlier when the hon. Member for Rutland and Melton (Alan Duncan) spoke about the Conservative party&#146;s passion for science. The hon. Member for Windsor (Adam Afriyie) is a glowing example of that commitment, as he has maintained a huge desire to promote science on behalf of the Conservative party, and I pay tribute to him. I say to the Conservative Front Benchers, however, that although there were four Conservative members of the Committee since 2007, only one has ever turned up for active participation. Two members of the Committee&#151;the hon. Member for Mid-Bedfordshire (Nadine Dorries) and the hon. Member for Castle Point (Bob Spink)&#151;have never once attended a single Committee meeting.</p>

 We have had an excellent debate on two different motions this afternoon. I am pleased that we were able to discuss the Science and Technology Committee and the structures of such Committees as well as make some constructive contributions to the debate on pensions. I have been asked some specific questions, and I will ensure that good answers are provided to any that I am unable to answer here and now.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o233"><a name="90625-0016.htm_para1"><a name="09062552001053">We are all grateful that there is such a wide consensus on the new Science and Technology Committee. I regret that a mistaken step was taken in the past when we got rid of something that was doing excellent work. I am sure, however, that there is widespread consensus on the views just expressed by the hon. Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough (Mr. Willis).</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o234"><a name="90625-0016.htm_para2"><a name="09062552001054">In business questions today, there was discussion of what Select Committees can do. Let me re-emphasise that it is up to Committees to take a wide-ranging approach to their remit, and to examine the full scope of science policy and related matters across government. Earlier this week, a Hansard Society conference considered the role of departmental Select Committees. We have now moved beyond Departments turning around and saying to Select Committees, &#147;We don&#146;t want to answer that,&#148; or, &#147;You can&#146;t look at that.&#148; That should no longer occur in Select Committees. In the new spirit of reform, if a Select Committee decides that it wants to scrutinise research budgets, for example, it should be able to do so.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o235"><a name="90625-0016.htm_para3"><a name="09062552001055">I am also aware of the comments of Universities UK that there should be a Sub-Committee devoted to higher education. Clearly, it is up to the new departmental Select Committee to consider that. We would not want to tell it that it should set up a Sub-Committee, although clearly it could do so. Higher education is a key aspect of the work of any business Department&#151;and of the new Select Committee. It could not be otherwise. Education has been a priority for the Government since 1997. Let us hope that the Select Committee sets up such a Sub-Committee.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o236"><a name="90625-0016.htm_para4"><a name="09062552001056">May I, like other Members, thank the trustees of the parliamentary pension fund for their work, and particularly the hon. Member for Bournemouth, West (Sir John Butterfill), who spoke lucidly and expansively, for his chairmanship? May I correct the suggestion made by the shadow Leader of the House that there was a lack of consultation with the trustees and chair of the pension fund? My predecessor, the hon. Member for Rhondda (Chris Bryant), did consult the hon. Member for Bournemouth, West. In fact, we postponed the motions before the House because he was away for a short time due to ill health, and we felt that it would not be right to consider them without him here. In my new role, I have had meetings and reviewed earlier correspondence&#151;the consultation came in a busy week, but I was glad of the time I spent with him.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o237"><a name="90625-0016.htm_para5"><a name="09062552001057">On the questions about the 20 per cent. cap and the 0.2 per cent. figure, I cannot give adequate answers in the Chamber now. I will find out the answers to those good questions, and to the detailed questions put by my hon. Friend the Member for Brent, North (Barry Gardiner).</p>

Opposition Members feel that it should meet in Bridlington&#151;<i> [Interruption.]</i> I am supported in that view by my hon. Friends the Members for Scarborough and Whitby (Mr. Goodwill) and for Beverley and Holderness (Mr. Stuart). Will you confirm that under the provision of Standing Order 117A, it is not possible to debate the motion, or the motions that come before it, because of the terms of the Standing Order, even though we have not yet reached the moment of interruption? Because of that, is it not the case that the only way in which my hon. Friends and I can show our displeasure at the motions is by dividing the House?</p>

 On a point of order, Madam Deputy Speaker. Given that it is only 4.15 pm and the Minister is present, is it not possible for her to explain to us why the meeting of the North West Regional Grand Committee must take place when Parliament has reassembled, but other Regional Grand Committees are to meet when it is in recess? Some Committees are meeting at the same time as both the Liberal Democrat and the Conservative party conferences, yet none are meeting at the same time as the Labour party conference.

 On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker. The purpose of these motions is to provide for a uniform situation across England in which Regional Grand Committees are allowed to meet at certain appointed times. Following the Government&#146;s recent defeat, it appears that that policy is in complete disarray, and we now have inequity across England. Is it in your power to ask the Leader of the House to make a statement&#151;hopefully, one in which she announces that she intends to withdraw all the motions and go back to the drawing board?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o261"><a name="90625-0018.htm_para5"><a name="09062552002934"><i> Motion made, and Question proposed, </i>That this House do now adjourn.<i> &#151;(Mr. Watts.)</i></p>

 I know that Members are anxious to get away and enjoy the lovely evening, so I will not delay us any longer than necessary. However, I do believe that traditional crafts in this country have had very little air time, so to speak, on the Floor of the House, and I would like to try to put that right.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o262"><a name="90625-0018.htm_para6"><a name="09062552002936">Outside the workshop of Mike Turnock, who lives in Whaley Bridge in my constituency, there is a shelter that is evidently home to a community of toads. That is not the purpose of the shelter, however. It is also where Mike keeps his pieces of 5 ft long, 4-by-4 beech wood&#151;the raw material for his family business, which he inherited from his father. Mike takes the beech and, using a band saw, cuts it into strips of about 5 mm thick. He chamfers each end of the strip and places it into a steam bath. This homemade device, powered by the electric elements from four kettles, makes the beech supple and mouldable. Once the beech has been steamed and dried, he bends it around a jig built to his exact requirements so that the ends of the strip overlap significantly. The ends are then nailed into position in an adept and professional manner, using nails of exactly the right length, and the base of a garden sieve or riddle has been created. He then drills the requisite number of holes around the entire perimeter of the riddle, half in a horizontal plane and half perpendicular. These are the basis for the weaving of the sieve itself from steel wire. By the time the web has been created, assisted again by custom-made tools, everything has been finished off safely with no projecting ends and a rim has been placed around the outside of the sieve, it has taken him an hour&#146;s work.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o263"><a name="90625-0018.htm_para7"><a name="09062552002937">What Mike has created is a common or garden soil sieve, the like of which may be found in garden centres up and down the country. These are beautiful objects: they are rugged, good to hold, efficient and long lasting, and just so much nicer than the plastic equivalents that so many gardeners use today. In his father&#146;s day there would have been three or four men working in this workshop, and two or three similar workshops not too far away, but not today.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o264"><a name="90625-0018.htm_para8"><a name="09062552002938">The garden sieve is not the only type of sieve that Mike Turnock makes. He makes larger ones and smaller ones, ones with larger meshes and with finer meshes, and ones designed for separating cockles or shrimps from seawater or even rivets from sand in the Sheffield casting industry. The finest grade sieves are actually easier to make because the smaller mesh is bought in ready made from China. The finest food grade sieves also have their own demands from industry.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o265"><a name="90625-0018.htm_para9"><a name="09062552002939">I must declare an interest: my mother is now the proud owner of a garden sieve that Mike gave to me on the occasion of my visit to his workshop. Hon. Members may purchase their own from certain garden centres, although the supply is far less than potential demand, as Mike is the only person left in the country making these handmade sieves as far as I know. He only supplies garden centres in two regions of England.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o266"><a name="90625-0019.htm_para0"><a name="09062552002940">When Mike took on the business from his father, it was a going concern. It still is today: he is making a living and evidently loving it. After a few lean years  <br>

caused by illness, he is now back in full production again. But Mike is 64. He and his wife are now looking to retirement and there is no one left to carry on this business, despite the potential that exists for increasing sales.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o267"><a name="90625-0019.htm_para1"><a name="09062552002941">The same is true just down the road in Sheffield at the last handmade scissor makers in the country. Other craft skills are in equally short supply, which is ironic at a time when premium products such as these can sell on the basis of their quality and command a good price. Perhaps fortunes cannot be made, but livings certainly could be made from an expansion of these industries.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o268"><a name="90625-0019.htm_para2"><a name="09062552002942">Indeed, figures produced by the Department for Culture, Media and Sport actually support what I am saying: there are 157,400 registered creative businesses in this country, and they have growth rates faster than the economy as a whole. The Crafts Council recently launched its &#147;Crafts Blueprint&#148; for creative industries, and said:</p>
<a name="90625-0019.htm_brev0"><a name="09062552003061"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;New research undertaken by Creative &amp; Cultural Skills has identified that craft generates almost &#163;3 billion to the UK economy each year making it the fourth biggest sector&#148;&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o269"><a name="90625-0019.htm_para3"><a name="09062552002943">within the creative industries&#151;</p>
<a name="90625-0019.htm_brev1"><a name="09062552003062"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;after design, performing arts and music...Given that over 80% of the sector comprises small businesses employing 1-5 people, improving skills is essential to ensure this growth continues in the coming years.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o270"><a name="90625-0019.htm_para4"><a name="09062552002944">It went on:</p>
<a name="90625-0019.htm_brev2"><a name="09062552003063"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;The craft sector has one of the highest employment growth rates (11 per cent.) in the creative and cultural industries (according to DCMS between the years 1997-2006) and the demand for craft skills has never been higher. Expanding entry routes into the sector, diversifying the workforce and enhancing leadership and professional development are some of the main recommendations in the Blueprint.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o271"><a name="90625-0019.htm_para5"><a name="09062552002945">In the same press release, Rosy Greenlees, executive director of the Crafts Council, said:</p>
<a name="90625-0019.htm_brev3"><a name="09062552003064"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;The Crafts Council is committed to making the UK the best place to make, see and collect contemporary craft.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o272"><a name="90625-0019.htm_para6"><a name="09062552002946">Why did she refer to contemporary craft? It would be wrong to exclude the traditional crafts that organisations such as the Heritage Crafts Association seek to conserve. The craftspeople concerned include the sieve maker, the rake maker, the handmade cutlery maker and others. They do not necessarily make objects of beauty or of stunning magnificence, which seems to be the focus of the craft-based media, but functional, traditional objects that require just as much skill to make as well as requiring a true sense of heritage and basic human purpose. The arts media and crafts media seem fixated on the idea of arts and crafts, and on linking the two together. I want to make the distinction. I have nothing against arts&#151;not at all&#151;but they should not subsume the crafts in that definition.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o273"><a name="90625-0019.htm_para7"><a name="09062552002947">The Heritage Crafts Association was set up by, among others, my constituent Robin Wood, a pole-lathe bowl turner. The organisation believes that recognising the living heritage of skills offers great opportunities for education, community involvement and jobs and can even play a significant role in the tourism industry. However, what do the Craft Council and DCMS mean by the creative industries? Generally speaking, they mean the arts, the media and culture. They mean the conservation of buildings, artefacts and historical traditions. They even include&#151;I very much welcome this&#151;traditional skills related to the building trade, such as the production  <br>


<meta name="Date" content="25 Jun 2009">

of lime mortar, stone roofing, thatching and stone walling. The National Trust, English Heritage and the Heritage Lottery Fund have even created apprenticeships to ensure that those skills are retained so that their precious buildings can be conserved. I do not use the word &#147;precious&#148; pejoratively. They are precious buildings, and those skills need to be preserved to ensure that such buildings can be maintained in the best possible condition. However, it is the other crafts&#151;those that deal with useful tools that man has evolved over 1,000 years&#151;that I am interested in today.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o274"><a name="90625-0019.htm_para8"><a name="09062552002948">Outside the field of construction, support for such crafts is not what it could be, which is why people such as Mike Turnock cannot find the funding to take on an apprentice or someone to learn the trade and work with him long enough to take over his potentially flourishing business and expand it in the future, retaining his wonderful craftsmanship in our community.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o275"><a name="90625-0019.htm_para9"><a name="09062552002949">We all know someone called Smith, Turner, Potter, Fletcher, Barker, Cartwright or even Thatcher. Those were the names originally given to those people who founded the crafts heritage in this country. In 2006 the UNESCO convention stated:</p>
<a name="90625-0019.htm_brev4"><a name="09062552003065"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Any efforts to safeguard traditional craftsmanship must focus not on preserving craft objects&#151;no matter how beautiful, precious, rare or important they might be&#151;but on creating conditions that will encourage artisans to continue to produce crafts of all kinds, and to transmit their skills and knowledge to others, especially younger members of their communities.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o276"><a name="90625-0019.htm_para10"><a name="09062552002950">The goal of the UNESCO convention is to safeguard traditional craftsmanship by supporting the continuing transmission of knowledge and skills associated with traditional artisans, to ensure that crafts continue to be practised in their communities, providing livelihoods to their makers and reflecting creativity and adaptation. May I ask my hon. Friend the Minister why, when 107 countries from Albania and Algeria through to Zambia and Zimbabwe have seen fit to sign up to the convention, effectively making intangible cultural heritage part of their cultural policy, the UK is not one of those countries?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o277"><a name="90625-0019.htm_para11"><a name="09062552002951">I want to turn for a moment to the Heritage Lottery Fund. It recently announced that 10 projects would benefit from a &#163;7 million training bursary scheme. The projects involve archaeology, transport heritage, conservation volunteers, reed and sedge cutting and other schemes to help conserve things that are already there. It is very difficult to find examples of Government or lottery funding being used to create things from scratch or regenerate the skills that, like sieve making, are in danger of being lost.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o278"><a name="90625-0019.htm_para12"><a name="09062552002952">In High Peak, I have not only that last sieve maker but Robin Wood, who tells me that he is the last professional pole-lathe bowl turner in the country. Both crafts have been established for more than 1,000 years, but it is difficult to see how they will survive even one more generation. The Crafts Council has recognised this problem, and I have referred already to the blueprint that it produced with Creative and Cultural Skills, which was launched recently in the other place. In it, the council points out that many of the craftspeople involved in cottage industries are elderly and without successors to whom they can pass on their skills. In addition, many are sole traders, with little incentive to take on an apprentice without external funding.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o279"><a name="90625-0019.htm_para13"><a name="09062552002953">Many of these traditional skills are often referred to as &#147;rural&#148;, but in fact they are urban as well. An example of that is the scissor makers of Sheffield, to  <br>

whom I have referred and on whose behalf my right hon. Friend the Member for Sheffield, Central (Mr. Caborn) has campaigned.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o280"><a name="90625-0019.htm_para14"><a name="09062552002954">It seems that only once these crafts are dead do they come under the remit of the heritage industry, as their products find their ways into museum displays and people take pride in their conservation and celebrate their memory. Why can we not give the same attention to the ailing small industries that create these iconic objects? Are not the skills as worthy of conservation as the products that they create? We assess the relative importance of protecting, preserving and finding new life for older buildings that we see as part of our heritage: why should we not take a similar approach to heritage craft skills, and allocate a budget to do so?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o281"><a name="90625-0019.htm_para15"><a name="09062552002955">I know that the Department for Culture, Media and Sport has rightly welcomed the Government&#146;s announcement of the &#163;1.1 billion future jobs fund, and the positive impact it will have in the field. I know that, among other things, the fund will pay for 5,000 apprenticeships in the creative industries. I know that the wider creative industries are a huge source&#151;and potential future source&#151;of income for this country, as well as generators of employment. I also know that helping a single-person business to keep going from one generation to the next is not the sexiest part of the DCMS agenda, but it is vital.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o282"><a name="90625-0019.htm_para16"><a name="09062552002956">Making garden sieves is not going to bring this country out of recession, but it is a part of our tradition and it ought to have a future. I hope that my hon. Friend the Minister will tell us exactly how she will support the forgotten parts of the world of creative industries in the future.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o283"><a name="90625-0019.htm_para17"><a name="09062552002957">The responsibilities of DCMS include sport as well as culture, and I am sure that the Minister will not need to ask the Minister for sport, my hon. Friend the Member for Bradford, South (Mr. Sutcliffe), about where some of the nicknames that we give to our football clubs have come from. However, let me remind her of the Blades in Sheffield, the Cobblers in Northampton, the Saddlers in Walsall, the Hatters in Luton and the Silkmen just across the hills from me in Macclesfield.</p>

 First, may I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for High Peak (Tom Levitt) on securing this debate about one of Britain&#146;s lesser known but still extremely important craft skills? As some hon. Members may know, no serious gardener, anxious to keep his or her soil in good tilth, would be without a good quality riddle&#151;and, as my hon. Friend has made clear, should they be in need of one, his constituent Michael Turnock is just the man to supply it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o285"><a name="90625-0019.htm_para19"><a name="09062552002960">Mr. Turnock and his one-man riddle-making business in Whaley Bridge are well known locally for their high-quality products. His skills have also attracted national interest, and that makes it all the more sad and surprising that, so far, Mr. Turnock has failed to find anyone who  <br>

wants to take over his business, despite the efforts of Mr. Robin Wood, who has done a great deal to popularise crafts and to make everyone, including the Government, aware of their situation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o286"><a name="90625-0019.htm_para20"><a name="09062552002961">However, Mr. Turnock&#146;s story is, unfortunately, all too familiar. Mechanisation and new materials have taken over the labour-intensive and time-consuming processes required to make one particular type of tool by hand. In fact, estimates made in 2004 suggested that, along with Mr. Turnock&#146;s, only six businesses in England still make that sort of craft product&#151;three horse collar makers, two besom broom producers and one oak spale basket maker. I think that my hon. Friend mentioned another maker, and I shall get that product from him after the debate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o287"><a name="90625-0019.htm_para21"><a name="09062552002962">The picture is not much brighter even among better known crafts such as thatching, saddling or timber framing, where the number of people employed totals little more than 1,000. If as Mr. Turnock and others insist, craft products are in high demand, all that is missing are trainees or apprentices willing to take up placements in craft-based firms&#151;</p>

 My hon. Friend the Member for High Peak outlined some of the Government schemes to help single-person businesses, such as Mr. Turnock&#146;s, to attract and keep apprentices. For once&#151;unusually&#151;funding is not the problem. There is funding around, and there are a lot of courses; what we lack are people of any age who want to take up placements or apprenticeships in craft firms such as the one Mr. Turnock runs.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o290"><a name="90625-0019.htm_para24"><a name="09062552002966">There are obviously many reasons for that situation. Sometimes, it is down to young people not being able to see a clear career path. Sometimes, it is because a person does not want to be a sole trader, or part of a small business. Sometimes, it is because younger people want to experience the bright lights of the cities, and craft trades tend to be in rural areas. Sometimes, it is just because people do not know that the opportunities and jobs exist, which is one of the areas where the Government can help&#151;locally, regionally and centrally.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o291"><a name="90625-0019.htm_para25"><a name="09062552002967">Overall, not many craftspeople have the time, or even the finance, to advertise what they do and to attract apprentices. It is a Catch-22 situation. Both the Government and the sector are very aware of the problems. This month, Creative and Cultural Skills published a crafts blueprint, to accompany and amplify the cultural heritage blueprint, which is a work force development plan designed to improve participation in the traditional skills sector. The success of recent television shows such as &#147;Victorian Farm&#148;, as well as the 20-year waiting list for allotments in some areas, indicate real popular interest in sustainable traditional practices, which could lead to an appreciation of the time and care taken to produce quality hand-made items such as Mr. Turnock&#146;s riddles.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o292"><a name="90625-0019.htm_para26"><a name="09062552002968">The UK is blessed with an extraordinarily wide variety of traditions and crafts. Coupled with increasing awareness of the economic, social and environmental impact of  <br>

our current life styles on the health of our planet, there has been a resurgence of interest in traditional crafts and practice. We are seeing a revival of traditional crafts such as carpentry, knitting, crocheting, quilting and tatting, as well as an increase in the number of craft magazines and programmes. New technology makes some crafts easier and opens up a new and much wider market for quality hand-made products made by people such as Mr. Turnock.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o293"><a name="90625-0019.htm_para27"><a name="09062552002969">The Crafts Council supports Mr. Turnock&#146;s work, and the work of all the other people in the sector. The council organises events to showcase crafts. English Heritage helps to fund the very popular heritage open days and festivals of archaeology, which as well as opening up buildings to the public also promote traditional crafts and activities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o294"><a name="90625-0019.htm_para28"><a name="09062552002970">Crafts, as a skill, fall under several central Government Departments. The Department for Communities and Local Government is very keen on them because it believes that maintaining traditional skills in a community helps to define and shape local identity. It knows that a shortage of skilled people can hold up planning applications for historical buildings. The Commission for Architecture and the Built Environment published its &#147;Skills to grow&#148; report in partnership with 15 national bodies, including Lantra, which is the sector skills council for the land-based sector that focuses on horticultural green-space skills.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o295"><a name="90625-0019.htm_para29"><a name="09062552002971">The Department for Business, Innovation and Skills is responsible for sector skills councils such as CABE. It provides a great deal of support for small businesses that are involved in craft areas. The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, and its agencies, Natural England and the Forestry Commission, are supporting traditional skills through their rural development programme. My Department, through its non-departmental public bodies and the lottery, shares those common interests and backs the projects. For example, the Heritage Lottery Fund has awarded more than &#163;446 million to 1,300 projects that have delivered heritage skills training in not only blacksmithing, textiles and paper conservation, but traditional building skills, such as using lime mortar and dry-stone walling. Its &#163;7 million bursary programme for on-the-job training in 10 areas in which it has found evidence of a shortage of crafts has helped to train new masons, hedge layers and millwrights.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o296"><a name="90625-0019.htm_para30"><a name="09062552002972">My hon. Friend will be aware that English Heritage published the second &#147;Heritage at Risk&#148; report yesterday. Its finding confirmed the need for such skills locally and regionally. That is why English Heritage has been working with ConstructionSkills and the national heritage training  <br>

group to address some of the shortage in traditional building craft skills. It is also why it has just signed a memorandum of understanding with the all-party arts and heritage group on maintaining standards and best practice in the built heritage sector.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o297"><a name="90625-0019.htm_para31"><a name="09062552002973">I am glad that Arts Council England is also involved. It will spend more than &#163;6 million this year alone on organisations involved in contemporary or heritage crafts, including by giving funding of &#163;2.8 million to the Crafts Council to lead on contemporary crafts.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o298"><a name="90625-0019.htm_para32"><a name="09062552002974">My hon. Friend talked about an international convention on crafts. I believe that he was referring to the 2003 convention for the safeguarding of the intangible cultural heritage. The Government have no plans to ratify the convention, but we are supportive of its aims and spirit. We are keen that the rich intangible cultural heritage of the United Kingdom is properly valued and, when necessary, preserved. However, we are wary of legislating on such a sensitive matter as culture, especially in an area such as intangible heritage which, by its very nature, is difficult to define. Ratifying the convention and setting out strict definitions of what our intangible cultural heritage is, and might be, could be constricting and controversial. For example, there are issues surrounding languages and dialects in the devolved Administrations and in Cornwall.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o299"><a name="90625-0019.htm_para33"><a name="09062552002975">Whether tangible or intangible, however, our heritage is a marvellous asset that we want to protect and nurture. As a Regional Minister, I see a role for the regional development agencies and local authorities. They need to play their part, along with central Government and non-departmental bodies, in ensuring that our traditional skills are upheld and preserved.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o300"><a name="90625-0019.htm_para34"><a name="09062552002976">We do not want to preserve things for their own sake; we want to preserve them because of what they add to our country and to what it has to offer. As Minister with responsibility for tourism, I know how much that offer is worth to our economy every year. I also know how important it is to get people involved. My hon. Friend may or may not have heard of the recent phenomenon of yarn bombing: think Banksy meets the women&#146;s institute. It is guerrilla knitting in the public realm. Its legality is still uncertain, but its creativity is not. It is a wonderful example of a centuries-old tradition being made relevant for today. I hope that we can offer an opportunity to uphold the heritage that men like Mr. Turnock have preserved for us, and can make that heritage relevant and accessible to everybody.</p>
