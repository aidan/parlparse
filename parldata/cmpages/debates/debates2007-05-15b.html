there is no meaningful public transport at all. He was talking about buses, but clearly there are other forms of public transport, such as taxis and minicabs, that might well be used in areas where the demand is limited, but where the interest in services is great, particularly among elderly people who do not have their own transport.

 I am not sure that I agree with the hon. Gentleman&#146;s characterisation of the reduction of the revenue support grant. It is of course for individual local authorities to determine the level of concession that they offer their residents. He makes a fair point in recognising that in the longer term and in the future, there may well be opportunities, for example through smart ticketing that allows cash to be credited, to consider providing pensioners with facilities that would make a more flexible range of services available, whether that is through dial-a-bus, community travel or taxis. However, those are discussions for the future, as well as for today.</p>

regret that comment. I join him in recognising capacity as a serious challenge. That is why I announced in March, when we published the high level output specification, that we will specify 1,000 extra carriages for the rail network. However, that is without prejudice to the continuing work that we need to take forward on, for example, considering platform lengthening or the possibility of double-decker trains. The number of trains that we can run on the existing network is limited, but I assure the House that we are seriously considering all options to make full use of that network.</p>

Many people consider the needs of elderly residents, and the partial service means that elderly residents cannot go out at night, but I was told of the case of a young lad of 15 who used to go to a theatre group and get the bus back late at night, but now cannot go.

 Improved bus services benefit all ages in the community. It is right to recognise that in my hon. Friend&#146;s community, in mine and in the communities of many Members, bus services are a vital lifeline. That is why, all too often, following the arbitrary withdrawal of services on which people rely, there is understandable concern and anger in those communities. That is one of the reasons why, last summer, we took a long hard look at bus provision in the United Kingdom, why we published &#147;Putting Passengers First&#148;, and why we are determined to drive forward better arrangements to assure effective partnership between local authorities and the bus operators.</p>

 The fares at off-peak times, to which the hon. Gentleman refers, are not regulated fares. Although I understand that there was real concern and public interest in the fares that were announced, it is important to emphasise that those are not fares set by Government. The regulated fares, which are set by Government, in addition to the advance purchase discount fares, account for about 70 per cent. of the journeys made on Britain&#146;s railways. Beyond those regulated fares and advance purchase fares, there must be a degree of flexibility for train companies to set prices against other modes of available transport, but I would urge all train companies to act responsibly when considering the setting of unregulated fares.</p>

The Department for Transport is determined to ensure that First Great Western meets the franchise commitments to which it has signed up.

I am confident that, working together with Network Rail, a better service will be received by customers in future.</p>

 Despite a large increase in passenger journeys from Wolverton train station, its passenger facilities have not improved.

Unfortunately, since then, that package has been reduced to just &#163;400,000. Will the Minister explain why that reduction has occurred?

 No, that is not the case at all.

That requirement, established by the Legal Services Commission, has been in place for more than a year and the sector has responded very well; indeed, many such organisations have achieved productivity increases of 19 to 20 per cent. We expect that to continue and  for better service to be given. The hon.

Gentleman&#146;s Constitutional Affairs Committee received a letter from the Lord Chancellor indicating that, in the absence of cartelling or any improper conduct, the market would indeed dictate prices. In the meantime, I have been very cheered by the number of solicitors who have taken on more employees, compared with the number who have let them go. In the criminal sector, which I can speak of most, that is indicative of people gearing up for the opportunities that these changes present.</p>

 Yes, the LSC will indeed monitor the process as it develops and is starting to model a process to ensure that it is practical to monitor it. The way in which the competitive tendering will be rolled out is not yet agreed, but it is likely to be on something of a phased basis, perhaps regionally, which will enable us to monitor it properly. We are aware of the problems of the second round, but we have some proposals&#151;not yet totally cleared and fixed&#151;that should ensure that firms can grow in the first round into the position of being able to bid for the second round.

 The Government give funding to organisations that support the families of homicide victims, including Victim Support and Support After Murder and Manslaughter, and victims can apply for compensation through the criminal injuries compensation scheme.

 I would like the Government to consider broadening the range of help that they give to victims of homicide. I have a constituent whose husband was killed by a neighbour and she and their children have been intimidated by members of the killer&#146;s family since he was sent to prison. She is a council tenant and she has applied to move either within York or back to Scotland where her family live. Does the Minister think that public housing authorities should make housing transfers a priority in such cases and will she tell me what power the Parole Board has to prevent the killer from returning to the neighbourhood when he is released from prison?</p>

 My hon. Friend raises an important point. It is not just for the courts, police and criminal justice system to work to support the victims of crime. All the public authorities should identify what help they can give to people who suffer as the result of a crime, including the housing authorities. The local criminal justice board has the opportunity to work with the local authority in my hon. Friend&#146;s area to see what can be done to help that family. If other victims see that those who have been the victims of crime have not been treated properly by the system, they will give up hope. I will ask the local criminal justice board what help they can give.</p>

 I pay tribute to the Witness Service for the help that it provides to victims in homicide cases, and to the exceptional job done by police family liaison officers. They are very highly trained, and support the families while also helping the criminal justice system. Once again, I point to the pioneering work going on in five Crown courts. Families used to be confined to sitting in the public gallery while everyone else spoke about the person killed and focused on the defendant. The pilot means that for the first time families have a chance, after conviction but before sentence, to say what the loss of the person killed means to them.</p>

As far as I am aware, there has not been a single allegation of irregularity.

Last year, United Kingdom acts accounted for 62 per cent. of the top 100 artist album sales. Four of the top five albums of the year were by UK artists: Snow Patrol, Take That, the Kooks and the Arctic Monkeys&#151;I believe that the Chancellor of the Exchequer is a fan, but that has not yet affected sales.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o12"><a name="70515-0004.htm_para3"><a name="07051555000198">The British market has always been receptive to new music from overseas, with Scissor Sisters, the Killers and the White Stripes all providing examples of successful acts that first broke in the UK. Musically, Britain never ceases to evolve. New talent proves increasingly popular with music buyers. Record companies in the UK recognise the huge importance of new talent in maintaining Britain&#146;s formidable reputation for producing the most successful artists.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o13"><a name="70515-0004.htm_para4"><a name="07051555000199">Britain&#146;s wider music industry employs more than 125,000 people in the UK, and the record industry is responsible for most of the UK&#146;s investment in new artists, which in 2004 amounted to 17 per cent. of their turnover, or &#163;207 million. It is thus of great concern that illegal peer-to-peer file sharing has already had an enormous effect on British music sales; an estimated &#163;1.1 billion of revenue was lost in the last three years as a result of that activity. On top of that, the music industry has to deal with the other face of online copyright theft&#151;commercial piracy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o14"><a name="70515-0004.htm_para5"><a name="07051555000200">It is of course not only the music industry that is threatened by that criminal activity. The film, television and games industries also suffer from illegal downloading&#151;something I have never knowingly done.</p>

The Bill will be crucial to protecting and nurturing the future talent of the British creative industries. In December 2005, the Chancellor of the Exchequer asked Andrew Gowers to conduct an independent review of the UK intellectual property framework. The review was published in December 2006, and my Bill takes heed of a number of its recommendations.</p>

In particular, the digitisation of information and the ability to store it electronically has made it far easier to copy and distribute. The problem posed by online copyright theft is twofold. First, there is peer-to-peer file sharing, which is generally carried out by individuals, many of whom are young, in their own homes. As the Gowers report stated:</p>

that is readily available; almost every home computer can produce perfect copies of CDs via the internet and file-sharing networks that distribute music to millions of people.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o18"><a name="70515-0004.htm_para9"><a name="07051555000204">The second aspect of criminal activity is commercial piracy, whereby music is unlawfully downloaded and then copied for sale. Online copyright theft is seen by criminals as a low-risk, high-profit criminal activity. The crime has proven links to other criminal activities such as youth exploitation, drugs, obscene pornography and people smuggling.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o19"><a name="70515-0004.htm_para10"><a name="07051555000205">As well as that large-scale crime in the digital world, in the physical world counterfeit CDs are bought from personal contacts&#151;friends, neighbours or work colleagues. Market stalls, street vendors and car boot sales are other popular distribution channels, all of which are notoriously hard to police. It is thought that people download music or buy counterfeit CDs because they are cheaper than official releases and are thought of as an effective way to sample music.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o20"><a name="70515-0004.htm_para11"><a name="07051555000206">In 2003, as part of the implementation of the information society directive, certain types of online copyright infringement were criminalised. The maximum sentence for committing the offence is two years&#146; imprisonment, which contrasts with infringements in the context of physical copyright theft, where the maximum penalty is 10 years&#146; imprisonment. Most people agree that it is a crime to help oneself to the property of another without payment or permission, and accessing illegal content online must be viewed in the same way.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o21"><a name="70515-0004.htm_para12"><a name="07051555000207">The legislation that we have at the moment accurately denotes the seriousness of the offence, but it makes no provision for the monitoring of the crime or for enforcement&#151;something that they do somewhat better in Italy and Germany. There are currently no structures through which the Government monitor or enforce the law on online copyright theft, despite its being an offence that costs the industry vast amounts of money. In the absence of any publicly funded enforcement, the music industry has taken the lead role in attempting to quantify and tackle the issue. The Bill makes provision for the establishment of a national organisation that will monitor and enforce copyright law as related industries are currently doing for themselves.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o22"><a name="70515-0004.htm_para13"><a name="07051555000208">I have been in touch with a number of institutions that have been working hard independently of the Government to protect the artists they represent. The Bill makes provision for the Government to take responsibility for the monitoring and enforcing of copyright laws, and to carry on the good work that those groups have done up until now. The groups include the film industry&#146;s Federation Against Copyright Theft and the games industry&#146;s Entertainment and Leisure Software  <br>

Publishers Association, which spearheads investigations of criminal activity on behalf of member companies. As for raising public awareness, the British Phonographic Industry has sent hundreds of thousands of instant messages to people who are illegally uploading files in the UK to make it clear that they are breaking the law. Some 70 per cent. of consumers know that unauthorised file sharing is illegal, but the extent to which this awareness translates into a deterrent is unclear.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o23"><a name="70515-0004.htm_para14"><a name="07051555000209">Having considered the good example that those organisations set, I am calling for a national online piracy investigation and enforcement unit, specifically to monitor and enforce online copyright theft. The unit would be sufficiently resourced to allow a truly national remit. It would regularly research and monitor the scale, nature and impact of online piracy. It would be equipped to carry out investigations into piracy and would have full investigative powers. It would be empowered to bring prosecutions against online piracy. The unit would work seamlessly with existing Government agencies that work in related areas, such as local authority trading standards officers, and with the Serious Organised Crime Agency. It would work seamlessly with industry anti-piracy units to complement and bolster their efforts. Lastly, I understand that internet service providers are privy to much information that could be used to tackle the crime. I suggest that one of the key priorities of the new organisation should be to build links with internet service providers to ensure that, where necessary, information that they have access to can be used in building investigations.</p>

Moreover, I look forward to reading the findings of the Culture, Media and Sport Committee on copyright theft when its report on the subject is published tomorrow.

However, we have chosen for today&#146;s debate a subject on which there is gathering consensus in British politics: the need for accepted procedures for giving parliamentary approval for our country&#146;s participation in armed conflict.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o29"><a name="70515-0004.htm_para20"><a name="07051555000217">For years, many hon. Members have given voice to their concerns about the existing arrangements and the need for change. The hon. Member for Walthamstow (Mr. Gerrard), who is in the Chamber, and the right hon. Member for Birmingham, Ladywood (Clare Short) both introduced private Members&#146; Bills on exactly this theme that enjoyed a good deal of cross-party support. Indeed, the Bill introduced by the right hon. Member for Birmingham, Ladywood was sponsored by Labour and Liberal Democrat Members, as well as by my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Rushcliffe (Mr. Clarke) and me, before I rejoined the Opposition Front-Bench team. The right hon. Member for Oldham, West and Royton (Mr. Meacher) also has a Bill on the subject before the House; I know that the Leader of the House will be pleased that the right hon. Gentleman now has quite a lot of time to pursue that Bill.</p>

It is clear from the Government&#146;s amendment that their position is now markedly different from that of only two weeks ago. In a debate in the House of Lords on 1 May&#151;two weeks ago today&#151;the Lord Chancellor said:</p>

The looks on the faces of Government Front Benchers suggest that his views have been ignored.</p>

It is important to stress that both our motion and the Government amendment call on the Government to produce proposals after consultation&#151;consultation with Opposition parties, I hope&#151;and it is very difficult to lay down rules that cover every eventuality.

 Again, the conclusion that we come to on such matters must be the result of consultation between the parties. Indeed, there should be consultation outside Parliament, too. My view is that it would be impossible to lay down hard and fast rules that would cover every eventuality. I think that there ought to be a parliamentary debate and a vote before a major deployment of forces overseas, because, of course, there could easily be mission creep that took us from a deployment to actual fighting. As for a bombing campaign, we would have to distinguish between different circumstances. In the case of Kosovo, the international pressure and the build-up of forces were well flagged up before military action took place. In that case it would have been possible to hold a parliamentary debate and a vote. Of course, in a case where bombing is to be carried out as a surprise, it would not be wise to conduct a parliamentary debate beforehand.</p>

The favoured option of the House of Lords Constitution Committee, which was not a bad one, was when time allowed to have a debate in the upper House which would help to inform the debate in this House, but there would be no binding vote on the Government in the House of Lords. In that way, the nation could benefit both from the expertise of the upper House and the democratic legitimacy of the lower House in an appropriate sequence. However, there would be other ways of dealing with the matter.</p>

If we have an upper House that is largely elected, and where no one party has a majority, it might be important to respect that House by having both Houses of Parliament involved in giving approval to the deployment of troops, thereby making Parliament even more effective in its control of these matters.</p>

determined the role that Parliament should play in the deployment of armed forces overseas. It recommended that the Government should seek parliamentary approval if they propose the deployment of British forces outside the United Kingdom into actual or potential armed conflict, and that they should indicate their objectives, the legal basis and the likely duration and size of the operation. It recommended that, if for reasons of emergency and security, prior discussion were impossible, the Government should provide retrospective information in seven days&#151;or as soon as is feasible&#151;and seek approval at that time.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o51"><a name="70515-0005.htm_para20"><a name="07051555000262">It is not difficult to understand why so many informed and authoritative commentators and Committees of both Houses have concluded that matters need to be changed. In the past 10 years, the UK&#146;s armed forces have been deployed in five major military operations overseas&#151;in Bosnia, Kosovo, Sierra Leone, Afghanistan and Iraq&#151;and in each case the procedure for parliamentary involvement has differed. The House had a fiercely contested debate and vote about the Iraq war. The Leader of the House subsequently acknowledged that that set an important precedent for the future. On Kosovo, about which there was widespread, cross-party agreement, the debate was held on the Adjournment of the House. We have had many Government statements on Afghanistan, but there has never been an opportunity for a parliamentary vote, despite the fact that it is now the most substantial overseas commitment of the British armed forces, and is likely to remain so for some time.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o52"><a name="70515-0005.htm_para21"><a name="07051555000263">I draw attention to the variety of procedures not to criticise the current Government but to show that those of us who believe that the accountability of Ministers to Parliament is important to our democracy cannot sit back and think that current procedures are adequate. The number of overseas deployments in recent years has highlighted the problem, as has the controversial nature of at least one, but it is also true that the procedure has similarly varied in previous decades. There was a substantive vote at a late stage on the commitment of troops in the Korean war and the first Gulf war. On the other hand, the debate on the Falklands war took place on the Adjournment of the House. No substantive vote took place on the deployment of forces at Suez.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o53"><a name="70515-0005.htm_para22"><a name="07051555000264">The arguments for ending the extraordinary variety of procedures, which generally results in the adoption of the one that is least inconvenient to the Government of the day, are strong. There is the case for strengthening Parliament vis- -vis the Executive across the board. Whether or not the Government in this country have the characteristics of an elective dictatorship, there is widespread concern that the power of Parliament to influence Government decisions has become weaker over the years and that the trend needs to be reversed.</p>

 May I raise an additional factor: the importance of good intelligence? My right hon.

In that vein, does he agree that parliamentary approval is of secondary importance to good intelligence, because one could easily paint a scenario where, if the intelligence were bad, we would repeat the same mistake that we made in Iraq, irrespective of parliamentary approval to go to war?</p>

He said that it would not, in his conception, be necessary to have a parliamentary vote where we were taking military action under treaty obligations. Earlier on, he said that one example of where, in his conception, a parliamentary vote would have been required was Afghanistan. Surely we took military action there as a result of an attack on an ally, which triggered article 5 of the Washington treaty. Does he believe, on reflection, that that was or was not a case requiring a parliamentary vote under his proposals?</p>

 It would entirely depend on the speed of the action taken. My point was that where, according to the judgment of the Government of the day, immediate action were required under treaty obligations, they must be able to take it, but they should subsequently come back to Parliament for retrospective information and retrospective approval. Where those treaty obligations lead to a build-up of forces and a plan for a campaign&#151;in the case of Afghanistan, one could argue that there have been three separate stages of deployment over the past six years&#151;there is, of course, a case for prior approval of some deployments.

Excellent quality papers were written by officials, but these were not discussed in Cabinet or in Cabinet Committee. Without papers circulated in advance, it remains possible but is obviously much more difficult for members of the Cabinet outside the small circle directly involved to bring their political judgement and experience to bear on major decisions for which the Cabinet as a whole must carry responsibility. The absence of papers on the Cabinet agenda so that Ministers could obtain briefings in advance from the Cabinet Office, their own departments or from the intelligence agencies plainly reduced their ability to prepare properly for such discussions, while the changes to key posts at the head of the Cabinet Secretariat lessened the support of the machinery of government for the collective responsibility of the Cabinet in the vital matter of war and peace.&#148;</p>

The acceptance of our motion tonight would supply them with the necessary support and authority, and with a requirement to do so. They seem to be on the verge of making a commitment to doing so, and the Leader of the House should be in doubt that we would hold them to it.</p>

Indeed, there has not been a significant armed conflict overseas since the beginning of the 20th century in which the United Kingdom has been involved where, in one way or another, at the time of decision or in retrospect, this House has not indicated whether, and in what way, it has consented to the Executive decision taken.</p>

That, in turn, has meant that Parliament&#146;s role, though substantial, is imprecise and less than well defined.</p>

The first, from the Public Administration Committee, from the 2003-04 Session, is entitled, &#147;Taming the Prerogative&#148;. The second, from the Lords&#146; Constitution Committee, from the previous Session, is entitled, &#147;Waging War: Parliament&#146;s Role and Responsibility&#148;.

There is no question but that Ministers at that time recognised the need to gain&#151;in one way or another&#151;the consent of Parliament. Indeed, Parliament was called to a special sitting on a Saturday. However, the debate was short&#151;it was three hours long&#151;and on the Adjournment, and those that followed were also on the Adjournment. I thought at the time that the Commons should have been able to express whether it consented in a tangible way&#151;by vote. I thought that as a supporter&#151;not an opponent&#151;of military action against Argentina, because I considered that to be the proper role of the Commons. To echo a point made by Lord Bramall in the other place, I also thought that because I believed that our troops, some of whom came back maimed and others of whom never came back at all, deserved to know the level of support that was behind them from the people&#146;s representatives in this Chamber.</p>

Were this new procedure in place, in each case there should have been a debate on a substantive motion, usually in advance&#151;although perhaps, for special reasons, in the case of the Gulf war in retrospect, and an issue might also have been raised in respect of Afghanistan in 2001 to do with our treaty obligations.

 The point that gives me difficulty is the use of the word &#147;substantial&#148;. In our current experience, wars do not start with the massing of forces on borders. Instead, they evolve in dribbles. When do we decide that parliamentary permission is needed for a substantial deployment? Does &#147;substantial&#148; refer to firepower or to manpower?</p>

 I know that the hon. Gentleman has military experience and I say to him that this is a difficult issue. The motion sets out, as I have, the important caveats to taking a decision in advance of a deployment. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman has read the Constitution Committee&#146;s report, but if he refreshes his memory on it, he will see the interesting discussion of various conflicts in which we have been involved in which, in the main, we have had the opportunity to consider the matter in advance. Sometimes that has not been the case, but it is significant that it has been the case quite frequently. If we go back through the last 100 years, we see that there has been a build up to every military action that I can think of, and it has been the British Government&#146;s decision&#151;to which Parliament consented in one way or another&#151;that has led to the war. I include the second world war, which, yes, turned out to be an existential war involving this country, but the declaration of war was made by us against Hitler, not by Hitler against us. </p>

 Does my right hon. Friend agree that although it is likely to increase troop morale if there is solid parliamentary support in advance or at the beginning of an action, it is likely to risk troop morale if the issue is gratuitously reviewed during an action? The suggestions made earlier that the House should regularly return to the issue are therefore perhaps misplaced.</p>

 My hon. Friend makes an important point. The House should return to the issue in the sense that regular statements should be made and perhaps debates held, but I can think of nothing more damaging to forces&#146; morale&#151;and many of us have family members in the armed forces&#151;or that would create greater uncertainty and possibly put troops at risk than constant reviewing and the risk that the House would effectively make operational decisions in place of those in command.</p>

 The Leader of the House might recall that in March 2004 we had a lengthy debate, which I opened, on the disclosure of the Attorney-General&#146;s opinion. The hon. Member for Broxtowe (Dr. Palmer) mentioned troop morale. A major factor in troop morale is knowing that the actions that they take are lawful in international and domestic law. In that regard, will there be a change of emphasis from the Government? In other words, will there be a presumption in favour of disclosure where possible, rather than a presumption against?</p>

 For very good reasons, neither I nor my noble Friend the Attorney-General favours having the advice offered to the Prime Minister and the Cabinet by Attorneys-General and Law Officers disclosed publicly, whether to this place or in any other way. In evidence to the Lords, my noble Friend drew a distinction between disclosing the advice and disclosing what amount to his conclusions in respect of that advice&#151;whether, in other words, the conflict was lawful.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o99"><a name="70515-0007.htm_para15"><a name="07051555000345">That was the practice that the Attorney-General adopted in respect of the Iraq war. He answered a parliamentary question in the other place, which I repeated here, and published a briefing document setting out why he believed&#151;and it was his decision, not the Cabinet&#146;s&#151;that the war was lawful. Of course Parliament should be informed about matters such as that, but the arguments against making the legal advice available, as opposed to the conclusions stemming from it, are overwhelming. I hope that the question is not pushed further.</p>

He was, however, concerned, that a comprehensive War Powers Act on the American model would find itself &#145;overtaken by events&#146; because &#145;an international situation will arise in the next 20 years that is entirely different from anything we have ever experienced&#151;and we would find such an act did not cater for it&#148;.</p>

The Committee said that a statutory requirement could create confusion about the legal status of our armed forces, and added that any challenges to the legality of a deployment could have a negative impact on the morale of the forces involved.

 Indeed. It seems as though the recommendations of the Modernisation Committee are moving in that direction. We are certainly proposing to change the title &#147;Adjournment debate&#148;; it is ludicrous and outdated and even in the House no one can understand why we move to go home and then spend six hours discussing not whether we are going home but issues of major importance. The Government have tried to make better use of substantive motions for subject debates as well as for debates on specific issues. Of course, judgments have to be made; for example sometimes&#151;as I have done myself&#151;in foreign policy areas it is better for there to be open debate without a specific resolution, as sometimes there may be, too, in respect of reviewing the progress of military action.

The Constitution Committee has provided a helpful starting point, setting out the core characteristics that might define such a process: principally, that Government should seek parliamentary approval in respect of any decisions on the major or substantial deployment of British forces outside the UK, that they should indicate the basic objectives and nature of any such deployment, and that they should keep Parliament informed of progress. We will make more detailed proposals, as I said.

Few will forget the dossiers of dubious distinction, the discredited manner in which the legal advice was obtained and then disclosed, or the flouting of international law.

There is an ever more urgent need for consideration in terms of the withdrawal of our armed forces. We will return to those issues on other occasions&#151;or at least we hope that we will, although opportunities to debate, in Government time, what has happened in Iraq since the conflict began have been almost non-existent. If Parliament&#146;s role is to become more explicit, it cannot be involved only at the outset of military action; it must have an appropriate role in considering what follows. We welcome the Government&#146;s intention to consult and to bring more detailed proposals before Parliament, but we must hope that Ministers intend all those issues to be taken into account.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o120"><a name="70515-0008.htm_para14"><a name="07051555000383">Whatever lies behind the changed or changing positions of Members on both sides of the House, we appear to be reaching a defining moment in Parliament, in which we assert our position and take on more responsibility for some of the most difficult decisions that a country ever faces, and not before time. In this fiercely uncertain world, the United Kingdom retains a key role in seeking to establish peace and in maintaining order. As previous contributors have mentioned, Britain has more than demonstrated that in the past decade in Kosovo, Sierra Leone and Afghanistan, never mind in countless smaller-scale expeditions. Time and again, our armed forces have demonstrated their bravery, commitment and professionalism.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o121"><a name="70515-0008.htm_para15"><a name="07051555000384">In Parliament, there have been Adjournment debates, statements and questions aplenty, but, with the exception of Iraq, there have been no votes. That surely has to change. Let us be clear about one thing: the principle of parliamentary approval for the deployment of our armed forces into conflict will not make things easy. Every one of us in the Chamber will be faced with a major responsibility that will never be comfortable. However, given what we ask of our young men and women on the front line, the least that they should expect of us is that we give serious consideration to the matters of life and death that they face. That is also what people across the country now expect. A million people took to the streets in anger and frustration to express their opinions on Iraq. The 21st century media allow people to absorb news from countless sources and to take part in debates online or in the studios, and they find it hard to believe that although the issues and the nature of the debates have moved on, our procedures in Parliament have not.</p>

Does the hon.

That would put our armed forces in a very difficult situation and would be intolerable.

The rag-bag of statutes, powers and conventions that make up what passes for a British constitution gives plenty of scope for unaccountable Executive authority. The very notion of the royal prerogatives, dating from the mists of time, creates an air of mystery, but beneath the colourful, confusing veneer, many of those prerogatives have morphed into modern-day instruments of raw Executive power. Many outside this place find it staggering that the Prime Minister alone can take the decision to enter into armed conflict. The Cabinet&#146;s role is not formalised, never mind Parliament&#146;s. Although politically it would be hard to ignore a vote in the Chamber that had gone against the Government, there is no explicit constitutional bar on the Prime Minister of the day doing just that.

Certainly, we have learned more than enough for Parliament to demand more.</p>

We will also need proper and appropriate detail on the geographical extent, the expected duration and the relevant elements of the armed forces that will be involved. Appropriate detail is an important element. Operational security and the safety of our armed forces must not be jeopardised, so the Prime Minister must have sufficient discretion to determine the amount of detail put in the public domain. Even with this important qualification, the provisions of the Bill would allow a significant advance in the level of parliamentary scrutiny.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o129"><a name="70515-0009.htm_para2"><a name="07051555000394">We must look at how that scrutiny is maintained appropriately once the conflict has begun, and later when it has finished.

<p><a name="stpa_o133"><a name="70515-0009.htm_para6"><a name="07051555000399">It is surely one of the most astonishing comments on our so-called&#151;I say that deliberately&#151;British democracy that in this country the decision to go to war, which, as all Members have said, is the gravest decision ever facing a nation, is still taken by one person alone, the Prime Minister, and there is no requirement to seek parliamentary approval. I acknowledge that the Government&#146;s amendment states&#151;I hope that this is correct&#151;that it is &#147;inconceivable&#148; that there would not be a parliamentary vote, in accordance with what happened in 2002 and 2003, in committing this country to war. However, even if that were true&#151;and the fact is that there have been several occasions when it was not&#151;it is, in my view, not sufficient in a parliamentary democracy, on an issue of such gravity, to rely on such assumptions. We do not, of course, have a written constitution&#151;I do not expect that to change at all quickly&#151;but this is a matter that must be clarified explicitly, beyond any conceivable doubt.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o134"><a name="70515-0009.htm_para7"><a name="07051555000400">That is all the more so given that, as I was amazed to find in my preparations for this debate, even where the Prime Minister of the day does allow a parliamentary vote, and that vote is opposed to war, the Prime Minister still has the absolute power to ignore the result of that vote and to commit the nation to war. That applies both where the vote is taken after the declaration of war, as in the case of the Attlee Government over the Korean war and the Major Government over the 1991 Gulf war, and where the vote is taken shortly before the start of war, as was the case with the Blair Government over Iraq.</p>

 I understand that point. In practice, that may well be the case. It is extremely difficult to envisage a Prime Minister losing a vote on a matter of such weight and still proceeding. However, my point is that it is simply unacceptable, however unlikely it might be, that the constitutional position remains that he or she would be entitled to take that course. If Parliament has any sense of its own dominance in the final decision, that is not a situation that we can allow to continue.</p>

That was the case when Britain went to war in the Balkans in the 1990s. There was lengthy fighting in Bosnia and in Kosovo for which there had been no parliamentary approval. It is also true that even where a vote is called, it can be arranged, as I am sure that all Members remember extremely well, at the last minute when British troops are fully deployed, just before the outbreak of hostilities, as of course happened on   <br>

18 March 2003. It is then extraordinarily difficult for Parliament to abort a build-up to war. Frankly, a pistol is being held to Parliament&#146;s head. In effect, Parliament would humiliate the Prime Minister as well as calling a halt to a process, which, by that stage, is almost unstoppable.

Irrespective of the rights or wrongs of particular wars, the decision to go to war is so paramount to the life of the nation that it should be made only by an elected Parliament on a substantive vote, well before events have moved to such a point that Parliament has little or no alternative to ratifying a decision that has already been reached.</p>

previous checks and balances have been eroded and some of the pre-existing autocratic powers in the hands of successive Prime Ministers, derived from the monarchs of previous ages under a totally different system of governance, have been consolidated further. The right to take a country to war, irrespective of parliamentary or public opinion&#151;that is the actual position, however unlikely it may seem&#151;is the clearest example of that.</p>

It would, of course, be very much better if the Government legislated, which is what is needed, so it is essential that, in the light of this debate, the Government now bring forward their proposals to implement that commitment.</p>

In the case of Iraq, that would mean that the Attorney-General&#146;s full advice on the legality of the war&#151;the 17-page version, not just the one page&#151;would be made available, as would the evidence on the existence and threat of weapons of mass destruction, insofar as it was available to the intelligence services, and the proper reporting of what turned out to be crucial in that case, which is the key French position on the possible use of the veto in the Security Council.</p>

We should not in any event seek to prevent that, but in such circumstances&#151;they would, I think, be rare&#151;the Bill requires that the Prime Minister must still lay a report before Parliament within seven days of the commencement of troop deployment. I believe that that is a reasonable compromise.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o145"><a name="70515-0009.htm_para18"><a name="07051555000417">Those demands are not out of step. There is nothing remarkable about any of the proposals, and it is not as though we would be making any great democratic advance by adopting them. Rather, we would be catching up with what other countries already do. In the United States, for example, the War Powers Resolution of 1973 states that if the approval of Congress for waging war is not secured within 60 days, the President must withdraw US forces within a further 30 days.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o146"><a name="70515-0009.htm_para19"><a name="07051555000418">The proposals that we are discussing today represent a crucial change whose implementation is long overdue. As we now know from the leaking of the Downing street memo, the Prime Minister apparently committed the UK to war in Iraq in secret in April 2002 by giving his word to President Bush at his ranch in Texas. The fact that, under the present arrangements, he could legitimately argue that he was entitled to do so&#151;I believe that that is the case&#151;is precisely why those arrangements need to be reformed. I submit that it is now our duty in this House to put in place proposals to ensure that that kind of personalised, secretive and undemocratic decision making, reminiscent of a long bygone age and totally unsuitable for a modern constitutional democracy, is brought to an end, and that Parliament takes the role that we all know the nation and the electorate clearly demand.</p>

Friend the Member for Richmond, Yorks (Mr. Hague) had provided the opportunity for a significant constitutional change. We are not debating a small matter here.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o147"><a name="70515-0009.htm_para20"><a name="07051566000002">Suddenly, resistance has crumbled to the important assertion of the role of Parliament in a modern democracy, and to the way in which we will establish legitimacy for going to war in future. This is therefore an important occasion. So far, the debate has attracted only what I would call the true believers, and only a few weeks ago they would have found themselves in a small minority. The Leader of the House was able to find a 1994 book, in which he put forward admirable sentiments&#151;which, alas, were not adopted by the Government in which he has served for 10 years. Everyone else who has spoken has form on this issue, including through supporting private Members&#146; Bills seeking to make this change, which have been flatly opposed by the Government.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o148"><a name="70515-0009.htm_para21"><a name="07051566000003">It is important that we true believers not only rejoice on seeing the sinners coming to repentance, but take advantage of the occasion to give an indication of what we want to come out of this. The Government&#146;s amendment to the motion is expressed in broad generalities, but we must ensure that the process is changed, so that in some highly controversial future situation of which none of us can yet be aware, some future Government do not try to rely on the wrong bits of the proposals or slip back from where we appear to be going.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o149"><a name="70515-0009.htm_para22"><a name="07051566000004">This change seems to be one of the few beneficial outcomes of the recent Iraq war. We are not, of course, debating the merits of the war today, but it is the controversy surrounding it that has led to this change. It has revealed how weak our constitutional arrangements for going to war have been, and the dissatisfaction with that process has produced this significant shift in position. The decision to take part in the invasion of Iraq was based on the Prime Minister&#146;s power to advise on the exercise of the royal prerogative, and it is long overdue that we should assert, in contradiction to that, that the Prime Minister and the Government derive their power from Parliament, not from the monarch, and that the arrangements resulting from the Glorious Revolution of 1688 are totally unacceptable to Parliament in 2007. I very much hope that the Lord Chancellor&#146;s defence of the 1688 Glorious Revolution and the royal prerogative on this subject, made only two weeks ago, will be the last defence of that arrangement heard in British politics from any sensible source.</p>

 I am not sure that the right hon. and learned Gentleman is entirely correct to say that the Iraq war is a good example of the royal prerogative being inappropriately used. Does not he agree that the Prime Minister&#146;s decision to have a vote on the conflict changed the landscape here, and that we are now seeking to institutionalise such a vote as the norm? Does not he also accept that the controversy that has continued to surround that conflict shows that a parliamentary vote is not the only way of resolving such difficult issues, and that we need to consider the whole question of war making as a process?</p>

Government, and particularly to Robin Cook, who, according to the account that we heard from the Leader of the House earlier, persuaded his colleagues that it was not possible to carry on resisting the demand for a substantive motion in the House of Commons. That changed things to a certain extent. I understand why the Leader of the House should have tabled a motion, and should make a speech today, pointing out that that is a precedent on which we will never go back; it is skilful advocacy to take credit for that now, and to claim that that is the basis on which the change is being made.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o150"><a name="70515-0009.htm_para23"><a name="07051566000007">I urge caution, however. For the reasons given by the right hon. Member for Oldham, West and Royton, on which I shall try to expand in my speech, that was  not a satisfactory precedent in many ways. The circumstances in which the vote was taken revealed the weakness of not having had a vote before. Although it became impossible for a present-day Government to resist putting a substantive motion to the House of Commons, that was not satisfactory. Indeed, continued dissatisfaction with the recent process led the right hon. Member for Birmingham, Ladywood (Clare Short) to table her Bill, which I supported, led the right hon. Member for Oldham, West and Royton to table his Bill, and should lead us all to clamour for reform. Now that things have moved, the consultation should lead to our considering in great detail how to enshrine the process to make sure that when Parliament is given its right to vote and scrutinise in future, it can do that properly, without a pistol held at its head, in full knowledge of all the relevant information, and in a position actually to influence the outcome. We are not there yet.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o151"><a name="70515-0009.htm_para24"><a name="07051566000008">I would adopt as a starting point the recommendations of the House of Lords Constitution Committee. I was pleased that the Leader of the House referred to those recommendations with apparent approval, and I hope that that means that the Government will look to the report of that Select Committee, chaired by Lord Holme, a Liberal peer, as the starting point. It is important that we consider what that Committee eventually recommended, on page 43 of its report. To save time, I shall paraphrase it, but only a little.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o152"><a name="70515-0009.htm_para25"><a name="07051566000009">That report said that the Government should be required to seek parliamentary approval if they propose the deployment of troops outside the United Kingdom in an area of conflict, and that that decision should probably be subject to scrutiny by a Select Committee and in other appropriate ways. It recommended that prior approval should be required as the trigger for the deployment of troops, and that subsequent ratification of that approval should take place if circumstances change after the deployment is first made. It also said that the Government should be required to put forward the legal basis of the possible warfare or conflict that may arise from the deployment, and that the case for going to war should be set out clearly for parliamentary scrutiny.</p>

convention. There are enormous difficulties involved in the drafting of a suitable statute. We do not want too rigid an arrangement to cover an infinite variety of circumstances, which may on occasion require some common sense and flexibility. I regret to say, however, that I have declining confidence in the power of convention in the British constitution. I used to be a great supporter of the place of convention in the constitution, because I prefer political sanctions to legal sanctions and intervention wherever possible, but I regret to say that in modern times I have seen more parliamentary conventions laid on one side when expediency determines than I have seen statutes defied or revised. Other countries have found it possible to put similar processes on a statutory foundation, and I do not think it should be beyond proper consultation, and the wit of parliamentary draftsmen, to find an appropriate basis for this process, as long as suitable discretion is allowed not only for emergencies but for all the other myriad circumstances to which Members have already referred today.</p>

 My right hon. and learned Friend is correct in saying that other countries have found it possible to adopt a statutory approach, but may I suggest that that may not be a proper comparison? The United Kingdom is one of the very few countries that use their armed forces for a wide range of activities and operations in many parts of the world, including not just conflict but peace enforcement and peacekeeping. What would concern me enormously about a statutory approach is that the problem would be dealt with in a very rigid way that could seriously impede the ability of our armed forces to perform properly the task they had been given. As we have all agreed, circumstances will constantly change, and if it were necessary to refer constantly to some Act of Parliament rather than using the greater flexibility allowed by a convention, we might do a great disservice that we certainly do not intend.</p>

 I agree that that danger must be avoided in the drafting of a statute. A hugely complex, detailed and prescriptive statute would be a mistake. However, I do not think that it is beyond our abilities to produce a statute setting out firmly the framework of the process that should be followed, leaving adequate discretion to both Government and Parliament to use it as common sense and politics dictate in particular circumstances. That is, of course, something that can be considered during the consultation that the Leader of the House has proposed.</p>

The first and most obvious point is that it was not a timely vote.</p>

long before that information was shared with many people in the country. We did not arrive at the vote that counted until the very eve of war, and when we did vote, it was obvious to anyone who had followed the debate that the invasion would take place within a matter of days. Half the British Army was already in place in the desert, and no doubt the Americans were telephoning the Prime Minister to tell him that he must speed up the process because everyone was going to go.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o156"><a name="70515-0010.htm_para3"><a name="07051566000015">I know that in recent days the right hon. Member for Oldham, West and Royton has been embarrassed by the fact&#151;quite amazing to those who know him&#151;that he has a record of having voted in favour of the invasion, but he is not alone on either side of the House. I well remember from discussions that took place at the time of the debate that many Members on my side of the House&#151;not just the 20 or so who voted against the war at various times&#151;felt that they could not possibly vote against it when the troops were already in the field, and could not understand how on earth Parliament could now be expected to pull them all out and bring them home. It was not a vote in which Parliament was being invited to take part in a timely fashion, and it was not a vote which most Members of Parliament could really believe would have the slightest credible effect on the outcome.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o157"><a name="70515-0010.htm_para4"><a name="07051566000016">We had had various statements. We had known what was going on. We had had one or two votes. We had had the vote in November 2002 on resolution 1441. I voted in favour of the motion tabled that day; it was skilfully worded. A very high proportion of those who voted in favour of that motion believed that they were voting for the last chance of avoiding war, not in favour of participation and an invasion. Many of us became indignant when it was later claimed that the November vote gave parliamentary authority for what happened. Many people in this country and abroad thought that a second United Nations resolution would be required before it could be turned into a basis for war.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o158"><a name="70515-0010.htm_para5"><a name="07051566000017">We had a lot of statements, followed only by questions, but no substantive motion. Whenever problems arose we had inquiries, but the inquiries were deliberately set up with very narrow terms of reference. The Hutton report inquired into the death of Dr. Kelly. The Butler report inquired into the use of intelligence; it was very critical, but not sufficiently so to shake the Government. In my opinion, those inquiries were set up to minimise parliamentary debate on those issues and to shift it outside, not to give Parliament a further opportunity to take part in the process.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o159"><a name="70515-0010.htm_para6"><a name="07051566000018">We had no vote at any relevant time when the debate and vote might have influenced the outcome, so we now have to draft a process. The starting point must be when a significant deployment of troops takes place; that is the time when the law, or strong convention, should require that parliamentary approval for a Government decision be given before it can be acted on. We need a process that lays down rules to establish that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o161"><a name="70515-0010.htm_para8"><a name="07051566000020">I do not believe that once we have gone to war, that should always rule out parliamentary scrutiny on the grounds that any discussion would undermine the troops in the field and be bad for morale. Of course certain types of debates would be very damaging to morale and extremely unpatriotic, but I think that the House can be relied on to treat Members who engage in such debates very roughly indeed. However, on many occasions the troops must be amazed that so little parliamentary attention appears to be paid to what they are engaged in, and they would like to be reassured that somebody back home is debating what is going on, and what is the likely outcome. In a modern democracy it should be impossible to cut out parliamentary scrutiny, and the need for the Government to seek a reaffirmation of their authority. I believe that they did so on a considerable scale in the Crimean war; the case for that in the 21st century is much stronger. We should be allowed to have such scrutiny nowadays.</p>

 My right hon. and learned Friend is making a powerful case, and I fully support what he says. I was not in favour of the war, but I am not in favour of the management of the peace initiative either. Does he agree that it would also be right to scrutinise what we do in the aftermath of war fighting&#151;in the peacekeeping? Had we managed that better, the position would not be as it is now&#151;close to civil war.</p>

 I wholly agree. In terms of both Iraq and Afghanistan, we are currently unclear about what the Government believe will happen. We have not had adequate parliamentary scrutiny. I supported the operation in Afghanistan, and I was against that in Iraq. There is no argument against Parliament&#146;s considering a serious substantive motion about the future conduct of operations in both places. It would not be remotely unpatriotic for this House to address that. The circumstances in both countries are plainly wholly different from those that we thought we would face when we first intervened.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o162"><a name="70515-0010.htm_para9"><a name="07051566000023">The second thing wrong with the process was the way in which, at every stage, the Government controlled all the information on which Parliament acted. Of course the Government have to be the principal source of information, but there are certain types of information that our conventions and statutes should require them to lay before the House as a matter of duty, not just of choice. The legal basis for the war should obviously be placed in a clear statement before the House. As it happens, I am not one of those who believe that the Attorney-General&#146;s full opinion should ever be made public and placed before the House, because that would get in the way of fearless advice. Moreover, if the whole thing had to be drafted for public consumption, that would alter every nuance of it. Rather, the conclusion should be set out as such, and as a declared statement of the legal basis on which the Government are proceeding. That was done during the Iraq war, but again, not willingly or in a straightforward fashion. It was pretty messy, and arguments continued about the whether the Attorney-General had wavered.

My right hon. and noble Friend the Attorney-General did come forward at the appropriate time&#151;it needs to be borne in mind that, contrary to what the right hon. and learned Gentleman said, a decision to go to war had not been taken until the last few days before it was put before this House&#151;and did present a legal justification for military action, which is exactly what he said he thought ought to happen when he gave evidence to their lordships&#146; Committee.</p>

 I do not agree with that analysis of events at all. The whole point about the invasion of Iraq is that it was not a sudden or quick process. It was a very long process, planned back in 2002, involving a remorseless build-up to an invasion that became ever more inevitable the more that preparations were made. One can see that from Bob Woodward&#146;s descriptions of what was going on in the United States. As is usual, we have had far more revelations about what happened day to day in the United States in the run-up to the war than we in this country will get for 30 years.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o163"><a name="70515-0010.htm_para10"><a name="07051566000026">There came a stage in that process when so many troops had been deployed and so much preparation has taken place for what might lead to an invasion&#151;I would say that it was 90 per cent. likely to lead to warfare&#151;that the time had come for Parliament to be asked to approve that deployment. At that stage, Parliament should have had plainly before it not just a bald statement that the Attorney-General believed the deployment to be lawful, but an adequate, decent legal statement on the legal basis, saying why, on the authority of international law and precedent, the Attorney-General had come to that conclusion. There should, of course, also have been a plain statement of the purpose of the war, and why the British Government thought that there was a British interest that it might prove necessary to defend through the use of military force. That was the key thing in the Iraq war.</p>

To judge by my many discussions with neo-conservative friends of mine who debated vigorously with me my opposition to their determination to see regime change in Iraq, I very much doubt whether at any stage there was a plain and defensible statement of the real political and diplomatic motives for going to war. Something of that kind must be the starting point, so that we can clarify it in consultation. We need to put it into some firm  <br>

However, we must also ask questions about the legitimacy of warfare. We all want to debate what is a just war and what is not. What are those extreme situations where British interests are so threatened that the use of military power is justified? There are few pacifists in this House, and we all accept that such situations do occur. However, they have occurred 60 times&#151;some to a minor extent&#151;in the last 10 years. We need to be satisfied, and our troops, too, need to be satisfied, that they are embarked on a legitimate process that has been authorised by the Parliament of their country, which is upholding the best interests and the best values of their country.</p>

I was debating with him United Nations resolutions and the legality in international law of what was being proposed. I knew very well that he did not take the United Nations or international law very seriously; on the whole, such matters were indulged in by neo-conservatives to assist their European friends in getting their own countries involved, as well. They were not high on the list of priorities so far as leading neo-cons were concerned. However, my neo-con friend was able to answer my question about the legitimacy of his argument: he said, &#147;We have all the legitimacy, as an American Government, that we require. We have large majorities in favour in both Houses of Congress.&#148; He thought that far more important than UN resolutions, or some fiction&#151;in his opinion&#151;called international law.

A future Prime Minister would have enhanced authority if there were a process by which he could get the authority of Parliament behind him in defending British interests overseas. The proposed constitutional change would improve, rather than weaken, our ability to conduct foreign policy, and it would be looked back on as a change that it is amazing was not made a century earlier. This system should not have been allowed to drag on until this stage. At last, we have a Government spokesman standing up and defending what future students of politics will regard as obvious common sense.</p>

 This debate is on the principle of parliamentary approval for armed conflict. It is an important debate of principle, but it takes place of course in the shadow of a very real armed conflict&#151;the ongoing war in Iraq. I voted against that war and was never more comfortable with a vote in Parliament.</p>

There can be few armed conflicts in the 20th and 21st centuries that provoke as much bad feeling and anger as the war in Iraq. Even though we had a vote on it, the process by which we went to war has put a focus on the issue of parliamentary approval.</p>

It makes no sense to have procedures that have no meaning even for relatively well informed members of the public.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o172"><a name="70515-0010.htm_para19"><a name="07051566000038">The process by which we agree to armed conflict at present reflects the use and abuse of the royal prerogative.

Member for Chesterfield, Tony Benn. On that, as on many other issues, he was both prescient and right. He has been proved correct by events and I am sure that he will be pleased to see that Ministers are catching up with him on the issue.</p>

It is interesting that the US is having a lively, constructive and engaged debate, instigated by Congress, about the Iraq war, its progress and whether the US should withdraw. We are having no such debate on the Floor of the House. Here, we have to await the will of whoever is Prime Minister. The comparison with the US, where Congress can have a proper debate about the progress of the war and the possibilities for withdrawal, is most illustrative.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o174"><a name="70515-0010.htm_para21"><a name="07051566000040">It is especially important that the House reviews the process by which the country goes to war given the rise and rise of the doctrine of liberal interventionism. I am a sceptic on that issue, especially when the intervention occurs without a proper legal framework. If we are to intervene increasingly in other countries for humanitarian or other reasons, we need to have a much firmer framework on which to do so. At the moment, international law on the subject means whatever the last lawyer to speak about it says it means.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o175"><a name="70515-0010.htm_para22"><a name="07051566000041">Members on both sides of the House have said that we not only need a vote on going to war, but better intelligence and more information. They have said that we did not have enough intelligence last time and that that was the problem. As one of those who voted against the war in Iraq, I wonder whether they read either of the dossiers that were produced. Both were simply assertion piled on assertion and lacked factual information. Having read them, I was never persuaded by them. Perhaps it is my background as a career civil servant that led me actually to read the paperwork, but I was not persuaded by it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o176"><a name="70515-0010.htm_para23"><a name="07051566000042">Nor was I persuaded by the assertion in the newspapers that Saddam Hussein had missiles that could hit British territory, or even Cyprus, in 45 minutes. Hon. Members on both sides have said that they did not have enough information, but on the information that was laid before the House&#151;and the speeches and writings of people such as Scott Ritter, one of the last UN weapons inspectors to go to Iraq&#151;I was satisfied that there was no legal basis for the war. Members who unfortunately voted for the war should not hide behind a lack of intelligence or information.</p>

None the less, it was not mandatory to have a vote. I welcome this debate and what we have heard from at least one of the candidates for the leadership of the Labour party about a willingness to move the procedure on. It is wrong for Parliament, for our armed forces and for the political process that we should continue, in the 21st century, to take our country to war through a process that depends on the norms of the 16th century.</p>

But the truth is that, despite 24-hour news and the increasingly presidential nature of our system, the rights and the powers of Parliament remain the last and best defence of the citizen.

 On the face of it, the debate is about parliamentary approval for this country to go to war, but it is almost as much about the erosion of trust in Government and the Prime Minister that has led to the demand for change. I am perhaps the first to contribute to the debate who is profoundly unenthusiastic about the change. I will support it, for reasons I will come to in a moment, but I take no particular pleasure in doing so. I have in mind not only the continuing controversies over the Iraq war&#151;and the feeling shared by many people that they were let down by the Government in the projection of the case for war to both Parliament and the country&#151;but the Kosovo conflict.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o180"><a name="70515-0011.htm_para2"><a name="07051566000047">Whatever one&#146;s views about the Kosovo conflict, the truth is that we effectively declared war on another country that had not attacked us. We proceeded to bomb that country for six months, but at no time was a vote taken in this House of Commons to give approval to that decision. Three debates took place on the Adjournment, but on no occasion was there an opportunity for a vote on something that was manifestly a war, even though no war had been declared.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o181"><a name="70515-0011.htm_para3"><a name="07051566000048">The conflict in Kosovo, in combination with the Iraq situation, has led increasingly to a profound mistrust of our arrangements, and to a demand to formalise them. Why do I say that I am unenthusiastic about that change? The answer is that, when one looks at how the royal prerogative has developed over centuries, one sees that what we have now is very different from what existed originally. In the past, the royal prerogative meant that a monarch&#151;or any Prime Minister or chief minister appointed by that monarch&#151;could take decisions regardless of the views of Parliament. Even in those days, however, the need to vote supply meant that Parliament could influence indirectly the monarch&#146;s ability to go to war.</p>

Yet the Government are as elected as this House is, and they are the  <br>

Government only because the Prime Minister and his or her colleagues command a majority in this House. Therefore, there is not the fundamental lack of legitimacy that existed when the royal prerogative was developed and used at an earlier time in our history.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o183"><a name="70515-0011.htm_para5"><a name="07051566000050">Moreover, the question goes beyond the fact that a Government&#151;any Government&#151;are elected. The comparisons with the US made by my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Rushcliffe (Mr. Clarke) are not entirely appropriate, for the following reason. The US President does not depend for his continuation in office on the support of Congress. If the American legislation did not require a vote in Congress before the US could go to war, a President could take that decision on his own initiative. Short of impeachment&#151;which is incredibly difficult, for all the reasons that we are familiar with&#151;there would be no way in which Congress or the American public could either reverse the decision, or stop it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o184"><a name="70515-0011.htm_para6"><a name="07051566000051">A President is elected for a full term of office. He does not need to have a majority in Congress&#151;very often, as at present, he does not have such a majority. It would therefore be intolerable, of course, that an issue as fundamental as peace or war could be determined by the President without anyone being able to do anything about it, short of invoking the ultimate nuclear weapon of impeachment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o185"><a name="70515-0011.htm_para7"><a name="07051566000052">In the case of the UK, we all know what the political reality is: a Government who decline to ask for an endorsement by the House of Commons in these matters will not survive unless they command, if not the enthusiasm of the House, then at least its acquiescence. The Government take great pride in the fact that they asked for the House&#146;s support when the war in Iraq was determined. That is, of course, historically correct, but I do not think that I will be contradicted when I say that many Labour Members voted for the Government only with enormous reluctance. They did so because they feared that the Government would fall if they failed to carry the day. Similarly, a Government who went to war without a vote would know that the consequence of acting against the wishes of the House and of their own party would be the same.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o186"><a name="70515-0011.htm_para8"><a name="07051566000053">In an ideal world, therefore, I would prefer that we were not going in the direction in which we are moving. Once constraints such as we are discussing today are introduced by statute&#151;and also, to some degree, by convention&#151;there is a danger that demands for repeated votes during the course of a war could create extraordinary uncertainty and incoherence for our armed forces in the field.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o187"><a name="70515-0011.htm_para9"><a name="07051566000054">As I say, I take no great pleasure from the direction in which we are moving, but I believe that the Kosovo conflict was hugely important. I make no comment about its merits, but no vote was held in respect of that conflict, and not because the Government believed that not holding a vote would somehow assist our armed forces. No vote was held because the Government were, I suspect, embarrassed by the lack of a mandate from the UN Security Council, and by the fact that we were attacking a country that had not attacked us. The Kosovo mission had broad support on both sides of the House, but the Government found it convenient&#151;for political rather than military reasons&#151;to avoid the House being requested to give its formal approval.</p>

If we are to require in future that the House must give its explicit endorsement when military operations are contemplated or about to take place, it is very important that we are conscious of what the necessary safeguards should be.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o189"><a name="70515-0011.htm_para11"><a name="07051566000056">The Government and my right hon. Friend the Member for Richmond, Yorks (Mr. Hague) have both suggested that there would be occasions when it would not be possible for the Government to ask the House for approval in advance of a military operation, and that therefore provision should be made for retrospective endorsement. It is true that there might be such occasions, but any such retrospective endorsement would have to be considered very carefully. In an intervention earlier, I made the point that it is hugely important that a failure to grant retrospective endorsement should not render illegitimate a war already begun, as that would place our armed forces in a very difficult and incoherent situation.</p>

 Does the right hon. and learned Gentleman agree that that is also an argument against requiring legislation in these circumstances, as that would subject whatever we might decide to judicial review? As a result, a court might decide that our troops were engaging in an illegal activity because of a drafting error in the Act authorising the war.</p>

 I broadly agree. It is hugely important that we do not get so involved in our debates in this Chamber that we forget the potential implications for the people doing the actual fighting and risking their lives on the country&#146;s behalf.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o190"><a name="70515-0011.htm_para12"><a name="07051566000059">There is a second aspect to the question of retrospective approval.

It cannot be demanded that, because the House of Commons has declined to give its support, our troops must be brought home in days or week, regardless of wider implications. I repeat that we must trust the Government to handle such matters in a sensible and flexible fashion. We must not tie their hands too much. </p>

<p><a name="stpa_o191"><a name="70515-0011.htm_para13"><a name="07051566000060">I shall make only two additional points, as I do not want to detain the House much longer. The first is that the motion asking the House to approve the Iraq war was incredibly complex. I have it here: debated on 18 March 2003, the motion was 32 lines long&#151;a massive attempt to justify what the Government had in mind. A danger arises when it turns out that some part of a justification such as that turns out to be invalid. I shall read out part of the motion, although I stress that I do so not for partisan reasons but to illustrate my point. The motion seeking approval for the Iraq war began by requesting that this House</p>

If the basis on which the House is asked for approval turns out to be totally invalid, what does that do to the legitimacy of a conflict? What message does it send to the armed forces in the field?</p>

Of course, any Government arguing their case from the Dispatch Box will have to explain their views, and of course such matters will be debated on both sides of the House, but I believe that the motion itself&#151;the formal, legal endorsement for going to war or entering into armed conflict&#151;should be kept to the minimum possible length in order to avoid the risk to which I have referred.</p>

 My right hon. and learned Friend is making a powerful argument. The vote on the 18 March motion was not about going to war&#151;I was going to intervene on the hon. Member for Hackney, North and Stoke Newington (Ms Abbott) on this point&#151;although I acknowledge that both of us were not here at that point. There was a vote on resolution 1441, which related to the failure of the inspection programme, and a vote on resolution 678, which was tucked away in the motion and had actually been written 12 years before. If we are to introduce new arrangements, we must have a clear-cut indication that this House will decide whether we go to war, rather than the ambiguity of the motion debated on 18 March 2003.</p>

 In fact, I was in the House for the debate on 18 March.

 I do not doubt for a moment what the hon. Lady says, but it is not a question simply of what Members of this place believe.

 I have listened to my right hon. and learned Friend&#146;s criticism of the motion, but I am not quite sure why a terse, one-line statement, leaving Ministers free to assert whatever they want from the Dispatch Box, would make it any more legitimate. Does not his criticism make the contrary point, which is that at that stage the Government were obliged to set out as many bases for the war as they could think of? I suspect they were acting on the advice of the Whips who said that the debate must be timed for the last possible moment and that the motion should include reference to this and to that because it would maximise the vote. Is not my right hon. and learned Friend&#146;s point that a clear statement of the basis for war should be made earlier, so that it is not as subject to the vagaries of whipping, timing and pressure of imminence? Such a statement would put on the record the reasons for going to war and make it easier to hold the Government to account thereafter.</p>

 I agree, but my main concern is the impact on our forces in a theatre of war. It is hugely important that they have a clear understanding that, whatever subsequent political events may demonstrate, the legitimacy of their actions on our behalf is not open to question.</p>

However, anyone who has been involved in conflict&#151;even indirectly, in my case, or directly, like some of my hon. and gallant Friends&#151;knows that that is not the case; the spectrum of military activity is huge. I am not referring only to peacekeeping or peace enforcement. I offer an example of the difficulties that we shall have to address.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o195"><a name="70515-0011.htm_para17"><a name="07051566000070">While I was Defence Secretary and then Foreign Secretary, the UN resolutions on no-fly zones in Iraq were enforced. That did not involve conflict on a day-to-day basis&#151;we were not attacking Iraq every day of the week or every week of the year&#151;but Britain and the United States, the two countries militarily involved, had told the Iraqis that if they breached the UN resolutions and attacked our aircraft or were seen in the air in the no-fly zone, we would take military action to stop them. On several occasions, the Iraqis breached the no-fly zone, so British and US jets took to the air and sometimes shot down Iraqi aircraft and attacked Iraqi radar installations. That was not a declaration of war in any interpretation, but it was armed conflict, which is the term used nowadays. There are rarely declarations of war; they have gone out of fashion as declarations, even if the substance is still with us.</p>

That would be an absurd situation. However, such operational problems can easily arise in the real world, so I say to my hon. Friends as well as to the Government that although, sadly, it is necessary to move towards a formalisation of the role of the House and of Parliament as regards the Government&#146;s use of what has formerly been the prerogative, it will be enormously difficult to handle unless we are prepared to sacrifice the flexibility that has until now been an asset. It is sad that erosion of trust in the Government has forced us to make such painful choices.</p>

 Normally, when I attend debates and hear agreement between Ministers and Opposition Front Benchers I am immediately suspicious. Today, I shall make an exception, because an important development is taking place along lines for which I and some other Members have been arguing for some time. As I pointed out earlier, I introduced a private Member&#146;s Bill on the subject in January 2005. It had cross-party support and in the following year my right hon.

Member for Richmond, Yorks (Mr. Hague) suggested that it had occurred among only Labour Members, but it has actually occurred on both sides of the House. In 2004, seven Conservative Members signed my early-day motion; by 2005, 36 of the 233 signatures were Conservative. In the opening speeches and in the interventions made on the right hon. Member for Richmond, Yorks, I still detected unease among some Conservative Back Benchers about not only the Government&#146;s proposals but those of their Front-Bench team.</p>

But a precedent was set. The Prime Minister said shortly afterwards that he thought that it was inconceivable now that any Government could try to go to war without a vote&#151;but the fact that the Prime Minister said that is no guarantee for the future. We have to look at the mechanisms involved.</p>

taken, how they should be taken and in what circumstances, that would open up the possibility of legal challenges&#151;in a way that might not arise if we had a convention. But I was not using the term &#147;legitimising&#148; in its strictly legal sense; I was thinking about the Government&#146;s seeking justification for the action that they intended to take.</p>

My gut feeling and preference would be for legislation, having introduced a private Member&#146;s Bill on the subject a few years ago, but I recognise from that experience the difficulties of drafting and of getting the legislation exactly right. Safeguards are necessary to allow for urgent action and for troops to be able to defend themselves without any fear that that action will create difficulties for them. How do we distinguish between military action and peacekeeping? Is there really a distinction in some cases?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o203"><a name="70515-0011.htm_para25"><a name="07051566000081">I recall the debate on the Bill introduced by my right hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Ladywood and that some of the difficulties that were suggested at that time were somewhat exaggerated. The most important difficulty is one that the right hon. and learned Member for Rushcliffe spoke about in his contribution: the timing of the vote. If Parliament is asked to vote when troops have already been deployed&#151;as it was in the final vote on Iraq&#151;certainly for some people it becomes much more difficult to oppose the war.</p>

 Does my hon. Friend agree that timing is vital for two reasons? When the House is asked to vote on military action and the troops are massed at the border, two issues come into play in Members&#146; minds. First, there is the fact that they will be letting down their troops, who have been heavily deployed. Secondly, there is the humiliation that the Prime Minister of the day will suffer if his own MPs do not vote for military action. Timing is key to having a proper and reasoned vote on the subject.</p>

 I accept both those arguments. The difficulty is how to get the timing right. If the timing of the vote is left entirely in the control of the Prime Minister, frankly it would be a pretty stupid Prime Minister who could not select when he would have a much better chance of getting the desired outcome. There is no question but that the timing of the vote can affect the outcome. Whether we go down the legislative route or the convention route, we should be looking for some mechanism that gives Parliament more control over the timing and more choice about when votes are called, as was suggested. If all the choices about timing are left to the Executive, it is almost certain that the vote will take place when it is most likely that the Executive will get the result that they are looking for.</p>

to go to Parliament and say, &#147;Give me a mandate to go to war,&#148; when there might still be a chance of peace. Does he agree that there is a genuine objective difficulty that makes it difficult to lay down in statute exactly when the vote should take place?</p>

 I accept that point. There are genuine difficulties about the timing. If we look not just at the Iraq war, but at some of the other military actions over the past 10 years, we see that there have been quite long build-up periods. Choosing when there should be a vote is not simple. I would not pretend for one moment that it was. But we ought to give some thought to the mechanisms for determining the timing of the vote. That will be critical in getting a procedure that works properly&#151;if we are going to have parliamentary involvement. I am not suggesting for one minute that I have a simple, easy answer, but it is a key point.</p>

 Should not the rights and responsibilities of Parliament extend not just to the resolution to deploy into an area of armed conflict? Should it not have the right to monitor what subsequently happens? Perhaps it could appoint a bespoke Select Committee to monitor what happens in the conflict and post conflict. In situations such as Iraq, when Parliament knows that it is potentially on a countdown to deployment to armed conflict, such a bespoke Select Committee could be formed and could help to determine when parliamentary votes were required and when debates were appropriate.</p>

 I thank the hon. Gentleman for his intervention. That is obviously one possible mechanism. In terms of scrutiny, there seems to be no problem with Select Committees choosing to look at what is happening. The real problem is that debate is not taking place in the House as a whole. We have had relatively little debate in the past two or three years about what is going on within Iraq, when it is clearly of immense importance and when there are many, many Members who are seriously concerned about what is happening. But that is a slightly different issue: it is to do with what happens afterwards, rather than what happens at the point when we are about to take military action.</p>

The Committee talked about wars &#147;of necessity&#148;, &#147;of choice&#148; and &#147;of obligation&#148;. A war of necessity is self-defence. If one is attacked, quite clearly one expects to defend oneself. As far as this country is concerned, it is difficult to think back to a time when that actually happened&#151;when the trigger for war was a direct attack on this country. The Committee dismissed wars of obligation as not being a reality. It pointed out that none of the international treaties that we are signed up to forces us to take military action. Even perhaps the most obvious example, article 5 of the NATO treaty, which is the core commitment to collective self-defence in NATO, only commits each signatory to take</p>

It was a political choice to be involved in military action in Kosovo, Afghanistan, Bosnia, Sierra Leone and Iraq&#151;the major military actions over the past 10 years. It cannot be suggested, as some tried when we discussed parliamentary involvement a year or two ago, that if Parliament had been involved, it would have given the game away and alerted the enemy that we would be involved in military action, because every example involved a significant build-up period. In most, although not all, of those cases, military conflict did not involve the UK going it alone because either we were in a coalition, or the action took place under the auspices of UN resolutions.</p>

I remember from drafting my private Member&#146;s Bill that it is really difficult to get all the detail right and to think of all situations that might arise so that they can be covered. The key issue is that there should be substantive votes. We need a mechanism that will ensure that substantive votes take place in the House and that the House can have a degree of control over the timing of votes.

overwhelming public support for what Governments were doing in all wars before the Iraq war, which was declared in March 2003. We only have to think back to the days before the declaration of war in 1914 to recall that there was overwhelming support among the public and in the House and massive demonstrations were held. There was a feeling that we were absolutely right to go to war because the independence and neutrality of Belgium had been violated. The mood in 1939 was much more sombre, but it was absolutely united. We felt that while we had given Germany every opportunity to try to maintain peace, owing to our desperate experience of the first world war and our desire to avoid war, we had to go to war. Although there was some opposition to the Falklands war, there was basically a united House of Commons and united public opinion on that much smaller war, which happened after the sovereignty of part of the United Kingdom was grossly violated by an invasion. While all those wars drew support, there was one important exception: Suez. That rather proves the point.</p>

Prime Ministers did not act alone irrespective of public opinion. The truth is that they acted in line with public opinion&#151;they almost had no choice.

The motion cited numerous United Nations resolutions and stated explicitly that the war was a just war. A just war is a war into which a country is forced against its will to defend itself. We were told in March 2003 that we had to go to war because we were faced with a dictator who was out of control, who had the third or fourth biggest army in the world, who had weapons of mass destruction and who was a real and potent threat to the region.</p>

We went into Iraq because we feared for the security of the region, and we believed that the country&#146;s Government was a threat to the region. We now justify our continued presence by saying that we are asked to be there by the democratically elected Government, and we say that we will stay there as long as is necessary.

We all know that there is a complete and desperate mess out there. None of us has any time for what Saddam Hussein did, and we all know that he was a ruthless and desperate tyrant, but we have enormous sympathy for ordinary Iraqi people. When I visited Iraq while Saddam Hussein was in power, those people were going about their business.

Any Government that still had troops in Iraq at the time of a general election would be swept aside by our electorate. Such is the complete breakdown in trust, and such is the opposition of the British people to our continuing presence in Iraq, that whatever happens, and whatever the security situation on the ground, our troops will leave. For that reason, the process is subject to an arbitrary timetable of three, or more probably two, years.</p>

We are told, of course, that we are doing terribly well in the southern part of the country, although the Americans are having all sorts of problems, and we are told that we are gradually withdrawing, but we have not actually been told what has been happening in the provinces from which we have withdrawn. We all know that gradually a strong military or political force will take over as we leave. Apparently, we will now withdraw to the airport, but does anyone think that a country can be run from an airport? The reason we are withdrawing to the airport is to try to reduce our casualties. It means that we can maintain the political fiction that we are still in the country and are sustaining the Government, and that everything is all right. We are stuck in the airport. Armies that retreat to airports are armies that are leaving the country.</p>

We are deluding ourselves. When we leave, one of two things will happen: either there will be complete chaos and civil war, or some strong man will take charge.

However, that is all said with hindsight. At the end of the day, a strong man will emerge, and it will not be the present bunch of corrupt politicians who are sheltering in the green zone, and who have just awarded themselves a two-month summer recess while American troops are dying in the streets trying to protect them.

Negotiations continue daily, and votes are threatened that would cut off President Bush&#146;s supply; he is having to negotiate his way out of that impasse. Here, we are brushed aside with soft words.

I do not believe that that sophisticated intelligence is out there at the moment. I think that the Government&#146;s intelligence on what is happening in the provinces that we have vacated is very weak indeed. The Government are flying by the seat of their pants, and they have no idea what will happen; they simply want to get out.

Of course, in this House, we all believe that those ideas are superior, but do we have no idea what is going through the mind of ordinary Iraqis, apart from those few politicians sheltering in the green zone? Do we really imagine that we are popular in Iraq? I know that there is a division of opinion on that, and that some people would perhaps like us to stay, but fundamentally, most people are opposed to what we want, and opposed to our way of life.

 In response to the hon. Member for Gainsborough (Mr. Leigh), I do not think that the debate has a great deal to do with Iraq specifically. Indeed, Iraq shows the limitations of what we are doing today. I also do not think that the debate has much to do with Afghanistan. I slightly question the hon. Gentleman&#146;s expertise, as he seems to think that Afghanistan is an Arab country. It is not.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o223"><a name="70515-0012.htm_para19"><a name="0705166000005">I shall explore in my speech the limitations of what we are doing today. To some extent, we have all been in agreement and we have made matters too easy for ourselves. I accept what everybody has said so far, that the issue is extremely important, and that we are making a very important change to the democratic tradition in Britain. It is a good change and it is overdue. I pay tribute to hon. Members such as my hon. Friend the Member for Walthamstow (Mr. Gerrard) and others who are not present. I also draw attention to my near neighbour, my hon. Friend the Member for Nottingham, North (Mr. Allen), who tabled motion 27 on the Order Paper, which I guess he can now withdraw because it is essentially identical to what we are about to approve today.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o224"><a name="70515-0012.htm_para20"><a name="0705166000006">The background to this debate is the increasing public scepticism over the involvement of Britain in international affairs to anything like the extent to which we have been accustomed in recent years. The right hon. and learned Member for Kensington and Chelsea (Sir Malcolm Rifkind), who spoke earlier, is a vigorous supporter of Britain punching above its weight. There was a recent opinion poll that specifically asked, &#147;Are you in favour of Britain punching above its weight?&#148; A substantial majority said, &#147;No, we are not. We are against Britain getting too much involved.&#148; That is a serious issue for all of us.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o225"><a name="70515-0012.htm_para21"><a name="0705166000007">We can all think of conflicts on which we disagree. For some it might be Suez, for some it might be Iraq, for some it might be a number of conflicts. Similarly, unless we are pacifists, we can all think of occasions when we would like Britain to intervene or to have intervened in the past. Many people feel that we ought to be intervening in Darfur. There are some who feel that we should be intervening in Zimbabwe or in Burma. There is always a debate on these topics and there is always a case for intervention. It is sobering that we have come to a point where the public on the whole say, &#147;I don&#146;t care if there is a good case for it. We don&#146;t want to get involved.&#148; In what we are doing today and in subsequent discussions, we need to try to rebuild the process to the point that the public accept that if that process is gone through in the correct way, we will reach a reasonable basis on which to intervene overseas.</p>

slaughter, and we need a process that we can accept. I am in favour of the change and I should like to explore some of the specific details that have been raised during the debate. The hon. Member for Newark (Patrick Mercer) asked what the test should be for substantial involvement, and whether it should be firepower or manpower. The answer is both. If we commit substantial firepower abroad, Britain will become very much part of whatever controversy is involved. That is a matter on which the House of Commons should legitimately be able to express an opinion. If we commit substantial manpower, the likelihood is that British lives will be lost&#151;so even more so should Parliament be involved.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o227"><a name="70515-0013.htm_para1"><a name="0705166000009">The right hon. and learned Member for Rushcliffe (Mr. Clarke) and my hon. Friend the Member for Walthamstow both raised the issue of timing. As we discussed in my exchange with my hon. Friend, there are difficulties both in consulting too early and in consulting too late. If the Prime Minister had come to the House six months before the Iraq war&#151;at a time when I think that he had privately concluded that it was likely that war would be necessary&#151;and if at that stage he had sought the authority of the House to go to war, with the United Nations still debating the issue and a great deal of controversy about Saddam&#146;s intentions and about the potential for the weapons inspectors to succeed in their mission, it would have been seen as an extremely provocative act, effectively pre-empting the attempt to find a peaceful outcome. However, by consulting only when the troops were on the border, as my hon. Friends the Members for Walthamstow and for Hackney, North and Stoke Newington (Ms Abbott) said, a great many of us felt that it was very difficult at that stage, with our troops on the border, for us to say, &#147;No, let&#146;s all go home.&#148;</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o228"><a name="70515-0013.htm_para2"><a name="0705166000010">I suggest that we foresee two separate decisions. One would be taken at the time of a substantial deployment of troops abroad. It would be accepted that that was not a vote to go to war, but a vote to deploy troops with a view to forcing a positive outcome. There would then be a separate decision at the time that it was felt that military force was needed. Those are two quite separate decisions, which should be seen as such. It should be possible to say, &#147;We authorise the dispatch of 50,000 troops&#148;&#151;or whatever the number might be&#151;&#147;for the purpose of advancing a favourable outcome&#148;, without that being a commitment to armed conflict, which would necessarily and prematurely inflame the situation.</p>

That was the point that we discussed briefly earlier. If our troops are fighting, it seems to me that we should not have some routine mechanism for Parliament to revisit the issue at regular intervals to discuss whether they should be fighting or whether they should stop. That would be demoralising.</p>

 I agree with the hon. Gentleman. I am glad that he picked up on my word &#147;routine&#148;. That is the point that I am making. Whereas Parliament should be automatically required to approve deployment and outbreak of war, I do not think that it should be automatically, by some standard mechanism, required to come back to the subject every three months or whatever the interval might be. In that case, the normal parliamentary process would take effect. If one of the political parties comes to the conclusion that a substantial change in strategy or even a complete withdrawal is needed, there are existing procedures in Parliament to allow that political party to raise the matter on one of its Supply days as a substantive motion.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o230"><a name="70515-0013.htm_para4"><a name="0705166000014">We heard the hon.

It would be open to the Conservative Opposition to use a Supply day such as today to put forward not a motion in principle about war-making powers but a motion urging immediate withdrawal. They have not done so because, at this point, they do not think that it would be justified or in the interests of our troops or the country. As I understand it, the Liberal Democrats favour an early withdrawal, and it would be open to them to put forward a substantive motion on a Liberal Democrat Supply day. If the Government came to the conclusion that a change of strategy was needed, it would be open to them, in all sorts of ways, to come to Parliament to ask for such approval. However, it should not be an automatic process&#151;the automatic element should relate only to the deployment of troops.</p>

 My hon. Friend emphasises the importance of people in this House not wishing to demoralise those who are already deployed in an area of conflict. Surely it would be demoralising to leave the question of parliamentary scrutiny of what takes place to partisan motions and initiatives.

 We should not underestimate the hesitation that any political party would feel about bringing forward a proposal to change the war strategy or, in effect, to admit defeat and go home.

Bournemouth, East (Mr. Ellwood), who says &#147;No&#148;, was not here. My hon. Friend the Member for Hackney, North and Stoke Newington, who was against the war, confirmed that she saw all three of those votes as leading very clearly in that direction, as I did.</p>

 The hon. Lady may have said that that was the spirit of what was voted on, but if the hon. Gentleman read the text of the various motions he would see that they were not about going to war&#151;they were about quibbling over resolution 1141 and then endorsing resolution 678, which is 12 years old. If we are to move forward and give powers to this Chamber, we must have a clear-cut motion put to us about going into conflict, rather than one that tweaks around with references to something that is more than 10 years old.</p>

Those of us who were here at the time of the Iraq vote will recall that public opinion had swung substantially in favour of voting to go to war. That is always the case. In any example that I can recall, with the possible exception of Suez, public opinion at the time we are about to go to war has been in favour of doing so. We know why that is. The press and the public tend to rally around the Government of the day and say, &#147;Right, if push comes to shove, we are ready to go to war.&#148; I cannot conceive of a situation whereby the Government of the day goes to Parliament and says, &#147;We&#146;ve got this desperate situation and it&#146;s necessary to have an armed conflict&#151;do you agree?&#148;, and Parliament says no. In practice, that does not happen and will not happen. From that we conclude that it is not just a single vote, or even two votes, on deployment and use of force that is needed, but a well-defined process in the run-up to a potential conflict.</p>

Asked that question, the intelligence community thought, &#147;We are being asked whether we can confirm that Saddam probably has weapons of mass destruction.&#148; So it looked at the fog, picked out the elements that seemed to confirm that and delivered them, with the results that we know. That is where the weakness lies. Well before any parliamentary consultation takes place, there is that difficulty in assessing the evidence.

 My hon. Friend makes a good point, which I had not altogether considered. He is right that the intelligence issue was very salient on Iraq in a way that it was not, say, on Afghanistan. His second point was also correct. Were we to propose another war on the basis of intelligence, it would require a greater conviction that that intelligence was correct. In that sense, my suggestion of an independent review of the evidence by the Intelligence and Security Committee could help. It is very important to have an element of independent all-party scrutiny at the intelligence stage.</p>

 There was obviously a problem with gathering intelligence. There is a general problem of having sufficient agents on the ground and so on. My suggestions would not help with that. A problem lay with the intelligence community&#146;s interpretation of the available evidence.

It could examine the evidence and reach the same conclusion, but at least there would be no corrosive suggestion that one party had over-interpreted the data and the other party would have done things differently.

<p><a name="stpa_o237"><a name="70515-0013.htm_para11"><a name="0705166000032">The hon. Member for Broxtowe (Dr. Palmer), in correcting some hon. Members and advising others, said that the debate had nothing to do with Iraq. I do not believe that for a moment. Given that about 80 per cent. of his speech was about Iraq, I wonder why he bothered to make such a claim.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o238"><a name="70515-0013.htm_para12"><a name="0705166000033">Let us consider the reason for the sudden U-turn and interesting timing of the debate. It is to do with the Chancellor, who is busily rowing away from the Blair mother ship. The only transparency is the politics behind that. Who was in the Cabinet when the decision was made to invade Iraq? Who paid the cheques? Who is as much an architect of Blairism as the man himself and, therefore, partly responsible for the conflict in Iraq? The answer is the Chancellor. He is now publicly advising that Parliament should play a pivotal role in war-making. Good. On the presumption that the assertion is not mere froth and spin, or part of his strategy to distance himself from the Blair Administration in which he was a central player, and that it can be taken seriously, it is most welcome.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o239"><a name="70515-0013.htm_para13"><a name="0705166000034">The Leader of the House, in opening the debate, said that there would be consultation with all parties. Let us hope that that will happen. For the record, I believe  <br>

that the convention route is preferable to a statutory route. Doubtless, that will be discussed in the weeks and months ahead. However, we must apply the lessons of Iraq and examine several matters that must be tackled.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o240"><a name="70515-0013.htm_para14"><a name="0705166000035">Let us consider intelligence. First, it must be clear, tested and truthful. Unfortunately, that was not  the case a couple of years ago. Secondly, it must be placed before Parliament unencumbered by spin or&#151;worse&#151;by being borrowed from a student&#146;s thesis. The hon. Member for Hackney, North and Stoke Newington (Ms Abbott) said that she saw through the various documents. As it happens, so did I. However, other aspects were in play during the votes and they contributed to the general ratcheting up to a position where war would happen. Regardless of wording, those of us who were present at that time knew what was happening. We knew that people were being hauled before the Prime Minister and the Whips and we also knew the real meaning of the motions. Let us not pretend otherwise. The hon. Member for Hackney, North and Stoke Newington is a redoubtable and tough character. She stood up to it, but others, sadly, did not. Still others were genuinely misled and took the evidence at its face value. I, for one, did not, and would be wary of doing so in future. Let us see whether we can improve the system.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o241"><a name="70515-0013.htm_para15"><a name="0705166000036">Thirdly, Parliament&#146;s involvement at an early stage, not when it is convenient only to the Executive, is crucial. That point has already been made and I shall not dwell on it. However, we know that the decision to invade Iraq was casually agreed in Texas between the Prime Minister and President Bush many months before Parliament voted on the matter. Indeed, the Prime Minister answered questions from various Members of Parliament, including me, in the few weeks before the conflict in Iraq, saying that no decision had been made and that military action could easily be avoided. He said that when 130,000 American troops were massed on the borders of Iraq.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o242"><a name="70515-0013.htm_para16"><a name="0705166000037">We were badly served by the current system. I could put it another way, but I shall not. Furthermore, we are aware of the misinformation about 45 minutes and the weapons of mass destruction. We also know that the nuclear experts were eager to continue searching and that Dr. Hans Blix, the chemical warfare expert, was keen to carry on for a couple of months. They were not allowed to complete their work, despite their pleas and despite being mandated by the United Nations to complete their respective tasks.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o243"><a name="70515-0013.htm_para17"><a name="0705166000038">Clearly, in addressing the matter, we must consider prerogative powers. I believe that those powers will have to remain, but that they should be exercisable by this House under strict conditions, whereby full information is supplied and a full debate is possible. I shall quote from the report of the House of Lords Constitution Committee, which is referred to in the motion. It states:</p>

</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o244"><a name="70515-0013.htm_para18"><a name="0705166000039">That is absolutely right and it is an essential question in this debate. That power is not one that the Executive would relinquish easily, but as I have already said, the  <br>

Chancellor has indicated a willingness to bring Parliament into the equation. Earlier this year, on a Sunday political programme, the Chancellor made that quite clear to Mr. Andrew Marr. He said that he could not conceive of a situation</p>
<a name="70515-0013.htm_brev1"><a name="0705166000860"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;other than an extreme emergency where Parliament would not wish to, and should not, have a role to play in this&#148;.</p>

As I have already intimated, that role was entirely unsatisfactory in its timing and also highly unsatisfactory given the quality of the alleged evidence against Saddam on which Parliament was to rely in reaching its conclusions and voting accordingly. In case anyone has any misgivings or qualms about this, let me say that Saddam was an awful tyrant and that no one in his right mind could ever have said a good word about him. That, however, is beside the point; it is another matter&#151;<i> [Interruption.] </i>Whether that justifies breaking international law is another question. That is my point.</p>

I still believe that that is right, even though I have heard knowledgeable Members on both sides of the House taking a contrary view. What we must have, at the very least, is more information on the legal opinion. It may be difficult in certain circumstances to supply the whole opinion&#151;though I know not&#151;but one page of A4 is hardly sufficient when there is a 17-page document. There are plenty of authorities in agreement with me. &#147;Erskine May&#148;, for example, states:</p>

I say that because when I was in Iraq two and a half years ago, I spoke to several senior officers who were deeply worried about the legitimacy of the conflict and the role of the troops. They volunteered those opinions;  <br>

I was not canvassing them. They were unsure and their morale was undoubtedly affected by that issue. Let us get this right: I am not trying to stir up the matter; it was volunteered to me. I am passing on, for what it is worth, the information that many senior officers in Iraq were concerned about the legitimacy of what they were doing. In my view, nothing is more damaging to military morale than a real doubt about the legitimacy of military actions. Indeed, days before the conflict began, Lord Boyce, then Chief of the Defence Staff, demanded what he called &#147;unequivocal legal authority&#148; for the invasion of Iraq. Similarly, I believe that Parliament should have such unequivocal legal authority in any debate on future conflicts; otherwise, such a decision will again be taken on flawed or seriously incomplete information, which cannot be the way forward in matters as serious as these.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o251"><a name="70515-0014.htm_para2"><a name="0705166000046">There is widespread concern about the way in which the Government acted in the run-up to the Iraq conflict. I suspect that that concern may deepen further as casualties continue and when we see the heart-breaking spectacle of grieving parents asking why their son or daughter died and in what cause. I have nothing but the highest regard for the troops serving there&#151;their bravery and professionalism is beyond doubt and beyond comparison. But it has surely reached the point where it is possible, or at least conceivable, that the presence of those brave men and women is actually contributing to the problem rather than helping to solve it. I put that not in a partisan way, but because I genuinely believe that it may be true.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o252"><a name="70515-0014.htm_para3"><a name="0705166000047">As politicians, we like to say that lessons have been learned.

Let Parliament assert itself and ensure that it is never again asked to vote on a flawed and discredited prospectus with such horrific and enduring consequences.</p>

 I congratulate my right hon. and hon. Friends on bringing this subject before the House today. I am sure that when they took that decision, they did not expect to see such a consensus across the Chamber, or a Government amendment very similar in its wording to the original motion.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o253"><a name="70515-0014.htm_para4"><a name="0705166000049">I have a dilemma&#151;very much on the same lines as that of my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Kensington and Chelsea (Sir Malcolm Rifkind). In my capacity as chairman of the defence committee of the European Security and Defence Assembly of the Western European Union, I have seen the effect of parliamentary approval on the deployment of the forces of a number of our European partners. What concerns me is that in seeking democratic legitimacy for what our armed forces do, we should not allow ourselves to get into a situation where we reduce the flexibility and timely deployment of those forces, or introduce national caveats into our deployment within multinational force deployments.</p>

my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Rushcliffe (Mr. Clarke) put so succinctly&#151;I abstained on the final vote because we were already effectively at war. Our troops were massed on the Kuwait border ready for the invasion and I felt that there was no reason to give comfort to Saddam Hussein by displaying a number of MPs who were not with our troops on that occasion. As I have pointed out several times previously, I also had a personal reason in that my daughter, a surgeon in the Royal Army Medical Corps, was one of the troops on the border, so she was part of the invasion force.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o255"><a name="70515-0014.htm_para6"><a name="0705166000051">On occasions, the case for military conflict is clear and there is a consensus. A number of hon. Members have mentioned that this evening. I believe that there was a consensus in 1939, for example, or over the Falklands. On other occasions, however, there is not a consensus and the case is not clear. Suez would be the most obvious post-war example. There are also occasions involving threats to sovereign government on which, particularly in this post-colonial era, we have deployed troops in places such as Cyprus, Kenya and Rhodesia for just those reasons.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o256"><a name="70515-0014.htm_para7"><a name="0705166000052">The world has changed in a number of ways, however. The world of state-on-state conflict is no longer with us. It might come back&#151;who knows?&#151;and we might have to invoke our various article 5 responses. I am referring to article 5 of the Washington treaty and article 5 of the modified Brussels treaty. It is more likely, however, that we shall be involved in military missions under the cover of a United Nations resolution, although such resolutions can be somewhat dubiously interpreted on occasions. I feel that that is what happened with Iraq.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o257"><a name="70515-0014.htm_para8"><a name="0705166000053">It is also more likely that we shall be involved in the broader tasks that were defined in 1992 as the Petersberg tasks&#151;humanitarian, rescue and peacekeeping tasks, and tasks involving combat forces in crisis management, including peacemaking. In Europe, those tasks are now vested in the EU Council, as well as in NATO. I mention them here because it is rare in modern times for us to deploy our troops outside the framework of an international organisation. We have been involved with NATO in Afghanistan and Kosovo, and with the EU in Bosnia and Macedonia. We are not involved in any major United Nations operations at the moment, but we could have been involved in the recent or ongoing ones in Lebanon and the Congo.</p>

It is also essential to consider this issue in the context of Germany&#146;s history. It was not until 1969 that Germany had an army, following the reconstitution of the Bundeswehr. We should also remind ourselves that there are German forces in Afghanistan, Bosnia and Kosovo. Also, last year, the first German-led military mission was deployed to the Congo&#151;it commanded the EUFOR mission that was deployed there for about four months&#151;and, for the first six months of this year, one of the two EU battle groups on call is under German command and dominated by German forces.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o273"><a name="70515-0014.htm_para24"><a name="0705166000069">The experience of Germany highlights the problems associated with the principle of parliamentary approval. Before each deployment, there is a lengthy debate in the Bundestag and the Bundesrat, and they will decide whether German forces will be deployed, in what operations they will be involved, and what the terms of engagement will be. They also lay down any caveats relating to their forces&#146; operation in the context of a multinational force. They also lay down the conditions that their troops should enjoy. Having visited German troops in a number of theatres, I remember that one provision is that no German soldier should be deployed anywhere in the world unless he has access to exactly the same medical facilities that he would have if he were living at home in Germany. That means that they have some of the most fantastic military field hospitals of any armed forces in the world.</p>

They have an excellent field hospital in Kabul and are involved in provincial reconstruction in the northern, peaceful areas of the country. In the Congo mission, although the operation commander was German, and the largest number of troops deployed were German, no German combat troops were involved&#151;the only combat troops were Spanish and French&#151;despite the Bundeswehr having excellent infantry forces, very good equipment and very good armoured vehicles.

Recently, in Berlin, I asked both the chairman of the Bundestag&#146;s defence committee and the Defence Minister whether, given Germany&#146;s previous experience of taking three months to decide whether to deploy to the Congo, that was possible.

our country or meet our international obligations. We must have careful definitions of peacekeeping and peacemaking. Let us remember that the initial NATO deployment to Afghanistan was as the international security assistance force, whose mission was provincial reconstruction&#151;a fairly innocent-sounding mission, and it was fairly innocent to start with. Our troops who are now committed in the southern part of that country, however, are in anything but an innocent deployment.</p>

On national caveats, if different Parliaments lay down different criteria for their troops to be deployed in multinational missions, that can lead to enormous grievances and problems for military commanders. We must give our commanders in the field the tools to do the job. Parliament must be involved at all stages; its involvement must be essential and not an afterthought. </p>

There are those who still see themselves as subjects of the Crown; I believe that most of my electors see themselves as citizens of a democracy. The Crown prerogative is convenient when immediate actions are required. It should, however, be tempered and controlled. I have reservations about the effectiveness of our armed forces in such circumstances, but I would still support the motion.</p>

trust in the Government to the lowest point. Therefore urgent action is needed; hence the amendment, which I assume will be accepted tonight instead of our motion. </p>

<p><a name="stpa_o281"><a name="70515-0014.htm_para32"><a name="0705166000078">My reservation about the amendment is that it</p>

</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o282"><a name="70515-0014.htm_para33"><a name="0705166000079">Should we hold our breath? When the Chancellor takes over as Prime Minister, will his advisers come round saying, &#147;Prime Minister, is it wise to give Parliament this important power?&#148; We have to wait and see, with a degree of cynicism, whether anything will come of tonight. Certainly I hope that something does come of it, because that will enhance the reputation of Parliament enormously.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o283"><a name="70515-0014.htm_para34"><a name="0705166000080">My other reservation, which has been reflected in many other Members&#146; speeches, is whether the proposal will interfere with the ability of this country and its military to operate properly. Will it handicap our armed forces in action? Clearly, the military must have freedom of action, certainly when engaged in a conflict. Tonight, however, we have heard that changing circumstances could result in further votes. How will those further votes square with giving the military the proper discretion to operate in a conflict zone, if they know that such votes might take away the legitimacy of what they are doing? If, as was suggested in the House tonight, we had another vote on Iraq, and the House voted against continuing engagement there, would not our forces have to be pulled back with a degree of urgency, in an undignified retreat? To make the proposal work, a lot of hurdles need to be overcome.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o284"><a name="70515-0014.htm_para35"><a name="0705166000081">Another hurdle is the intelligence. How will the House come to a properly informed decision unless it is privy to the intelligence? How will it get the intelligence without betraying its source? That seems to be a difficult circle to square, and it is a major problem. People have suggested different ways of dealing with that, such as intelligence committees, but the Opposition will not trust the Government on intelligence, nor will some Labour Members.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o285"><a name="70515-0014.htm_para36"><a name="0705166000082">Another hurdle is deciding whether to implement the proposal through a convention, as the House of Lords Select Committee recommended, or, as others have suggested, through a statute. If we have a statute, there is again a problem, because if British forces are engaged in a conflict, and then Parliament votes that that engagement should cease, does that mean that whatever has happened up to that point becomes unlawful? That is an interesting question for international and other lawyers, of whom I am not one. Given a chance, I would probably prefer the House of Lords Select Committee&#146;s recommendation of a convention, rather than a statute.</p>

Most of the wars that we fight are wars of choice. World war one and world war two, and possibly the Falklands, would be described as wars of necessity, when we had no option but to fight. All the other wars in which we have been involved&#151;we have been involved in more military action than any other country since the second world war&#151;have been wars of choice. In theory that should give Parliament plenty of time in which to debate the issues in the run-up to its decision on whether to take action, but in reality the position is not nearly as clear-cut.</p>

Friend the Member for Richmond, Yorks (Mr. Hague) has long opposed all aspects of the royal prerogative. It is a curious animal. When the Bill of Rights removed the royal prerogative from the King and gave it to the Prime Minister, it gave the Prime Minister more power than the monarch. The monarch depended on Parliament to give him the wherewithal to fight a war; once the removal of the royal prerogative had transferred that right to the Prime Minister, the Prime Minister could deliver not only commitment to the war, but the money and equipment that he needed in order to pursue it. It is curious that history has been slightly misinterpreted in that respect.</p>

They convey politics to a mass audience by personalising the individuals involved. They believe that the grey areas of Parliament such as Committees are of no interest, whereas personality, such as that of the Prime Minister, is important. I consider it most unlikely that we shall ever be able to row back from the presidential era in which we live.</p>

such as the war in Korea, the natural instinct of the British people was to rally around the political leaders and our troops. The Vietnam war changed that hugely, although it did not involve us. It changed the mood in America: people saw the media, and although they were being told that the war was a fight against communism and that the interests of the South Vietnamese Government must be defended, they did not consider that to be a cause worth fighting. They did not think that the South Vietnamese Government were a desirable Government in any case, and trust in what American Presidents were saying to them broke down.

have fought and spoken against abolition as it is proposed today for a long time. In a thesis that I wrote when I was a student at the Royal College of Defence Studies in 2003, at the time of the Iraq war, I went to great lengths to express my view that the royal prerogative was useful&#151;I shall explain why in a moment&#151;and that its abolition in favour of a parliamentary decision to go to war would be altogether retrograde. I advanced the same arguments during a debate about a year ago on the Armed Forces (Parliamentary Approval for Participation in Armed Conflict) Bill, promoted by the right hon. Member for Birmingham, Ladywood (Clare Short), and that has remained my view.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o297"><a name="70515-0015.htm_para10"><a name="0705166000097">As recently as this morning, I contacted the Conservative Whips to tell them that I very much regretted that I would be speaking and voting against the Conservative motion. Rather curiously, had that been the case, I should have found myself speaking and voting also against the Labour amendment. I might have ended up in a minority of one&#151;not a position that would give me any great discomfort, but it would have been difficult.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o298"><a name="70515-0015.htm_para11"><a name="0705166000098">The difficulty that I have encountered is that, having listened carefully to superb speeches by, for instance, my right hon. and learned Friends the Members for Rushcliffe (Mr. Clarke) and for Kensington and Chelsea and my right hon. Friend the Member for Richmond, Yorks, I have increasingly been led by the two central arguments they have advanced to review my dyed-in-the-wool opposition to a parliamentary decision on going to war. The first of those arguments is that the powers of Parliament have been systematically reduced and sidelined by this Government, and that a convention that was introduced to control the over-mighty monarchs of the middle ages has swung so far to the other extreme that we now have an over-mighty Executive.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o299"><a name="70515-0015.htm_para12"><a name="0705166000099">It has been said that Parliament has been sidelined to a significant degree in a variety of areas, of which that of war-making powers is, perhaps, the most significant. That is the case. I accept that the Chancellor says that he is determined to reinvent the powers of Parliament, but there is a powerful series of arguments about what has happened to the powers of Parliament to decide on a variety of matters and how Parliament has progressively become sidelined in recent years. I am also persuaded by the populist argument that of all the things that we do in this place&#151;and of all the things that the nation does&#151;going to war and committing our boys and girls to risking their lives is the most significant, and that it is increasingly an anomaly that this great House of Commons, which is the mother of Parliaments, has no say over whether that should occur. </p>

decision on any form of military deployment whatever to come before the House. That would be bad for a variety of reasons which I shall explain shortly. However, in all our discussions this evening&#151;whether they have been on some statutory obligation to discuss war-making in Parliament or on the parliamentary convention approach proposed by the House of Lords Constitution Committee&#151;we have been talking about a gradual approach, so that there would be flexibility in the use of parliamentary authority for war-making powers rather than a dictatorial or small-minded approach.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o302"><a name="70515-0015.htm_para15"><a name="0705166000102">That is a very important change. In all previous debates on this matter it had been suggested that there would be an absolute requirement that any deployment of troops anywhere in the world would require parliamentary authority. Presumably that would also apply to a significant increase in the number of troops&#151;as has happened in Afghanistan&#151;and to a change in the legitimisation or justification for a war resulting in our wanting to consider bringing troops home from that theatre. I would be wholly opposed to that, as it would hamper our generals and our nation, and it would prevent us from punching above our weight in the world. However, given that we have received assurances from both the Government and Opposition Benches that that would not be the case and that instead there would be a convention or a carefully worded statute that allowed some degree of latitude to the Government and the armed services, I begin to be more persuaded.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o303"><a name="70515-0015.htm_para16"><a name="0705166000103">There are, however, several caveats which we ought to think about extremely carefully. The first is to do with intelligence. There has been considerable debate about the use of intelligence. It is worrying that in the run-up to the vote on the Iraq war significant use of intelligence was made. The Government produced the two dossiers. They were said to be highly secret and intelligent and very important. We now know that much of what was written in them was complete and utter nonsense. Lots of the spin in the newspapers at the time&#151;which came, I understand, not from the Foreign Office or the Ministry of Defence, but from No. 10 Downing street&#151;proved to be completely inaccurate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o304"><a name="70515-0015.htm_para17"><a name="0705166000104">Let us contemplate for a moment why the Government had to go to such lengths to spin the intelligence in the run-up to Iraq. It was not so that they could take part in the war. They had to spin and pervert the intelligence in that way because they knew that they had to win a vote in this House. In other words, the very fact that there was to be a vote meant that the intelligence was not straightforward and easy to understand; it was converted into a justification for the war. That is unhealthy. Some of the suggestions made this evening about possibly using the Intelligence and Security Committee to consider the intelligence, or of employing other means to examine it before committing to war such as by means of a committee of Privy Councillors, offer a way out of that difficulty.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o305"><a name="70515-0015.htm_para18"><a name="0705166000105">However, it should be said that the intelligence that we act on when we go to war is, of course, secret and in most cases if it were revealed to this place or the public we would compromise our intelligence sources, which would be a retrograde step. There must be a way of considering the intelligence, and we must avoid the spinning of it.</p>

 Why does the hon. Gentleman have such low ambitions for this place? We could have a committee appointed not by the Prime Minister but by this place that looks into intelligence on behalf of this House, reports to this House and gives a certificate as to the veracity of the intelligence that it has received and studied.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman&#146;s suggestion is sensible. It might be possible for us to set up some such structure&#151;some form of truly secret committee in this place&#151;to consider the secret intelligence and then to certify the approach to the war. That is a possible approach, although also a difficult one, as it is not easy to imagine how we could construct that. However, we must avoid the spinning and the perversion of intelligence of 2003.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o306"><a name="70515-0015.htm_para19"><a name="0705166000108">The hon. Member for Broxtowe (Dr. Palmer) suggested that the public were at the time of the vote on Iraq very much in favour of the invasion. That is incorrect: 75 per cent of the people of this country were against an invasion of Iraq on the day on which we voted. That is in contrast to the situation in respect of Afghanistan; 70 per cent. of people were in favour of that deployment. The Government, faced by a difficult vote when they knew that the people were opposed, had to spin the intelligence in order to justify the deployment. In other words, an unpopular war requires greater spinning, particularly if there is to be a vote, but a popular war which is acceptable to the people, such as all the others, did not require that. Therefore, if we are to go down this route, there is an important question to be asked about the way that intelligence is used.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o307"><a name="70515-0015.htm_para20"><a name="0705166000109">We must also think about the way in which the armed services react to this place. I did not agree with the hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy (Mr. Llwyd), who suggested that the armed services deployed in the field were significantly questioning the reasoning behind the Iraq war. That is not my experience from talking to the armed services. They say that they are ready to do their jobs and that people cleverer than them in this place have decided that we should carry out such operations. I have not come across generals or regular soldiers saying that they thought that the war was unpopular and that they wished they were not there. They are glad to be there, and to be doing a professional job. However, if every aspect of a deployment to a theatre of war were governed not by the Executive but by this place, and if there were detailed discussions in this place, that would encourage those deployed increasingly to question why they were in that theatre of war. There would be constant debates in this place about the rightness or wrongness of a particular war, which would encourage people to question it. I am concerned about the politicisation of warfare that might result.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o309"><a name="70515-0015.htm_para22"><a name="0705166000111">The Opposition in question, behind by only one vote, would surely be strongly tempted to oppose the war because they would believe that they might just embarrass, or even defeat, the Government. If that Government said that they wanted a war, presumably the Opposition would see an opportunity to pick off one or two Government Back Benchers&#151;thereby defeating the Government on the central question of going to war, for goodness&#146; sake&#151;as a highly attractive proposition. In other words, an issue that ought to be dealt with through statesmanship would have been party politicised. That is another extremely difficult problem. We would need to find a way under the proposed procedure of establishing that where reasonable consensus exists on the question of going to war there should be a vote, while recognising that if there is a lack of consensus it might be much more difficult to do that. Reversion to some form of Executive prerogative, rather than royal prerogative, might be necessary.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o310"><a name="70515-0015.htm_para23"><a name="0705166000112">We have touched briefly on emergencies and of course, if there is an incoming intercontinental ballistic missile, no one would suggest that there should be a vote in the House of Commons on whether we should shoot it down. That is fairly obvious, and the Executive would of course have the authority to shoot it down, but what about less dramatic but none the less important emergencies? There are a variety of situations, such as the no-fly zone in Iraq, on which an immediate decision by the Executive is important for the sake of the peace of the world. A decision by this place, especially if it involved intelligence committees and so forth, would take quite a long time to reach.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o311"><a name="70515-0015.htm_para24"><a name="0705166000113">The sinking of the Belgrano springs to mind as an illustration of whether it was right for a Prime Minister to take such a decision. The Prime Minister of the day decided to sink the Belgrano and many people think that that was the wrong decision&#151;I believe that it was the right one&#151;but if this place had been asked whether to sink it, the ship would have been at the north pole before we had even begun to discuss the issue. There are many situations that need an urgent decision, and it would not be right to leave them to this place. What would happen, moreover, when we took part in United Nations or NATO operations or&#151;heaven forfend, from my standpoint&#151;if we took part in an EU operation? Might there be circumstances in which the UN or NATO sought to deploy British troops, but this place decided not to? Whom would the generals obey&#151;their NATO commander or this place? That is a difficult issue that needs to be considered carefully.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o312"><a name="70515-0015.htm_para25"><a name="0705166000114">So, although I am persuaded that the removal of parliamentary powers that we have witnessed in the past 10 years probably ought to lead us to seek to restore them by some reduction in royal prerogative, and although I am persuaded that the worry of committing our people to war is so huge that such a decision ought to be taken in this place, I none the less have very real reservations about the proposal and its operation in practice.

 I apologise again to the Chair, Mr. Deputy Speaker, for being unable to be here for the opening exchanges. I am interested in this issue, and there are two reasons why I was unable to be here, both of which are relevant. First, I had to go earlier today to the military funeral of a young man called Simon Davison, a constituent of mine who was killed in Afghanistan last week. As many Members know, such occasions bring home to us the responsibility that we feel for the circumstances that produce the tragic death of brave young men such as Simon. My feeling that I should share some direct responsibility for such occasions was reinforced by the fact that Simon&#146;s family and the local community would expect their political representative to be involved in some way in the decisions that produced the consequences. I felt that I should be involved and that I should be held to account for the things that I had done. That event simply brought home to me the importance of the general issue that we are discussing.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o314"><a name="70515-0015.htm_para27"><a name="0705166000117">The second reason for an apology is that the Public Administration Committee, which I chair, was meeting this afternoon, so I could not be here earlier. As is stated in the motion and the amendment, it was a report from our Committee in 2004, &#147;Taming the Prerogative&#148;, which first systematically drew Parliament&#146;s attention to the need to tackle prerogative powers. We identified the areas that we thought needed the most urgent attention, and war-making powers were at the top of our list. They were not the only item. We also talked about, for example, the approval of treaties.</p>

What history tells us, and what we tried to say in the report three years ago, is that it is among the peculiarities of our history&#151;in some ways, the blessings of our history&#151;that we have not, in some considerable time, had to sit down and work out what kind of political system we want or what kind of political people we want to be. We have never had to devise a new constitution, or indeed any kind of codified constitution, never having been successfully invaded or having had a successful revolution in modern times. We have never had to undertake the kind of political enterprise that other countries have had to do, so we have never had to confront what has happened in our history, which is&#151;among all the  <br>

blessings of broad stability and gradual change&#151;that powers that used to reside with monarchs have been transferred lock, stock and barrel to modern Executives. That is the running thread of our history. We come now, late in the day, to try to put Parliament back into the picture. We are doing that on several fronts, with some success.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o316"><a name="70515-0016.htm_para1"><a name="0705166000119">It was only a little while ago that I made the case that it was a constitutional anomaly that the Prime Minister did not account to a Committee of this House in the way that other Ministers did. Through our Committee, and then through the Liaison Committee, I entered into correspondence with Downing street about that. I used to get letters back&#151;we published them&#151;that told me that it was constitutionally impossible and went against all the conventions for the Prime Minister to attend on a Committee of this House. When Robin Cook was Leader of the House, he memorably asked me to stop going on about the issue, because the Prime Minister would never agree to it. The following week came the announcement that the Prime Minister would attend twice a year to give evidence before the Liaison Committee.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o317"><a name="70515-0016.htm_para2"><a name="0705166000120">We can see in that process a convention in the making. One day, it was constitutionally impossible and offended against all our traditions; then it happened; and now it is inconceivable that any future Prime Minister would not attend on the Liaison Committee. That is how we make constitutional change, but it is hard because we do not do it from first principles or a blank piece of paper. We come at the problem from this point in history, when we are trying to insert Parliament back into a war-making powers process. That is a process from which it has been excluded, inappropriately, for a long time.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o318"><a name="70515-0016.htm_para3"><a name="0705166000121">I agree with everyone who has said that the matter requires very careful consideration. We need to get it right. There are arguments about whether it is better to use law or convention, but, in some ways, as long as we get a strong and proper mechanism, that does not matter greatly.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o319"><a name="70515-0016.htm_para4"><a name="0705166000122">This debate is part of a process that has been going on for some time. We are embracing these matters for particular local and immediate reasons, but my right hon. Friend the Leader of the House was writing about the need to review prerogative powers 20 years ago. In those days, the Labour party was not routinely in government: as we have become so, of course, our interest in these matters has waned. When the PAC report appeared three years ago, neither the House nor the Government was terribly interested in what it said. </p>

<p><a name="stpa_o320"><a name="70515-0016.htm_para5"><a name="0705166000123">In the wake of the Iraq vote, my right hon. Friend the Leader of the House was asked, in the House, whether Parliament&#146;s vote on the war had created a precedent. I do not remember his exact words, but he said something to the effect that, yes, he agreed that a precedent had been created. My right hon. Friend is a former Foreign Secretary, so when he says that a precedent has been created, we are well on the way to getting either a convention or a law. That is how this place works.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o321"><a name="70515-0016.htm_para6"><a name="0705166000124">As I was not here earlier, it is only fair that I should be brief, so I shall end by saying that the change that we are discussing is not in Parliament&#146;s interest alone. It is constitutionally proper that Parliament should be inserted into the process, and it is good to see support for that general principle, even though people have worries about how it might work.</p>

I spoke earlier about attending a funeral this morning, and I believe that it is no longer possible to send people to war without their representative institution having some say in the process. The argument is as fundamental as that: given how contentious the 2003 vote on Iraq was, can anyone imagine what it would have been like if the Government had decided to go to war without a vote in this place?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o323"><a name="70515-0016.htm_para8"><a name="0705166000126">I voted against the Iraq invasion. People sometimes say to me that I must be very pleased about that, but I am not. What has happened gives me no pleasure: I wanted Iraq to be a stable democracy by now, and I regret hugely the fact that it has all gone so bitterly wrong.

 The right hon. and learned Member for Rushcliffe (Mr. Clarke) commented that he was happy to hear all the believers who were speaking in the debate, but that he was even happier that so many unbelievers had repented&#151;presumably before the debate, although we have even heard Members confessing that they have seen the light during it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o325"><a name="70515-0016.htm_para10"><a name="0705166000129">I remain one of the doubters. That is not a natural position for me, because knowing that as a member of a minority party I shall always be confined to the Back Benches I obviously have an interest in an increased role for Parliament. Furthermore, my natural distrust of the Executive has been reinforced by some of their decisions and behaviour over the years, so I believe that there is a need to pull power back to Parliament, as the hon.

sometimes things change. Initially, troops may have been sent as peacekeepers or to help in a disaster or a rescue mission, but the situation escalates. When troops are sucked into such situations, must they wait for Parliament&#146;s permission before they react, or should military action be taken without Parliament&#146;s approval?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o329"><a name="70515-0016.htm_para14"><a name="0705166000133">It has been suggested that only a substantial deployment should need a vote in Parliament, but it was not clear whether the deployment should be substantial in terms of manpower or firepower. Initially, an intervention might require few troops, but events could escalate. At what stage is the vote to be taken? If such a vote is required by law and military action is taken without it, what will be the legal implications for the people who take part in the action? As Iraq has shown us, lawyers are always happy to intervene and put soldiers through the court system.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o330"><a name="70515-0016.htm_para15"><a name="0705166000134">Even where it is possible to have a vote, there is still the question of when the vote should be taken and there has been considerable debate in the House about that today. If we take it too early, we are provoking a situation; if we take it too late, it is a fait accompli. It is quite clear that some of those who describe themselves as believers, or as sinners who have come to repentance, still have some doubts about the circumstances in which the vote should be taken, even if they agree on the principle of the vote.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o331"><a name="70515-0016.htm_para16"><a name="0705166000135">Another doubt that I have is about the basis on which the decision would be made. The right hon. and learned Member for Rushcliffe quite rightly said that the decision must be taken in full knowledge of all the relevant information. The relevant pieces of information that he suggested included the legal opinion. But even he had to concede that, if the full legal opinion were to be made available, the Attorney-General might well be reticent about giving it. He might draw back when thinking about some of the information he could give. The right hon. and learned Gentleman came to the conclusion that perhaps only the conclusions of the legal opinion should be made available. So, although we started off by saying that we need full knowledge to make a decision, we reached a situation in which we would be given the conclusions of the legal opinion.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o332"><a name="70515-0016.htm_para17"><a name="0705166000136">Another point that was made was that the decision should be made on the basis of the raw intelligence data. Other Members&#151;even those who support the proposal&#151;have said that at times it will not be possible to have the full intelligence, because it may compromise sources and the work that we are already doing on the ground. The hon. Member for North Wiltshire (Mr. Gray) said that the more important the decision, the less willing the Government may be to hand over the intelligence or the more likely it may be that the intelligence will be spun. If a decision is sought simply to get the view of Parliament, rather than to get approval for a war, perhaps there will be less reticence about giving the intelligence. But if we are talking about a crucial decision&#151;a decision to approve a war&#151;it becomes more important that the Government get the right decision and so the intelligence might be spun or curtailed in some way.</p>

difficulties that a vote in the House is likely to create when it comes to having the full information. There were also some doubts among the believers about the motion that should be put before the House. Some said that the motion should be as short as possible; others said that the motion should be as long as possible. The longer the motion, the greater the justification that will be contained within it. If one of the reasons given for going to war is shown not to pertain any longer, does that call into question the decision and does it provide a chance for the debate to be rerun?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o334"><a name="70515-0016.htm_para19"><a name="0705166000138">That brings me to the last point that I want to make. How often should the vote take place? Would it simply take place at the very start, whenever that start happened to be&#151;and at the moment, that is not clear&#151;or, as the right hon. and learned Member for Rushcliffe said, must there be ratification of the approval should circumstances change? What constitutes a change in circumstances could vary. For example, the circumstances might change in relation to the original reasons given in the motion that was put before the House. Of course, the longer the motion, the more justification there will be and the more opportunity there is to say that circumstances have changed. Alternatively, a change in circumstances could mean a change in the pace or the nature of the military intervention. If the change was to the pace or nature of the military intervention, would we be starting to intervene in operational and command decisions, and would that be good for the security of the troops or the execution of the war? Indeed, is the House qualified to make such an intervention?</p>

 The hon. Gentleman makes an important point that has been raised several times during the debate. We accept that we would not need to use the extra powers regularly because the House is able to pass judgment on operations without such a substantive motion. The Chamberlain Government were brought down by a motion that was non-substantive, yet none the less lethal.</p>

 I accept the hon. Gentleman&#146;s interpretation. However, that is not the universal view of those who have spoken in the debate. This is an aspect of the proposals that will need to be cleared up before an honest doubter can take a firm decision on them.</p>

 It is a pleasure to participate in this historic occasion. We are seeing the genesis of a major change to the decision-making process through which the UK mobilises its armed forces. Hon.

In this day and age, it seems inconceivable that we should have a royal prerogative that is so out of date. Democratic accountability seems to be missing from the Government, so I am pleased that Parliament is being invited to participate in the decision-making process. As we have heard, the issues that we are discussing stem from the Bill of Rights, which was written way back in 1688, and which transferred a number of powers directly from the monarch to Ministers. I am pleased that we are witnessing the beginning of a change that will result in Parliament scrutinising the decision to go to war. While debating the motion, we should consider the detail of the issue. There is now a blur between war-fighting and peacekeeping. Interventions are rarely bilateral; they are multilateral, so we have to ask ourselves detailed questions about the decisions that Parliament might need to take.</p>

Minister&#146;s grip on him is slowly loosening, and another hand is now grabbing him and turning him a different way.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o341"><a name="70515-0016.htm_para26"><a name="0705166000148">It is worth reminding ourselves that the term &#147;war&#148;, as defined by the Geneva conventions of 1949, is no longer used. The last time that Britain actually went to war was in 1942, against Siam. We no longer use that term simply because of the legalities. War is a state that the nation is in, and it is too complicated for us to go down that route. It involves dealing with diplomats and embassies and that treaties have to be reconsidered. It also raises the issue of enemy aliens and what to do with citizens of an enemy country who are in the UK.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o342"><a name="70515-0016.htm_para27"><a name="0705166000149">The UK has been involved in a number of operations over the past 10 years. We have made 60 deployments and been involved in five major conflicts. It is worth considering some of those conflicts as they show us that the prevailing tendency has been to seek Parliament&#146;s support when deciding whether to commit troops. We heard how, in the case of world war two, a motion was put before the House by Neville Chamberlain, and it was carried. Before the Korean war in 1950, a statement was made in which UK troops were offered to support US troops. That was actually a retrospective debate, but Parliament was nevertheless able to voice its views.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o343"><a name="70515-0016.htm_para28"><a name="0705166000150">On the Falklands, as has been said, the House was recalled for an Adjournment debate in April 1982. There was no vote, although there were plenty of statements, but it is worth reminding the House that there was no call for a vote. If there had been a call for a vote from any corner of the House, I am sure that the usual channels of the day would have allowed one, but clearly the view of the House was so unified that a vote was not seen as necessary. Hostilities in the Gulf war began on 17 January 1991, but a motion was put to the House four days later. We may be a bit late in getting motions agreed to, but there is certainly a precedent for Parliament commenting on our involvement in armed conflict. Kosovo has also been mentioned today. Hostilities began on 24 March 1999, but again there was no vote, and no vote was requested.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o344"><a name="70515-0016.htm_para29"><a name="0705166000151">It is when we come to Iraq that things get a little more confusing. There was a plethora of votes on Iraq, including in September 2002 and in February 2003. There was also the main vote of 18 March 2003, which committed the United Kingdom to war with Iraq, and which has been mentioned time and again. I have scrutinised the motion, and what it actually did was endorse the findings of UN resolution 1441. It also mentioned resolution 678. That resolution was written 12 years before the March 2003 motion, so the justification for war went back an awfully long way.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o345"><a name="70515-0016.htm_para30"><a name="0705166000152">At the time, we had 45,000 troops on the border ready to move across when the green light was given. If we are to scrutinise the decision to go to war, there should be a clearer motion endorsing what we intend to do, rather than some ambiguous call leaning on a series of UN resolutions, some of which are more than a decade old. The motion on 18 March 2003 leaned heavily on out-of-date material. That needs to be rectified. Better crafted motions should be tabled, which look forward rather than back, and state that if conditions do not change within a set period Britain will go into conflict with another nation.</p>

I pointed out to the Leader of the House in an intervention that not only the House but the country was misled by the limited amount of information made available. There was too much spin involved. The Alastair Campbells of this world should have no place in changing the advice given by our intelligence and security community. They were not happy with certain documents, which were slid back across the table with the instruction to emphasise other aspects of the reports. That is out of order and should never happen again.</p>

Members to vote in favour was the 45-minute claim and that somehow Cyprus, one of our sovereign bases, may possibly have come under attack. We know that that is not the case. As we move forward with the proposals, I should like to see proposals to ensure that we are never led down that road again. The information that is available to the Cabinet should be made available to other bodies as well.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman makes a valid point, which is the main thrust of my speech. If he waits a moment, I shall come to that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o348"><a name="70515-0017.htm_para2"><a name="0705166000157">There was some shameful spinning of the facts in order to justify war. Many will say that we would have gone to war anyway, because it had been decided that there was justification. Either way, we did it in a manner that alienated many of our allies. Again, that is an experience that we should never repeat.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o349"><a name="70515-0017.htm_para3"><a name="0705166000158">Let us suppose that the vote has taken place and the decision to go to war has been made&#151;I now come to the hon. Gentleman&#146;s point. The actual war with Iraq is only half the story. I was frustrated by some of the comments today that the vote on 18 March 2003 is the cause of the mayhem today. That is absolutely wrong. Our boys, the Americans and all the allies did their job in the fortnight after battle commenced and the country liberated. What followed was four years of a mess being created in a country that is now on the brink of civil war. If we are to make a decision to go to war, may we also have some form of scrutiny of the peacekeeping that follows?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o350"><a name="70515-0017.htm_para4"><a name="0705166000159">I repeat what I said in an earlier intervention&#151;had we had a suitable plan after the war to lift Iraq off its knees , sorted out the Ba&#146;ath army, dealt with the infrastructure, looked after the oil wells and got them working to provide income for the country, it is possible that we would not be having this debate today. I would even go so far as to say that the Prime Minister would not be forced out of office, as he is. It is not the fault of the military. My regiment, the Royal Green Jackets, now The Rifles, is currently based in Basra and working extremely hard. We should pay tribute to the hard work that all our forces are doing. However, if we ask them what frustrates them, they say that it is their belief that the blueprint for Iraq is questionable. They  <br>

did their job at the beginning by liberating the country, and then we had a blank canvas to do something with. That has been a wasted opportunity. I recommend Bob Woodward&#146;s book, &#147;State of Denial&#148;, which goes through the details of some of the decision making that took place on both sides of the Atlantic and perhaps brought us to the questionable position that we are in today.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o351"><a name="70515-0017.htm_para5"><a name="0705166000160">We must first be able to scrutinise the decision to go to war, but then, even if we disagree with it, we must accept it, put it behind us, and look at what we are doing to manage the peace. We have alienated our friends and lost hearts and minds because of the manner in which we have gone about our business. Britain is very good at winning over hearts and minds; we have a fantastic reputation around the world for making friends in a peacekeeping role. I cannot say the same for the Americans, who have lots to learn about befriending a nation that they are going into and being seen as liberators, not occupiers. I would like further scrutiny of that issue. Four years after the invasion, we are still debating it endlessly and there are concerns about the direction in which we are going. Most importantly, we are now looking at an exit strategy. Members on both sides of the House have said that we should withdraw. I would be uncomfortable with that because it would deny people the help that we promised them, but we need to look back at the blueprint and ask what we can do to improve the situation. The policy is failing and Parliament needs more scrutiny over why that is so. I am less angry about the decision to go to war than about the failure to keep the peace.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o352"><a name="70515-0017.htm_para6"><a name="0705166000161">Part of this debate must concern our capacity to help. My hon. Friend the Member for Woodspring (Dr. Fox) has spoken time and again about the problems of overstretch that British forces face. We need to be careful about committing ourselves across the world, sometimes without the support of our NATO or Commonwealth allies, when we simply do not have the troops or the military support. If, as the Prime Minister suggested on 17 January on HMS Albion, we are to stand up and be counted when other nations are reticent in defending democracy, we also need to protect our soldiers, sailors and airmen and invest in the services and support that they need. We are failing to do that, and the consequence is the overstretch and effect on morale in our armed forces. In Iraq, that attitude of going it alone was one of the reasons for the loss of faith among many of our friends in Europe. Had we had a decent resolution in the UN, we would have gone into Iraq with more support, and therefore more help would have been available in the peacekeeping operation afterwards.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o353"><a name="70515-0017.htm_para7"><a name="0705166000162">On the proposal to change the royal prerogative, there are lessons to be learned from what other countries have been doing. Canada has a very similar system to ours, but the Government have promised to offer a vote whenever troops are committed. In Holland, as we heard from my hon. Friend the Member for North Dorset (Mr. Walter), there is a new requirement to keep Parliament informed, but that has caused huge delays in the commitment of troops to Afghanistan.</p>

between Congress and the President, who is commander-in-chief, over who has the ultimate power to wage war and who holds the purse strings governing the length of time the country can be committed to a particular war. It is not doing the morale of the forces in Iraq any good to see that tension in the Capitol.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o355"><a name="70515-0017.htm_para9"><a name="0705166000164">France, under its constitution of 1958, can declare war only if authorised by Parliament, but circumnavigates that by getting involved in international operations that have a different label. Germany is a great example that we must consider because there the authority is very much bestowed on the Bundestag&#151;the German Parliament. However, anyone who has visited Afghanistan will realise that the caveats that are imposed on German troops hinder them to the point that we question the reason for their presence from a military perspective. They do some work in provincial reconstruction teams, but they refuse to go out at night because their Parliament has told them that they cannot. How can troops who are part of an international security assistance force have such limitations, which do not apply to the rest of the force, imposed on them? It means that they guard the various bases but never wander out and get involved in operations. On paper, it appears as though there are 36,000 troops in Afghanistan, but only 15,000 are actually committed, with another 20,000 or so bound by so many caveats that their value is questionable.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o356"><a name="70515-0017.htm_para10"><a name="0705166000165">Parliament must consider the sort of peacekeeping roles on which we would want to vote. Do we want to vote on peace enforcement, conflict resolution or multinational humanitarian relief? Bearing mission creep in mind, we need to be aware of how often we must recall the issues to Parliament to measure our success or ascertain whether things are getting out of control.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o357"><a name="70515-0017.htm_para11"><a name="0705166000166">Let us consider the example of Afghanistan. In October 2001, the US and Britain began their air strikes. By 7 December, the last Taliban stronghold in Kandahar fell. On 5 December, the Afghan groups agreed a deal in Bonn on an interim Government and all seemed well. By January 2002, the first contingent of foreign peacekeepers&#151;not war-fighters&#151;were in place. At what stage might Parliament vote? Should there be two votes&#151;one on the initial onslaught and another on the peacekeeping? Of course, the story was incomplete because four years later, in 2005, we moved into Helmand province. Should that have required a vote? The Defence Secretary at the time said&#151;words he probably now regrets&#151;that we would probably not fire a shot. Subsequent deployments on the scale of a division have gone to Afghanistan. I fully support that, but the question for Parliament is the stage at which we vote. The mission has expanded comprehensively from the peacekeeping operation that began in January 2002. The same question that we ask about Iraq applies to Afghanistan: have we got it right? Is the blueprint for success in Afghanistan working? There are some serious questions that are beyond the scope of the debate. Parliament should be able to debate such matters. Currently, we do not have the ability to scrutinise what happens.</p>

from Defence questions yesterday that the British have different rules of engagement from the US in the Shatt al-Arab waterway. That needs to be rectified. There are legal questions, which could result in soldiers being unsure of where they stand in international law.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o359"><a name="70515-0017.htm_para13"><a name="0705166000168">We need proper information. There is a concern that we could end up being armchair generals. We like discussing such issues but we rely heavily on the information that the Government provide, what we find out for ourselves or what the media tell us. That is all very well if we are considering hospitals or schools because I can visit my local school or hospital and glean the information for myself. However, it is difficult for Back Benchers to visit the sort of places that we are discussing and fully comprehend what is happening. The information from the Government, especially the intelligence and security services, must be correct, accurate, up to date and unspun. Should the Defence Committee and the Intelligence and Security Committee be allowed to read more detailed reports? A key issue is sharing information so that Parliament can make informed decisions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o360"><a name="70515-0017.htm_para14"><a name="0705166000169">I am worried about retrospective decision making. In the case of escalation of conflict and mission creep, how far back do we go to confirm what has happened? Should there be UN approval? There can also be ambiguities about the type of conflict being entered into. How prisoners should be dealt with is another issue. The question can also be put the other way round: if Governments can come to Parliament to confirm that they can go to war, can Parliament go to the Government to request war? If I tabled an early-day motion that called for Mugabe to be taken out with a single bullet, I would doubtless get quite a few signatures. Would the Government then be expected to react to that or would such powers not exist? I think I know the answer to that one, but it is an issue that we need to raise.</p>

Conflicts are now very much under the microscope and are followed in minute detail. We have 24-hour coverage and the country&#146;s citizens are far more informed and opinionated than ever before. It is important that Governments are held to account. I very much support the motion and I look forward to seeing the detailed proposals that will now follow&#151;whether they be in the form of a convention or a statute. British involvement in international conflicts will, of course, continue&#151;but, I hope, only after better scrutiny by this House.</p>

I say that because committing our armed forces, in my view, justifies the full-hearted consent of both Parliament and people. Indeed, the people&#146;s will is expressed through this Parliament. When we take a decision about deployment, we need to do it with full knowledge and full consent because it is such a grave matter. I certainly support the idea of a statute that lays down the ground rules for this House of Commons to approve deployment. Implicit in that is the fact that provision must be made for the continued deployment to be scrutinised and reviewed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o363"><a name="70515-0017.htm_para17"><a name="0705166000173">One of the flaws in existing arrangements is that there has been no reaffirming vote for the deployment of our troops in Iraq. I am quite sure that the House would reaffirm it, because, irrespective of our views on the original decision, we all understand the constraints. It seems to me healthy for democracy that that should happen. If, in extreme circumstances, there were a need to withdraw or retreat&#151;heaven forbid, to cut our losses&#151;that too should be done through Parliament.</p>

That is pertinent, but I would like to draw the House&#146;s attention to the fact that 67 years ago yesterday, there was a vote in this House on the prosecution of a war. We had been at war for a year, but the principle of reaffirming our resolve was upheld here and, indeed, there was a Division of the House. I checked the <i> Official Report</i> and found that the motion was carried by 381 votes to nil&#151;but there was a Division nevertheless. The motion before the House was to confirm the new coalition Government, but it went on to say that this House</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o365"><a name="70515-0017.htm_para19"><a name="0705166000175">It set out the House&#146;s view, demonstrating the will of the country, on what should happen, giving a mandate to Winston Churchill and his coalition Government to prosecute the war with Germany to that victorious conclusion.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o366"><a name="70515-0017.htm_para20"><a name="0705166000176">I always think that one of the modern-day miracles happened in those critical hours in May 1940 when George VI appointed Churchill rather than Halifax, because Halifax could have used the royal prerogative to come to terms with Germany. It is a matter of fact that he, and many other good people, thought that they might have to cut their losses, and they would have used the royal prerogative to do so. They would not have come to the House of Commons to review the matter. What eventually happened would not have taken place but for Churchill&#146;s initiative of bringing that motion to the House of Commons and getting it ratified by a Division.</p>

We should not lose sight of the fact that that was an important occasion, not only giving him legitimacy but helping things on. In contrast, let us consider how King Leopold used the royal prerogative to capitulate without going to the Belgian Parliament. The hon. Member for North Dorset (Mr. Walter) mentioned the Belgian constitution in his speech earlier. There are good reasons why we should learn from history, because the idea that we are debating tonight has proved a worthwhile tool in promoting our national interests at the most critical times.</p>

As a member of the Foreign Affairs Committee, I thought that it was incumbent on the Committee to ask questions about the ground rules of the deployment, the rules of engagement and the relationship with Sandline and other private military companies&#151;I call them mercenaries. That inquiry was most unwelcome. It is a matter of fact that enormous pressure was put on the Foreign Affairs Committee&#151;including my hon. Friend the Member for Hackney, North and Stoke Newington (Ms Abbott) and me&#151;not to inquire into the matter. The Government assumed that if we were making such inquiries, we must be opposed to their policy. It worried me deeply that because we were inquiring about the ground rules and the reasons for the deployment, we were thought to be opposed to them. I just wanted to know what was going on.</p>

I also remember being away with two colleagues whom I like and respect very much, but when I went on television to say that the matter should go before the House of Commons, they told me that I was completely mad.

Parliament&#151;not a committee of parliamentarians, and not the so-called Intelligence and Security Committee, which is not a Committee of Parliament but is appointed by the Prime Minister to judge his own stewardship of such matters, which is wholly unsatisfactory.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o372"><a name="70515-0017.htm_para26"><a name="0705166000182">As part and parcel of the proposals tonight, we need to ensure that we have a parliamentary Committee, which would be highly responsible, which we will choose, and which realises that its knowledge could be critical to the lives of our service personnel. We should have that high ambition for Parliament: we should judge the verification of intelligence. Equally, we need to know about the legality of any deployment of our armed forces from an authority separate from a Law Officer who is a Minister of the Crown.</p>

The good guys won.&#148; I like the good guys to win, too, but we needed to know what the mischief was in the first place, and what the relationship was between our armed forces and Sandline&#151;an unhealthy situation. That was never disclosed, however, to the House of Commons.</p>

As many other Members have said, when we look at the differences between the amendment and the motion we see that we are dancing on the head of a pin. I rejoice in the conversion both of those on the Conservative Front Bench and, more importantly, of the people currently in government, who have stewardship of the principle. I do not, however, want to be deceived. I want to be sure that this is not a way of getting over a particular difficulty. I want written down in tablets of stone the ground rules by which we deploy and protect our armed forces, and by which Parliament reviews their deployment.</p>

I support the amendment, although it is a little silly&#151;this is occasionally a silly place&#151;that we do not have an agreed motion.</p>

 I can think of no greater and more important decision for the national interest than to go to war. It affects the lives of those whom we represent, the young people of this country.

The first was the Falklands. I remember collecting money from pubs across my constituency and sending cheques to the Ministry of Defence. We knew that that conflict had the assent of the people. The first Gulf war also had the assent of the people. The second Gulf war&#151;the one that has brought us here to discuss this motion today&#151;has been more equivocal.</p>

It can, in truth, only be the representatives of those who sent us here: ourselves, the House of Commons. We must say that we are prepared to go to war, that taxation shall be raised if necessary, and young people shall lose their lives if necessary. Therefore the principle must be a very great one, and the clarity with which we commit the resources of this nation must be affirmed. That is what the motion and the amendment are about.</p>

It covered the ground in relation to the difficulties of capturing the prerogative power. The War Powers Act in the United States and the Canadian approach are relevant instances. We seem somehow to be trapped in an imperial past when the very notion of the imperium was itself sufficient to justify any and every war&#151;but we are no longer in that age. As my hon. Friend the Member for Bournemouth, East (Mr. Ellwood) said, this is a world of instant communication. We know the details now.</p>

Such action hangs on judgment, and that judgment should not reside in the hands of one person, who knows only what he or she believes. We must reach out and affirm what the House believes is right for our country.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o382"><a name="70515-0018.htm_para6"><a name="0705166000196">Why did we table the motion? It was for a number of reasons. My right hon. Friend the Member for Richmond, Yorks (Mr. Hague), the shadow Foreign Secretary, said that in recent history a wide range of parliamentary mechanisms had been used to confer legitimacy on military action, but that what was generally used was the mechanism that was least inconvenient to the Government of the day.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o383"><a name="70515-0018.htm_para7"><a name="0705166000197">It is merely stating the obvious to say that the process in which we are involved today has been given impetus by the disquiet surrounding the current Government&#146;s handling of the run-up to the war in Iraq&#151;a subject mentioned by many Members today&#151;but there have also been positive drivers of that process. Both my right hon. Friend and the Leader of the House spoke of their long-standing personal commitment to improving the standing of Parliament. For my own part, I have long believed that the power to conclude treaties should be exercised ultimately through Parliament, and also that we should find better ways of holding our judges to account.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o384"><a name="70515-0018.htm_para8"><a name="0705166000198">As was pointed out by my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Rushcliffe (Mr. Clarke), the debate has given us an opportunity to make a significant constitutional change. What we have witnessed in recent decades is nothing less than the asset-stripping of Parliament. We have seen powers systematically taken to the Executive. We have seen powers taken to Europe. We have seen powers given away under human rights and devolution legislation. Today&#146;s debate has been a small, but none the less significant, attempt to start to take powers back to the House of Commons.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o385"><a name="70515-0018.htm_para9"><a name="0705166000199">That brings me to the motion and the Government&#146;s approach. In essence, the Government have already accepted the case presented in the Opposition motion. It is a shame that the Government felt that they needed to table an amendment, in what was a Pavlovian party political step.</p>

<p><a name="st_o281"><a name="0705166000200"><a name="70515-0018.htm_spnew3"><a name="0705166000935"><b>Dr. Julian Lewis (New Forest, East) (Con):</b>
 What a surprise!</p>

<p><a name="st_o282"><a name="0705166000201"><a name="70515-0018.htm_spnew4"><a name="0705166000936"><b>Dr. Fox:</b>
 I am in a kind and gentle mood, so my hon. Friend should not tempt me to go further. It was amazing, however, to hear the Leader of the House admitting that the Government had written their amendment before they saw the Opposition motion, and saying that the excuse for that was that the Opposition were late tabling the motion. Such creative interpretation of the facts was wonderful, even coming from the Leader of the House whose current job is to unveil the Chancellor&#146;s previously unknown waterfall of charm, warmth and humanity.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o386"><a name="70515-0018.htm_para10"><a name="0705166000202">It is also interesting that the Government have seemingly changed their position so rapidly. Merely two weeks ago the Lord Chancellor said that there was no need to change the Government&#146;s position and that it would, in fact, be dangerous to do so. With his usual deftness, the Leader of the House remarked that the Lord works in mysterious ways. Presumably the Lord he was referring to was the Lord Chancellor whose political career under the current Prime Minister has defied gravity, but for whom intimations of mortality  <br>

beckon under his successor. However, we are witnessing a welcome move towards a new parliamentary consensus on what is a very important issue.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o387"><a name="70515-0018.htm_para11"><a name="0705166000203">A number of legitimate questions have been raised about the general approach put forward today. Will it weaken or strengthen the country at a time of threat? May we have adequate definitions of terms such as &#147;substantial&#148; in relation to deployments? Will it interfere with the freedom of commanders and the conduct of war? Will it conflict with other treaty obligations? Should there be legislation or convention, and in either case how should it be done? Finally, is the change necessary at all? Let me deal with those questions in turn.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o388"><a name="70515-0018.htm_para12"><a name="0705166000204">Once Parliament makes a decision, what should happen subsequently? Many Members raised that issue. Should there be a requirement for a compulsory later endorsement of the position? That point was raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough (Mr. Leigh) in his powerful and passionate speech. He argued that Parliament needs to be able to revisit our troop deployment in Iraq. Several other Members agreed with that. The question was also dealt with particularly well and in detail by the hon. Member for Broxtowe (Dr. Palmer) in a thoughtful speech. Ultimately, Parliament cannot be stopped from voting on anything that Parliament wants to vote on. We have numerous mechanisms for achieving that. The question is whether Parliament should be able to interfere with operations under way&#151;which would, of course, be very destabilising. The answer to the question was well put in another question asked by my hon. Friend the Member for North Essex (Mr. Jenkin). He pointed out that Chamberlain&#146;s Government fell as a result of a non-substantive, but ultimately lethal, motion.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o389"><a name="70515-0018.htm_para13"><a name="0705166000205">Once a Government have begun to prosecute a military campaign, they require to continue to command a majority in the House of Commons to govern. That is the ultimate safeguard that we have. Any substantive motion suddenly to pull out of Iraq would not command a majority of the House even at this time, and that in itself gives the Government credibility and legitimacy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o390"><a name="70515-0018.htm_para14"><a name="0705166000206">Some question whether the changes proposed in the debate would weaken the hand of the Government and the armed forces. My right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Rushcliffe dealt with that issue. Division is undoubtedly a boost for our enemies, so it can only add strength if it is clear that military action has the support of Parliament and, by inference, of the British people. Moreover, I believe that that would provide our troops with the morale boost of legitimacy that comes with constitutional approval.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o391"><a name="70515-0018.htm_para15"><a name="0705166000207">Several Members were concerned about specific definitions in relation to deployments, notably of the word &#147;substantial&#148;. That is a legitimate and understandable concern. I believe that the strict legal definition of the term is both difficult and unwise. The House of Commons will be able to know what it means by such terms in the particular circumstances at any one time. The term &#147;substantial&#148; will be to do not only with the numbers that it might apply to, but with the nature of any conflict and the intent&#151;whether peacekeeping, policing or defensive. It will also be relevant whether any action is unilateral or multilateral  <br>

or involves a coalition or a treaty obligation. Any elected House at any time is better able to interpret whether the nature or size of a force deployed in any particular circumstance requires reference to Parliament than is the extremely stark codification of law. That brings me to the next, related question.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o392"><a name="70515-0018.htm_para16"><a name="0705166000208">Is any change that we decide to make better undertaken by convention or by legislation? I believe, as many Members do, that convention is preferable because it is more flexible and better able to accommodate complex or unforeseen circumstances of the sort mentioned by my right hon. Friend the Member for Wokingham (Mr. Redwood). It has been often repeated in this debate that the primacy of the House of Commons and Parliament must be upheld, which in itself leads to the conclusion that we should go down the route of convention, not legislation. Legislation is potentially subject to judicial interpretation, and under our current arrangements such interpretation could well occur outside our borders. The ability of foreign courts to have a say in what was or was not legitimate for the United Kingdom to do in deploying its armed forces would be utterly unacceptable to this House.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o393"><a name="70515-0018.htm_para17"><a name="0705166000209">My hon. Friend the Member for Grantham and Stamford (Mr. Davies) asked whether these arrangements could conflict with treaty obligations already in force, such as the NATO treaty. Article 5 of that treaty states that an attack against &#147;one or more&#148; countries</p>
<a name="70515-0018.htm_brev0"><a name="0705166000880"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;shall be considered an attack against them all&#148;,</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o394"><a name="70515-0018.htm_para18"><a name="0705166000210">and that each country will take</p>
<a name="70515-0018.htm_brev1"><a name="0705166000881"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;such action as it deems necessary, including the use of armed force&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o395"><a name="70515-0018.htm_para19"><a name="0705166000211">So a range of options are available to us, and there is absolutely no reason why that should in any way clash with the decision that we are taking in the House today. </p>

<p><a name="stpa_o396"><a name="70515-0018.htm_para20"><a name="0705166000212">The balance between the Executive and Parliament after the commencement of operations was also discussed. It is clear from the contributions of many Members that the consensus in the House is that it should be Parliament&#146;s role to grant approval for military action; it is up to the Government of the day to determine how to carry out that action. That issue was raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Louth and Horncastle (Sir Peter Tapsell), and the broad consensus in favour of that position has been reflected throughout today&#146;s debate. There can be no role for the House in detailed operational matters. We should certainly question the wisdom of what the Government of the day have been doing, as we have done throughout history, but the House has to have appropriate mechanisms for doing so that do not interfere in such operations.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o397"><a name="70515-0018.htm_para21"><a name="0705166000213">Some powerful speeches were made and I shall refer to just two or three; I hope that Members in all parts of the House will forgive me for not having time to mention them all. My right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Rushcliffe, in a passionate and extremely well-informed speech that he seemed to have been saving up for this House for a long time, made a number of very valid points. He raised an issue that was echoed throughout the day&#146;s debate: the need for information to be placed before the House before it takes a decision on a substantive deployment. He spoke  <br>

of the need to have the conclusions of legal advice made available to the House, if not the legal advice itself, to give us an indication of the intelligence basis.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o398"><a name="70515-0018.htm_para22"><a name="0705166000214">The hon. Member for Broxtowe talked about the gathering, collation, interpretation and use of intelligence&#151;issues that were again echoed in all parts of the House. My right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Rushcliffe also said that we must have clear objectives and an obvious starting-point for any military activities. Such issues reveal the stark contrast between what happens in this country and in other countries. We witnessed the problems that the Netherlands had to deal with in the run-up to the conflict in Afghanistan; no one in this House would like the British Government to be saddled with such problems.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o399"><a name="70515-0018.htm_para23"><a name="0705166000215">The hon. Member for Berwickshire, Roxburgh and Selkirk (Mr. Moore) said that the Liberal Democrats will support our motion, for which we are very grateful. I disagreed with him about the need for a legislative framework, for reasons that I have already set out. It would be inflexible and apply to the House a codification that might not suit some of the varied circumstances that we might face. The right hon. Member for Oldham, West and Royton (Mr. Meacher), who is probably helping his colleague with his campaigning, mentioned his private Member&#146;s Bill, for which I am happy to give him a little advertisement. He talked about the importance of the timing of any vote, saying that it should not be taken at a point where action had already become inevitable. That is an important lesson that the Secretary of State might want to return to in his winding-up speech.</p>

Were we to have an elected House of Lords&#151;as the House of Commons has already decided should be put in place&#151;what would its role be?

Friend the Member for North Wiltshire (Mr. Gray) said that he had changed his mind on the basis of the arguments that he heard in the House of Commons today. Well, I have heard it all now. It was worth waiting the 15 years that I have been a Member of Parliament. My hon.

My only concern is that in the time available I will not be able to do justice to all the speeches that have been made, but I shall do my best. The contributions reflected the fundamental place that Parliament has in the democratic decision-making process of this country and the priority we all on both sides of the House attach to the men and women of our armed forces, particularly when we ask them to act on our behalf and put their lives at risk, often in harsh and dangerous environments thousands of miles away from their families and their loved ones.</p>

One of the striking things about this debate, which began with nothing in principle between the Govt and the Opposition, is that it has revealed the complexity of the challenge we have set ourselves in determining a mechanism that gives practical effect to that principle. That mechanism must give a clear mandate for our armed forces that allows them to go into conflict and take on its risks confident that they have the durable support of the country as expressed through its Parliament.</p>

of the challenge that we have set ourselves. The right hon. Member for Richmond, Yorks (Mr. Hague) opened the debate and suggested that there was no difference between his motion and the Government&#146;s amendment. He suggested that we sought a distinction without a difference&#151;or, as my hon. Friend the Member for Thurrock (Andrew Mackinlay) put it, that we were dancing on the head of a pin. My right hon. Friend the Leader of the House pointed out a difference that he said was crucial&#151;the imperative to take full account of the paramount need not to compromise the security of UK forces or the operational discretion of those in command.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o408"><a name="70515-0019.htm_para1"><a name="0705166000225">The right hon. Member for Richmond, Yorks sought to dismiss that, asserting that no party in the House would seek to undermine our troops in that way and that it was an unnecessary qualification. I do not want to contradict his assertion that no party in the House would wish to undermine our troops in that way, but I just want to say to him and his colleagues that the terms of the motion that this House passes tonight will be pored over by the military&#151;and quite rightly so.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o409"><a name="70515-0019.htm_para2"><a name="0705166000226">For many reasons, some of which I shall come to later in my speech, we must act in a way that gives the troops whom we deploy into conflicts confidence in our decision making. As we are expressing the nature of the principle that we all now espouse, it is important that the House sends the right message of confidence to our troops.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o410"><a name="70515-0019.htm_para3"><a name="0705166000227">Those who contributed to this debate included the shadow Foreign Secretary&#151;the right hon. Member for Richmond, Yorks&#151;the right hon. and learned Member for Rushcliffe (Mr. Clarke) and my right hon. Friend the Member for Oldham, West and Royton (Mr. Meacher), to name but a few. They all welcomed what they described as the Government&#146;s damascene conversion&#151;or volte-face&#151;on this issue. I am grateful to the hon. Member for Berwickshire, Roxburgh and Selkirk (Mr. Moore) for reminding the House that the evolutionary process that has brought the Government to this point has had the same effect on Her Majesty&#146;s loyal Opposition. No doubt the Opposition can explain why their Leader, who opposed the principle in 2005, now supports it. In contrast, my right hon. Friend the Leader of the House reminded the House that the Government undertook to keep our position under review, and that we have been doing so.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o411"><a name="70515-0019.htm_para4"><a name="0705166000228">For my part, as Secretary of State for Defence, it was the apparently insurmountable challenge of working through the complexities that hon. Members today have identified&#151;in spades, I think&#151;that caused me to maintain and support the position adopted by the Lord Chancellor in the House of Lords on 1 May. That position was entirely consistent with the position that my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister held and which he explained to the Liaison Committee. It was contained in both the reports that we have been considering, and has been quoted liberally in the House today.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o412"><a name="70515-0019.htm_para5"><a name="0705166000229">The position adopted by my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister was reinforced by this House&#146;s history of scrutiny, retrospective review and debate of deployments over the past 10 years. I now accept, however, that the weight of the obvious all-party support for the argument had to be recognised. Government and Parliament must now get down to the  <br>

difficult task of working through the challenges, which should not be underestimated. The record of today&#146;s debate will be a significant quarry of the extent of those challenges.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o413"><a name="70515-0019.htm_para6"><a name="0705166000230">At the heart of this complexity is a debate about the appropriate mechanism to adopt. With the honourable and consistent exception of the right hon. and learned Member for Rushcliffe&#151;and perhaps of the hon. Member for Berwickshire, Roxburgh and Selkirk&#151;almost all the contributors to the debate favoured the approach of developing a convention that requires resolutions of both Houses prior to the deployment of forces, or to homologate that deployment. Such a convention, however, must preserve the supremacy of the House of Commons.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o414"><a name="70515-0019.htm_para7"><a name="0705166000231">Quite rightly, my right hon. Friend the Leader of the House did not express a preference at this stage, as the consultation that we have announced has yet to take place. However, the short debate between the right hon. and learned Members for Rushcliffe and for Kensington and Chelsea (Sir Malcolm Rifkind) highlighted some of the very obvious disadvantages inherent in a statutory framework, particularly the risk of a later legal challenge and all the detrimental effect that that would have on the morale of deployed troops. However, the right hon. and learned Member for Rushcliffe countered that point with an impressive argument about the need for a degree of certainty and clarity, based on the fact that he has no confidence in the power of convention. I suspect that that debate will continue, and perhaps over time the right hon. and learned Gentleman will attract a few more supporters to his position than he was able to do today.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o415"><a name="70515-0019.htm_para8"><a name="0705166000232">Several contributions drew on the words of Lord Bramall, Lord Garden and others who contributed to the Lords debate, pointing out that in exploring the options to formalise Parliament&#146;s involvement, we need to be conscious of the need not to undermine the effectiveness or security of our military personnel. It would be remiss of me not to highlight some of the issues we need to bear in mind in trying to achieve that objective; they include not only operational effectiveness but the wider diplomatic and development activity that often accompanies the deployment of our forces.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o416"><a name="70515-0019.htm_para9"><a name="0705166000233">The right hon. and learned Member for Rushcliffe and my hon. Friend the Member for Walthamstow (Mr. Gerrard) devoted a considerable amount of time to timing. I am grateful, too, for the contributions of my hon. Friend the Member for Broxtowe (Dr. Palmer) and of the hon. Member for East Antrim (Sammy Wilson), who set out the comparative advantages of earlier and later decision making. The hon. Member for Newark (Patrick Mercer) raised an aspect of that issue in an early intervention when he explored the characteristics of major or substantial deployment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o417"><a name="70515-0019.htm_para10"><a name="0705166000234">I agree that, as has been said, although the major deployments in respect of the Falklands, Kosovo, Sierra Leone, Iraq and Afghanistan clearly lent themselves to a process of parliamentary decision making, we have to recognise the nature of modern warfare. There are practical considerations such as the long lead times needed for military advantage, not to mention military engagements such as aerial bombing and the use of missiles, which in the words of the military are designed to shape the battle space. If we  <br>

get the timing wrong, there is a danger, in the words of the report of the Lords Constitution Committee, of</p>
<a name="70515-0019.htm_brev0"><a name="0705166000882"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;removing the ability of United Kingdom forces to have &#145;strategic poise&#146; by giving the opponent early notice of intent&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o418"><a name="70515-0019.htm_para11"><a name="0705166000235">The hon. Member for Bournemouth, East (Mr. Ellwood) brought to the attention of the House the fact that modern military operations are very different from those we engaged in only 20 years ago. In that respect, we try to adopt what has become known as the &#147;comprehensive approach&#148;, integrating all the levers of Government to maximise the effect on the ground&#151;a point to which I shall return later if I have time.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o419"><a name="70515-0019.htm_para12"><a name="0705166000236">I know that I speak for the House when I say that my first priority is the effectiveness and safety of our armed forces. It is crucial that they remain capable of performing the tasks we ask of them, agile enough to respond quickly to an ever more dynamic operational environment and robust in the face of real threats to our, and their, security. Their morale and safety must remain paramount.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o420"><a name="70515-0019.htm_para13"><a name="0705166000237">If Parliament is to take an informed view of military deployments, it is only natural that Members should want to satisfy themselves about the nature of the operation and the threat our forces will face and that they will have the equipment, tactics and procedures they need to help them to succeed. Indeed, Members set out a list of the requirements for any such debate, drawing on the report of the Lords Committee. I know of the necessity to satisfy oneself about all those things; as Defence Secretary I ask myself such questions every day in relation to the deployment of our troops in theatre.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o421"><a name="70515-0019.htm_para14"><a name="0705166000238">The Lords Committee considered those points in its report, which noted the need to restrict some information but acknowledged that it could compromise the ability of Parliament to make informed decisions about a given situation. That is why in that decision-making process I shall resist the sharing of any information that compromises the priority of operational security. This is not a hypothetical debate, or one in which the Government hide behind the smokescreen of security concerns; it is not even about what information the Government proactively put before Parliament. In today&#146;s globalised world, where our potential adversaries watch the same television programmes and read the same newspapers and internet sites as we do, operational security can easily be undermined not just by the Government&#146;s answers but even by the questions posed; managing that in a way that allows Parliament to take an informed view will be a significant challenge.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o422"><a name="70515-0019.htm_para15"><a name="0705166000239">We would certainly not release any information that could compromise sensitive intelligence or reveal elements of our operational planning. Indeed, I can conceive of some military operations that the House would not want to debate in public, either because it would risk escalating the conflict or because the mission itself is so sensitive that even acknowledging its existence would risk undermining the effectiveness of deployed forces and the UK&#146;s wider interests.</p>

<p><a name="st_o285"><a name="0705166000241"><a name="70515-0019.htm_spnew1"><a name="0705166000939"><b>Des Browne:</b>
 Perhaps the hon. Gentleman was not paying attention to the earlier part of my speech. I explained what he asks. Given the few minutes that I have left, I think that it would be inappropriate to repeat it. I am afraid that he will have to read it in the official record.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o423"><a name="70515-0019.htm_para16"><a name="0705166000242">I have already referred to the need for our forces to be agile in the face of a developing situation and to be quick to deploy when needed. Developments in technology, travel, communications and military capabilities mean that events around the world that challenge our security or international stability often require fast and decisive action. It is vital that we are able to deploy our forces quickly, especially when lives are at stake: for example, as we have debated, in hostage situations or following a dramatic deterioration in the security situation that required us to help evacuate UK citizens. We will have to take account of that as we take our work forward.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o424"><a name="70515-0019.htm_para17"><a name="0705166000243">That might require an arrangement for some kind of retrospective consideration&#151;as some of the speeches made today suggested. As the right hon. and learned Member for Kensington and Chelsea pointed out, we should recognise that our armed forces deserve the full support of the House, and deploying them into a potentially dangerous situation and asking them to put their lives at risk while holding open the possibility that they may well be recalled some time later would be untenable. Again, that will require careful work, as will the question of what would happen in the event of a change of Government.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o425"><a name="70515-0019.htm_para18"><a name="0705166000244">Once deployed, our armed forces must also retain the flexibility to adapt to the threats that they face without the constraint of returning to the House at every twist and turn. We must beware of the &#147;long screwdriver&#148; and strike a balance between strategic consideration of the issues and trusting the judgment of our people on the ground, because their lives may depend on it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o426"><a name="70515-0019.htm_para19"><a name="0705166000245">We must also consider how a new mechanism might affect the reliability of the UK as an ally. Some hon. Members, including the hon. Member for Bournemouth, East, pointed out effectively the different systems of parliamentary decision making among many of our allies and the consequences for the effectiveness of their military as allies when they are deployed in theatres. In the modern world, our forces will almost always be deployed alongside troops from other nations, and timetables imposed by the parliamentary activities of those other nations are not necessarily under our control. Our experience of operating in a multinational environment is that often the overall speed of decision making and deployment is driven by the time scale of the different troop contributors. The UK is valued as a coalition partner by our partners in NATO and the EU because we are reliable and because we deliver what we say we will. That involves not only the eventual deployment of troops, but the campaign planning that is vital to any successful mission. We would not want to inhibit such contingency planning.</p>

 The right hon. and learned Member  for Kensington and Chelsea used the example of the Iraqi no-fly zones. Our armed forces are engaged on a range of operations and activities as we speak.

 I am delighted to join others in taking the opportunity to celebrate the centenary of scouting and in encouraging people to volunteer. Before doing that, on behalf of the all-party group on the Scout Association, I should like to express our sadness at the death of Lord Weatherill. He was the president of our group and a wonderful advocate of the scout movement. Indeed, he established the excellent Speaker&#146;s tea party, which you, Mr. Speaker, continue today. He was, in every respect, a fine man. We will miss him greatly.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o437"><a name="70515-0020.htm_para6"><a name="0705166000808">The year 2007 marks the centenary of the scout movement. Scouting started in the United Kingdom and can now be found in all but a handful of countries. It is the largest co-educational youth movement in the United Kingdom, offering challenge and adventure to 400,000 young people aged between six and 25. There are also 100,000 adult volunteers. United Kingdom membership has increased in the past two years by 1.6 per cent. More girls are also joining the organisation. There are 28 million members worldwide.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o438"><a name="70515-0020.htm_para7"><a name="0705166000809">Adventure is at the core of scouting. The association passionately believes in helping young people to fulfil their physical, intellectual, social and spiritual potential by working in teams, and learning by doing and thinking for themselves. Scouting encourages young people to try something new, feel the buzz of the challenge and reflect on what that means. Scouting offers more than 200 activities throughout the United Kingdom through a structured youth development programme. Crucially, all those activities are made possible by the efforts of more than 100,000 voluntary adult leaders.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o439"><a name="70515-0020.htm_para8"><a name="0705166000810">The Scout Association is committed to including even more of the diverse mix of young people in the United Kingdom. In the past three years, it has supported the Muslim community in opening 15 local scout groups, and others are planned. The association currently deals with inquiries from leaders and schools about the way in which scouting can engage with the extended schools agenda. I am delighted that my two fellow officers of the all-party group are present and I hope that they catch your eye, Mr. Speaker, to make short contributions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o440"><a name="70515-0020.htm_para9"><a name="0705166000811">The year 2007 marks 100 years of scouting. The more than 400,000 young people and 100,000 adult volunteers in the United Kingdom will join in the centenary celebrations. The hon. Member for Colchester (Bob Russell) tabled an early-day motion and I am delighted to say that almost every hon. Member who can sign has signed it. However, one or two others may now feel inspired to sign it and then their names will be included in the illuminated address, which will be presented at the Speaker&#146;s tea party and subsequently displayed at Gilwell.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o441"><a name="70515-0020.htm_para10"><a name="0705166000812">Across the world in 2007, the centenary of scouting is likely to be the largest ever example of youth co-operation and one of the biggest global celebrations since the turn of the millennium. For 100 years, scouting has been changing the world for the better,  <br>


<meta name="Date" content="15 May 2007">

with projects occurring all over the globe. They tackle local issues and make a difference in local communities. Examples include communicating with children about the dangers of HIV, re-educating child soldiers in Africa and raising money for homeless children around the world. Scouts in the UK have been active in supporting the projects of their fellow scouts around the world. Following the Asian tsunami, UK scouts raised more than &#163;250,000 for scout-led development projects in affected countries.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o442"><a name="70515-0020.htm_para11"><a name="0705166000813">The climax of this year&#146;s centenary celebrations will be the world scout jamboree at Highland park in the county of Essex. I know that the Minister will be there, as will many other hon. Members. It is a private matter as to whether or not we shall stay under canvas for a night. There will be 40,000 scouts from more than 200 countries coming together in a celebration of worldwide youth co-operation and peace under the theme of &#147;one world, one promise&#148;. More than 8,000 volunteers will make the jamboree possible; it is supported by fewer than 30 paid staff. The jamboree will be the largest gathering of people before the Olympic games and the support of those 8,000 people helping to make it happen is an unprecedented illustration of the power and value of the volunteer. Besides raising money to attend the jamboree themselves, scouts in the UK have raised more than &#163;400,000 to assist fellow scouts from less well-off countries to attend the great event.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o443"><a name="70515-0020.htm_para12"><a name="0705166000814">Let me turn to the subject of volunteering, which is a challenge for us all. Adult volunteers within the scouting movement contribute more than 364 million hours of voluntary work each year to their local communities&#151;and that is before the jamboree. The undertaking of the jamboree is awe inspiring in respect of how many volunteers will be required. The number of volunteers working for scouting is bigger than the combined work forces of the BBC, which is 24,000, and of McDonald&#146;s, which is 67,000. Next bank holiday at the end of May, 200,000 scouts from the UK will simultaneously sleep under canvas during a series of adventure-packed centenary camps to celebrate 100 years of scouting. It is estimated that adult volunteers will have given up more than 5 million hours of their free time to enable the camps for this weekend alone to go ahead.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o444"><a name="70515-0020.htm_para13"><a name="0705166000815">Even with all those volunteers and hours being put in, there is a waiting list of 30,000 young people who want to join the scouts, but cannot because of the lack of volunteers. We need to find ways to encourage more adults to volunteer. I understand that the Guide Association&#151;I am co-vice-chairman of the parliamentary group&#151;has similar numbers of young people also wanting to join. There are so many benefits to volunteering, not just for the scouts but for any youth organisation. Volunteering can help young adults to develop skills such as leadership, which will help their careers. It introduces people to a whole range of activities that they would not necessarily have considered doing before.</p>

<p><a name="st_o294"><a name="0705166000816"><a name="70515-0020.htm_spnew4"><a name="0705166001487"><b>Mr. Andy Reed (Loughborough) (Lab/Co-op):</b>
 I congratulate the hon. Gentleman on securing this evening&#146;s debate. As he knows, until Easter I was a Beaver helper  <br>

at my local 2nd Quorn scouts group and was proud to help. We recognise the problems that he mentioned in that many of the leaders, like myself, have had to move on because they find it so difficult to find the time. Does he think that there are any ways in which the scouting movement could be more flexible, allowing leaders to volunteer on a more flexible basis&#151;in and out, as it were&#151;so that they do not have to give an overall commitment? As he knows, many people in society really struggle to make the regular weekly commitments required to make scouting such a success.</p>

<p><a name="st_o295"><a name="0705166000817"><a name="70515-0020.htm_spnew5"><a name="0705166001488"><b>Mr. Amess:</b>
 I congratulate the hon. Gentleman on leading his Beaver group, which is a big undertaking. The issue of flexibility is crucial, and I am sure that the national organisation will take that into account when encouraging more people to volunteer.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o445"><a name="70515-0020.htm_para14"><a name="0705166000818">That leads me to ask why more people do not volunteer. Many are afraid of making a time commitment, as the hon. Gentleman has just pointed out, but scout groups can be flexible. They will allow volunteers to give as little or as much time as they feel that they can. Other people feel that they do not have the right skills, but anyone can help. A person does not have to be a qualified rock climber to help to run a community-based scout group. Office skills are just as important, for example, and everyone can contribute something. There are concerns about risk, and a perception that leaders might be open to law suits. However, the Scout Association provides award-winning training and one-to-one support to help people to make the best use of their skills and talents and to guide them through a range of potential situations.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o446"><a name="70515-0020.htm_para15"><a name="0705166000819">As the House would expect, I particularly want to praise the good work and achievements of the Southend West district scouts, led by Pete Murray&#151;not the former disc jockey, but the district commissioner. Southend West district scouts are an amalgamation of Leigh-on-Sea district scouts and Westcliff district scouts. The amalgamation took place in September 2004, and I am informed that it is going well. Southend West district scouts are able to boast nearly 1,000 members this year&#151;an increase of nearly 100 over the past year. It is a tribute to the organisation that it continues to be so popular a century after it was founded.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o447"><a name="70515-0020.htm_para16"><a name="0705166000820">To mark the centenary, 650 scouts were recently present at the centenary renewal promise in Southend. The hon. Member for Colchester (Bob Russell) and I were present at Windsor to see Her Majesty the Queen inspect the Queen&#146;s scouts. That was indeed a wonderful occasion. Southend West district scouts are also holding a centenary camp weekend in June and a mini-jamboree at Belchamps campsite to coincide with the world jamboree. Of the 17 scout groups in Southend, West, there are three sea scout units, two of which are Admiralty recognised. All three have excellent waterfront facilities and are fully equipped for the training of all young people. They also do a wonderful job in organising the Leigh regatta. Two of the groups also have full disabled facilities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o448"><a name="70515-0020.htm_para17"><a name="0705166000821">Despite the huge popularity of the Southend West district scout group, it lacks volunteers. So what about volunteering generally? Adult volunteering is an issue that extends beyond the scout movement. For instance,  <br>

the Samaritans reported earlier this month that 65.4 per cent. of 16 to 24-year-olds said that they had thought about helping their community in their spare time, yet only 2 per cent. said that they would actually turn out and volunteer. That is a very low rate of return. A Samaritans volunteer survey showed that 95 per cent. of people had between one and eight hours free time every day, which adds up to between seven and 56 hours spare time each week. According to Volunteering England, the reason that many employers encourage volunteering is that it makes a big difference not only to the organisations that people volunteer for, but to those that employ the volunteers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o449"><a name="70515-0020.htm_para18"><a name="0705166000822">I want to say a word about volunteering in Southend, West. The motivations for volunteering vary enormously. Some people might want to help various organisations that have helped them in the past. We all know from our constituency contacts that that is often the inspiration behind a volunteer group. Volunteering enables people to learn new skills and to experience different areas of life. I am interested in the scouts because I was a member of the 47th West Ham group. I did more than 100 nights rough camping and got a great deal out of the organisation and, in my humble way, I want to give something back to scouting.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o450"><a name="70515-0020.htm_para19"><a name="0705166000823">There are endless opportunities for volunteering that will appeal to many different people. For example, there are opportunities to help on environmental projects and others relating to animal welfare, working alongside the RSPCA. In particular, I extend my thanks to the 300 people who regularly help out at Southend university hospital. I also thank those who do a magnificent job helping Essex Air Ambulance. I pay tribute to the recent event organised at No. 11 Downing street, which was a splendid occasion, and which all those who attended thoroughly enjoyed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o451"><a name="70515-0020.htm_para20"><a name="0705166000824">There is no point having an Adjournment debate, however, if one does not ask the Government to do something. May I therefore gently ask the Minister to tell the House what plans he has to assist the voluntary sector in encouraging more people to volunteer? Do the Government have any plans to work with employers to make it easier for employees to volunteer, to which the hon. Member for Loughborough (Mr. Reed) referred with regard to flexible hours? How will the Government encourage young people to become more involved in volunteering, capitalise on the will to volunteer reported by the Samaritans, and turn that will into action?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o452"><a name="70515-0020.htm_para21"><a name="0705166000825">I recognise the support provided by the Government to the Scout Association in its centenary year, and I welcome the Chancellor&#146;s recent Budget commitment to increase the quality and quantity of opportunities for volunteering and awareness of the benefits of volunteering. I would like to hear more from the Minister, however, about how that commitment will be implemented and how its success will be measured.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o453"><a name="70515-0020.htm_para22"><a name="0705166000826">Let us celebrate the centenary of scouting and do all that we can to encourage volunteering, so that this wonderful movement, which has done so much for so many people, prospers for at least another 100 years.</p>

there was an example of how scouting rises above all tribal divisions and unites all people, it is in the fact that we three disparate souls&#151;the hon. Member for Southend, West, the hon. Member for Colchester (Bob Russell) and me, a slightly less honourable Member&#151;are united, despite our political differences, in our respect and affection for scouting and in our determination to see scouting succeed. One of the most amazing things about scouting is that wherever one goes in the world, if one makes the scout sign and gives the scout handshake, one has made a friend.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o454"><a name="70515-0020.htm_para23"><a name="0705166000828">The hon. Member for Southend, West mentioned his scout group, but it would be wrong for me to mention Greenford and district scout group, so ably led by Andy Norman, or even Ealing and Hanwell district scout group, equally ably led by Alan Rayner&#151;so I will not do that. If those people who do not know about scouting, and who still hear an echo of that past when there was a feeling that uniformed groups could not be supported by certain councils, spent time with their district scout groups, as many right hon. and hon. Members have done, they would see that scouting unites everybody, regardless of age, class, colour, creed, sex or any other difference.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o455"><a name="70515-0020.htm_para24"><a name="0705166000829">I also thank you, Mr. Speaker, for so ably hosting the scout tea. I think that the Maryhill group were welcomed. They certainly enjoyed their tea and, as I recall, ate most of it, as well as other people&#146;s.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o456"><a name="70515-0020.htm_para25"><a name="0705166000830">I also draw attention to the fact that the House now has a ministerial champion of scouting. I pay tribute to the hon. Member for Doncaster, North (Edward Miliband), who, on several occasions, has addressed groups of scouts and admitted to never having been a scout. He may never have been a scout, but by heaven, he is a good friend of scouting. He has done the reputation of the House much good in the world of scouting.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o457"><a name="70515-0020.htm_para26"><a name="0705166000831">I congratulate the hon. Member for Southend, West not just on what he has done tonight, but on what he does all the time for that great unifying force of scouting. I add my voice to his in the call for more volunteers. What could be sadder than the thought of a waiting list for people who want to get involved as beavers, cubs or scouts? Let the cry go out from tonight&#151;scouting needs adults. The world would be a better place for more scouting.</p>

 As secretary of the all-party parliamentary scout group, I thank the two-co-chairs, the hon. Members for Southend, West (Mr. Amess) and for Ealing, North (Stephen Pound), for their contributions. I endorse all that has been said, and congratulate the hon. Member for Southend, West on the way in which he set out the case.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o458"><a name="70515-0020.htm_para27"><a name="0705166000833">I will be brief, because we want to hear from the Minister.

The message that goes out to the Government&#151;to all of us&#151;is that we desperately need to recruit more volunteers for tomorrow, so that the great scout movement that we have enjoyed in this country, and which the world has enjoyed, can look forward to its second centenary.</p>

 Let me begin by associating myself with what the hon. Member for Southend, West (Mr. Amess) said about Lord Weatherill, the former Speaker of the House of Commons. I had the privilege of meeting him at an event arranged by the Rainer charity for young people. I know how passionate he was about these issues, and I know that he will be widely missed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o461"><a name="70515-0021.htm_para0"><a name="0705166000837">I congratulate the hon. Gentleman on securing the debate and giving us an opportunity to discuss the scout movement. His speech showed what an eloquent spokesman he is for the movement, along with the other members of that extraordinary trio&#151;my hon. Friend the Member for Ealing, North (Stephen Pound) and the hon. Member for Colchester (Bob Russell). They are a formidable combination, and they have done a great deal to promote the interests of the scouts in Parliament.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o462"><a name="70515-0021.htm_para1"><a name="0705166000838">I should add a confession, previewed by my hon. Friend the Member for Ealing, North. I was never in the scouts, or indeed in the cubs, or even the Woodcraft Folk. As with all childhood neglect, I think I blame my parents, but I have tried to make up for it in the 100th anniversary year.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o463"><a name="70515-0021.htm_para2"><a name="0705166000839">Like you, Mr. Speaker, I have been privileged to meet some inspiring representatives of the scouts and the adult volunteers who work with them, both at the reception organised by the all-party group and at a reception that I hosted on behalf of the Government. I was struck by the extent to which the scouts and volunteers whom I met defied many of the stereotypes that exist in Britain today. The young people in the scouts want the best not just for themselves but for society. They are not the selfish individualists that the media, and, I am afraid, politics, sometimes portray.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o464"><a name="70515-0021.htm_para3"><a name="0705166000840">One of the scouts whom I met, Conor Michaels from Huddersfield, told me, &#147;Yes, the scouts are about adventure; yes, you get the chance to meet new people and make great friends.&#148; But he also said, &#147;The great thing about scouting is that it tries to make the world a better place&#148;&#151;a point also made by the hon. Member for Southend, West. That young person mentioned the scouts who volunteered after hurricane Katrina, and those who raised money for the tsunami appeal. In its anniversary year, the scouting movement is also taking a lead in countering some of the negative stereotypes about young people. It now has 450 young spokespeople from almost every county in the country, and I was lucky enough to meet some of them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o465"><a name="70515-0021.htm_para4"><a name="0705166000841">I also pay tribute to the extraordinary dedication and commitment of the adult volunteers, to whom the hon. Gentleman also referred. As one of them pointed out to me, the official number of uniformed volunteers is 100,000, but that is a significant underestimate of the number who play their part to make the movement what it is. Behind the people in uniform are the parents on committees, those who help with expeditions and camping, those who help out by raising money, those who help out with jumble sales, and so on. They should make us optimistic about Britain. They are unsung heroes who do extraordinary things, and I am very pleased that we have the chance to honour them in the House tonight. Those are some of the great things that the scouting movement does for our society.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o466"><a name="70515-0021.htm_para5"><a name="0705166000842">It is particularly impressive that the movement is not resting on its laurels on its 100th anniversary. It is led dynamically by Derek Twine, the chief executive, and Peter Duncan, the chief scout. Their leadership is dynamic and they are organising some extraordinary events this year, including Mr. Speaker&#146;s tea. Their leadership is also visionary in that they realise that the scouting movement cannot stand still. As Peter Duncan explains, there are two myths about the scouts: one is that they are declining and the other is that they are old-fashioned. He says that they are neither.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o467"><a name="70515-0021.htm_para6"><a name="0705166000843">Scouting is no longer a single-sex organisation; it admits girls, and 14 per cent. of scouts are now female. Nor is it a single-faith organisation. There are now Muslim and Sikh groups, and The Scout Association is committed to increasing its diversity. The scouts also consider themselves to be a social movement, taking up important issues of our time. Their 100th anniversary promise is &#147;One world, one promise&#148;, and they are using the anniversary to campaign on climate change and other key issues.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o468"><a name="70515-0021.htm_para7"><a name="0705166000844">The key moment of this year&#151;the jamboree&#151;has at its heart this commitment to making a better world. This year&#146;s Jamboree is at Hylands park from 27 July to 8 August. I am adopting a wait-and-see policy on the question of whether to camp at Hylands park. There will be 40,000 young people from 218 countries, and I am pleased that the Government have been able to make resources available to make it a success.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o469"><a name="70515-0021.htm_para8"><a name="0705166000845">What is so exciting about the jamboree is not only that it will bring young people together from across the world, which is important, but that there will be volunteering to help the local community in Hylands park; 4,000 young people a day will be going out to help members of the local community. It will also raise awareness of some of the key issues facing today&#146;s world, in particular those facing the younger generation, such as climate change, global development and the need to bring together different faiths. Above all, it will be a great advert for Britain, and I look forward to attending.</p>

Some of the best activities of the scouts involve volunteering for the wider community, but we need to bring out the best in the many young people who want to volunteer, and not just in those in the scouts.</p>

Issues around Criminal Records Bureau checks are often raised and we are seeking to address them. There are also barriers in the benefit system, to do with lunch expenses. We have been able to take action on that.</p>
