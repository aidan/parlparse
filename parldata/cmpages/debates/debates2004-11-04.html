 (Lab): If she will make a statement on post office closures.  [195860]
</p>



<p><a name="st_0"><a name="41104-01_spmin0"><b>The Secretary of State for Trade and Industry  (Ms Patricia Hewitt): </b> 
 Post Office Ltd. embarked on a restructuring of its urban network in late 2002 because there was simply no longer enough business to sustain the existing network. The urban reinvention programme will help to ensure a sustainable urban network for the future. The programme is now approaching its final stages, and 95 per cent. of people living in urban areas will still be within a mile of their nearest post office.
</p>








<p><a name="st_1"><a name="41104-01_spnew0"><b> Mr. Heyes: </b> 
 I thank my right hon. Friend for that answer, but I wish I could share her optimism about the way in which the post office closure programme is being handled, especially given the predicted threat to Crown offices. I do not believe that franchising is the answer. In the Failsworth area of my constituency, there is a former Crown office that was franchised to the Co-op some years ago. It is now threatened with closure, despite being described by the Post Office as


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_0">&quot;a busy branch which attracts customers from a wide area&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>




</p>

<p>
<a name="41104-01_para0">
<a name="stpa_0">This is happening simply because the Co-op has decided to get out of the post office business. Does my right hon. Friend agree that the time has come for a decisive ministerial intervention to bring some sanity to the Post Office&#039;s incompetent closure programme and to remind the Post Office of its public service obligation?
</p>








<p><a name="st_2"><a name="41104-01_spnew1"><b> Ms Hewitt: </b> 
 I am grateful to my hon. Friend for that question, because it gives me the opportunity to stress to every hon. Member that the press coverage earlier this week was completely wrong. There is no proposal or programme to cut a swathe through the directly managed post offices. The only requirement that I have placed on Allan Leighton and his team at the Post Office is that they stop the losses in the directly managed post offices, which are currently amounting to some &#163;71&nbsp;million a year. That is simply unacceptable. There are 550 directly managed post offices. Fewer than five of 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>4 Nov 2004 : Column 432</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>them are likely to close next year, and that will be because they are simply not viable. Whether the others remain directly managed or whether some become managed through a retail franchise, as others have done in the past, the important issue is that they continue to give the best possible service to customers, and that they bring new customers in to all our post offices by introducing new products and services, as the Post Office is doing.
</p>








<p><a name="st_3"><a name="41104-01_spnew2"><b> Mr. Michael Weir  (Angus)</b> 
 (SNP): I hear what the Secretary of State says, but, having gone through the post office reinvention programme, which closed many sub-post offices in towns and rural areas, we now hear that the Post Office is even considering closing Crown post offices, whose existence has often been given as the excuse for closing down sub-post offices. Does she not accept that there is a real need for the Government to intervene and get a handle on what is happening to the whole post office network?
</p>








<p><a name="st_4"><a name="41104-01_spnew3"><b> Ms Hewitt: </b> 
 The hon. Gentleman should understand that, because of what we have done on rural post offices, we have stopped all rural post office closures, except those that are completely unavoidable because nobody can be found to run the sub-post office in question. I understand very well why people are concerned about urban network closures, because we all value the part that sub-post offices play in our communities. However, we face a choice. Do we simply allow unplanned closures to take place as sub-postmasters retire or give up because they cannot make a living, or do we back our Post Office in a planned reorganisation of the network that will give better service to customers? I believe that we are taking the right approach. This is a planned reorganisation, there is more investment in the post offices and, contrary to the hon. Gentleman&#039;s assertion, there are no proposals to close all the directly managed post offices.
</p>








<p><a name="st_5"><a name="41104-01_spnew4"><b> Mr. Martin O&#039;Neill  (Ochil)</b> 
 (Lab): My right hon. Friend might not yet have had time to read the document that my colleagues and I on the Select Committee on Trade and Industry have issued in response to her comments on our report on the urban reinvention programme. It is not without precedent, but it is not common for Select Committees to comment on a Minister&#039;s comments. We did so because we were so concerned by the inadequacy of the response that we received. In respect of implementation, transparency and consultation, the handling of the urban reinvention programme was a bit of a shambles. Frankly, we do not agree that it was effectively and efficiently handled, and we think that there is an unwarranted degree of complacency on the part of the Department.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41104-01_para1">
<a name="stpa_1">What is more, we feel that the assessment of the effectiveness of urban reinvention is far too narrow, and the idea that it can be effectively and efficiently carried out only on the basis of the number of closures is not the best criterion to apply. This was the unanimous view of a cross-party Committee that, as I have said, took the rare step of questioning the effectiveness of the Government&#039;s response to our report. We would like to think that when the Secretary of State has had time to consider the document, a better response will be forthcoming.

<a name="stpa_4">As for administration and consultation, following a number of expressions of concern from Members nearly a year ago, on 5 February my hon. Friend the Member for East Ham (Mr. Timms), then the Minister for postal services, announced significant improvements in the consultation process. Moreover, by means of that process Postwatch has ensured that nearly 400 closure proposals have been withdrawn or changed.

 (Con): How many more post offices are going to close?
</p>








<p><a name="st_9"><a name="41104-01_spnew8"><b> Ms Hewitt: </b> 
 That will depend on the outcome of the consultation that is currently taking place in the constituencies that have not yet been part of the process, but I can say that the number is likely to be considerably smaller than the 3,500 figure that was bandied around by the press and Conservative Members some months ago.
</p>








<p><a name="st_10"><a name="41104-01_spnew9"><b> Mr. Lindsay Hoyle  (Chorley)</b> 
 (Lab): As my right hon. Friend will know, I am a member of the Select Committee chaired by my hon. Friend the Member for Ochil (Mr. O&#039;Neill). We see this as the urban destruction of the post office network. What worries me is the fact that we now have empty shops in Chorley. The appropriate criterion was not used, the figures were massaged, and the whole thing was an absolute disgrace. We were depending on the Crown post office in the town centre becoming a replacement for the benefit of those wishing to travel into town. Can we have a categorical assurance that the Crown post office will remain open, like others elsewhere?
</p>








<p><a name="st_11"><a name="41104-01_spnew10"><b> Ms Hewitt: </b> 
 The directly managed Crown post offices are regarded as part of the urban network. They are therefore subject to exactly the same criterion as we set for the Post Office&#151;that 95 per cent. of people living in urban areas must be within a mile of a post office. As for the specific issue of Chorley Crown post office, I will check with David Mills of Post Office Ltd. and write to my hon. Friend.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41104-01_para5">
<a name="stpa_5">I cannot accept my hon. Friend&#039;s assertion about urban reinvention. I stress that whereas post offices were closing in an unplanned way because sub-postmasters and postmistresses simply could not make a living, there is now a new network. Nine out of 10 customers of post offices that have closed have moved their custom to the nearest branches, and thanks to the new products we are providing&#151;particularly the new banking services&#151;we are increasing the potential customer base. There are 

<br>&nbsp;<br>

<br>&nbsp;<br>now 21 million people who can do their banking at the post office. That is the way in which to strengthen our post office network.

</p>








<p><a name="st_13"><a name="41104-01_spnew12"><b> Ms Hewitt: </b> 
 One of the main factors taken into account by Postwatch as well as the Post Office when they are considering the closure of a branch is access for elderly people, people with disabilities and people without the use of a car. As I have said, nine out of 10 customers of post offices that have closed have moved their custom to the nearest branches that Postwatch and Post Office Ltd. were considering. I sympathise with the hon. Lady&#039;s constituents who may be experiencing difficulties, but I am afraid I must advise them that the Liberal Democrats&#039; policy&#151;as announced by their Front-Bench spokesman&#151;is to privatise the Post Office along the lines of the Dutch model. That would hardly improve matters.

 (Lab): On access, will my right hon. Friend look at Greenacres post office in Aylesford, which is subject to closure, and the receiving post office that is about a mile away? Access to it will not be possible for people in wheelchairs, and the Post Office is suggesting that such people ring a bell outside, so that counter staff can deal with their requests on the pavement.
</p>








<p><a name="st_15"><a name="41104-01_spnew14"><b> Ms Hewitt: </b>

 Since becoming Secretary of State, I have stayed in very close touch with the federation, and indeed, my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary met its representatives only last week. The federation itself has been calling for an urban reinvention programme&#151;with compensation for sub-postmasters who have to give up their offices&#151;precisely because so many of its members simply cannot make a living.

 (Lab): What recent discussions she has had with Ofgem on fair competition in gas prices.  [195861]
</p>



<p><a name="st_18"><a name="41104-02_spmin0"><b>The Minister for Energy and E-Commerce  (Mr. Mike O&#039;Brien): </b> 
 I have discussed gas market prices with Ofgem. It recently published a report that identified the cause of such rises as the impact on the UK wholesale market of the cost of gas in continental Europe&#151;gas prices there are linked to oil prices, which have obviously risen&#151;and of declining gas production in the North sea.
</p>








<p><a name="st_19"><a name="41104-02_spnew0"><b> Huw Irranca-Davies: </b> 
 My hon. Friend will be aware of the considerable disquiet that exists among residential gas consumers at what seem to be runaway prices in the gas market. I attended a CBI dinner two weeks ago, at which the main topic of conversation was the impact of gas prices on the manufacturing base in south Wales. The manufacturing base in my constituency is very healthy and there are many jobs, but can my hon. Friend give me and employers in my constituency an assurance that gas prices will be brought under control, and that there will be genuine and fair competition in respect of them?
</p>








<p><a name="st_20"><a name="41104-02_spnew1"><b> Mr. O&#039;Brien: </b> 
 A recent report by Oxford Economic Research Associates, published in October, showed that the UK has the most competitive energy market in Europe. Prices are indeed increasing, but from a historically very low base in real terms. Domestic consumers can of course substantially reduce their gas bills by switching suppliers; indeed, a &#163;30 reduction for gas and &#163;20 for electricity is achievable. Customers who can switch their method of payment to direct debit can save up to &#163;13 on their electricity bills and &#163;14 to &#163;26 on their gas bills, and some companies are offering low-cost&#151;or, indeed, free&#151;insulation to pensioners and those on benefit. The owner of a typical 1970s semi that is heated by gas could save up to &#163;130 per annum by using proper insulation. On industrial prices, Ofgem is looking at the way in which the market is operating to ensure that it continues to do so efficiently.
</p>








<p><a name="st_21"><a name="41104-02_spnew2"><b> Malcolm Bruce  (Gordon)</b> 
 (LD): Does the Minister acknowledge Ofgem&#039;s estimate that wholesale energy prices in the UK will rise this winter by &#163;5 billion as a result of these increases, and that that will dramatically increase fuel poverty, hit households hard and undermine the competitiveness of British industry? The fact is that competitiveness within the UK market does not help if we are being undermined by a lack of competitiveness in the European market. Is it not time that the European Commission de-linked the coupling of gas and oil prices and introduced a genuinely 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>4 Nov 2004 : Column 436</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>competitive market? As things stand, we are exporting gas to the continent when prices are low, and importing it back again when prices are at a record high.
</p>








<p><a name="st_22"><a name="41104-02_spnew3"><b> Mr. O&#039;Brien: </b> 
 On the hon. Gentleman&#039;s final point, I certainly agree that we need to get the European Commission to ensure that there is a liberalisation of the energy market in Europe. The increase in oil prices is affecting gas prices, and there is a link to Europe, but if we can ensure a greater degree of liberalisation in the European energy market, we may be able to get some of those prices under more effective control.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41104-02_para0">
<a name="stpa_6">We view the energy sector here as market-based and it has functioned remarkably well in recent years. As I said, domestic customers can reduce their gas bills through energy insulation methods, by switching suppliers and, if they can, by direct debit payment. Those are means by which domestic consumers can make substantial savings on their bills. Ofgem has looked at the way in which the market is operating for&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;industrial customers. It is conducting further investigations into particular issues such as the excessive spike in some prices and will get back to us on that. We are monitoring the issue carefully. It is important and the hon. Gentleman can be sure that the Government take the matter seriously.
</p>








<p><a name="st_23"><a name="41104-02_spnew4"><b> Mr. Mike Hall  (Weaver Vale)</b> 
 (Lab): May I draw my hon. Friend&#039;s attention to the impact of gas prices on INEOS Chlor in Runcorn? The gas price per therm has gone up from 17p to 34p&#151;double the price paid last year, which is costing the firm &#163;170,000 a day extra, &#163;50 million a year more. It has to pay 25 per cent. more for its gas, yet it comes from the same fields that supply continental Europe. What are the Government going to do about it?
</p>








<p><a name="st_24"><a name="41104-02_spnew5"><b> Mr. O&#039;Brien: </b> 
 Ofgem has studied with a great deal of care the way in which the gas market operates and it concluded that wholesale price increases have caused the increases in domestic prices. A number of gas companies have taken the view that they will hold their prices; others that they will increase their prices to their customers. In those circumstances, customers will want to look for companies that will cost them less and consider switching to them to receive lower bills. What we want to do is encourage customers to examine their bills, check with Energywatch to find out who is charging the lowest prices and, where they can, switch. They should also take the other measures that I mentioned, which will also ensure that their bills come down.
</p>








<p><a name="st_25"><a name="41104-02_spnew6"><b> Richard Ottaway  (Croydon, South)</b> 
 (Con): Will the Minister accept that consumers will take with a pinch of salt the idea that savings can be made by switching accounts? When the price of gas fell by nearly half, consumer prices fell by only 10 per cent. The truth of the matter is that when gas prices go up, the consumers take the burden, but when gas prices go down, they do not gain the benefit.
</p>








<p><a name="st_26"><a name="41104-02_spnew7"><b> Mr. O&#039;Brien: </b> 
 I am not sure whether the hon. Gentleman is suggesting that we should dispense with the market and somehow introduce regulation. That would be a volte-face for the Conservatives. As far as we 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>4 Nov 2004 : Column 437</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>are concerned, the consumer has a number of options available. Different consumers will have different available options. It is certainly the case that, on average, switching supplier can save &#163;30 on a gas bill per year, and by switching payment to direct debit a further &#163;26 could be saved on gas bills. Furthermore, if consumers properly insulate, they could save &#163;130 per annum. Some of the companies increasing their prices are making it clear that they will offer some of the insulation free of charge. I might add that replacing an old boiler with a modern, energy-saving one&#151;I accept that it is a capital cost&#151;could bring about savings of up to &#163;120 per annum. Those are quite significant savings that consumers could make, but none of that disputes the fact that the issue is serious and that we are watching the market with a great deal of care.

Under the terms of the 2004 spending review, UKTI will expand its operation over the next three years in order to maintain the UK&#039;s position as the No. 1 location in Europe for attracting inward investment and to increase the quantity and quality of investment into the UK.

 I thank my hon. Friend for that answer which, combined with the recent improvements in the manufacturing sector, demonstrates that Britain is working. However, I want to add the caveat that I am very concerned about regional disparities. The overheating in the south-eastern economy means that areas such as Yorkshire and the Humber could miss out on inward investments and improvements in manufacturing. In his evidence last week to the Environmental Audit Committee, Sir John Egan gave the impression that success should be encouraged to breed success in successful areas, and that we should almost forget the rest. What are the Government doing to counterbalance that sort of approach?

 I am grateful to my hon. Friend for raising that matter. The Government are determined to ensure regionally balanced economic growth right across the UK. That is why, in my hon. Friend&#039;s area, Yorkshire Forward is progressing the agenda of bringing inward investment directly into Yorkshire and Humberside. The Government have put in place a platform of stability, and we want that to be the basis for regional devolution. In turn, that can be a real driver for the economic generation of every part of this country.

The latest figures available to me show that, in 2003&#150;04, 26 inward investment successes were enjoyed by the Northern Ireland Office. I shall be happy to communicate that information to the hon.

One of the challenges for UKTI is to balance the strategic overview available at the centre with the regional reach of agencies such as the WDA. We need to strike a balance between ensuring that we speak with a common voice to the inward investment community around the world&#151;and we should emphasise Britain&#039;s competitiveness without shame or embarrassment&#151;and ensuring that we speak up for those parts of the economy that may not, traditionally, have received as much inward investment as other areas.

 I am grateful to the right hon. Gentleman for that characteristically gracious question. There is of course a technical distinction to be drawn between stock and flows of inward investment, and I would be happy to write to him on the technical point that underpinned the answer given by my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State. However, it ill behoves the Opposition to lecture this Government on the success of inward investment, when Ernst and Young, in a recent report, declared that the UK remains the No. 1 location in Europe for inward investment.

I know that we have a good success story, but I put to him the case of a marvellous investment in the purchase of a company, with promises of expansion and technological development, followed&#151;a couple of years later&#151;by the shift of most production overseas, with the consequent suffering by suppliers. Has that investment had a negative or positive impact?

<p><a name="st_37"><a name="41104-02_spnew17"><b> Mr. Alexander: </b> 
 My hon. Friend raises an important point, which has exercised the Government for several years. We need to ensure that we get best value for money for any public support that is provided for inward investment. Our response is not to turn away inward investment, but to ensure that support is provided to our own indigenous manufacturing base and British companies. That is why we have advanced the research and development tax credit and put in place regional economic development strategies from a foundation of economic strength. We need to ensure that, as well as attracting inward investment, we ensure that we get value for money for it and that we support indigenous British companies.

Substantive negotiations are due to start early in the new year and to be concluded by the end of 2007. While the negotiations are at a very early stage, we will continue to work with the European Commission, other member states and ACP countries to ensure that those agreements deliver their development potential.

First, under the current system of trade preferences, such agreements are not compatible with World Trade Organisation rules, so change must occur.

 I am in full agreement with my hon. Friend. He can look back to the success that we enjoyed at Geneva in July when we achieved a framework for the Doha development agreement, contrary to the pessimism expressed after Cancun.

The challenge now is to achieve the parallelism that was contingent on the agreement&#151;we need a similar response from the United States, and clearly the new trade commissioner will take that forward. If there is scope for further progress, we are determined to be at the forefront.

 I appreciate that the closures are a matter for Post Office Ltd. The criterion it has set to identify deprivation uses ward-based statistics, which, the Government realise, are a blunt instrument.

Will my hon. Friend take that up with Post Office Ltd. and revisit some of its proposals? It should ensure that there is a good case for the closure of post offices in neighbourhood renewal areas.

<p><a name="st_64"><a name="41104-04_spnew7"><b> Jacqui Smith: </b> 
 There will not be a mandatory set of common key performance indicators.

They then have to consider the most appropriate ways to measure that and to report it to shareholders and investors who, because of that process, will be better able to engage with the ongoing governance and running of the company.

 (LD): I am delighted to hear that the Minister needs no encouragement to encourage women in that direction, but she will be aware of her Department&#039;s research that found that women with science, engineering and technology degrees were economically less active than their male counterparts or female non-SET graduates. There is a particular problem when women have had a career break, which makes it difficult for them to return. What is the Minister doing to address these problems?

<p><a name="st_76"><a name="41104-05_spnew5"><b> Jacqui Smith: </b> 
 The hon. Lady is right. That is why one of the programmes of work of the UK Resource Centre, backed up by investment of &#163;1.5 million from the Department for Education and Skills, aims to examine the issues relating to women returners&#151;for example, helping them to keep up to date with scientific research during their career break, helping to train them when they come back into employment, and giving good practice advice to employers about how to bring women back into the workplace and keep them engaged. There is both money and action through the UK Resource Centre aimed at the issue that the hon. Lady identified.

 (LD): What progress has been made in increasing the proportion of women non-executive directors.  [195880]
</p>



<p><a name="st_77"><a name="41104-05_spmin1"><b>The Minister for Women and Equality  (Ms Patricia Hewitt): </b> 
 In 2000, only 57 FTSE 100 non-executive directorships were held by women. That increased in 2003 to 84, but it is still not good enough, which is why we are working with business leaders, recruitment firms and others to widen board recruitment.
</p>








<p><a name="st_78"><a name="41104-05_spnew6"><b> Dr. Cable: </b> 
 How does the Minister explain the fact that whereas women make up 30 per cent. of all company managers, her own figures suggest that they account for only 6 per cent. of the magic circle of non-executive directors, and only 1 per cent. of chairmanships? What is the Laura Tyson initiative, which I think the right hon. Lady launched, helping concretely to deliver in this respect?
</p>








<p><a name="st_79"><a name="41104-05_spnew7"><b> Ms Hewitt: </b> 
 A real problem that was clearly identified in Derek Higgs&#039;s report is that of non-executive directorships being recruited from far too narrow a pool of people who are already known to the existing board members, and particularly the chair. Since the Higgs and Tyson reports, we have held round tables with a series of leading businesses, remuneration committees, headhunters, search firms and so on; we are now working on a document entitled &quot;Better Boards&quot; that 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>4 Nov 2004 : Column 448</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>will be launched later this month, drawing on the business case for widening and diversifying board appointments; and, crucially, we have established a mentoring scheme with 20 chairs and chief executives of the FTSE 100 already signed up to act as mentors to women who are one or two steps below a board-level appointment, but who with the right support will form part of the next generation.
</p>








<p><a name="st_80"><a name="41104-05_spnew8"><b> Mrs. Eleanor Laing  (Epping Forest)</b> 
 (Con): Does the Minister agree that it is somewhat ironic that only 6 per cent. of non-executive directors are women when a non-executive directorship is the perfect job for a woman? We are always talking about flexibility and part-time employment, and that is exactly what a non-executive directorship is. I am pleased to hear what the Minister has said about the &quot;Better Boards&quot; report, and I look forward to seeing it. I find myself strangely in agreement with most of what she has just said, but please will she assure me that she will not go down the road of introducing quotas or coercing companies into employing women? It should not be necessary. The business case itself should convince all companies that the best companies are already employing best practice with regard to women, and I hope that she will continue encouraging and not coercing.
</p>








<p><a name="st_81"><a name="41104-05_spnew9"><b> Ms Hewitt: </b> 
 I entirely agree with the point made by the hon. Lady, and I can happily give her that assurance. We have no intention whatever of imposing Norwegian-style quotas on boards, but I cannot help reflecting that it is rather a pity that the Conservative party proposes to slash through my Department&#039;s budget, and the Liberal Democrats propose to abolish it completely, so no one would be left to pursue the excellent work that she has just welcomed.

 As I said earlier, a large number of programmes are designed to encourage more women and girls to take up education and employment opportunities in engineering, stay in those careers and progress to the top of them.

It is, of course, viable for those companies that depend on engineers to consider ways to help student engineers with their fees, which employers in other industries sometimes do. We have a comprehensive range of activity to get young people, and particularly young women, interested in science, engineering and technology, to get them into university and to keep them in those professions afterwards. We are spending a significant amount of money and are focusing it in the right place.

We need reassurance that those targets are being met, and if they are not being met, we need the opportunity to discuss the reasons why. I ask this during national adoption week and remind the House, with great warmth, that the legislation was about one thing: providing a loving and stable family home for vulnerable children, 25 per cent. of whom never achieve that goal.

 I think that the best thing would be for me to write to the hon. Gentleman about that. There are reasons why we adopt our particular position. It is not because of the lack of intensity of pressure on companies to deliver, or an unwillingness to see the achievement of all the objectives of a procurement stream being implemented within the UK. My experience tells me that there are good reasons why we do not necessarily put these matters under public scrutiny. The hon. Gentleman shrugs his shoulders as if this were a great mystery. My experience in Government tells me that we do not do things lightly, but after long and careful consideration. Sometimes there are good established practices, but it does not mean that we do not consider whether there might be a better way of doing things. I note what the hon.

Equipment procurement is not just about today&#039;s operations. We have to plan over decades, predicting the challenges that our servicemen and women will face in the future and then equip them to meet those challenges.

As a result, this country would not be making the progress that it is making, or building the largest warship since world war two.

<a name="stpa_58">I hope that the hon. Gentleman does not suggest that we should do what other nations do, which is to impose conditions on contracts. That leads to overpriced contracts, which means that we cannot make savings that can be invested in defence spending elsewhere. That balance has to be struck in any procurement decision. We do not have such a protective system and nor did the Conservative Governments of long and distant memory. We have to ensure that we have a robust contract that will deliver on time, on value and on quality. That is what we believe we have achieved in that case.

 The Minister was right to go through the broad aspects of the Army, Navy and Air Force main procurements. Will he say anything about procurement for the Royal Fleet Auxiliary, especially the Military Afloat Reach and Sustainability&#151;or MARS&#151;programme? As he knows, while the two new carriers and the new assault ships are welcome, they will not be sufficiently deployable unless they have support ships to refuel and rearm them in combat. The MARS programme is a substantial programme that will place huge demands on our design and shipbuilding but is vital to the future of the Royal Navy.
</p>








<p><a name="st_104"><a name="41104-13_spnew3"><b> Mr. Ingram: </b> 
 I agree that the MARS programme is important. I am increasingly intrigued by Opposition spokesmen who make demands but never put a ticket price on them. They give lists of everything they want, but deny that they amount to spending commitments. They say that they want us to do this and that, but they never reveal their total commitment in each area. Nor do they ever say what they would take out of the existing programme to make way for their demands. If we are to have an honest and open debate on procurement&#151;

 Well, I have said that the MARS programme is important. Our whole approach to expeditionary warfare requires support shipping. How we pay for that and the timing of its provision are issues for the procurement stream. As I said, we are spending &#163;6 billion this year on procurement and &#163;8 billion to sustain it.

I do not know whether he has yet had sight of the letter from the chairman of Carrington, a company in the north-west, but it reveals that it has been 19 weeks since the contract was award to Cooneen. In that time, the Chinese subcontractor&#151;People&#039;s Liberation Army factory No. 3533 in Chongqing&#151;has not been able to produce fabrics that meet the specifications for tensile strength, tear strength, shrinkage and infra-red reflectance.

 I hear the snide comments from the Opposition. Is it suggested that we should have a trade embargo with China? <i>[Interruption.]</i> Well, it is nice to know that that is not what is suggested. Outsourcing in China is an acceptable part of a process put in place by any prime contractor. All contracts have to be subject to evaluation as they proceed. That happens in all procurement streams, and if contractors do not supply on quality, on time and on the required numbers, the penalty will fall on them. They will then have to find other sourcing methods. If contractors do not deliver, it is their failure and we hold them to account for it. That is exactly what would happen on the contract my hon. Friend mentions. He said that he had a letter about the contract, but several allegations have already been made about it. All of them have been investigated, and the allegations he makes will also be investigated. We owe that to the people who depend on the equipment procured, be it uniforms or the big-ticket items I have already mentioned. We will give consideration to the points that he makes, but making an allegation does not make it a fact or accurate. We will have to examine the allegations.

<br>&nbsp;<br>equipment that we can procure for our armed forces in the future are equally varied and numerous. The capabilities of our armed forces and the military effect that they can deliver are growing year by year. Increasingly, we can combine intelligence with target acquisition, modern communications and precision weaponry. The result is changing the nature of modern warfare. For example, in Iraq, the RAF was able to hit more of its targets with less ordnance and therefore fewer aircraft than ever before: 85 per cent. of our air-dropped munitions were precision-guided bombs. That represents a step change in capabilities over the relatively short period of a decade.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41104-14_para2">
<a name="stpa_65">In the future, military operations will involve the rapid, accurate and decisive delivery of critical military effect at the right moment. Again, to use the jargon, that is known as effects-based warfare, the key to achieving which will be the agility and flexibility of our forces and the platforms that they operate from. Procurement is crucial to delivering that transformation. Too often in the past, procurement decisions were made through replacement thinking&#151;automatically replacing ageing platforms with new ones designed to do much the same job. These days, our procurement decisions are increasingly made on the basis of capability, flexibility and inter-operability. We need adaptable and flexible capabilities that we can use alongside our allies.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41104-14_para3">
<a name="stpa_66">I want to outline three elements of our vision for delivering those capabilities: network-enabled capability; defence industrial policy; and equipment acquisition reform. Let me deal with network-enabled capability first because it is central to effects-based warfare. It is not a weapon, but a concept of war, and it cannot just be bought off the shelf. Put simply, it is a linked network of systems, platforms and headquarters that can all communicate with one another in real time. It allows up-to-date intelligence and information to be delivered exactly where it is needed most, so our commanders achieve the rapid, pinpoint response that we require. That is not just a future aspiration.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41104-14_para4">
<a name="stpa_67">In Iraq, we have seen the difference that networked capability can make. The Mamba artillery detection radar, which is a procurement success story, was recently used in concert with our communications network to pinpoint enemy firing positions. Fire was then brought to bear from coalition aircraft at the precise time and location that it was needed. That is a graphic demonstration that our NEC approach is already paying dividends.

<a name="41104-14_para5">
<a name="stpa_68">At the strategic level, our investment in the Skynet 5 satellite system&#151;the largest private finance initiative contract ever awarded by the MOD&#151;will provide secure communications between strategic decision makers and front-line forces.

 We have very good relations with BAE Systems and all our major suppliers throughout the supply chain. I know about the criticisms that have been made. I have heard people say that there could be corruption at the highest level between the industry and the MOD. If they say that, they must make it stack up. This goes back to the importance and vitality of what we do in procurement and the way in which it delivers not just for individual companies and their employees but for the good of the British economy. Crucially, what the suppliers deliver is vital to our war-fighting and peacekeeping capabilities. I endorse the point of view expressed by the right hon. Gentleman.

Our amphibious capability has been enhanced most recently by the introduction of the assault ship, HMS Albion, in July last year. HMS Albion will be joined by her sister ship, HMS Bulwark, this December. Our future maritime expeditionary force will therefore be better placed to support the land component&#151;a vital element of any military intervention, which is known in the jargon as the boots on the ground. Our future procurement plans will also ensure that the Army is ready for whatever it will face.

We therefore intend to invest about &#163;3 billion over the next 10 years to replace and enhance that capability. The Apache attack helicopter is the most recent addition to our fleet. Apache gained initial operating capability on 28 September, and any hon. Member who has seen it will know that it is an awesome aircraft.

 That would depend on the nature of the proposition when set against the budgets, which is what is being discussed. I accept the premise on which I thought that the hon.

We need to be able to ensure that it will exist when we need it, so we need to talk with industry sensibly and openly, but equally it has to talk to us realistically. We are not involved in a one-way process. We are the main purchaser and we keep the shipyards open.

It was brought into operation early, which speaks volumes for Britain&#039;s defence industry and the quality of our scientists and engineers who ensure that such equipment is delivered. We endorse the C-17 as important heavy-lift equipment. We have consistently supported the principle of the two new aircraft carriers. I have said before that I issued a press release welcoming the Government&#039;s decision to go for the short take-off and vertical landing variant of the joint strike fighter and to incorporate in the design of the carriers the possibility of retrofitting the catapult. There is common ground, but inevitably there are disagreements.

<a name="41104-15_para10">
<a name="stpa_96">Those are not my words, but the conclusion of the Defence Committee. Its recent report on defence procurement exposed how the Government&#039;s procurement process is in almost complete disarray. It is hard to recall when I last read a report by a Committee dominated by Members of Parliament of the governing party that was so overtly critical of the Government, so much so that it led to the extraordinary situation of the Government virtually rejecting the report out of hand. Worse still for the Government, however, is that it was one of a succession of critical reports exposing their inability to get a grip on their procurement process.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41104-15_para11">
<a name="stpa_97">The reports follow on from another series of reports on the Government&#039;s approach to the equipping of our armed forces for the recent Iraq war. All concluded that there was deficiency in the provision of some kit. I remind the Minister that one of our accusations was sustained by the National Audit Office, which said that there was insufficient kit in theatre. It gave three reasons for that. First, there were insufficient stocks on the shelves. It did not entirely criticise the Government for that because it accepted that it was not possible to keep a vast array of kit on the shelves that may not be required. Secondly, there was difficulty in getting some of the kit into theatre. Again, that involves logistics issues, which we all understand. However, the NAO&#039;s third point was that the Government had allowed insufficient time to make up the shortfall of the kit that was not on the shelves. The Government have not been able to defend that serious accusation, which we lay at their door, and we pray in aid the NAO in support of our position.

<a name="stpa_99">That is simply unacceptable. It illustrates the fault at the heart of the Government, not only in equipping our armed forces, but in training them. They did not allow sufficient time for either equipping or training because they were concerned that that would send the message to their Back Benchers that they were preparing for war at the same time as they were negotiating at the United Nations. I am afraid to say that as a result our armed forces were betrayed. Yesterday&#039;s verdict in a court martial further confirms the extent of that betrayal.

 Does the hon. Gentleman agree that the overall judgment of the NAO report was that the operation was a logistical success and that we deployed into theatre in half the time that it took 10 years ago in the first Iraq war?
</p>








<p><a name="st_133"><a name="41104-16_spnew1"><b> Mr. Howarth: </b> 
 Of course I accept that, but I cannot ignore&#151;the House and the country would not want me to&#151;the criticisms that have been made. Those specific and detailed criticisms go to the heart of the Government&#039;s thinking about the planning for the operations. In the world of realpolitik, we understand that it is necessary for a party to carry its Back Benchers with it, but the armed forces must not be sacrificed, and their safety not imperilled, by the political imperative of the Government of the day who are unwilling to face up to their Back Benchers, who might be hostile to military action. The result is that the troops do not get the kit that they want or do not get it in time.
</p>








<p><a name="st_134"><a name="41104-16_spnew2"><b> Mr. Keetch: </b> 
 Is not another example of the point that the hon. Gentleman is making the large number of urgent operational requirement orders that were placed in the run-up to the Iraq war? That clearly shows that forces were being sent without being properly equipped. It is worth remembering that this was not a war that occurred suddenly, like the first Gulf war or the Falklands war. This was a war of our timing, which should not have been started until our forces were ready to begin the conflict properly.
</p>








<p><a name="st_135"><a name="41104-16_spnew3"><b> Mr. Howarth: </b> 
 The hon. Gentleman reinforces my point and I am grateful to him for doing so, particularly as he comes from a slightly different position on these matters. What he says about urgent operational requirements, which amounted to about &#163;500 million, also illustrates the point. However, the National Audit Office was right to say that it would not be reasonable to expect any Government to have on the shelves, ready to use, equipment for 50,000 troops in the Arctic, the desert, temperate climates and so on. We must be reasonable; taxpayers&#039; money is at stake.

Defence expenditure was then 3 per cent. of GDP. By 2005&#150;06 it is set to fall to 2.3 per cent. of GDP, resulting in reductions in equipment, platforms, manpower and overall funding to the front line.

Those are a cloak to mask the cuts resulting from decisions made in No. 11 Downing street.

<b>4 Nov 2004 : Column 486</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>Procurement, Sir Peter Spencer, told the Defence Committee earlier this year that of the seven aims of smart acquisition, only one had been met. The Committee accordingly concluded:

<p>
<a name="41104-16_para15">
<a name="stpa_115">However, the MOD has itself admitted that smart acquisition has not been applied in the way that was envisaged on some of the newer projects, and that it has failed to bring the anticipated improvements to legacy projects, to which the hon. Member for Glasgow, Pollok (Mr. Davidson) just referred. It is not the Committee with which Ministers should be taking issue; rather it is their own chief of defence procurement. It was Sir Peter who predicted that this year&#039;s accounts were likely to present another problem year.

<a name="stpa_116">The problem with smart acquisition is not so much the policy itself but its implementation. The Government&#039;s failure properly to implement their own policy has meant that some of the potential savings, which could have been achieved through improved management of risk, through life management and a partnership with industry, have not been achieved, and it is to those key areas that I wish to turn.

<a name="41104-16_para18">
<a name="stpa_118">Much more needs to be done to manage risk. The SDR sets out that 15 per cent. of a project&#039;s budget should be spent prior to the key decision-making point, known in the trade as main gate, to try to reduce that risk. However, smart acquisition projects have seen only 4.4 per cent. of their total budget being spent prior to main gate, well short of that target of 15 per cent. that the Government have set themselves.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41104-16_para19">
<a name="stpa_119">The Minister has just told us that the Government have taken that message on board, and we welcome that, but they are a long way short of achieving the objective that they themselves have set. It is no good their bleating on that the problems are exclusively with projects started by the last Conservative Government, because Sir Peter admitted last week that one of the reasons smart acquisition projects had not encountered difficulties similar to those of the so-called legacy projects was that they were in the relatively early stages, and could well run into problems later in the procurement cycle when such difficulties traditionally arose. So the answer to the hon. Member for Glasgow, Pollok is that the jury is out on his Government&#039;s own projects. We wait to see whether the Government fulfil their own commitments.

<a name="stpa_128">Another key to achieving the aims of smart acquisition is developing a mature partnership with industry, with both sides working together from a project&#039;s inception through to the completion of its service life. Government and industry need to be honest with each other on costs, capability and time issues. I agree with the Minister. This is not simply a matter for the Government; industry has a role to play here. It involves setting achievable budgets and in-service dates. If the Government set a budget that is too low simply to gain Treasury approval, or industry gave a low estimate in order to win a contract, the result would be escalating costs later in the process. Equally, if for political reasons the Government set an unrealistic in-service date and industry accepted such an estimate, the result would be time slippages.

 Yes, of course. We were the architects of the introduction of extensive competition into defence procurement, which resulted in a considerable saving for the British taxpayer and a sharpening-up of British industry. We must also face the fact that the defence industrial base is contracting not only in this country but around Europe and in the United States. We must also address security of supply.

<a name="stpa_132">The Minister told the Select Committee that he seeks the answer to the question: which essential capabilities does this country require? We understand that point and are doing our own work to see whether common ground exists or whether we disagree on the capabilities that it is necessary to retain in the United Kingdom. Given the contracting defence industrial base, we must address the essential issues. I hope that I have made our policy clear: we believe that it is essential to work with industry and to even out the peaks and troughs so that we can retain the skills base in the United Kingdom to ensure that essential capability is maintained.

<a name="stpa_133">I do not want to take too long on individual projects, but the Minister inevitably raised Typhoon.

Will the Minister give the House an assurance that the Government expect to sign off tranche 2 by the end of the year?

Ministers later backtracked from their initial position and dismissed out of hand a joint proposal last year by BAE, Alvis and Thales to work with the MOD to develop that project. So much for the partnership with industry. Months passed while the MOD was reviewing its procurement strategy.

<p>
<a name="41104-17_para7">
<a name="stpa_139">Later, the Government announced their intention to establish a systems house to reassess the entire project, adding at least another year to the process. The Minister appointed W S Atkins to undertake the assessment phase. When does he expect it to be completed? In a recent interview in <i>Jane&#039;s Defence Weekly</i>, the chief of defence procurement, when discussing the FRES project, stated:


</p>

<a name="stpa_141">The CDP&#039;s statement would be fair, were it not for the fact that Ministers had already set an in-service date of 2009, which subsequently slipped to 2010. The Minister cast doubt on the achievability of that in-service date in a written answer last month to my hon.

<a name="stpa_143">Can the Minister tell us how much he has set aside for the FRES project, which the Chief of the General Staff, General Sir Mike Jackson, regards as absolutely essential? There has been some speculation that the programme&#039;s lifetime cost could be as much as &#163;50 billion on top of the initial &#163;6 billion figure. Again, we would welcome clarification from the Minister on that point. It is little wonder that a senior infantry officer was quoted in <i>The Daily Telegraph</i> on 2 October as saying that the FRES programme had turned into &quot;a debacle&quot;.

<p>
<a name="41104-17_para12">

<a name="41104-17_para14">
<a name="stpa_146">Serious questions remain over the future of the project to design and build the carriers. First, the Government announced that they wanted the MOD to take a risk-sharing part in the programme, leading BAE&#039;s former chairman, Sir Richard Evans, to express the concern that the three-way alliance was developing into:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_16">&quot;some sort of a procurement committee, chaired by a procurement officer from the Ministry of Defence who will have a balancing vote on the committee&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="41104-17_para15">
<a name="stpa_147">He was rightly concerned about where and with whom the responsibility for risks resides and whether a committee is the right decision-making body. Have those concerns, which were raised by one of the prime contractors in the carrier project, yet been attended to?
</p>

<p>
<a name="41104-17_para16">
<a name="stpa_148">The decision to introduce a physical integrator for the carrier project represents little more than an added layer of bureaucracy on an already cumbersome project. As I said at Defence questions last Monday, the contract is not, as has been reported, for the management of the project, but rather it is the contract for the management of the contract for the management of the carrier project, which is extremely convoluted.

<a name="stpa_149">On the joint combat aircraft, which was formerly known as the joint strike fighter, reports persist about continuing problems with the short take-off and vertical landing variant. Can the Minister confirm that the weight problems with the STOVL variant have been resolved? I understand that those problems have not been resolved, giving rise to concerns that the aircraft will carry only two 1,000 lb bombs instead of the planned 2,000 lb bombs. As <i>Jane&#039;s Defence Weekly</i> put it:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_17">&quot;the requirement has now been made to fit the aircraft, instead of the other way around&quot;.</p>

<p>
<a name="41104-17_para20">
<a name="stpa_152">A decision to abandon the STOVL variant would mean the new carriers being fitted with catapults to launch conventional aircraft.

However, the fact is that we are partners, and the Prime Minister deserves some dividend for his support. The Minister is more aware than I of the damage that the Prime Minister has incurred from his own side. One dividend should be to get the ITAR waiver&#151;which, I remind the House, concerns unclassified information.

We believe that the overwhelming evidence is that they are failing to deliver. Their failure to invest in research will have deeply damaging consequences for Britain&#039;s defence industrial base in years to come, their reliance on new technology gizmos at the expense of numbers of tanks, ships and aircraft will expose our armed forces to real risk, and their inability to manage the procurement process has proved costly to an already stretched defence budget.

<a name="41104-18_para8">
<a name="stpa_166">In fairness, the extent of the current defence procurement programme and budget is formidable in terms of ensuring that our armed forces are among the best in the world. The cost of the top 20 projects for 2002&#150;03 was in excess of &#163;50 billion. I am very pleased about that. We have already heard about the joint strike fighter and Typhoon. In our much maligned report, we listed the top 20 projects; it is an impressive list. We welcomed the fact that the Government are spending more on defence. I do not believe the figures cited by the hon. Member for Aldershot. The Government are giving procurement a great deal of attention. Much of what they have done is to be supported, and we did so in our report.

<a name="stpa_167">The procurement of high-tech, cutting-edge equipment is not easy, but lessons from the past need to be learned and acted on. Some of our previous reports pointed to the risks if equipment programmes are not managed properly. Those reports go back years. I have been on the Defence Committee since 1980, and we have produced endless critiques of the defence procurement process. In our report on the strategic defence review, we discussed the major inquiries&#151;the Gibb-Zuckerman in 1961, Downey in the mid-60s, and Levene in the mid-80s&#151;and looked into smart procurement. Those were all serious attempts to do something that we have never done as a country&#151;to produce defence equipment effectively, on time, and to cost.

<a name="stpa_168">We are still striving for that, and progress has been made. In our highly-criticised report, we said that the system is not yet succeeding&#151;indeed, there have been several failures. The report was based on our own methodology. We have a full-time member of staff seconded from the National Audit Office, we undertake an annual review of the defence procurement process, and we read the NAO material and all sorts of documentation. Many of our criticisms came from the chief of defence procurement. How can we be criticised for citing the senior guy in the procurement process apart from the Minister? That is indefensible.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41104-18_para11">
<a name="stpa_169">We pointed out that the top 20 defence procurement projects for 2002&#150;03 had experienced in-year cost increases totalling &#163;3.1 billion and that those projects had slipped a further 18 months beyond their expected delivery date, with nine months&#039; slippage occurring in 2002&#150;03. However, the report highlighted several good things, including the successful de-risking of the 2087 sonar radar project&#151;2087 is not the projected in-service date.

<a name="stpa_175">In addition to the poor headline performance figures for 2002&#150;03, the most disappointing findings from our inquiry were the evidence provided by the chief of defence procurement, Sir Peter Spencer, head of the DPA. Sir Peter had commissioned an independent review of the DPA, referred to by the Minister, and specifically of the implementation of the smart procurement initiative. He told us in an evidence session that the findings from the review included the following: the underlying causes of poor performance were endemic; only one of the seven key principles underlying smart procurement had been implemented in full; there was a misunderstanding throughout the MOD as to what project leaders were expected to deliver; and some of the projects that had commenced following the introduction of the smart acquisition process were showing signs of problems.

 I am sure that my right hon.

<a name="stpa_182">The Government&#039;s response suggested that the Committee should have highlighted the success of the procurement of items.

In the DPA&#039;s annual report and accounts for 2003&#150;04, published in October, the chief of defence procurement says that the agency failed to achieve its targets on programme slippage, cost growth and customer satisfaction. He added:

<a name="41104-19_para7">
<a name="stpa_189">My point is that things have gone right in many instances. The budget is going up and the programme set out by the Government to acquire weapons to equip our armed forces for the future is formidable and commendable. I admire what they have done. They are trying to achieve almost the impossible. Many previous Governments have failed in the task. The Government have begun the process and made progress but, unfortunately, failures have occurred. It is incumbent on the Defence Committee to point out those failures. If the Minister does not like the message, he should not shoot the messengers, because most of them are in the pay of the Ministry of Defence. I ask him to tell the person who wrote the document that slags us off that he should perhaps have approached us privately so that we could exchange views. We are trying to be constructive, not destructive.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41104-19_para8">
<a name="stpa_190">The budget constraints are obvious, and we need to get the best equipment that we can afford. The Minister, his colleagues and I remain good friends. I have had my famous discussion with a nameless person and I emerged in one piece. We are on the same side. Even the Opposition are part of the process of considering how best to serve our armed forces with the money available. I hope that our comments, those of Ministry of Defence employees, and of internal mechanisms, can be acted on. I hope that lessons will be learned, without rancour or excessive anger. We can then collectively deliver to our armed forces the right amount of high-quality equipment that is good enough for them. They deserve the best and perhaps we can collectively help them to get the best equipment so that they can do what we ask of them.

<br>&nbsp;<br>the matters that need discussion, not only for our armed forces, but for taxpayers, constituents and the country. We should be able to do that in a helpful and constructive, rather than a destructive, spirit.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41104-19_para9">
<a name="stpa_191">A fortnight ago, we debated defence in the world, which clearly demonstrated our enormous current defence commitments, not least in Afghanistan and Iraq. In the context of Iraq, I want to comment on some &quot;breaking news&quot;&#151;the phrase that appears on television screens. The Black Watch is apparently deploying to a larger geographical area. Although I do not have the exact details, I hope that the Minister will make a statement at the end of the debate. On 21 October, the Secretary of State said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_30">&quot;The deployment is limited in scope, time and space&quot;.&#151;[<i>Official Report</i>, 21 October 2004; Vol. 425, c. 1037.]</p>

</p>

<p>
<a name="41104-19_para10">
<a name="stpa_192">I hope that the breaking news does not contravene that, and that later we will understand what constitutes the enlargement of the geographical area.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41104-19_para11">
<a name="stpa_193">I place on record again our admiration of and support for the bravery and professionalism of all our troops, especially in the difficult times that they are experiencing, leading up to what we all hope will be successful elections in Iraq in the new year. I am pleased that presidential elections, although they may not have been perfect, were held in Afghanistan. We wish President Karzai the very best in trying to take his country forward.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41104-19_para12">
<a name="stpa_194">The annual opportunity to consider defence procurement policy provides us with the chance of considering individual high-profile projects. The two previous speakers have spent approximately an hour going through two aspects of those high-profile and costly projects. However, I hope that the debate also provides us with an opportunity to explore the changing strategic environment in which long-term decisions have to be made. The United Kingdom is&#151;I suspect, not for the first time&#151;at a crossroads in several matters, which will have a significant bearing on those decisions. I should like to consider them briefly.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41104-19_para13">
<a name="stpa_195">The hon. Member for Aldershot (Mr. Howarth) alluded to the first aspect, which is the relationship on foreign affairs and defence with the United States of&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;America and the European Union. Without unnecessarily repeating the catalogue of events that led up to the conflict in Iraq, we must surely recognise that if we move ever closer to the USA in foreign policy, it will inevitably affect relationships with our European partners. It is also likely to determine the shape of our defence assets.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41104-19_para14">
<a name="stpa_196">The necessity for compatibility with US equipment when fighting alongside each other is clear and obvious and such a policy has significant cost implications. Unless compatibility is also possible with our European partners, we face either expensive duplication or possible value for money integration. It would be ideal, as the Minister said in his opening speech, if we could harmonise in Europe and be compatible with the USA. I am not clear about whether that will be possible on a medium and long-term basis.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41104-19_para15">
<a name="stpa_197">Secondly, procurement spending appears increasingly polarised between expensive technology and what might be considered low-tech personnel numbers. As greater technological advances are made in our weapons and communications equipment, it is 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>4 Nov 2004 : Column 499</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>tempting and seductive to believe that fewer fighting troops are necessary. Yet is clear that, although impressive technology was able to win the brief war in Iraq, the lack of troops on the ground to patrol the borders and secure arms dumps, vital oil installations and other infrastructure dramatically changed military planning. We need both, and expenditure and focus on one should not compromise the provision of the other.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41104-19_para16">
<a name="stpa_198">Thirdly, I want to consider the importance of the UK defence industry. Again, much has been said about that with which I agree. Its importance in security of supply and economic value to the UK cannot be overestimated, yet we must ensure that our armed forces get the best possible equipment and that the taxpayer gets value for money. As the Chairman of the Select Committee pointed out, those decisions are sometimes incredibly complex and difficult. We do not criticise to make a point&#151;we acknowledge that decisions are difficult&#151;but we want to try to understand all the parameters.
</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200304/cmhansrd/vo041104/debtext/41104-20.htm"/>







<p><a name="st_155"><a name="41104-20_spnew0"><b> Mr. Davidson: </b> 
 The hon. Gentleman says that there are difficult decisions. Will he disown the comments of the Liberal Democrat Lord Garden, who recently said that he wanted the order for aircraft carriers to be placed in the United States and the aircraft carriers to be built in Norfolk, Virginia?
</p>








<p><a name="st_156"><a name="41104-20_spnew1"><b> Mr. Breed: </b> 
 I was not aware of that and I hope that the aircraft carriers will be built here. There is every hope that that will happen. However, it would be interesting to examine the cost comparisons so that we understood the issues. Sometimes the definitions of value for money&#151;and the definitions in general&#151;are not sufficiently broad. When I read the report, it took me a while to understand the term &quot;de-risking&quot;. I believed that it meant to get rid of risk, but it means risk assessment. Why use &quot;de-risk&quot; to mean risk assessment? I worked in an industry that considered risk and reward all the time. It is not possible to remove all risk but we can try to assess some risk and make cost comparisons.
</p>








<p><a name="st_157"><a name="41104-20_spnew2"><b> Mr. Ingram: </b> 
 If the cost comparator said that it was cheaper to build abroad, would that become Liberal policy?
</p>








<p><a name="st_158"><a name="41104-20_spnew3"><b> Mr. Breed: </b> 
 Decisions would not be made purely on cost comparisons. We must acknowledge that value for money contains far more elements than the actual cost of building a vessel. If, as I understand it, the life span is 50 years, that will have all sorts of implications for the economy, and so on. There is no reason why we cannot be honest and mature enough to examine how much production might cost in different places, and to consider the benefits.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41104-20_para0">
<a name="stpa_199">Such objectives sometimes seem incompatible. I do not believe that they are, but our instinct must be to buy British where possible. Because of globalisation, however, the necessity of joint ventures and the scale of some defence programmes, the international defence industry is shrinking in terms of the number of companies involved, particularly with the capacity to undertake such programmes. With the huge US defence budget and the nationalistic calls from American politicians to buy only American, it will be more difficult to maintain an independent UK defence industry. The 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>4 Nov 2004 : Column 500</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>Government have indicated that they do not consider ownership of a company important provided that it remains based in the UK, with all the employment opportunities and with some safeguards for intellectual property rights. I do not take that view, as I believe that joint ventures as well as mergers and acquisitions provide Trojan horses, which could by stealth appropriate the component parts of our defence industry.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41104-20_para1">
<a name="stpa_200">This brings me to the last of my crossroads concerns&#151;research and development, which has been touched on in previous contributions. The Government have rightly indicated that the UK&#039;s future economic fortune lies in knowledge-based industries at the heart of which is research and development. There are three vital elements to successful research and development in any field, but they are perhaps most important in defence: a supply of highly intelligent and motivated people; considerable financial resources; and an appropriate Government policy. It is interesting to note from today&#039;s newspaper that seven of the top 10 universities in the world are American, and perhaps we ought to congratulate Oxford and Cambridge on being the only two UK universities in the top 10. As regards funding, the vast majority of venture capital funds now available for R and D are located in the USA. And the enormous programme of public expenditure by the US Government provides an attractive background to R and D projects, allied to a most attractive corporate taxation policy to encourage R and D in companies at all levels.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41104-20_para2">
<a name="stpa_201">We are rightly concerned about the admissions policy of our universities, and hon. Members have engaged in all kinds of debates recently on that. While we are debating, however, American universities are scouring the world and Europe in particular to offer attractive packages to the very best students, with the prospect of US citizenship at the end. In no way do I present this scenario as an anti-American rant, but as a recognition of the USA&#039;s clear, co-ordinated policies to assemble a defence industry that has the capability for significant domination in the foreseeable future. It is therefore vital for us to recognise that our procurement policies will have to take into account those realities. I hope that that gives my view in terms of work that may go out of this country to the USA in particular.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41104-20_para3">
<a name="stpa_202">I want to turn to a few current concerns. Mention has already been made of the Astute submarine programme, and especially the delays that have been experienced. I have recently been made aware of the operational vulnerability of our existing Trafalgar class submarines. I understand that HMS Torbay and HMS Tireless have been withdrawn from service and are undergoing further expert assessment at Devonport. I readily pay tribute to the highest safety standards that are adopted at Devonport when dealing with our nuclear-powered submarine fleet. Clearly, safety is of the utmost importance not only to those who sail on those ships but to those who do the work at Devonport. It places inevitable strains on the existing submarine fleet if replacements are delayed, however, and we are likely to experience technological difficulties in ships that are probably among the most complex pieces of machinery in the world today. Increasingly, lengthy delays will be&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;experienced, exposing some of the problems with&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;replacements. If the Minister cannot provide 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>4 Nov 2004 : Column 501</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>clarification of the current situation of those two submarines in Devonport in his wind-up, I would be grateful if he could write to me.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41104-20_para4">
<a name="stpa_203">As we have indicated previously, we wholeheartedly support the carrier programme and would welcome the Minister&#039;s confirmation of the current situation. Reference has already been made to that. In an intervention, my hon. Friend the Member for Hereford (Mr. Keetch) mentioned the Military Afloat Reach and Sustainability project in an attempt to understand the thinking of the MOD in respect of the MARS and carrier programmes, as it appears that they are inextricably linked. If our warship yards cannot cope with the construction of eight to 10 ships for the MARS programme at the same time as the construction of aircraft carriers, we would like some understanding of the thinking on how to tackle that programme. If they can be constructed at the same time as carriers, in this country, I would be only too pleased to hear it.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41104-20_para5">
<a name="stpa_204">Finally, I want to refer to the results of the MOD internal survey, which was published only a few months ago. I hope that the Minister agrees that it provides some alarming figures. Two thirds of those questioned are spending their own money on extra equipment because they do not have confidence in the MOD issue, and nearly half our soldiers in Iraq have no confidence in their fighting kit. Furthermore, a constituent of one of my hon. Friends who is the mother of a Royal Marine serving in Iraq at the moment has advised me that the Marines cannot operate effectively at night because there are only eight pairs of night-sight goggles for a total of 800 men. That seems extraordinary and I would therefore welcome the Minister&#039;s comments.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41104-20_para6">
<a name="stpa_205">The same survey revealed that 39 per cent. of soldiers do not feel valued by the Army and that 35 per cent. felt that morale was very low. When asked, &quot;Does the MOD look after its personnel?&quot;, only 3 per cent. of respondents strongly agreed, and 32 per cent. somewhat agreed, leaving 62 per cent. who either did not know or did not believe that the MOD looked after its staff. Furthermore, 35 per cent. of soldiers were critical of the frequency of the operation of tours, while 87 per cent. of the RAF said that they were overstretched, with 20 per cent. working more than 50 hours a week. I hope that the Minister at least finds those figures as worrying as I do, and will seek to address some of the underlying problems. Again, I would be appreciative of his views in his wind-up.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41104-20_para7">
<a name="stpa_206">I think that it is agreed across the House&#151;at least I hope so&#151;that we need to ensure that our forces have the best and most effective equipment, and yet it is clear from the survey that that does not seem to be the case. I readily accept that no one can provide everything without reference to cost, but in the total sum game, the amount spent as a proportion of total expenditure on basic kit and basic equipment cannot be large. I would hope that some reprioritising of expenditure, bearing in mind the huge costs of some of the big-ticket items mentioned this afternoon, can be made so that we can at least ensure that no member of the armed forces would feel compelled to purchase additional kit with their own hard-earned cash in order to feel more confident in the dangerous situations to which we send them.

<p><a name="st_159"><a name="41104-20_spnew4"><b> Mr. David Crausby  (Bolton, North-East) (Lab):</b> 
 I shall begin by making the obvious statement that it is undeniable that our armed forces deserve&#151;indeed, must have&#151;the very best equipment and support services available. They are, after all, men and women who risk life and limb in our defence on an increasingly regular basis. Whenever there is a conflict between the safety of our troops and buying British, we must have no hesitation in coming down on the side of protecting our brave servicemen and women. Cost is obviously an important issue, but we would be wise to take a sensibly balanced view in the procurement process, so as to deliver a secure supply of defence-related products and services in the long and medium term.

</p>

<p>
<a name="41104-20_para8">
<a name="stpa_207">The safety of our forces notwithstanding, the most secure and dependable supply is, of course, a local supply, manufactured and delivered by the UK in the UK. The end of the cold war has completely changed western defence priorities, and the globalisation of the industry has put enormous strain on both defence manufacturers and the trade unions. The trade unions have dealt with and accepted enormous numbers of job losses over recent years, and defence manufacturers, for their part, have continued to invest, in spite of difficult trading conditions.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41104-20_para9">
<a name="stpa_208">Despite this revolution in the industry, the UK has been able to maintain its position as the world&#039;s second largest defence supplier; and so we ought to be, as we are, after all, the world&#039;s second largest defence importer as well. This is not just a one-way process, with UK manufacturers demanding more of the defence budget. The size of the budget is in many ways dictated by the size of our industry and its ability to produce. As the British defence supply chain declines, the temptation to cut the budget will increase.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41104-20_para10">
<a name="stpa_209">The UK&#039;s defence industry is one of which we should be enormously proud. While I accept the Minister&#039;s comment that without the MOD there would not be a British shipbuilding industry, I must point out that without the British shipbuilding industry there would not be an MOD&#151;or, indeed, a British nation, other than one that might well be French or Spanish-speaking. This is very much a two-way process. The UK defence industry is world-class, and it should be valued in the same way as we value our armed forces themselves. It contains irreplaceable talents and skills, and it is vital to our independent ability to protect ourselves and our nation.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41104-20_para11">
<a name="stpa_210">The UK has the most open defence market in the world, but our openness to others is not always reciprocated. Does anyone really believe, for example, that the French would allow us to build their aircraft carriers, or the Chinese would dress their soldiers in Lancashire cotton? I doubt very much that either of those things could happen.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41104-20_para12">
<a name="stpa_211">The defence industrial policy launched in October 2002 was an important step in the right direction, but it was long overdue. The order for Hawk trainer jets was secured only at a very late stage, after some very serious arm-twisting. Sir Richard Evans, the then chairman of BAE Systems, told the Defence Committee that the recommendation from the Defence Procurement Agency was to acquire the Italian Aermacchi aircraft rather than the British Hawk, and that in coming to that 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>4 Nov 2004 : Column 503</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>recommendation no account had been taken of the additional value to the UK of purchasing the Hawk. He went on to say that the Indian Government had placed an order for 66 Hawks only after the British Government&#039;s eventual decision to buy British, and that he could genuinely see us being able to sell 400 to 500 such aircraft worldwide. Well, we shall see, but one thing is absolutely certain: none of that would be possible without the MOD order. After all, who would expect the Indian Government to buy the Hawk if the British Government had not been prepared to?
</p>

<p>
<a name="41104-20_para13">
<a name="stpa_212">The eventual decision by the Secretary of State to secure the Hawk trainer was a brave and sensible one that was obviously made in Britain&#039;s interests, and I suppose that this example demonstrates the success of the defence industrial policy in the end. Why, though, did he have to make the decision at such a late stage? One of the six overarching themes of defence industrial policy is maximising economic benefit to the UK from defence expenditure. The Americans do not appear to be so reticent in protecting their manufacturing base. They are not quite as enthusiastic as we are about being fair and open to foreign competition. That is clearly demonstrated by their reluctance to grant even an unclassified waiver of the international traffic in arms regulations to the UK, which is disgraceful. I greatly appreciated the Minister&#039;s robust comments on the waiver in his opening speech, and we strongly support his efforts to overturn the decision.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41104-20_para14">
<a name="stpa_213">America&#039;s argument in favour of the regulations is that it should not export its technology to the industries of untrustworthy countries. That is understandable, but Canada has done so and enjoys free trade with the United States. The question is, who will George Bush turn to first when he needs a reliable military ally&#151;Canada or the UK? There is an urgent need for the President to deliver on the ITAR waiver. The White House has no excuses now that the Republicans are clearly in control. Failure to deliver will inevitably damage our special relationship. Without full access, we are entitled to ask why we should stick our neck out in support of the United States if it does not trust us with its technology. The denial of the waiver delivers a huge and unfair advantage to American companies.

 I agree with what the hon. Gentleman is saying about ITAR, but the question that must be asked&#151;perhaps he knows the answer&#151;is whether the Prime Minister has asked that favour of the US Government, and if so, what the response from his friend George Bush was.
</p>








<p><a name="st_161"><a name="41104-21_spnew1"><b> Mr. Crausby: </b> 
 The Prime Minister has not confided in me personally, but my understanding is that the White House is very much in favour of the waiver, and support from the President is there. The problem lies with Congress, and people such as Congressman Hunter. My point is that as we move into a second and strong presidential term, the President should redouble his efforts to ensure that Congress delivers. As I have said, the lack of a waiver gives American companies an unfair advantage. Not only are there obvious commercial difficulties in having to license thousands of individual components, but delays could make effective competition virtually impossible.

<a name="stpa_214">Increasingly, UK companies are trying to get around American protectionism by buying up US companies. Therein lies another problem. Many of our major enterprises are forced to employ nearly as many workers in the US as in the UK. If we do not halt that drift, Britain will rapidly become the low-tech end of the business, completely reliant on other countries and their Governments. If that is coupled with the purchase by overseas companies of UK defence manufacturers, we could end up with just the unskilled and outdated end of the business.

<a name="41104-21_para1">
<a name="stpa_215">The globalisation of high-tech manufacturing is of course inevitable. With a level playing field, the British defence industry can compete with anyone in the world; but defence industrial policy must ensure that the UK has maximum exposure to new technologies. British taxpayers and British politicians will be best persuaded to invest in defence when they can see that the wealth of our nation benefits as a result.

<p><a name="st_162"><a name="41104-21_spnew2"><b> Mr. Peter Viggers  (Gosport) (Con):</b> 
 Thank you, Madam Deputy Speaker, for giving me the opportunity to follow my Defence Committee colleague, the hon. Member for Bolton, North-East (Mr. Crausby). Of course, our thoughts today are with our armed forces, many of whom are being put at risk on our behalf. Our objective is to contribute to the discussion in order to ensure that they have the best possible equipment available to them.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41104-21_para2">
<a name="stpa_216">The facts have been rehearsed by several hon. Members. The 20 largest projects in defence procurement cost &#163;51.9 billion&#151;a massive sum&#151;excluding the two most sensitive, which are not recorded. In 2002&#150;03, some &#163;3.7 billion-worth of defence equipment was delivered, but there was a slippage&#151;an increase in cost&#151;of &#163;3.1 billion. Looked at in one way, that means that we are scarcely making any progress at all. There was a 6 per cent. increase in costs and an 18-month slippage in programmes. Nine months of that slippage occurred in the last year, so in that time only three months of real progress was being made. Moreover, although the Defence Procurement Agency said that it expected to spend 15 per cent. of programme costs on investment in de-risking, only 5 per cent. was actually spent. So the smart procurement initiative&#151;now known as smart acquisition&#151;aim of &quot;faster, cheaper, better&quot; is not being met.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41104-21_para3">
<a name="stpa_217">With the possible exception of Ministers, we all enjoyed very much the speech of the right hon. Member for Walsall, South (Mr. George), Chairman of the Defence Committee, in which he robustly defended the Committee&#039;s report. It was accurate in every case, and every allegation and statement can be fully justified. The Government&#039;s description of it as &quot;disappointing and flawed&quot; is completely incorrect. I take part in this debate with relish, and I am happy to associate myself with some of the more critical sections of the report. It is not a habit in this House for a Member to be identified with a particular phrase in a report, but I am proud to be associated with some of this report&#039;s more robust language.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41104-21_para4">
<a name="stpa_218">We have to ask ourselves what has gone wrong. How can it be that a respected Committee&#039;s report can describe the programme as &quot;woeful&quot;, which indeed it 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>4 Nov 2004 : Column 505</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>was? Smart procurement was introduced some six years ago, and it is highly charged with management consultant-speak. My background is in business, and I used to have ministerial responsibility for economic development in Northern Ireland&#151;I was responsible for the privatisations of Harland and Wolff and of Short Brothers&#151;so I do not regard myself as completely ingenuous when it comes to business matters. However, even though I listened carefully for about an hour when I attended my first smart procurement presentation many years ago, I did not really understand what those present were talking about. The presentation was completely suffused with management consultant-speak. Ordinary, normal people find it difficult to tune into such language, which was full of &quot;main-gates&quot; and special technical phrases. One needed a dictionary to understand what was being said.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41104-21_para5">
<a name="stpa_219">We have reached the stage where the director of defence procurement is offering an amnesty for honest forecasts, and there is a gap in targets. For example, the Ministry of Defence says that there is a 50 per cent. likelihood of a target being met in five years, whereas the DPA is talking about a 90 per cent. certainty of meeting a target in six years&#151;so they are not even talking about the same targets. Every project has to jump through the same hoops, and as so often with this Government, they have created a set of artificial targets and are spending an inordinate amount of money and time trying to meet them. Exactly the same thing is happening in the national health service. The Defence Committee Chairman, whose speech I am trying to develop, said that things have gone wrong; I am trying to work out why.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41104-21_para6">
<a name="stpa_220">In the NHS, micro-management has resulted in the Government setting targets in order to decide whether a hospital should get stars. They set targets for waiting times in accident and emergency units, for example. I know that my own local hospital had to work for weeks in advance to build up to its target week when it would be checked for its accident and emergency times. Having reached the target, it wound down from there. Doctors&#039; leave was cancelled in order to meet the target in the particular week, but it was subsequently restored. Having to meet the target distorted the work of the hospital for months.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41104-21_para7">
<a name="stpa_221">Exactly the same is happening in defence procurement. The Defence Procurement Agency sets artificial targets and people have to meet them rather than the interests of efficiency. The way ahead must be to develop a team of trained service personnel who have experience within the armed forces. They can move over to the procurement field when they have built up service experience.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41104-21_para8">
<a name="stpa_222">The Defence Committee provides a similar sort of analysis in paragraph 14 on page 47 of its report:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_31">&quot;MoD estimates that Smart Acquisition has resulted in savings of &#163;2 billion. However, given that the Chief of Defence Procurement has acknowledged that only one of the seven principles of Smart Acquisition has been implemented, we have no confidence in the reliability of this estimate.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="stpa_223">These are the key words:

<br>&nbsp;<br></ul>



<b>4 Nov 2004 : Column 506</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br><ul>procurement should be measured by objective standards and not just by reference to the seven principles that the MoD has itself adopted.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="41104-21_para10">
<a name="stpa_224">Smart acquisition has at its kernel the point that a task is de-risked at the beginning, but how can we de-risk a project? Let us take the example of the two huge new aircraft carriers, which we all fervently hope will eventually materialise. How do we decide whether the joint strike fighter, with its short take-off and vertical landing role, will be able to meet its requirements? We all know that there is a significant weight risk with the VSTOL joint strike fighter, but how can we possibly work out whether the technical problems will be overcome, and how can any commercial manufacturing company be prepared to take the risk of the project not working properly? It simply does not work. The Public Accounts Committee made the point that it is unreasonable to expect commercial companies to bear the risk, however much study is put into the project at the beginning.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41104-21_para11">
<a name="stpa_225">The only way ahead is to have a trained team of people. Having spoken to a wide range of people in the armed forces over a long period, I would submit that people involved in defence procurement need to have military, hands-on, armed services experience. We need to work in the long term to build up a team of trained and suitably qualified people from the outset and give them hands-on military experience for, shall we say, 10 or 12 years. At the age of, shall we say, 32 to 35 at the rank of, shall we say, major, these people would move over and take over long-term procurement projects. The long term is important: we cannot expect people to pick up a full understanding of major projects in a short period.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41104-21_para12">
<a name="stpa_226">The concept of drafting in Army, Navy and Air Force personnel for the standard billet of two and a half to three years and expecting them to be able to pick up and run with the ball is just not realistic. We need a cadre of people, perhaps comparable to the old Royal Corps of Naval Constructors. They usually had services experience before they moved in to become professional experts in their particular fields. I urge the Government to go down that road, to develop a cadre of trained people and then to trust them. We cannot second-guess them all the time; we must put them in position and let them manage. I would maintain that the besetting fault of this Government in particular, and of socialism generally, is that they love micro-management and believe that everything can be controlled from the centre.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41104-21_para13">
<a name="stpa_227">I want to make three more brief points. First, we should enhance co-operation with other nations. If the chairman of British Airways said that he wanted aircraft to be designed to his specifications, we would all think that he had gone barking mad and that the company would go out of business. However, the Army, the Royal Navy and the Royal Air Force all have equipment specially designed for them, and the same is true in France, Germany and most other countries.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41104-21_para14">
<a name="stpa_228">Governments are protectionist when it comes to defence procurement, and hon. Members, who have the interests of their constituents at heart, are also naturally protectionist in that respect. However, we must steel ourselves to recognise that procurement is not a job creation scheme. Adopting more long-term thinking about defence procurement means that we will work 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>4 Nov 2004 : Column 507</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>more closely with other nations. In that way, the cost to taxpayers will be reduced, and defence forces will receive equipment that is the most cost-effective possible.

<p><a name="st_163"><a name="41104-22_spnew0"><b> Mr. Gerald Howarth: </b> 
 I understand my hon. Friend&#039;s rationale, but is not one of the difficulties with collaborative programmes the fact that, on average, they are some 40 per cent. more expensive? That is a result of the collaborative element. The difficulty lies in trying to harmonise common requirements without compromising on the capability that is aimed for, and in banging together heads in Europe in an attempt to keep the costs down.
</p>








<p><a name="st_164"><a name="41104-22_spnew1"><b> Mr. Viggers: </b> 
 My hon. Friend is right to say that collaborative projects are more expensive. That is why we must be much more strategic in our thinking, so that one country takes the lead in developing a tank, for example, while another takes the lead in developing a ship, and another in developing an aircraft. However, that would require a level of statesmanship that is not evident anywhere in Europe, or even in the UK.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41104-22_para0">
<a name="stpa_229">Secondly, I want to say a word about the carrier programme, about which I am less sanguine than my colleagues on the Defence Committee or in the House. There is a yawning gap between the &#163;2.9 billion that the Government say the ships can be built for, and the &#163;4 billion that the manufacturers say is the absolute minimum. The Government started by setting up a competition between BAE Systems and Thales, and then announced that there would not be a competition after all. Input was forthcoming from VT, which has a great deal to offer, and from Swan Hunter, which has very little. Now we have an alliance&#151;effectively, a committee made up of representatives from BAE Systems and Thales, with a Defence Procurement Agency chairman. We are told that it is not a committee, but if it is not that, what is it?

<p><a name="st_165"><a name="41104-22_spnew2"><b> Ms Dari Taylor: </b>

 The hon. Lady will know that Swan Hunter almost went out of business before it was pulled back from the grave. I may be putting myself in a position that resembles the one encountered by my hon. Friend the Member for Henley (Mr. Johnson), and I may have to make a journey to the north-east, but I stand by what I said. There is widespread apprehension in the shipbuilding industry as a whole that Swan Hunter is being included because of jobs and not because of skills. I do not resile from that statement.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41104-22_para1">
<a name="stpa_230">My third and final point concerns the need for open markets in defence products. The UK is the nearest thing to an open market in Europe in that respect, but we must work more with colleagues to encourage the US to give us the international traffic on arms regulations waiver that we need so much. The VT group has suggested a new industry-Government approach to secure greater access to global defence markets, which would also be very welcome, but the ITAR waiver is crucial.

If we advocate serious change but do not get right procurement of equipment and the logistical support for that equipment, we will be in serious trouble. People can wish for effects-based defence or for capability, but they will not get it if procurement and logistical support are not got right. As I have said before, although it is often forgotten, almost half the defence budget is spent, not on equipment or front-line capability, but on supporting that equipment and front-line capability.

I have also been a member of the sub-committee of that assembly on future military capability, and I have been proud to observe the role that British defence policy&#151;especially the strategic defence review&#151;has played in transforming defence, not only in this country, but in other NATO countries. I do not know whether hon. Members are aware that all the countries that have undertaken a strategic defence review, including Norway, Germany, Spain and many former Warsaw pact countries&#151;the latter through their military action plans&#151;have referred to the British strategic defence review as a basis for considering transformation.

The Defence Committee report should be welcomed by Front Benchers as a warning shot across the bows.

<a name="stpa_237">I want to spend the time left to me throwing up a case that reflects my concerns about developments in the DPA and the Defence Logistics Organisation that have been flagged up already in the Defence Committee report. I refer to the announcement on 16 September of the Minister of State&#039;s preferred option to hand back the entire deep repair and maintenance of the RAF&#039;s premium front-line fleet of Tornado GR4s to the RAF. I am talking not about servicing in theatre, first-line servicing or minor repairs to keep those aircraft in the air, but factory maintenance. Major repair and overhaul is being taken away from the Defence Aviation Repair Agency.

<b>4 Nov 2004 : Column 510</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>DARA was created by Her Majesty&#039;s Government in April 2001, as an alternative competitive source of aircraft repair to that offered by the commercial, private sector. It has a major strategic role in ensuring that our front-line fleet is kept in the air at the right price, so that we get value for money.

<a name="stpa_239">The RAF used to carry out deep repair and maintenance&#151;in fact, it did so in my constituency for 40-odd years&#151;but not because it could deliver front-line capability better, more cost-effectively or more efficiently than business, but because there was a very good military case for doing so during the cold war. Since the end of the cold war, no one&#151;none of the NATO countries, nor any of those who produced strategic defence reviews&#151;believes that there is any military or economic case for the RAF to carry out deep support for our fast jets on the front line.

<a name="stpa_240">Only the declaration of a preferred option has been announced, but I am deeply concerned that, if pursued, it will result in capability failures and a dependence on a monopoly source of support for the RAF, and that a well-known defence contractor&#151;I shall not name it, but I am sure that those on the Front Bench are aware of it&#151;will be relied on to bail out the RAF in the future, as it has had to do in the past. If the fully commercialised civilian capability that exists is taken out of DARA, the RAF will have no one else to turn to. I draw the House&#039;s attention to the recent comments of the Public Accounts Committee when it interviewed Sir Kevin Tebbit about the Ministry of Defence&#039;s constant failure to avoid being dependent on a monopoly supplier; that is exactly what is happening.

They are not there to compete with the private sector, but to prepare for and fight wars.

Will the Minister seek an independent assessment of what went wrong with the aircraft and why it took 219 days to turn it around, rather than the 60 that it should have taken?

It was little wonder that the supplier was pleased when I recently spoke to it about the prospects of the new partnership and new relationship. There is still time to do something about that, however.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41104-23_para4">
<a name="stpa_246">If the decision were right for our military and the taxpayer, I would go to my constituents, who are very experienced&#151;in the Minister&#039;s words, uttered within the past 12 months, they are world-beaters&#151;in defence aviation repair, and say that in the interests of the defence of this country we have to bite the bullet, take the tough decision and find ways to minimise the impact, but that is not the case. The decision is bad for the military, the taxpayer and the aviation industry in south Wales. It is wrong in principle and wrong in practice.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41104-23_para5">
<a name="stpa_247">I ask my right hon. Friend to reconsider the decision. The end-to-end review was flawed. It took place within months of the creation of the Defence Aviation Repair Agency. The RAF was not happy about the agency in the first place and, surprise, surprise, the review&#039;s recommendation is to give the work back to the RAF. If he cannot see that, it is a matter for concern, which is why I am delighted that the Defence Committee will investigate the issue shortly.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41104-23_para6">
<a name="stpa_248">Please do not get this decision wrong. It is not a question of jobs in my constituency. It is not even a question of the damaging effect that it will have on the south Wales economy. It is a question of the future capability of the British Royal Air Force. We cannot place that at risk.

 In following the hon. Member for Vale of Glamorgan (Mr. Smith), may I say that I am glad that he implicitly acknowledged the excellent work in the private sector by the many thousands of my constituents at BAE Systems Warton, who produced the Tornado mid-life update and the GR4 model as a result of that? I have noted his comments, which will not be lost on those aerospace workers.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41104-23_para7">
<a name="stpa_249">I want to pick up a theme of the hon. Member for Bolton, North-East (Mr. Crausby), who made a perceptive and interesting speech, touching on many of the challenges that lie ahead in securing the future for Britain&#039;s high-technology defence industries, particularly in the aerospace sector. The House knows that the home of BAE Systems is in my constituency, and it is to that that I want specifically to address my remarks.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41104-23_para8">
<a name="stpa_250">Although I found much in the Minister of State&#039;s speech that was interesting, I was disappointed with the number of omissions relating to specific projects. I appreciate that he cannot cover everything, but we are embarking on taking our place in the construction of the joint strike fighter project. It is the world&#039;s biggest military aerospace project. Some 230 of our personnel are in Dallas Fort Worth. I think that I can claim to be the first British politician to visit that plant, to have a presentation on the JSF, to see the future for myself and to talk to some of our excellent people who are contributing to that project. However, the Minister made no specific detailed mention of the future of that project and the implications of that for Britain&#039;s aerospace industry.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41104-23_para9">
<a name="stpa_251">On the future offensive air system&#151;the cradle of the development of the new technologies that will equip our industry for the future&#151;the Minister told me in a written answer that since 1999 we have spent &#163;84 million on that project, subsumed as it is into the European technology acquisition programme. But there was no mention in his speech of what the project is currently about, what technologies are involved and when we can expect some public exposure of the projects that will arise from it. In the parliamentary question I asked for a statement on the future offensive air systems project, including the project&#039;s objectives. We got two lines on arguably the most important programme that&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;will determine our future aerospace industry technologies.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41104-23_para10">
<a name="stpa_252">The debate has touched briefly on the Eurofighter Typhoon. I take the opportunity to put on record my personal appreciation for the courtesy and kindness that the Minister for Defence Procurement, the noble Lord Bach has shown in personal discussion and correspondence in response to the many letters of representation that I have sent on the subject of tranche 2. The discussions between the company and the Ministry of Defence about the difficulties of the cost of the second tranche and the implications for the cost structure of tranche 1 appear to have been successfully concluded. May we please have a straight answer to the question as to when an announcement will be made? This has been run out for far too long. It is nearly a year since those of us with an interest started asking when the matter would be sorted.

<a name="stpa_253">I say this not for any kind of political gain. I recently had a constituency advice bureau in BAE Systems and, one after another, members of the work force came to me and said, &quot;Mr. Jack, when is this going to be settled? When will we know that we have some future for our work at Warton and Samlesbury?&quot; I acknowledge that the Minister must have a meeting with the other three partner countries before the matter can be finally decided, but he owes it to those workers to give them an early Christmas present and put the future of tranche 2 once and for all beyond doubt.

<p>
<a name="41104-23_para12">
<a name="stpa_254">The language on Eurofighter Typhoon has become noticeably more positive from the Secretary of State and all Ministers and from the Chief of the Air Staff. I welcome that endorsement. It will certainly help prospects for export orders in the discussions that are going on with the Greeks and the Malays, for example, and perhaps even future orders for Saudi. More confidence among export customers would be welcome, but the biggest vote of confidence would be the signing of tranche 2. Perhaps in his winding-up speech the Minister will put us all out of our&#151;I will not say misery, but anticipation.

 My understanding is that our European partners are awaiting a decision from the United Kingdom. They are all ready to go. I understand from BAE Systems that the price has been agreed with the Government. What is the hold-up? My right hon. Friend is right to say that the Minister must give us an answer today.

<a name="stpa_255">I should be grateful if the Minister explained why pen has not yet been put to paper on the subject of the Hawk order for the RAF. The hon. Member for Bolton, North-East rightly emphasised the importance of the United Kingdom&#039;s decision to purchase that aircraft, yet I understand that the plane has not yet been ordered. A decision in principle has been made, but it would helpful to know when the order will be placed.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41104-24_para1">
<a name="stpa_256">Another notable omission from the Minister&#039;s speech was the Nimrod MRA4. That may be, from the Minister&#039;s point of view, in the &quot;All too difficult&quot; column, but let us spend a moment reviewing MRA4 and its importance to the UK aerospace industry. It is currently the largest British aircraft project. In fact, it is the only large British aircraft project in construction. I would be the first to acknowledge that the birth of MRA4, representing as it does nearly 95 per cent. of a brand-new aircraft, has not been painless. There are huge lessons to be learned from the way the procurement exercise was undertaken, but with the successful flight of the first prototype from Woodford to Warton in my constituency, we know the aircraft will fly. We know also that two other prototypes studying the mission system are under construction at Woodford.

<p>
<a name="41104-24_para2">
<a name="stpa_257">This aircraft is a world-beater. Its mission system, which Boeing has helped us to develop, is the envy of the world. A fair chunk of what Boeing has done is going into the American P3 replacement aircraft. It has, for example, a 14-hour loiter capability, one of the largest bomb bays of any military aircraft in the world, and the latest acoustic suite and electronic surveillance systems. It is one of the best aircraft of its type and yet it was not mentioned specifically in the Minister&#039;s speech. It is of crucial importance to the aerospace industry, with 1,500 workers at BAE Systems at Woodford, Warton and Brough combined involved in it. There are 2,000 more in the supply base, and many small and medium-sized enterprises depend on it. So far, the most that the Government have said is that they need, or think they need, approximately 12 of these aircraft to carry out the capabilities of the existing fleet of Nimrod patrol aircraft.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41104-24_para3">
<a name="stpa_258">Given the investment that the Government and the company have put into the project, it merited at least a mention in the Minister&#039;s speech to give us some indication of how the Government will take forward the future assessment of the project and when, if ever, they will decide to buy more than one, two or three. I do not know, but in terms of the future of our maritime patrol capability, and possibly, as it is a world-beater, even selling the aircraft to others, we should at least have had a mention of it in his speech.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41104-24_para4">
<a name="stpa_259">I had the rather surreal experience in the middle of September of standing in the middle of the joint strike fighter factory in Lockheed Martin at Dallas Fort Worth. That aircraft plant is over a mile long. It is the&nbsp;home of the F-16 and the F-22, as well as now of the F-35. The reason why it was odd to be standing there was that I was having a discussion with representatives of 230 of our own aerospace workers who were there. They were admired for their skills and they told me how impressed the Americans were by our engineering capability. They said that the Americans were in awe of the fact that when British-made components came together, they fitted. There were no shims, no adjustments, no nothing. They did what it said on the outside of the can. They talked about their contribution, but then they said that they had already put their technological jewels on the table and that that was what had got them into the joint strike fighter project. They asked what was the future of the British aerospace industry, where were the new technologies coming from, and what would keep the skilled teams of engineers and systems designers together. The most that we have heard on that score in the Minister&#039;s speech today is that he welcomed the desire to secure a long-term future for the aerospace industry, or words to that effect, and he muttered something about the defence industrial strategy.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41104-24_para5">
<a name="stpa_260">I welcome the fact that there is a much better dialogue between BAE Systems and the Government. In fairness, there is both listening and discussion. But unless that exercise, combined with the work of the future offensive air system project is to mean anything, we must have a clear statement first, that the Government regard the aerospace industry in the same way that they do shipbuilding. Shipbuilding is on their list of strategic capabilities that they feel that the UK should have. That lines up, as I understand it, with nuclear weapons, 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>4 Nov 2004 : Column 515</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>nuclear propulsion and encryption. But aerospace does not currently figure on the list of strategic defence capabilities that we should maintain in this country.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41104-24_para6">
<a name="stpa_261">I can see, from having seen the size of Lockheed Martin&#039;s plant at Dallas Fort Worth, that we will never be able to rival the might of the American defence industry. But, to pick up on the points made by the hon. Member for Bolton, North-East, we have world-beating capabilities that should in future put us at any table, anywhere in the world where there is a project of partnership that would be to the advantage of the United Kingdom.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41104-24_para7">
<a name="stpa_262">The Government must now state with greater clarity what they are doing to develop new technologies. What are the new technologies? What work are the Government doing in the materials development field? Which new electronic systems and manufacturing systems will they support? After Eurofighter-Typhoon and other current projects, we will not have an industry.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41104-24_para8">
<a name="stpa_263">In conclusion, I turn to the JSF. I wholly endorse all that has been said in this debate about technology transfer and welcome the efforts on the ITAR waiver, but now is the time for the Prime Minister to call in the cards. I know from my discussions with the Foreign Secretary and a question that I put to the Prime Minister in the House that they take seriously the discussion about that matter with President Bush. As America&#039;s most loyal ally, it is time for America to come to our aid and make certain that meaningful discussions to evaluate the RAND Europe report on the JSF in Europe are pursued.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41104-24_para9">
<a name="stpa_264">I say that because the report offers the prospect of a final assembly and check-out line for the up-to-150 aircraft in which the Government have an interest. There is certainly the prospect of a maintenance and repair unit for those aircraft in this country, which is a necessity. In addition to servicing, such a unit could also undertake lucrative upgrades over the aircraft&#039;s potential 20-year lifespan.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41104-24_para10">
<a name="stpa_265">The production run in the United States could exceed 2,800 planes, and when I visited Dallas Fort Worth, Lockheed Martin indicated that it might be subject to supply constraints. If that is the case, it is incumbent on the Government carefully to evaluate&#151;perhaps on behalf of or in concert with other European countries which are interested in the aircraft&#151;the possibility of locating the final assembly and check-out facility in the United Kingdom, hopefully at Warton. A facility to deal with maintenance and repair makes eminent sense in the long term. If technology transfer does not occur, however, all the possibilities for British industry and the JSF identified in the Government-funded RAND Europe report will not happen, because we will not get the required technologies.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41104-24_para11">
<a name="stpa_266">The JSF is a vital project and we have embedded our best technology to date in it. Given that we may want to develop the aircraft in the future, I back the attempts to achieve technology transfer. However, I hope that the Government will indicate whether they will engage in meaningful discussions with the United States about the long-term planning for that aircraft.
</p>

<a name="41104-24_para12">

<p>
<a name="41104-24_para13">
<a name="stpa_268">Appropriately, I shall start with the 2004 spending review. Although all hon. Members are concerned about how much we are spending and how effectively we are spending it, it is also important to remember that we are spending. The defence budget will increase by some &#163;3.7 billion over the next three years, which is something to be satisfied with. I say to the Minister that I will always want more, but I am pleased that the Government have put the money up front.

</p>

<p>
<a name="41104-24_para14">
<a name="stpa_269">We should acknowledge that the average real terms increase in spending of 1.4 per cent. a year, building on the additional investment in defence in the 2000 and 2002 spending reviews, gives us a sense of satisfaction and security. We are putting our money where it is required to achieve the best equipment and kit for our armed forces. That represents seven consecutive years of planned, real-terms growth&#151;the longest period of sustained growth in planned defence spending for more&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;than 20 years. That is a record of which to be proud.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41104-24_para15">
<a name="stpa_270">My knowledge of defence and the defence industry started with my membership of the Select Committee on Defence, which represented a tremendously valuable opportunity for me. During that period, I met many of our troops serving in the Balkans, in Kosovo and in parts of Europe where they were playing high-quality, creative and professional roles. I was never more proud than when I met them in Banja Luka and they explained how they were helping to maintain peace. To be honest, I often felt that I would love to be a member of the armed forces. My back went straight and I was always wanting to stand to attention, because although what they were delivering was not known about or acknowledged by many people in Great Britain, it was superb in terms of what it achieved.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41104-24_para16">
<a name="stpa_271">I felt the same when I met our armed forces as members of NATO involved in partnership for peace. They were committed to involving others in working together in partnership better to deliver change and to understand one another, and working together better to achieve a peaceful Europe. That was very pleasing.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41104-24_para17">
<a name="stpa_272">As we are talking about procurement, I shall lean on the fact that I was Parliamentary Private Secretary to my hon. Friend the Member for Kirkcaldy (Dr. Moonie) when he was Minister with responsibility for veterans&#151;that was a tremendous experience&#151;and to Lord Bach, Minister for Defence Procurement. That gave me a keen insight into the Royal Navy. That was not because they wear the smartest uniforms, although they do&#151;many hon. Members have teased me about that&#151;but because of the way in which they deliver a service. Through the Defence Committee, I gained

That was a straightforward insult, and I hope that he will have the decency to come to the House to withdraw it. I had to ask him to repeat it because I could not believe it the first time. Swan&#039;s has 100 years of experience and a reputation as an excellent builder of naval ships. I got to know the men&#151;the boilermakers and engineers&#151;there when I worked in trade unions in the northern region. Whenever I went to Portsmouth or Plymouth or to parts of the world where commercial contracts were being put together, I was proud that men from the north-east regularly made themselves known to me. They were often in the majority among the construction force. Let nobody in this House say that we won the contract in order to provide jobs. I am not trying to fool anybody&#151;of course I want jobs so that my community can work&#151;but I would not want a contract for the Royal Navy to be built by sub-standard people, as was implied by the hon.

<a name="41104-25_para0">
<a name="stpa_274">When Swan Hunter won the contract for the two auxiliary landing ships logistics, I was delighted. I was thrilled to watch the construction process, with its expert shipbuilding and engineering competence. When the first ship was launched, everyone, including the Royal Navy, said, &quot;Look, Dari,&quot;&#151;they did not call me &quot;the hon. Member&quot;&#151;&quot;this is not high-tech kit,&quot; but to my eyes it was an excellent piece of engineering. It was expertly made and totally dependable; it was launched on time, and it was made to price. To my way of thinking, all those are qualities.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41104-25_para1">
<a name="stpa_275">I want now to bring a problem to the attention of my Front-Bench colleagues. I hope that they will be sympathetic to what I am saying. Swan Hunter is now building the second logistics ship. Construction should have started three months before it did. I believe that production is catching up and that the ship will be launched in 2005, but I want my Front-Bench colleagues to acknowledge the following problem. During the building of the first logistics ship, the Royal Navy decided that it wanted greater electronic competence and better technology, so the design had to be rethought for the second ship. The designers had to go back to the drawing board, and that took time. Inevitably, time is money. If the Royal Navy wants better, more and different, that is exactly what we should be producing and delivering, but the straight fact is that it will cost. I

<p>
<a name="41104-25_para2">
<a name="stpa_276">The new landing ship dock logistics, or LSD&#151;an unfortunate acronym&#151;will be launched in spring 2005. I have no illusions about my competence to understand the changes that the Royal Navy required, but I do know that I support its determination to achieve the best. We in this House should determine likewise and spend accordingly. I do not want anyone to be under the illusion that I expect there to be an open chequebook, but when the Royal Navy can explain why and how the costs have increased, we are honour bound to accept that.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41104-25_para3">
<a name="stpa_277">My next point has to do with the maintenance of a competent manufacturing industry, which is a difficult and expensive achievement. We must understand that investment in equipment is astoundingly expensive. I want to put a problem to my Front-Bench colleagues. The second logistics ship is, as I said, to be launched next spring. We know that, justly, Swan Hunter has won the contract to build 25 per cent. of the aircraft carrier, but all the suggestions are that the date for that project has slipped. It could be 2006; it might be later. That is seriously problematic for a shipbuilding industry that is costly in terms of its skilled work force and the equipment that it uses.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41104-25_para4">
<a name="stpa_278">I cannot complain about that: the design of the carriers has to be right, and if the project takes longer, we have to cope with that. However, we also have to be sympathetic to the manufacturer, who cannot have kit lying idle or watch the people whom he has trained disappear into the ether. How would he get that trained work force back again quickly and effectively&#151;a work force whom we trust to build the carrier? I have a suggestion for Ministers. It is not that I want the Department always to build on time&#151;that is not always possible&#151;but I want it to acknowledge that there are alternatives when that is not possible. I want to suggest such an alternative.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41104-25_para5">
<a name="stpa_279">The Royal Fleet Auxiliary Service needs new oil tankers. I do not believe that that is a secret&#151;the whole House probably knows that. New oil tankers are necessary because the single-hull tanker is being decommissioned for appropriate reasons. We can rebuild or put in a second, additional hull lining. Both options mean good work. I want to persuade my Front-Bench colleagues that the contract should go to a British yard. Of course, I want it. The hon. Member for West Chelmsford (Mr. Burns) is smiling because he knows jolly well what I am about to say: I want the contract to come to the north-east and I shall lobby and exert pressure for it. However, I especially want Ministers to understand that we have a responsibility to support a competent defence manufacturing base. It also has a responsibility to look for new products, diversify and ensure that it is looking for commercial opportunities.

 Does the hon. Lady agree that the north-east has the potential to offer another service to the Ministry of Defence?

 I agree with the right hon. Gentleman. The northern defence industry is keen to press its competence to decommission in an environmentally friendly way.

I started by complimenting my Front Benchers and I shall end by doing that because it is valuable and important. They made it clear that they believed that they could cut waste. They believed that they could make savings. We all watched and wondered how and if. I am delighted to read a report that states that the pledge to make &#163;2 billion of savings over 10 years has already been met. The Department is hitting its targets. It is spending good money and minimising waste. I simply ask my hon. Friends for one more thing&#151;to ensure that any slippage is acknowledged and stopped and, when possible, to support our defence manufacturing industry. It is precious to us all and the last thing we want to see damaged.

 It is a great pleasure to follow the hon. Member for Stockton, South (Ms Taylor), who made a passionate and interesting speech. She conveyed to the House her love of men in uniform&#151;the armed forces&#151;and her stalwart support for constituency interests. Although I will not follow her comments, except in one respect, I was impressed by her interest in and love of the armed forces and defence. I mused, as I listened to and watched her, on how interesting it would have been to hear a speech on defence from her 20 years ago. It might have been a case of then and now with regard to her views, but given her background before she came to the House, perhaps she had not had the same experience that she has had since of meeting our armed forces in the field, which may have influenced her.

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>4 Nov 2004 : Column 520</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>briefly today. My constituency has for many years been associated with defence procurement. In 1987, there were five Marconi companies in the constituency. It still has a Marconi company&#151;Marconi Selenia&#151;but because of changes in defence procurement, a global economy and rising costs, there have been changes in the ownership and composition of some other companies that remain in my constituency such as e2v and BAE Systems, which, having taken over some of the Marconi empire, has a manufacturing presence there. Chelmsford has expertise and experience dating back many years because it is the home of Marconi. We have a close interest in defence procurement, and rely on it for jobs and the sustainability of the local economy. We are proud of the town&#039;s contribution over many years to supplying our armed forces with highly skilled, highly technical equipment, and to supplying armed forces and commercial, non-military companies and establishments around the world with first-class equipment.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41104-25_para10">
<a name="stpa_284">I want to ask the Minister four questions, to which I hope he will respond, if not in his wind-up, because of pressure of time, then in writing as soon as conveniently possible. The nature of defence companies has changed rapidly because of the massive costs of research and development for new equipment. Much more international co-operation has developed between companies seeking to produce the finest equipment that armed forces need. As a result, there is concern in my constituency, which my hon. Friend the Member for Aldershot (Mr. Howarth) shares, about the need for clarification of the Government&#039;s view on giving defence contracts to companies that may be part of an amalgamation or conglomeration that is not exclusively British-based. As the Minister will know, the Government&#039;s defence industrial policy states:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_34">&quot;The UK defence industry should be defined in terms of where the technology is created, where the skills and the intellectual property reside, where jobs are created and sustained, and where the investment is made.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="41104-25_para11">
<a name="stpa_285">First, on that basis, are the Government more concerned about investment in and growth of UK defence industries than the ultimate ownership of a defence supplier?
</p>

<p>
<a name="41104-25_para12">
<a name="stpa_286">Secondly, inward investment is clearly extremely important for the future of the UK&#039;s defence industry. We need to move away from the issue of company ownership and focus instead on where jobs are created and how best the UK can attract more foreign investment. For instance, Finmeccanica is an Italian business, but its subsidiary, Marconi Selenia in my constituency, is a UK company that sustains high-quality jobs both at its sites in Chelmsford and Liverpool and through third-party relationships in the UK that support delivery of its contracts. So my second question to the Minister is: do the Government agree that creating and sustaining such jobs is essential in order to avoid a technology drain, in which such expertise is forced to leave the UK in search of jobs overseas?
</p>

<p>
<a name="41104-25_para13">
<a name="stpa_287">Thirdly, the UK defence industry does not exist in isolation. Rather, it collaborates with European partners to identify procurement and third-party opportunities. Such an approach is naturally two-way, and by encouraging inward investment UK workers and 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>4 Nov 2004 : Column 521</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>businesses can continue to identify new opportunities for growth. So my third question to the Minister is: does the Government&#039;s policy on defence procurement take into account the need for ever greater collaboration so as to ensure the continued successful growth of the defence industry?
</p>

<p>
<a name="41104-25_para14">
<a name="stpa_288">Fourthly, the UK&#039;s industrial capability and export ability are key to this debate. Companies such as Finmeccanica are well placed to exploit networks on behalf of the UK industry. For example, the global defence communications market sector is estimated to be worth about &#163;500 million over the next 10 years, and it is essential that UK companies compete vigorously and successfully in this market. So my fourth and last question to the Minister is: what is the Government&#039;s stance on the need to increase the UK&#039;s export capability? It is crucial that British companies, either working alone or in collaboration with overseas companies, should have the ability to be at the sharp end of research and development, developing new technologies and products that will ensure that our armed forces have the finest, best and most appropriate equipment to enable them to continue to defend this country and protect our interests overseas.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41104-25_para15">
<a name="stpa_289">These companies have gone through an extremely difficult time economically as world markets and the industry contracted very painfully, with far too many job losses and all the misery that that entails. It is important that they should now be given the opportunity to put the difficult times behind them and to move forward, so that they can thrive and look forward to a bright, successful future in which they have the ability to be innovative and entrepreneurial, both in our own national interest and for the purposes of inward investment, job creation and exports.

<p><a name="st_185"><a name="41104-26_spnew0"><b> Jane Griffiths  (Reading, East) (Lab):</b> 
 Thank you, Madam Deputy Speaker, for the opportunity to take part in this important and interesting debate. I come to the debate having taken note of the Defence Committee&#039;s report, and as a member of the defence committee of the Western European Union. In September, the Committee met in Hengelo, in the Netherlands, to discuss defence procurement, and we looked at the issue from a pan-European and international perspective. The issues addressed at the meeting were extremely similar to those addressed by the Select Committee in its report and by the Public Accounts Committee in its recent report on major projects.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41104-26_para0">
<a name="stpa_290">One of the main issues that the Committee sought to address was international collaboration in the defence industry. The view was that this has tended not to work very well. In shipbuilding, for example, good ships have been built in collaboration projects between European countries, but have cost about 25 per cent. more than they would if any country had built them alone. So it would seem that, even in collaboration between European countries, there is the same problem of cost overrun.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41104-26_para1">
<a name="stpa_291">To address this problem, a European defence agency is in the process of being established, but it is important that there is a will for it to succeed. The point of the 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>4 Nov 2004 : Column 522</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>European defence agency is to ensure that there is sufficient capacity in Europe for national Governments to meet their own needs for defence and security, and for European needs to be met. But it is important to remember that decisions on defence have an impact on the economies of the individual countries involved. A nasty, cynical mind might think it would be all too easy for policies to be tilted to ensure a beneficial outcome for one country&#039;s defence industry. We must ensure, in all our wider interests, that that does not happen.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41104-26_para2">
<a name="stpa_292">In the last few years, we have seen consolidation in the defence industries of both Europe and the United States. Key European players in defence say that we must not have &quot;fortress Europe&quot;; but it must be borne in mind that the defence industry is unique, in that it is a market whose customers are just about always Governments. Improving defence procurement will have an impact on the defence industry. In fact, it could be argued that improvements in the defence industry will bring about improvements in defence procurement. But the US accounts for nearly 40 per cent. of the world&#039;s defence spending, more than double that of the European Union&#151;and it is worth remembering that great big China&#039;s proportion is only 6 per cent. The needs of the US will dominate the world&#039;s defence market, whether any of us like it or not.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41104-26_para3">
<a name="stpa_293">As a result of action taken by the then US Defence Secretary, William Perry, we have seen a massive rationalisation of the US defence industry which has resulted in just five major airframe companies, three missile companies&#151;down from nine or 10&#151;two armoured vehicle land systems, and only three shipyards. Progress in Europe has been even slower. According to the head of marketing at BAE Systems, Sir Charles Masefield,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_35">&quot;Firstly, the defence budget shown there of the combined European companies is only 115 billion, less than half the total annual US defence budget, in fact just 41 per cent. Instead of 5 airframe manufacturers chasing that greatly reduced budget, you can see we have 7, we have double the number of missile companies in Europe, we have three times the number of armoured vehicle companies in Europe, and we have nearly four times the number of shipyards.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="41104-26_para4">
<a name="stpa_294">In the US there has been a move to deliver the industry that delivers the economies of scale, to deliver an improved performance on procurement. We in Europe are much slower in achieving that.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41104-26_para5">
<a name="stpa_295">There is, however, a danger that European defence industrial consolidation will result not in a better European industry able to compete and collaborate with large US companies, but in the &quot;fortress Europe&quot; that I mentioned earlier, in which preference will be&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;given to European solutions for European requirements. Similar problems in the US could also damage defence procurement. The Defence Committee has expressed concern about that, saying:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_36">&quot;A careful balance is needed, with the UK government using its influence in Europe to avoid any undue European-preference policy emerging while also playing a full part in rationalising the defence equipment market in Europe.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="41104-26_para6">
<a name="stpa_296">Ideally, in market terms, the US and Europe need an integrated marketplace. In a lecture in Rome 17 May 2001, Sir Charles Masefield of BAE Systems said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_37">&quot;But what about the transatlantic consolidation? I believe if you look at the US and European situation, we have of course as I&#039;ve shown, the four mega companies in the United States, Boeing, 

<br>&nbsp;<br></ul>



<b>4 Nov 2004 : Column 523</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br><ul>Lockheed, Raytheon and Northrop Grumman. We have in Europe, Finmeccanica, BAe, EADS and Thales. How are those going to play in the 10 years ahead? Well no-one knows but my guess is that this sort of thing will gradually happen and if we were to meet in this room in ten years&#039; time, I wouldn&#039;t like to predict what would be the marriage in those global companies, but instead of 8 major defence companies in the world, I believe it is much more likely there will be 3 or maybe 4&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I believe each of those 3 or 4 will be transatlantic global companies, rather than either the United States or European companies.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="41104-26_para7">
<a name="stpa_297">One important piece of work for the European defence agency will be to look forward to how the different countries in Europe will be able to carry out their defence procurement in this kind of world. How will we meet the different requirements of the different countries in such a marketplace? In particular, how can we be sure that in a global marketplace UK defence procurement is driven by the requirements of the UK military, rather than just by what the large companies are willing to offer? I don&#039;t pretend to have any answers to those dilemmas now, but they are being discussed.
</p>








<p><a name="st_186"><a name="41104-26_spnew1"><b> Mr. Kevan Jones  (North Durham) (Lab):</b> 
 Does my hon. Friend agree that the defence White Paper allows the market to help drive the efficiencies to which she alludes, rather than creating a rigid policy under which national Governments would decide what the future of the defence industry in their countries should be?
</p>








<p><a name="st_187"><a name="41104-26_spnew2"><b> Jane Griffiths: </b> 
 My hon. Friend makes a very sound intervention and he is absolutely right. That very point is being made, and it is contributing to the discussions that are taking place in what I hope is a positive way. It is well understood within the Western European Union, for example, that the UK invites competition in its defence procurement industry, while other states do not. That is an obvious difficulty, and hopefully, a body such as the European defence agency will play a part in opening things up.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41104-26_para8">
<a name="stpa_298">I end with a very short story that shows the difficulties associated with truly opening up transatlantic defence procurement. The new helicopter for the newly re-elected US President is being built by AgustaWestland, mainly at its factory in Italy, which the WEU&#039;s defence committee visited last year. Because it will carry around the President of the United States, it has had to be called US101 to make it sound American.

<p><a name="st_188"><a name="41104-26_spnew3"><b> Mr. John Burnett  (Torridge and West Devon) (LD):</b> 
 It is a pleasure to follow the hon. Member for Reading, East (Jane Griffiths), who made a very thoughtful contribution. Unlike the hon. Member for Stockton, South (Ms Taylor), she did not assert an ambition to join the armed forces. I have had a pleasant few minutes to dwell on what would have happened had the hon.

</p>

<p>
<a name="41104-26_para9">
<a name="stpa_299">I am concerned that there are some unanswered questions about defence procurement, and I want to begin by asking a few of them. Today is indeed the time to ask them, and I hope that the Minister will answer them when he winds up. I have an outstanding shipyard in my constituency, called Appledore, which still exists despite going into receivership last autumn. Earlier this 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>4 Nov 2004 : Column 524</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>year, the assets were bought by DML, and I am delighted that that happened. Before going into receivership, Appledore had some 600 employees plus 300 to 400 self-employed personnel working in the shipyard. Given that it provided jobs for more than 1,000 people, it was an extremely important employer&#151;in my constituency, regionally, and indeed nationally. Its work force was outstanding, and it had a great reputation for its high skills. It competed in the commercial world for commercial orders, but it was not successful when it came to Ministry of Defence orders.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41104-26_para10">
<a name="stpa_300">I was pleased that DML Plymouth bought Appledore&#039;s assets. DML is not solely reliant on the MOD for orders and work; it actively seeks and tenders for commercial orders worldwide. It now has a proven track record in the construction of super-yachts. Some are being built as we speak, and I hope that further yachts will be ordered in the near future. DML took on Appledore&#039;s superb design team of some 50 people straight away, and a further 50 are now employed on a super-yacht construction contract. So about 100 of the original 1,000-strong work force&#151;only about one tenth&#151;are re-engaged.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41104-26_para11">
<a name="stpa_301">DML Appledore is currently competing in the MOD tender for the 1 Castle class offshore patrol vessel. Appledore has built a number of these vessels in the recent past for the Royal Navy&#151;but only as sub-contractors&#151;and also for the Irish navy. Its record is excellent. Vessels were constructed on time to a fixed cost, and to top quality. It also built the arctic survey ship HMS Scot on a sub-contract from BAE Systems. She has been at sea nearly every day since her construction, and every report that I hear is of her excellence.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41104-26_para12">
<a name="stpa_302">DML itself has a turnover of some &#163;500 million sterling a year, so we now have the financial muscle to compete for MOD orders. I point out to the Minister that neither DML nor Appledore has ever had a prime MOD contract for the construction of a Royal Navy ship.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41104-26_para13">
<a name="stpa_303">If we win the OPV contract, a further 200 employees will be re-engaged for at least 18 months. Importantly, it will give the MOD a further shipyard to engage in the competitive tendering process&#151;a shipyard that is used to competing in the commercial world where the competition is extremely tough, and a shipyard that understands that the future for British shipbuilding is to be in the forefront of technology, building sophisticated niche vessels.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41104-26_para14">
<a name="stpa_304">On the role of competition in winning MOD orders, I have reason to be dubious, if not cynical, about the process. Three or four years ago, Appledore tendered for two alternate landing ships logistic. The order was won by the north-east&#151;Swan Hunter, I believe&#151;as the hon. Member for Stockton, South said. We took that on the chin, on the grounds of fair competition. A few months later, out of the blue and without any further tendering process, orders for two further vessels were placed at Govan, despite our numerous attempts. The only satisfactory explanation I can find for this order is that it was just in time for the Scottish elections.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41104-26_para15">
<a name="stpa_305">My question to the Under-Secretary is this: how can a senior Cabinet Minister direct an MOD order, whether it be for construction or refitting, to be placed at a shipyard other than the one making the 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>4 Nov 2004 : Column 525</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>most&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;competitive bid? Why cannot commercial confidentiality be lifted and full scrutiny allowed after the exchange of contracts and completion? Bidding itself is an increasingly expensive process and the inherent costs of the favoured lease-maintenance deals are extremely high.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41104-26_para16">
<a name="stpa_306">Research and development, construction and maintenance are not the only costs that shipyards have to bear. On lease-maintenance deals, banks are always involved and they usually buy and lease. The banks will want to extract watertight indemnities as well as pick up capital allowances. Bank charges will be substantial; legal costs will be high. Documents such as leases, performance guarantees, collateral warranties and so forth have to be drafted and agreed. There is the risk to the shipbuilder of having to take the vessel back when the lease expires, often with very little residual value left. It is a complex process, very costly in management time, bank charges and professional fees. Do Ministers really believe that that is the best way to manage procurement and provide value for taxpayers&#039; money? It is a question that I should like to hear answered when the Under-Secretary winds up the debate.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41104-26_para17">
<a name="stpa_307">Along with other hon. Members, I recently attended a presentation given by BAE Systems at which that company suggested that shipbuilding companies should form what I would loosely call a consortium and bid as one for a future construction programme for the re-fleeting of the Royal Navy. The discussions are mainly taking place between Vosper Thorneycroft and BAE Systems, but I know that DML Appledore is also involved.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41104-26_para18">
<a name="stpa_308">What are the main reasons behind the precipitation of the discussions? First, there is the over-reliance of many yards on MOD orders and, secondly, the abundance of new naval orders in the pipeline. I welcome that, but the Under-Secretary will have heard my intervention on the Minister of State earlier when he spoke about the programme, and the budgetary constraints are being evened out more than is apparent as we speak. What it would mean is that the MOD would effectively be the sole customer and the new consortium company the sole supplier. That is not a satisfactory state of affairs for the taxpayer or for the shipbuilding industry in the medium or long term when, as they surely will, the MOD orders dry up. I hope to hear what the Under-Secretary believes the medium and long-term solutions will be in respect of these matters.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41104-26_para19">
<a name="stpa_309">Some of us are seriously concerned that important contracts are subject to undue influence by senior Ministers, and that the contracting process is unnecessarily complex and costly. When the Minister sums up, I hope that he will endeavour to allay our fears on these matters.

Will the entire construction of those vessels take place in this country? Will the Minister assure the House that the MOD&#151;or some forces within it&#151;will not seek to have the hulls built abroad as part of a cost-saving exercise?
</p>

<p>
<a name="41104-27_para4">
<a name="stpa_314">Most of us who have been involved in the industry for some time recognise that the distinction between hull construction and outfitting is now artificial. Vessels are designed to be built in modules, segments and sections, and that is much more efficient and cost-effective. It means that the hull is completed, followed by the other steelwork and then the rest of the outfitting. I hope that that point will be taken into account.

<a name="stpa_315">Will the Minister give an indication of when work will begin on the second batch of Type 45 destroyers?

I am aware that the supply of design work on Clydeside is rapidly running out and that a gap between the available work force and the work required is likely to become apparent in December. To avoid redundancies, the MOD needs to give the okay for some of the second batch design work to begin now. If highly skilled people in ship design are allowed to leave the industry, it will be very difficult to reassemble that work force later on.

<a name="41104-27_para8">
<a name="stpa_318">The large contracts that are being given out are, it could be suggested, ruinous to small and medium-sized enterprises. What cognisance has the MOD taken, in its procurement policy for clothing, of the Department of Trade and Industry policy on contracting with SMEs? What cognisance has been taken by the MOD of the ability of our domestic clothing manufacturing industry to compete in the future? How does our present policy sustain an environment that enhances competitiveness? That is one of the categories of defence industry policy. My hon. Friend the Minister may be unclear about the point that I am making, so I shall put it another way. Some British clothing companies will no longer produce clothing because they have lost contracts that they previously had. The new contracts are for five or 10 years, so how will British companies be able to tender for such work in the future? The industry will no longer exist. In other words, will the inadvertent result of present policy be that we will have to give all the work to overseas competitors?
</p>

<p>
<a name="41104-27_para9">
<a name="stpa_319">The example of Cooneen has already been cited. I understand that that company is world famous for the manufacturing of wedding dresses and babywear. Has due diligence been exercised to ensure its capacity and capability to carry out a contract for the MOD? Is it the case that the company failed to register accounts in the last year, and if so, why? Was the red army factory No. 3533 in China part of the tender bid that the company put in or did it change its outsourcing, after it won the contract, from, say, Belgium to China? I presume that such issues as capacity and capability were considered in advance of the contract being awarded. We would not want to be in a situation in which actual fabric samples had not been provided. Were fabric samples provided from China or any other proposed outsourcing for that contract?
</p>

<p>
<a name="41104-27_para10">
<a name="stpa_320">Finally, has there been any quantification of the loss of British jobs throughout the supply chain caused by such decision making? I ask that because the supply chain includes some of my constituents. Bassetlaw provides a disproportionately high number of new entrants to the armed forces. Next week, young people in my constituency will apply to join the armed forces, and I do not want the people who volunteer to join our armed services when there is conflict around the world to be equipped with second-rate, shoddy Chinese clothing, instead of British clothing, to do the job that they are paid to do.

<p><a name="st_191"><a name="41104-27_spnew2"><b> Jim Sheridan  (West Renfrewshire) (Lab):</b> 
 In the short time left to me, I want to concentrate on two main issues that are relevant to today&#039;s debate. I have worked almost all my working life in the defence industry, so I hope that I reflect it accurately.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41104-27_para11">
<a name="stpa_321">The first issue is smart procurement, which the DPA has promoted and implemented as a way to improve defence procurement. That has involved a change to the procurement cycle, the idea being that the industry is involved at an earlier stage. That may be true, but the overriding desire to get value for money still dominates competitions. MOD staff continually talk about wanting offers from industry that provide 80 per cent. of the capability at 50 per cent. of the cost. Various permutations of percentages are used, depending on who is talking. It is a great principle, but we rarely see it happening, because the DPA evaluation teams are not empowered or organised to assess non-compliant proposals.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41104-27_para12">
<a name="stpa_322">Currently, a proposal may arrive from industry that is around 12 inches thick and is broken up into lots of small packages that are distributed to many disparate MOD teams who score it against a set of requirements. At no time do those teams have access to sensitive price data. All they can do is mark each response paragraph as compliant or non-compliant. Each proposal is assessed for its compliance, and in effect only those proposals that are deemed to have cleared the bar are considered for price and other commercial issues. At the end of the day, each company feels compelled to submit a fully compliant and therefore intrinsically expensive bid, and it would take a very brave company indeed to aim under the bar.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41104-27_para13">
<a name="stpa_323">The basic point is that the DPA and its customer, the MOD&#039;s equipment branch, are not equipped or organised to assess a non-compliant bid that may offer better value for money by proposing a reduced capability and price. If the MOD and the DPA truly want to implement smart procurement they need to change their way of assessing bids and increase the calibre of staff involved in the process.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41104-27_para14">
<a name="stpa_324">My second point is about overseas competition, which many hon. Members have mentioned today. The MOD, in its pursuit of competition, encourages overseas companies to compete for work in the UK. All UK defence companies are used to competition&#151;it is a way of life for many of them, and it can be a positive pressure on businesses to ensure that waste is eliminated, overheads are reduced and product development cycles are shortened. It keeps companies fit and lean in the defence industry. However, the marketplaces where we can compete openly in the world are not that big. In fact, we find that we compete with the same companies in the far east and middle east as on our home turf. Okay, all is fair in love and war, but we do not have the opportunity to compete in those competitors&#039; home markets, and the biggest culprit is the USA.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41104-27_para15">
<a name="stpa_325">American companies are growing strong on rich pickings at home, and that gives them an added advantage over this country overseas. The UK Government should either get the US and other European domestic markets opened up to fair competition, or they should impose the same domestic 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>4 Nov 2004 : Column 529</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>restrictions on the US and other countries to protect our defence industrial base. That is the sort of language used in the pubs and clubs in my neck of the woods by people who work in the defence industry.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41104-27_para16">
<a name="stpa_326">As I said, I spent most of my working life in the defence industry. I was a worker at Barr and Stroud, which is now called Thales. I also worked in Yarrow shipyard on the Clyde, which is now operated by BAE Systems. I congratulate the people whom I worked beside on the education that I received during that period&#151;I am not blaming them for it&#151;for which I am eternally grateful. Without being too critical, I have to say that the Ministry of Defence is one of the most difficult organisations to deal with. Extreme frustration is caused by procrastination when placing orders. Companies have to wait for orders that keep getting pushed further back down the pipeline. Companies and management sometimes have difficulty retaining their work force while waiting for such orders to come through and holding on to spare parts and components required to fulfil a contract. The Ministry of Defence is not an organisation with which someone would choose to work.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41104-27_para17">
<a name="stpa_327">Many jobs in the defence industry have been lost over the years. More jobs have been lost in it than in any other industry of which I am aware. I am proud of the fact that that was done by companies and trade unions getting together to recognise the problems and taking appropriate action. I pay tribute to them, because if they had not acted at the time, we would not have the defence industry that we do, especially on the Clyde.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41104-27_para18">
<a name="stpa_328">If we are to have a strong, robust and efficient defence industry, we must give the management and the work force the tools to realise that. That is why we need a long-term strategy that allows employers to plan, where possible, some years ahead in placing contracts and getting the tools to do the job. We must also consider the suppliers to the major contractors, because they have a right to know about the strategy. More importantly, employees in the defence industry must know the direction in which the Government&#039;s strategy for defence is going and how that will impact on them.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41104-27_para19">
<a name="stpa_329">I am proud of the Government&#039;s record on placing MOD contracts with British companies, and I hope that it continues. However, may I also send a message to British companies that depend wholly on defence contracts? The MOD requires only a finite amount of equipment and has only a finite amount of taxpayers&#039; money to spend. Every company involved in the defence industry should develop tangible diversification plans so that when there is a downturn in the defence industry, they will be able to compete in the commercial market.

 As many hon. Members have reminded us, while we sit talking in this comfortable Chamber it is important to bear it in mind that our soldiers, sailors and airmen are putting their lives on the line and themselves in danger on our behalf.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41104-28_para0">
<a name="stpa_330">The Minister of State told us how well defence procurement was going. To use his words, he highlighted our successes on defence procurement and said that all issues on smart acquisition had been

<br>&nbsp;<br>addressed. Sadly, few people who have spoken in the debate have agreed with him. I do not pretend that defence procurement is easy or that it was easy for Conservative Governments; anyone who does so is foolish. However, we must always remember the end result of failings in defence procurement; a frightened soldier, sailor or airman who is protecting our country&#039;s interest and defending us, yet who, because of deficient equipment&#151;a failed radio, a rifle that does not work properly or an engine that does not start&#151;might die. That explains why the debate is important.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41104-28_para1">
<a name="stpa_331">The Select Committee Chairman, the right hon. Member for Walsall, South (Mr. George) properly highlighted, with great wit, his Committee&#039;s report. He also highlighted the Minister&#039;s astonishing sensitivities when confronted with criticism. We all know that the truth hurts and that we only get really angry with criticism when it is justified. As many hon. Members said, the report needs a proper reasoned answer, not the Minister&#039;s petulant response, and the important points need to be addressed.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41104-28_para2">
<a name="stpa_332">If the Minister of State has moved to the right of my hon. Friend the Member for Aldershot (Mr. Howarth), he should start to be called Genghis by Labour MPs. [Hon. Members: &quot;He already is.&quot;] I was not aware of that.

<a name="41104-28_para3">
<a name="stpa_333">I do not often agree with the Liberal Democrats, but the hon. Member for South-East Cornwall (Mr. Breed) rightly talked of the looming crisis in research and development, echoing my hon. Friend the Member for Aldershot. He also spoke of the importance of the ownership of defence companies. Not all defence companies or products have to be British; that would be ridiculous. However, we are right to remember that ownership matters. In the Gulf war in 1991, our Belgian allies had a request from the Ministry of Defence for 5.56 small arms ammunition, which was running short. They refused it.
</p>

<p>

<a name="stpa_334">The hon. Member for Bolton, North-East (Mr. Crausby) spoke&#151;I hope he does not take this the wrong way&#151;a great deal of sense about defence industrial policy. He said that it is not necessarily benefiting the UK and has a bad effect on our industry while other countries benefit to our detriment. That was an excellent point.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41104-28_para5">
<a name="stpa_335">My hon. Friend the Member for Gosport (Mr. Viggers) described the indecipherable gobbledegook and management-speak of smart acquisition.

 I know that the right hon. Gentleman was here at the beginning, but he was not here when my hon. Friend the Member for Gosport spoke. My hon. Friend&#039;s point was reasonable. I have to confess that I have never visited Swan Hunter. I do not know what the situation is there. My hon.

</p>








<p><a name="st_199"><a name="41104-28_spnew7"><b> Mr. Brown: </b> 
 It is possible to follow the debate on the closed circuit television that we all have in our offices, which I have been doing. The remarks by the hon.

 I am not going to go on about this unimportant point. All this nonsense about an apology is unworthy of the right hon. Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, East and Wallsend (Mr. Brown). He should attend the debate instead of sitting with his feet up in his office drinking tea. If he had attended, he could have intervened on my hon. Friend the Member for Gosport. I was disappointed with my hon. Friend in one respect; he did not mention Haslar, which I think he has mentioned in every other debate.

Members for Bassetlaw (John Mann), for Glasgow, Pollok (Mr. Davidson) and for West Renfrewshire (Jim Sheridan) all made points that were not supportive of the Government. It was not that they were anti-Government, but their criticisms were good. Even in her loyal speech, the hon. Member for Stockton, South (Ms Taylor) reported that she had identified problems and demanded that the UK support UK defence manufacturing industry; a fair point.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41104-28_para7">
<a name="stpa_337">My right hon. Friend the Member for Fylde (Mr. Jack) made an excellent speech and asked some pertinent questions about the aerospace industry and where skills would come from. Those questions need answers from the Minister. The dialogue that he mentioned earlier is not enough.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41104-28_para8">
<a name="stpa_338">I joined the armed forces in 1970, which makes me distressingly old. I shall tell a short story that illustrates defence procurement. With a very short haircut I was shown around the Royal Marines commando training centre&#151;perhaps &quot;shown around&quot; is not the right way to describe it&#151;and I remember a signals captain showing me something called an A40. Some hon. Members may have carried an A40. It was a big one, and very heavy. I carried it across Dartmoor, the Brecon Beacons and all sorts of places. It was almost impossible to tune and very inefficient. The person who had the job of carrying it was 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>4 Nov 2004 : Column 532</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>the unlucky one. In 1970 the marine captain said, &quot;Don&#039;t worry, Clansman is coming in soon. It&#039;s a brilliant new set and we&#039;re all going to have Clansman.&quot; This is not a party political point, I hasten to tell the Minister. I rejoined my battalion in 1987 in Hong Kong and we still had Larkspur A40s. It was only in 1988, 18 years after I had been told that it was coming soon, that Clansman came in.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41104-28_para9">
<a name="stpa_339">I mention that because Bowman&#039;s original in-service date was 1995; under a Conservative Government, I know. The Labour Government said in 1999 that the in-service date was 2002 and it eventually came into service in March this year. Procurement is dogged by such delays. It needs to be sorted out, but I do not have any pat answers.

<p>
<a name="41104-28_para10">

<a name="stpa_341">but the Government cannot continue to claim that the strategy is working if, as we heard earlier, the 20 biggest projects are already delayed by, on average, a year and a half and the taxpayer is footing the bill for the Government&#039;s &#163;3 billion overspend. Typhoon was four and a half years behind its target in-service date and will cost at least &#163;1 billion more than promised.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41104-28_para12">
<a name="stpa_342">Let me emphasise the consequences of delays and overspend. Not only are service personnel jeopardised when they find themselves on the front line without the equipment that they need, but there is the prospect of having to cancel or scale down the size of projects, as in the case of Type 45 destroyers.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41104-28_para13">
<a name="stpa_343">My hon. Friend the Member for Aldershot mentioned the Defence Procurement Agency&#039;s &quot;woeful&quot; track record, which the Chairman of the Select Committee also described. The cancellation of the human centrifuge project, which has not been mentioned, is an example of how the MOD has lost its grip on the procurement process. In 1997 a contract worth &#163;14 million to design and build a human centrifuge to allow trainee pilots to experience G-force was let to the US firm Environmental Tectonics Corporation, ETC. In July 2001 the MOD took the decision to cancel the project, citing


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_40">&quot;the failure of that company to deliver a centrifuge to the Royal Air Force&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="41104-28_para14">
<a name="stpa_344">Before the project&#039;s cancellation, the MOD had already made progress payments of almost &#163;6 million, which were of course written off.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41104-28_para15">
<a name="stpa_345">The costs to the taxpayer of the centrifuge that never was do not end there. Earlier this year the MOD had to pay cancellation costs. According to the 2003&#150;04 annual report and accounts of the MOD, under the rather euphemistic heading &quot;Constructive Losses&quot;, the final cost of the project to the British taxpayer was reported to be &#163;14.4 million. The MOD paid more to cancel the project than it would have cost to acquire the centrifuge. The project was not cancelled on grounds of insurmountable risk or because of an inability to achieve the desired capability, as ETC was able to design and build the centrifuge. It was cancelled as a result of the Government&#039;s inability to manage the procurement process. I can report to the House that the centrifuge, 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>4 Nov 2004 : Column 533</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>designed and built with British taxpayers&#039; money, is in full operational service with a far eastern air force. That is what we call smart acquisition; by them.

<a name="41104-28_para16">
<a name="stpa_346">We hear much about future effects and capability, but what happens first is cuts. The promised future capability is often still at drawing-board level, while our forces have to cope with what they have been left with. Is that sensible at a time when our forces are experiencing overstretch as never before?

That is not new, because troops always like having other people&#039;s equipment, but nevertheless it is true. The hon. Member for South-East Cornwall mentioned equipment survey findings in Iraq. The 2003 survey for the Army last year found that 55 per cent. of troops and 42 per cent. of officers had bought items of kit with their own money.

When will the keels be laid? What will be the long-term running costs? I heard an extraordinary suggestion, which I am sure should be dismissed, of &#163;3 billion per year per ship. What will be the complement of each carrier and, given that the Minister is cutting manpower now, is he confident that trained crew will be available to man them? Will he say something about point defence and close-in weapons systems? Like our existing carriers, the US carriers have a close-in weapons system, but unlike ours they also have Sea Sparrow surface-to-air missiles. We will have to rely on the Carrier Air Group, but the Type 45 air defence ships will be reduced from the projected 12 to eight. That does not leave many spare for two carrier forces.

The Select Committee&#039;s report in July 2004 referred to the Astute programme and particularly mentioned that delays were exacerbated by shortfalls in skills. The MOD needs to concentrate on creating a stable procurement programme; a smoother pattern of demand in order to retain workers and protect the UK&#039;s valuable shipbuilding expertise, which I believe is referred to as gap filling.

They realise that they will not see it into service, so they try to put off making decisions. They do not want to see it in service because they will end up with the problems. My hon.

<a name="stpa_356">As the hon. Member for Blaby said, equipping our service personnel with battle-winning capabilities is a matter close to this House&#039;s heart. We owe a considerable debt to our people, and I pay tribute to those men and women in the armed forces who are currently engaged in serious and dangerous undertakings throughout the world. The Government are committed to ensuring that our armed forces remain highly capable and effective. Through our procurement plans and by making sure that our armed forces are

<a name="41104-29_para8">
<a name="stpa_357">In his opening remarks this afternoon, my right hon. Friend the Minister of State outlined the continued improvements to the way in which we procure equipment. Procurement is a vital part of the MOD&#039;s role and has often been subject to criticism. In his final words this afternoon, my right hon. Friend said, &quot;Do we have a perfect track record on procurement? No, but no Government ever have.&quot; That point should form the basis for this debate.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41104-29_para9">
<a name="stpa_358">We have taken many of the valid criticisms on board, but there is much to be proud about. The urgent operational requirement process rapidly equips and supports our armed forces at the front line in Iraq, and has been a success. The process proved to be flexible and adaptable, and I reject any suggestion that our forces have been let down by the MOD and the Government. Indeed, the hon. Member for Hereford (Mr. Keetch) raised urgent operational requirements in an intervention. Urgent operational requirements are an accepted means of supporting operations and are an effective and efficient way to target activity against emerging operational priorities. The National Audit Office has complimented the urgent operational requirement process.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41104-29_para10">
<a name="stpa_359">I shall respond to the comments made by the hon. Member for Aldershot (Mr. Howarth) about yesterday&#039;s court martial. I am sure that the House will join me in extending our deepest sympathies to the family of Sergeant Nightingale, who was killed in that tragic incident. We are aware of the finding of the court martial arising from the death of Sergeant Nightingale. Lance Corporal Braymire was found guilty of a military offence concerning his failure to conduct normal safety procedures, which do not involve advanced technical procedures. He had successfully completed his weapons handling test, which included passing the safety modules, during his mobilisation training.
</p>








<p><a name="st_206"><a name="41104-29_spnew2"><b> Mr. Soames: </b> 
 On Lance Corporal Braymire, will the Minister accept that 2,300 young men went to the Gulf as reservists without properly certified weapons training? Will he assure the House that the board of inquiry, which we understand has been set up, will report, that its findings will be made public and that the people responsible for that gross failing will be held to account, whatever rank, military or civilian, they may be?
</p>








<p><a name="st_207"><a name="41104-29_spnew3"><b> Mr. Caplin: </b> 
 The hon. Gentleman is right. In accordance with our normal procedures, an Army board of inquiry has been set up. It was rightly stayed, pending the outcome of the court martial. We have seen the findings of the court martial only in the past 24 hours and will of course consider very seriously the comments of the judge advocate. However, we are yet to receive a full copy of the transcript, and I think that the hon. Gentleman would accept that we should wait to see that before going any further.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41104-29_para11">
<a name="stpa_360">We heard about the ITAR waiver and the importance that the House attaches to it. There has been progress on that front. My right hon. Friend the Prime Minister last raised the issue with President Bush in June in the

</p>

<p>
<a name="41104-29_para12">
<a name="stpa_361">Much has been said about the Defence Committee&#039;s report on procurement, about which I intervened on my hon. Friend the Member for Vale of Glamorgan. I was rather taken with the Committee Chairman&#039;s suggestion that we should have preliminary discussions before the Government responses are published. That is okay provided that he is prepared to offer us the same facility before his Committee publishes a report. Perhaps the MOD and the Committee can discuss that in the weeks to come.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41104-29_para13">
<a name="stpa_362">I want to highlight one or two aspects of the Committee&#039;s report. It claimed that the performance of the Defence Procurement Agency could only be described as woeful; my right hon. Friend the Member for Walsall, South tried to suggest that the word was meant to be &quot;wonderful&quot;, which might have given a different tone to the whole report. We cannot accept that the agency&#039;s performance was woeful in that particular year, when it delivered &#163;3.6 billion of new equipment.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41104-29_para14">
<a name="stpa_363">The report said that there are still problems in relation to four legacy projects. We accept that, although I should say that the Committee particularly welcomed the progress that we have made on Nimrod and Astute to try to deal with the situation. Around 40 per cent. of the cost increases comprise internal interest on capital charges.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41104-29_para15">
<a name="stpa_364">The other significant aspect of the report relates to paragraph 53, which refers to a &quot;fear culture&quot; at the Defence Procurement Agency. Several hon. Members tried to explain what they think that means, but it clearly relates directly to staff. The Ministry of Defence wholeheartedly rejects the assertion that such a culture exists. The Committee did not substantiate it, and although it had many opportunities to consult MOD officials and my noble Friend Lord Bach, it failed to do so. The House will understand that such an accusation could have a serious effect on morale at the agency. I am afraid that the Committee did not properly think that through.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41104-29_para16">
<a name="stpa_365">I hope that we can move on from here, but it is right and proper to place on record our feelings about the report and its failings, notwithstanding the fact that that there are of course lessons to be learned from the Committee&#039;s comments.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41104-29_para17">
<a name="stpa_366">I want to move on to comments made by Members. Various Opposition Members suggested that CVF&#151;the future aircraft carrier&#151;is now being run by a committee. In fact, it is an alliance. That works well in other industries and there is no reason why it should not work well in defence procurement. As the House knows, BAE Systems is an important member of that alliance.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41104-29_para18">
<a name="stpa_367">I was very disappointed by what the hon. Member for Gosport said about Swan Hunter. I utterly reject his comments and strongly support those of my right hon. Friend the Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, East and Wallsend (Mr. Brown) and my hon. Friends the Members for Stockton, South and for Glasgow, Pollok. Conservative Front-Bench Members could, in winding up the debate, have dissociated themselves from the hon. Gentleman&#039;s comments; they should have done. 

<br>&nbsp;<br>

<br>&nbsp;<br>I&nbsp;will just say this: those who work at Swan Hunter and the people of the north-east will have heard what the hon. Gentleman said today.

<a name="stpa_368">The hon. Member for South-East Cornwall (Mr. Breed) asked me about Devonport, and I undertake to write to him about those issues. The hon. Member for Aldershot asked about Galileo. It is a civil system under civil control, as has been confirmed by successive EU Transport Councils. The requirement for navigation and timing information to support UK armed forces will continue to be met by GPS, which remains the de facto NATO standard.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41104-29_para20">
<a name="stpa_369">I return to the hon. Member for Gosport&#151;on a slightly happier note, I hope&#151;to answer his point about shipbuilding. There are three Astutes, two Type 45 destroyers and two handling ship docks that he might regard as being in some phase of construction.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41104-29_para21">
<a name="stpa_370">There was a suggestion that the Defence Procurement Agency accounts may affect our ability to complete some of our planned projects. The figures presented show the value of actual contracts placed with suppliers, less any expenditure recorded elsewhere in the accounts. They do not in any way mean that funding to meet commitments for our procurement programme is not available. I hope that I have clarified that point.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41104-29_para22">
<a name="stpa_371">In the short time remaining, I want to make a couple of final points about industrial policy and future capabilities. My right hon. Friend the Minister of State set out in his opening remarks the key principles of the defence industrial policy and the importance of defence manufacturing industrial support. That was welcomed by many Labour Members, including my hon. Friend the Member for Stockton, South. I take this opportunity to emphasise a further aspect of that important policy. Our partnership with industry is crucial in equipping and sustaining our front-line forces. In achieving those objectives, it is vital that the Ministry of Defence and industry continue to work together. We must seek fully to understand the pressures on industry but, in return, industry must respond effectively to the challenge of delivering equipment to time and to cost in fulfilling the contracts that it wins from the MOD.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41104-29_para23">
<a name="stpa_372">On future capabilities, I want to emphasise that the challenges faced by our armed forces are complex and ever changing, as I hope the House understands. We have to make difficult procurement decisions today and tomorrow to equip our forces for that unpredictable future. We are often looking decades in advance, so it is not a simple business. Just as our armed forces will have to be increasingly flexible and adaptable in future, so will our procurement plans. The proposals outlined in the future capabilities announcement by my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State in July will be implemented over the coming years. We plan to increase our capacity to undertake expeditionary operations alongside an equipment programme that is delivering, and will continue to deliver, an advanced range of capabilities.

Our future procurement programme will support more flexible and deployable forces with world-beating kit tailored to achieve that effect.

<a name="stpa_378">I must admit that until I received a telephone call on the evening of 19 October, I was only sketchily aware of the long and wretched story of the Chagos islands and their people. It is a shabby story of international power politics and betrayal. It is a stain on the integrity of British foreign policy. I know that the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister is not responsible for foreign policy, but I will argue that it now has a key responsibility for the consequences of what happened.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41104-30_para4">
<a name="stpa_379">I do not wish to replicate the excellent speech of my hon. Friend the Member for Reigate (Mr. Blunt) in Westminster Hall yesterday. The focus of this debate is on the practical problems that we face now and in the future. It is clear, however, that past Government actions led directly to the call that I received on 19 October, and to the problem that we are discussing today. It is therefore worth rehearsing those briefly.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41104-30_para5">
<a name="stpa_380">In 1966, Harold Wilson&#039;s Government acquiesced to an American request to purchase and depopulate the British Indian Ocean Territory in order to build an airbase on the principal island of Diego Garcia. It has been suggested that, in return, Britain got a special offer on Polaris submarines. Be that as it may, the plantations were closed, and with them the island&#039;s economy. The supply ships were diverted and the majority of the islanders were exiled to a slum area of Port Louis, the capital of Mauritius. Some went to the Seychelles. Eventually, in November 2000, following an action brought by the chairman of the Chagos refugees group, the High Court ruled that the islanders had the legal right to return. Attempts to return, however, were obstructed and proved unsuccessful.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41104-30_para6">
<a name="stpa_381">Under the British Overseas Territories Act 2002, a majority of the exiles became British citizens, allowing them to enter and reside in the United Kingdom. In 2003, about 100 destitute islanders arrived at Gatwick airport and settled in Crawley, West Sussex. It is good to see the hon. Member for Crawley (Laura Moffatt) in her place, as I know that she has wrestled with this issue for some considerable time. It is reported that the support that they have so far received from West Sussex county council has cost local taxpayers &#163;500,000.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41104-30_para7">
<a name="stpa_382">I have said that this is a shabby story. The latest and, perhaps, shabbiest twist of all came in June this year. On the day of the local government and European elections, 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>4 Nov 2004 : Column 541</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>when eyes were elsewhere, without notification to the House, let alone debate, the Government signed two Orders in Council, the effect of which was to overturn the High Court judgment and reimpose the legal ban on the islanders&#039; ability to return to Diego Garcia.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41104-30_para8">
<a name="stpa_383">This is the position: the Government have finally cut off the remaining hope of returning to the islands, and legislated to enable the islanders to come to Britain. Given that the only other choice available is to remain in Port Louis, where they claim to live in conditions of poverty, drug abuse, unemployment and prostitution, it is hardly surprising that many would prefer to make a new life in Britain. Certainly, I have no argument with their decision to do so.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41104-30_para9">
<a name="stpa_384">Now we come to the telephone call of 19 October. It was from Councillor Mrs. Spiers, leader of Reigate and Banstead borough council. She told me that 45 islanders had arrived at Gatwick and, following a court decision that discharged West Sussex county council from an obligation to house all but the most vulnerable of them, 33 had effectively thrown themselves on the mercy of her council. They were being housed in temporary accommodation in Horley in my constituency, at a cost of some &#163;20 per person per night. Her question was straightforward: she understood the plight of the islanders, but why should the council tax payers of Reigate and Banstead be solely responsible for footing the bill for their maintenance? That is a question that I hope the hon. Member for Gillingham (Paul Clark) will answer directly.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41104-30_para10">
<a name="stpa_385">My expectations of a helpful response are not high. When my conversation with Councillor Mrs. Spiers had ended, and having established via the Home Office that this was not an immigration issue&#151;on the ground that the individuals concerned were British&#151;but a matter for the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister, I sent an urgent fax to the Minister for Local and Regional Government, setting out the issue and concluding:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_43">&quot;I would be most grateful if you might let me know what provisions exist for your Department to provide financial support to the Council to cover these exceptional circumstances: and it would also be greatly appreciated if you could arrange for an appropriate official to contact the Council as a matter of urgency in order to discuss the situation&quot;.</p>

<p>
<a name="41104-30_para12">
<a name="stpa_387">That was on 19 October. It is now 4 November, and nobody from the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister has bothered to make any contact with the council. It would be helpful if the hon. Gentleman could explain why there has been no communication at all, despite that urgent request.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41104-30_para13">
<a name="stpa_388">My hon. Friend the Member for Reigate and I visited the islanders last Friday. They have been moved into a block of sheltered flats, somewhat to the alarm of a number of elderly residents, and although their accommodation is cramped, they are being well cared for. The council deserves to be congratulated on the way that it has handled the issue. It immediately reacted with humanitarian assistance, while at the same time seeking to protect local residents from a potentially open-ended financial liability. It thus sought to discharge its moral duty to the islanders and fiduciary duty to local people.

</p>

<p>
<a name="41104-30_para14">
<a name="stpa_389">As the Minister will know, solicitors acting for the Chagossians successfully sought a judicial review of the council&#039;s decision to refuse temporary accommodation in respect of one of the applicants, on the ground that he was not habitually resident. Pending the outcome of the judicial review, the council decided to accommodate all the islanders, in order, as it said, to save the public purse from any further judicial review requests. The court determined on 1 November that the council should continue to house them until the outcome of the review of the original decision. Meanwhile, the council is assessing the islanders&#039; entitlements under separate homelessness legislation. I am sorry if this all sounds a bit complicated, Mr. Deputy Speaker, but I am afraid that it is.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41104-30_para15">
<a name="stpa_390">The House might take the view that it was strange for the court to come to a decision that the islanders could arguably be considered to be habitual residents of the United Kingdom when they had only been here for a couple of weeks. But this decision only serves to underline the need for the Government to intervene to resolve the matter. Having looked at the full circumstances of the case and its history, Mr. Justice Moses acknowledged&#151;and this is significant&#151;that the real issue was the Government&#039;s need to address the problems of the islanders. He said that there were very unusual circumstances in the case, and that, in his view, a substantive case could be made that the habitual residence occurred as soon as the Chagossians arrived in the United Kingdom.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41104-30_para16">
<a name="stpa_391">Mr. Justice Moses stated that he had great sympathy with the local authority, saying that it was certainly arguable that this was a matter not for the authority but for central Government. However, he was quite clear that, in a humane and civilised society, it was unacceptable not to provide any temporary accommodation for the islanders, as that would merely mean that they would return to Gatwick, where there were no facilities whatever. He is quoted in today&#039;s edition of the <i>Surrey Mirror</i> under the rather unhelpful but none the less true headline, &quot;You foot bill for homeless Diego Garcians&quot;, saying:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_44">&quot;The prospect of their wandering around and gravitating back to Gatwick is not something that any civilised human being can contemplate.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="41104-30_para17">
<a name="stpa_392">Given the unique circumstances of the case, this judgment seems understandable. However, it does nothing to resolve the difficulties faced by the council, or the basic injustice of requiring my constituents, and those of my hon. Friends the Members for Reigate and for Epsom and Ewell, to foot the entire bill for housing the islanders for an undetermined period of time.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41104-30_para18">

<a name="41104-30_para19">
<a name="stpa_394">My hon. Friend the Member for Reigate asked in the debate yesterday why more than 900 passports had been applied for when these people had perfectly good Mauritian travel documents of their own. It would be responsible to conclude that at least 900 people are actively considering following their compatriots to Gatwick; a further 4,100 are in a position to do so. It would be logical to expect them to want to settle close to other former islanders in the Horley and Gatwick areas. It would therefore be sensible for the Government to make plans now for this event.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41104-30_para20">
<a name="stpa_395">I am aware that solicitors acting for the islanders are seeking an exemption from the relevant regulations so that, on arrival, they may be deemed eligible for housing and other benefits. If they are successful in this, it would certainly help the council&#039;s legal bills, but it would compound the problems that it faces in meeting the needs of the islanders from its very limited means. I am sure that I do not have to warn the hon. Gentleman of the consequences were thousands of islanders to arrive and were the cost of their maintenance to remain a local responsibility.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41104-30_para21">
<a name="stpa_396">I am proud to say that local people have to date shown sympathy and good will towards the islanders, although I have already been asked by one homeless man why he is sleeping rough in a playing field when the islanders are not. I remind the hon. Gentleman that there are at present about 2,000 people already on the waiting list for housing in the Reigate and Banstead area. Good will can be stretched only so far. It is therefore essential that, in replying to this debate, he understands the potentially very serious nature of the issue.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41104-30_para22">
<a name="stpa_397">As I said in yesterday&#039;s debate, the long-term solution lies with the Foreign Office, and I was pleased to hear that the Foreign Office Minister has indicated that he would consider raising the question of aid measures with the Department for International Development. However, the short-term solution lies with the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister. We are seeking a solution that is fair both to the islanders and to local residents. The problem has arisen as a result of action by central Government, and it is time for central Government to shoulder their responsibilities.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41104-30_para23">
<a name="stpa_398">The Minister may recall that a few years ago, when Surrey unexpectedly played host to General Pinochet, the county police were awarded a special one-off payment from the Home Office to help offset the exceptional security costs associated with their new temporary resident, on the ground that he was in Surrey for reasons to do with Government decisions entirely beyond Surrey&#039;s control. There is an obvious parallel in the present case.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41104-30_para24">
<a name="stpa_399">Let me end with another quotation from the<i> Surrey Mirror</i>&#039;s report of the recent court hearing:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_46">&quot;Told that, until the legal issues were resolved, there was nothing that Central Government could do, the judge suggested: &#039;Well, write a cheque&#039;&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="41104-30_para25">

<p><a name="st_219"><a name="41104-31_spnew0"><b> Mr. Crispin Blunt  (Reigate) (Con):</b> 
 I am grateful to my&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hon. Friend the Member for East Surrey (Mr. Ainsworth) for allowing me to make a brief 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>4 Nov 2004 : Column 544</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>contribution, and for his kind words about my debate with the Under-Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, the hon. Member for Harlow (Mr. Rammell) yesterday.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41104-31_para0">
<a name="stpa_401">Yesterday&#039;s reply was extremely disappointing. It did not suggest that the Government were treating the issue with the seriousness and immediacy that it requires. It is a consequence of the Government&#039;s Orders in Council, presented in June, that we now face what is potentially an increasingly difficult challenge for local authorities. It is very important for the services required for these people to be established in Mauritius and the Seychelles before they come to the United Kingdom&#151;but if the Government are not going to do that, they really must offer assistance to the local authorities that have to host the people.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41104-31_para1">
<a name="stpa_402">There is a clear need for joined-up government. If the hon. Member for Gillingham has nothing to offer local authorities this evening, as the Under-Secretary had nothing to offer the people of Diego Garcia and the rest of the Chagos islands yesterday, I must tell him that this will certainly not be the last he has heard of the matter.


<a name="time_22">
<a name="41104-31_time0"><h5>6.16 pm</h5>
</p>








<p><a name="st_220"><a name="41104-31_spnew1"><b> Paul Clark  (Gillingham) (Lab):</b> 
 I congratulate the hon. Member for East Surrey (Mr. Ainsworth) on securing the debate.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41104-31_para2">
<a name="stpa_403">The Government are well aware of the importance of the issues facing local authorities as a result of the arrival of a number of Chagossians in Britain. I hope that following my response the hon. Gentleman, and the hon. Member for Reigate (Mr. Blunt), will appreciate the importance that we attach to this, and will also take account of the resources that have been and are available and of other issues arising from the case.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41104-31_para3">
<a name="stpa_404">Because there was clearly a very good debate in Westminster Hall yesterday, and because my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs responded to it, I do not want to go into details of the history at great length; but following what the hon. Member for East Surrey has said, I want to put one or two things on record.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41104-31_para4">
<a name="stpa_405">The Chagos islands were part of the dependency of Mauritius, and continue to be administered under that scheme. On achieving independence in 1968, with the agreement of the Mauritius Council of Ministers they were detached to form part of the British Indian Ocean Territory, which was rightly created to meet the defence needs of the United States and Britain. I am sure the hon. Gentleman will know that the plantations to which he referred were ceasing to be economically viable at the time. For that reason as well as for defence reasons, it was decided that the islanders should be removed. That happened in the late 1960s and early 1970s.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41104-31_para5">
<a name="stpa_406">The vast majority of the islanders, some 1,200, were relocated to Mauritius, although some went to the Seychelles. They automatically acquired either Mauritian or Seychelles citizenship when those countries achieved independence, and they retained their status as citizens of the United Kingdom and the colonies. Entirely correctly, under the British Overseas Territories Act 2002 they were given the additional status of full British citizenship. That carries the right of abode in the United Kingdom, and as we know and the hon. Gentleman mentioned, some have taken up that 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>4 Nov 2004 : Column 545</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>opportunity. Of course, that also gives them freedom of access to other European countries, but the suggestion that the Orders in Council may have been used in an underhand way is incorrect. The hon. Gentleman will be well aware that it is common practice to deal with such decisions through the use of Orders in Council when amending the constitution of an overseas territory, so nothing different was done in that regard. In addition, some of the islanders were in fact seeking British citizenship before the Orders in Council were put in place. They continue to apply for such citizenship, as we know.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41104-31_para6">
<a name="stpa_407">Any Chagossian applying for a British passport at our high commission in Mauritius receives clear guidance on what to expect if they travel to the UK. This guidance&#151;in the form of a leaflet in English and Creole that is placed in each passport&#151;stresses that it is their responsibility to ensure before travelling that they have the necessary resources, or that they can rely on friends or family who are already here.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41104-31_para7">
<a name="stpa_408">In addition, our high commissioner in Mauritius wrote to the leading member of the Chagossian community on 27 September. It is worth quoting that letter, which states:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_47">&quot;Those Chagossians who are British citizens are of course free to go the United Kingdom if they wish. However, as you know, those that do exercise this right cannot expect more favourable treatment than any other British citizen going to the United Kingdom from abroad and, just like any other British citizen, they have to fulfil the normal conditions of entitlement and habitual residence before qualifying for social security benefits etc. These entitlements are clearly set out in the leaflet which accompanies each new passport issued to members of your community by the British High Commission passport section.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>








<p><a name="st_221"><a name="41104-31_spnew2"><b> Mr. Ainsworth: </b> 
 I would be grateful if the hon. Gentleman explained whether that letter is legally binding in any way, and if so, whether anyone had told Mr. Justice Moses.
</p>








<p><a name="st_222"><a name="41104-31_spnew3"><b> Paul Clark: </b> 
 We have a duty and a responsibility to ensure that we communicate clearly to such people their position and rights, to the extent that they prevail. We are making it clear through the issuing of that letter that those who seek to come here as British citizens have no automatic right to accommodation or benefits. As I understand it, that letter was given wide coverage in the Mauritian press. Such information is also given to every new applicant for a British passport, including the 900 people who recently applied, to whom the hon. Gentleman referred.
</p>








<p><a name="st_223"><a name="41104-31_spnew4"><b> Mr. Ainsworth: </b> 
 The point is that such people are currently receiving accommodation at the expense of the public purse, so something seems to have gone wrong with the hon. Gentleman&#039;s logic.
</p>








<p><a name="st_224"><a name="41104-31_spnew5"><b> Paul Clark: </b> 
 Nothing has gone wrong with the logic. What we have to understand is the legal responsibilities and the legalities of the process of becoming a British citizen, and the rights to which that entitles individuals. I will deal in due course with homelessness, local authorities and the resources available.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41104-31_para8">
<a name="stpa_409">I turn to the Reigate and Banstead case. I listened very carefully to what was said about the number of such people who could come to this country. That is an issue, 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>4 Nov 2004 : Column 546</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>but we have to deal with the facts. It was suggested that thousands could come, but the fact that 900 people have applied for passports does not mean that all will come here to seek accommodation and resources; it is not necessary to follow that logic. Small groups of Chagossians have made their way to the UK. The most recent group, of some 43, arrived at Gatwick airport at the beginning of October. I have said very clearly that they are welcome to be here in the UK, but we have also made it clear that they are expected to support and accommodate themselves when they arrive. Income-related benefits and local authority housing are generally not available to persons from abroad, including British citizens, who are not habitually resident in the UK.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41104-31_para9">
<a name="stpa_410">In the case of the most recent arrivals, I understand that they were all accommodated by West Sussex county council for a temporary period while care assessments were made under the National Assistance Act 1948. I believe that the county council is continuing to accommodate a small number of them. Most of the Chagossians were subsequently required to leave the hotel accommodation provided by West Sussex council, and it seems that the next port of call for them was the housing authority. Accommodation was provided by West Sussex in Horley, in the hon. Gentleman&#039;s constituency in the district of Reigate and Banstead borough council. About 31 applications have now been made under the homelessness legislation.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41104-31_para10">
<a name="stpa_411">We must recognise that homelessness legislation is there to protect all people who are genuinely homeless or claim to be genuinely homeless. That is why I laid out clearly what our High Commission says to British citizens about what they can expect. When they are here, they then fall under the provisions of the homelessness legislation, which provides an important safety net for vulnerable people who find themselves facing a housing crisis.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41104-31_para11">
<a name="stpa_412">Where specified criteria are met&#151;that is, that applicants are eligible for assistance, have become homeless through no fault of their own and fall within a priority need group&#151;the local housing authority must ensure that suitable accommodation is available until a settled home can be found. Lesser duties apply in cases where homelessness is intentional or where the applicant does not have a priority need for accommodation. Those categories are defined in the legislation.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41104-31_para12">
<a name="stpa_413">I understand that the decision by Reigate and Banstead, in all the cases concerning the Chagossian arrivals, was that the applicants were ineligible for housing assistance because they were persons from abroad who were not habitually resident in the UK, or the wider area including the Channel Islands or the Isle of Man. I am sure that all hon. Members would agree that it is important for proper decisions to be made concerning homeless applications, and would understand why safeguards are built into the legislation.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41104-31_para13">
<a name="stpa_414">Applicants have the right to ask the local authority internally to review a decision that they are ineligible for assistance, and I understand that the Chagos islanders have exercised that right with the Reigate and Banstead borough council. As a further safeguard, the legislation also gives local housing authorities a discretionary power to accommodate applicants while they carry out 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>4 Nov 2004 : Column 547</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>a review. Reigate and Banstead council originally decided not to exercise its power to provide applicants with accommodation, pending an internal review. There has also been a review of the High Court proceedings, to which the hon. Gentleman referred.
</p>

<p><a name="st_225"><a name="41104-32_spnew0"><b> Mr. Ainsworth: </b> 
 We are running short of time, so I would be grateful if, before the hon. Gentleman concludes, he could say very simply whether he believes that it is fair that our constituents should foot the bill, solely and by themselves, for these people who are here as a direct consequence of the Government&#039;s actions. Does he not think that it would be a fairer system if the Government shouldered their own responsibility in this case?
</p>








<p><a name="st_226"><a name="41104-32_spnew1"><b> Paul Clark: </b> 
 Of course, the hon. Gentleman will be well aware of the substantial moneys that local government receives for a whole host of activities that councils have to carry out and have to meet in the numerous operations in which they are involved. That was very much the point that I was making. Members cannot ignore the substantial increases in moneys that have gone to local authorities. There has been a 30 per cent. real-terms increase over the last seven years. That is a fact and there is no question about it. Additionally, substantially more moneys have been announced in the spending review earlier this year as going into local government finance generally. Authorities in Surrey have benefited from the extra money that we have made available. Surrey county council received a grant increase 7.7 per cent. increase in this year&#039;s settlement, well above the average for county councils. District councils also received good grant increases, with Reigate and Banstead receiving a grant increase of 3.6 per cent.
</p>








<p><a name="st_227"><a name="41104-32_spnew2"><b> Mr. Blunt: </b> 
 Will the hon. Gentleman give way?
</p>








<p><a name="st_228"><a name="41104-32_spnew3"><b> Paul Clark: </b> 
 I will give way if there is time, but I want to answer the hon. Member for East Surrey properly. 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>4 Nov 2004 : Column 548</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>The House will be aware that the homelessness provision given by the Government to local authorities is made by means of the formula block known as the environmental, protective and cultural services. Local authorities have substantial flexibility when it comes to its use.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41104-32_para0">
<a name="stpa_415">We have also given local authorities substantial direct resources through the rate support grant, but the issue at the heart of this debate is of a piece with the difficulty in respect of homelessness and housing that all authorities face, but especially those in London and the south-east. The pressures are substantial.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41104-32_para1">
<a name="stpa_416">The Government are putting substantial moneys into meeting the requirements of making affordable housing available and making provision for homeless families. That is true in Reigate and Banstead, and everywhere else in the country. We are well aware of the pressures that local authorities face, but we have made substantial additional resources available.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41104-32_para2">
<a name="stpa_417">I know that the events under discussion were unexpected, but we expect local authorities to plan for any such contingency that might arise. Substantial increases in resources have been made available to Reigate and Banstead, and substantial reserves are available to enable local authorities meet any contingency.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41104-32_para3">
<a name="stpa_418">Legislation is in place to protect people who are genuinely homeless, and the necessary procedures are in hand.
