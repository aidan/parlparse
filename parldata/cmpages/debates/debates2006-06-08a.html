What recent discussions he has had with ministerial
colleagues on the future of the Royal Mail and Post Office in Scotland.

Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Trade and Industry (Jim
Fitzpatrick):</b> Good morning, Mr. Speaker. DTI Ministers and
officials have regular discussions with other Government Department
colleagues on matters relating to Royal Mail and the Post Office
network.</p><p><a name="06060865000041">The
Under-Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, my
hon. Friend the Member for Brent, North (Barry Gardiner), who was
previously Under-Secretary at the DTI with responsibility for postal
services, met Ross Finnie, Minister for Environment and Rural
Development at the Scottish Executive, on 6 March to discuss a range of
issues relating to post
offices.</p><p><a name="06060865000042"><b><a name="06060865001071">Mr.
Carmichael:</b> I thank the Minister for that answer. Will he
and his ministerial colleagues encourage the chief executive of
Postcomm to engage better with communities on the future of Royal Mail
and the Post Office? I recently wrote to her inviting her to attend a
function in my constituency to discuss the future of postal services,
and she told me that she felt that she could learn all that she needed
to know by holding seminars in Edinburgh, Perth and Dundee. We in the
Isles have some difficulty with that attitude, because there is genuine
concern about the issue and people want to engage in the debate. We
need better responses from Postcomm than
that.</p><p><a name="06060865000043"><b><a name="06060865001072">Jim
Fitzpatrick:</b> I hear what the hon. Gentleman says and I
know that he will have a seminar in Orkney in due course. My
understanding is that the head of the rural network in Scotland for
Post Office Ltd will attend the Orkney seminar, and that it will also
be represented at the Shetland event. The Department is keen to do what
it can to maintain a sustainable network. We have 
<br><notus-date day="8" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>8 Jun 2006 : Column 378</b><br>committed &#163;2 billion to Post Office Ltd, including
&#163;750 million up to 2008 to support the rural network in
particular. We will be very interested in the outcome of his
seminar.</p><p><a name="06060865000044"><b><a name="06060865001073">Mr.
Brian H. Donohoe (Central Ayrshire) (Lab):</b> The Minister
may not know that the post office in Irvine in my constituency, which
serves some 30,000 people, is to be franchised. One of my reservations
about that proposal is that the franchise will include licensed
premises. Many elderly people in the area are opposed to that concept
and fear the whole idea. It is also almost bizarre that staff have only
recently undergone a training programme to help to widen the scope of
the business of the Crown post office, but it will now be of no use
whatsoever.</p><p><a name="06060865000045"><b><a name="06060865001074">Jim
Fitzpatrick:</b> I can understand my hon. Friend&#146;s
concern, although I have to confess that I did not know about that
initiative until he mentioned it to me earlier. The Post Office has to
look at modern ways of working, and franchising works in other parts of
the country. Having conducted a &#163;25 million pilot to determine
modern ways of providing services, we will examine closely anything
that has a positive effect on the sustainability of the service. I am
happy to hear more from my hon. Friend on the issue. If he drops me a
line, I will look further into the initiative that he
mentions.</p><p><a name="06060865000046"><b><a name="06060865001075">Mr.
Mike Weir (Angus) (SNP):</b> Does the Minister understand the
fear in rural areas of Scotland when Adam Crozier, the chief executive
of Royal Mail, talks about a &#147;radical transformation&#148; of
the network as a result of the collapse in Government work, such as
benefits payments? In the recent deal between the Government and the
Royal Mail, it was made clear
that</p><a name="06060865000949"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;the level of any
support after 2008 will depend on decisions on the future of the post
office
network&#148;.</p></ul><p><a name="06060865000047">Who
will take decisions on the future of the post office network? Will it
be Royal Mail or the Government, depending on the amount of money that
they put
in?</p><p><a name="06060865000048"><b><a name="06060865001076">Jim
Fitzpatrick:</b> I hear what the hon. Gentleman says about the
lack of Government support, and I hope that I have rebutted that by
demonstrating the &#163;750 million that we have committed to the
rural network in particular. It is not the Government&#146;s fault
that people are not choosing to use the post office. Habits are
changing and the internet is available: there are many reasons why
people are not using the post
offices<i> &#151;[</i><i> Interruption.</i><i> ]</i> Some 1,200 post
offices have fewer than 60 customer visits a week and 800 have fewer
than 20. The issue of sustainability has to be addressed, and I will be
happy to engage with the hon. Gentleman in due course in respect of his
local post offices.</p><h3 align="center"><a name="06060865000025">Energy

Secretary of State for Trade and Industry (Mr. Alistair
Darling):</b> The Government published a consultation document
on 23 January this year inviting responses on energy policy issues. We
expect to report to the House before the summer
recess.</p><p><a name="06060865000052"><b><a name="06060865001080">Mr.
Mackay:</b> The Secretary of State is aware that energy
supplies were very tight last winter and are likely to be even tighter
over the next couple of years. What is he doing to ensure that the
lights stay on next winter?</p><p><a name="06060865000053"><b><a name="06060865001081">Mr.
Darling:</b> The right hon. Gentleman is right: energy
supplies were tight last winter, and they are likely to be tight again
this winter. We expect a pipeline bringing gas from Norway to come
online, and that will help, as will an expansion of the capacity to
bring gas across from Belgium. We will also have the Rough storage
facility back, but there is no doubt that we will have to take various
steps over the next few months to ensure that we can get through the
coming winter. That is all the more reason why we should take realistic
action to ensure that we safeguard the security of our energy supplies,
this winter and in the years to
come.</p><p><a name="06060865000054"><b><a name="06060865001082">Peter
Luff:</b> We urgently need investment in new generating
capacity, but the single most important issue that the review must
resolve is the development of a long-term mechanism for the pricing
allocation of carbon. The current emissions trading scheme is welcome,
but it does not give investors the confidence that they need to make
very large investments. How confident is the Secretary of State that it
will be possible to negotiate a mechanism that will apply for, say, 20
years? If that cannot be done internationally, what freedom of
manoeuvre does he have domestically to develop a system that will bring
forward that
investment?</p><p><a name="06060865000055"><b><a name="06060865001083">Mr.
Darling:</b> Again, the hon. Gentleman is right. The industry
must have certainty, as many investment decisions will have to be taken
over the next few years and the price of carbon will be one of the
elements determining those decisions. As the House would expect, the
Government have been actively engaged with our European partners. I
attended a meeting in Brussels on Friday, at which we discussed the ETS
and emphasised the need to fix a carbon price over a long period. That
is very important, as the industry needs that certainty before it takes
the decisions that we need it to take in respect of the provision of
power supply in the
future.</p><p><a name="06060865000056"><b><a name="06060865001084">Miss
Anne Begg (Aberdeen, South) (Lab):</b> In all the discussions
about the energy review, will my right hon. Friend assure me that he
will not get bogged down in the nuclear debate? The oil and gas
industry still has a long-term future: Cogent, the sector skills
council, has an oil and gas training arm called OPITO that is
encouraging young people to go into the industry to fill existing
skills shortages and gaps. It is seeking to convince them that the
industry has a future and that they will still have jobs in 20, 30 or
40 years.</p><p><a name="06060865000057"><b><a name="06060865001085">Mr.
Darling:</b> My hon. Friend is right that nuclear is only one
element of our energy supply. It makes up 19 per cent. of our
provision, and we need to consider the totality. I have said on many
occasions&#151;and I repeated the point when I was last in
Aberdeen&#151;that a lot of oil and gas remains in the North sea and
that there is a lot of work there. The industry employs many 
<br><notus-date day="8" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>8 Jun 2006 : Column 380</b><br>people, and provides many highly skilled and good jobs. I certainly
agree that we ought to be encouraging people, in the north-east of
Scotland and across the whole country, to consider a career in the oil
and gas industry. It has a very good future, and it is an industry that
we want to encourage.</p><p><a name="06060865000058"><b><a name="06060865001086">Helen
Goodman (Bishop Auckland) (Lab):</b> Obviously, one part of
the energy review will consider measures to reduce demand. In an
important speech earlier this week, my right hon. Friend floated the
idea of changing the role of electricity producers to suppliers of
total services. How quickly might that happen, and what impact will it
have on reducing demand?</p><p><a name="06060865000059"><b><a name="06060865001087">Mr.
Darling:</b> My hon. Friend is right that we must reduce the
demand for energy. A central question in the energy review is how we as
a nation can reduce the amount of energy that we consume, and a
successful resolution of that question could mean that we would not
need as many new power stations as might otherwise be the case. Earlier
this week, I set out my belief that we need to consider how we can
incentivise energy supply companies to deliver ways in which demand
might be reduced&#151;such as through the use of insulation, smart
metering or other technology, for example. That approach is radically
different from the way in which companies at present are incentivised
to sell as much heat and light as they can, albeit in a way that causes
prices to be driven down. The process will therefore take some time,
but the industry is willing to discuss it and it will be a central part
of the review when we report in a few
weeks.</p><p><a name="06060865000060"><b><a name="06060865001088">Mr.
Tobias Ellwood (Bournemouth, East) (Con):</b> In his reply to
my right hon. Friend the Member for Bracknell (Mr. Mackay), the
Secretary of State talked about gas distribution but failed to cover
the price rises that were the real problem for people last winter. To a
large extent, those rises were caused by the continued absence of the
common gas market that Britain was supposed to pursue during our EU
presidency. Will the right hon. Gentleman indicate whether we are going
to go down that road, and whether it will be included in the energy
review?</p><p><a name="06060865000061"><b><a name="06060865001089">Mr.
Darling:</b> The right hon. Member for Bracknell asked me
about distribution, which is why I answered the question as I did. The
hon. Member for Bournemouth, East (Mr. Ellwood) is right that there is
considerable concern about recent price rises. During the course of our
presidency, we asked the Competition Commissioner to do everything
possible to ensure a far more open and transparent market. The hon.
Gentleman will doubtless have seen that over the past few weeks the
Competition Commissioner has served notice that she will enforce the
current rules and regulations. Recently, there have been raids on some
electricity companies in different parts of Europe and I hope that,
right across Europe, people are getting the message that if we believe
in a genuine open market, everyone has to play by the rules so that we
can see exactly what the prices are and exactly how much gas there is.
That is essential if we are to bring down prices and we fully support
everything that the Competition Commissioner is
doing.</p><br><notus-date day="8" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>8 Jun 2006 : Column 381</b><br><p><a name="06060865000062"><b><a name="06060865001090">Colin
Challen (Morley and Rothwell) (Lab):</b> Will the energy
review have anything to say about providing more information to energy
consumers? If we buy a can of beans and see how many calories are in it
and every other food product has similar labelling, why cannot we see
from our fuel bills how much CO2 we are emitting as a result
of our
consumption?</p><p><a name="06060865000063"><b><a name="06060865001091">Mr.
Darling:</b> I agree that we should provide far more
information on our fuel bills&#151;not just about how much CO2
is emitted. It would also be useful to make comparisons so that
consumers can see how much electricity or gas they consumed this
quarter as opposed to the previous quarter. Smart metering would mean
that people could see exactly how much electricity they were consuming
and how much they were paying for it at any time. A range of measures
can be adopted to help reduce the demand for energy, which has to be a
good thing.</p><p><a name="06060865000064"><b><a name="06060865001092">Mr.
Alan Duncan (Rutland and Melton) (Con):</b> Only last week, I
visited three intensive gas users in Yorkshire and found that the price
that they have to pay for their gas is far higher than they would pay
for the same gas in France or Germany. The punitive and unfair premium
on their costs is destroying some UK companies and is undermining UK
competitiveness. Further to what my hon. Friend the Member for
Bournemouth, East (Mr. Ellwood) asked a few moments ago, when does the
Secretary of State believe that the EU will have resolved its illiberal
and selfish practices, which are currently protecting its own companies
and severely disadvantaging
ours?</p><p><a name="06060865000065"><b><a name="06060865001093">Mr.
Darling:</b> As I said to the hon. Member for Bournemouth,
East (Mr. Ellwood) a few moments ago, the Competition Commissioner is
taking action. One problem is that, historically, companies in this
country have bought electricity on a short-term basis whereas many of
our European competitors have entered into long-term contracts. As I
have said, it is important that markets operate openly, and part of the
reason the price is so high is the uncertainty in the market, which
needs to be resolved as quickly as
possible.</p><p><a name="06060865000066"><b><a name="06060865001094">Mr.
Duncan:</b> One of the main ways of resolving the exposure
that intensive gas users face is to see just such an increase in
long-term pricing contracts, but Ministers have been foolish enough in
the past to recommend that companies forsake such contracts and buy on
the spot market instead, which is rather like the Chancellor selling
our gold. What prospect does the Secretary of State see for the
creation of new and better contracts that can alleviate the volatility
that industrial users of gas face in Britain
today?</p><p><a name="06060865000067"><b><a name="06060865001095">Mr.
Darling:</b> It is not for the Government to tell energy
consumers how they should conduct their business; it is for companies
to use their own business judgment. It might be useful to remind the
House, if hon. Members are not already aware of it, that we set up a
joint forum between Government and business to discuss some of these
issues, but the main thing is to ensure that the energy market actually
works.</p><br><notus-date day="8" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>8 Jun 2006 : Column 382</b><br><p><a name="06060865000068"><b><a name="06060865001096">Mr.
Dennis Skinner (Bolsover) (Lab):</b> We heard on the radio
this morning that there are large supplies of North sea oil and gas,
and large supplies of coal sweeping out to the North sea and eastern
England and large supplies in Scotland and Wales. The key to ensuring
that we have more coal as part of the energy review is not to rely on
foreign sources, but to ensure that we keep the continuity of the
mining industry. That is vital if we are to exploit the reserves that
still
remain.</p><p><a name="06060865000069"><b><a name="06060865001097">Mr.
Darling:</b> My hon. Friend is right that coal is a very
important part of the energy mix in this country at the moment. Coal
provides a significant degree of our security and supply. I can assure
my hon. Friend that coal will be one of many aspects that will be
covered in the energy
review.</p><p><a name="06060865000070"><b><a name="06060865001098">Mr.
Edward Davey (Kingston and Surbiton) (LD):</b> Will the
Secretary of State confirm that the Chancellor&#146;s latest estimate
of the cost of nuclear decommissioning is about &#163;90
billion&#151;almost double the Government&#146;s estimate fewer
than 12 months ago? When he announces whether the Government are to opt
for nuclear power, how confident is he that estimates of future
decommissioning will be accurate in any shape or
form?</p><p><a name="06060865000071"><b><a name="06060865001099">Mr.
Darling:</b> We must do our best to ensure that whatever
estimates we have are as accurate as possible. Of course, we have the
question of waste to deal with now, no matter what we decide in
relation to the future. That is something on which we will get the
advice of the energy review that is due to report in the summer. The
hon. Gentleman is right: nuclear waste is one aspect that needs to be
looked at. Nuclear has provided us with a base load supply of
electricity. It represents about 19 per cent. of electricity generation
at the moment. If we do not do anything, that will go down to 6 or 7
per cent. in the next 20 years or so, so it needs to be considered. We
cannot simply turn our back on it, as I think&#151;I may be wrong on
this&#151;the Liberal Democrats believe we
should.</p><p><a name="06060865000072"><b><a name="06060865001100">Mr.
Denis MacShane (Rotherham) (Lab):</b> In theory, open markets
are meant to reduce prices, but according to the Heren
report&#151;the international report on electricity prices for the
steel industry&#151;the price for the UK steel industry is
&#163;52.58 per megawatt hour for this year compared with
&#8364;52.70 for the same megawatt hour for the same period in
Germany. In other words, British steel makers have to pay the same
price in pounds as their German competitors pay in euros. Will the
Secretary of State write to me so that I can pass his letter to steel
makers in Rotherham and explain why British electricity for industry is
so expensive?</p><p><a name="06060865000073"><b><a name="06060865001101">Mr.
Darling:</b> I will certainly write to my right hon. Friend.
For the past eight or nine years, British industry has benefited from
lower electricity prices. In the past year or so, prices have gone up
dramatically for the reasons that we have discussed in the past five or
10 minutes. There is no doubt that some of the uncertainty generated by
the lack of transparency in European markets has added an extra element
to that price. We will continue the work that we started last year, and
additional capacity should be available to us. 
<br><notus-date day="8" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>8 Jun 2006 : Column 383</b><br>We will continue to support the European Commissioner in her efforts to

help.</p><p><a name="06060865000074">The other thing
that we have to get right is the long-term solution. There are no easy
solutions, but I hope that when we report to the House in July, we will
have a constructive engagement with all parties in the House to achieve
a long-term solution to this
problem.</p><h3 align="center"><a name="06060865000026">Ministerial

he knows, in this year&#146;s Budget speech the Chancellor announced
plans for expanding trade with major developing countries and
specifically to set new targets for expanding trade with countries such
as China and India. When are those targets likely to appear, and who is
responsible for setting them? As he knows, there is significant concern
in the export community that the UK has not been capturing anything
like a large enough share of the huge increase in international trade
that countries such as India have seen in recent
years.</p><p><a name="06060865000078"><b><a name="06060865001105">Mr.

trade between British companies and China and India and Chinese and
Indian companies trading here. We should not overlook the fact that
there has been considerable success in the past, but we need to do a
lot more. They are important markets to this country, and we want to do
everything we can to encourage that trade. My right hon. Friend the
Chancellor put in place various ways in which we can encourage that
trade and explore things that we can perhaps do better than we have
done in the

perception of the EU offer; support for United States agriculture; and
access to manufactured goods and other services in countries such as
Brazil and India. Movement will be required from everyone if we are to

Skills Council and the regional development agency, Yorkshire Forward,
together with additional European funding and resources from the city
of York council, have helped to provide just over &#163;3 million to
the city of York for investment. A further &#163;2.63 million of
Government funding has been allocated through Yorkshire Forward from

twice the national average. It is now well below the national average.
York is not only a science city for the local community, but a science
leader throughout Yorkshire and the Humber and, indeed, the north of
England. Will the Government&#146;s commitment to York and funding

of science city York since 1998 and the ability of the city council and
the university of York, with the private sector, to harness the
world-class potential of business clusters in bioscience, health care,
IT and digital creative industries. It is a model that the Government
want to support. Three science cities were mentioned in the 2004
pre-Budget report and the 2005 Budget mentioned three more. I am sure
that regional development agencies, as a result of the comprehensive
spending review in 2007, will be looking to see what the Government

lightly, and I am sure that everything has been done to protect the

significant reduction since 1998 in such accidents in the UK. The
experiment on British standard time between 1968 and 1971 was adopted
to test public support, but after a vote in Parliament the experiment
was abandoned. A 1989 Green Paper floated the issue, but it was not
pursued, and a debate in 1996 on a private Member&#146;s Bill failed
to secure significant support, so I do not think that the issue is

1997, the Labour party told us that it had 24 hours in which
to save the NHS. Will the Secretary of State for Health now come to the
House and tell us how long the NHS will have left if someone does not
sort out the problems caused by the Government?</p><p><a name="06060865000196">On 16 March, the Secretary of
State for Work and Pensions dismissed the finding of the parliamentary
ombudsman in her report &#147;Trusting in the pensions
promise&#148; that the Government had been guilty of
maladministration. The Government have said that it would cost too much
to accept the ombudsman&#146;s findings: &#163;15 billion, to be
precise. It has now been revealed that that was a gross overestimate of
the cost. Yesterday it also became clear that the Government&#146;s
proposals for pensions reform would mean that about 1.5 million
pensioners who had built up nest eggs for retirement would lose
&#163;450 a year. May we have a statement from the Secretary of State
clarifying the Government&#146;s position on both issues, and
explaining how the Government have let down Britain&#146;s
pensioners?</p><p><a name="06060865000197">The

Leader of the House has also said that he thinks the Prime Minister
should step down &#147;well before&#148; the next election. Of
course, the Prime Minister did promise that he would serve a full term.
That means either that the Prime Minister is not going to fulfil his

second.</p><p><a name="06060865000202">The right

Terrorism Act. She said that if the order was not made shortly, lives
would be at risk.</p><p><a name="06060865000203">I suggest
that the right hon. Lady needs to be extremely careful about implying
that lives would be at risk in this case; that comes close to
pre-judging cases currently before the courts. She really needs to
think about what she has been saying.</p><p><a name="06060865000204">Secondly, the right hon. Lady
knows very well that, under Home Secretaries of both main parties,
there is always some time between the passage of an Act and the laying
of orders under it. I do not remember that the Conservative Opposition,
either here or in the other place, were helpful in getting the
legislation in question through. If anybody is to blame for the delays,
it is the Conservative Opposition&#151;here and in the other
place.</p><p><a name="06060865000205">On the national
health service, the right hon. Lady asked whether we were right to
say&#151;on 30 April 1997, I think&#151;that there were only 24
hours to save the national health service. Yes, we were, because there
is no question but that, if the Conservatives had got back into power
in 1997, the inexorable decline of the health service&#151;which had
happened year by year by year, in my constituency and in
hers&#151;would have continued. We have more than doubled funding in
real
terms.</p><p><a name="06060865000206"><b><a name="06060865001199">Mr.

but what we have actually done, including in his constituency, is
increase the number of nurses by 85,000&#151;by a third&#151;and we
have increased their salaries by a quarter in real terms. There has
been an improvement in health care in every single constituency in the
country, based on spending that we voted for and the Conservatives
voted against. There has been a dramatic improvement in the number of
both doctors and nurses in the right hon. Lady&#146;s own
constituency; she knows that. Indeed, just four years ago, 113 people
in her area were waiting for in-patient treatment for more than nine
months, and in addition, 311 were waiting for in-patient treatment for
more than six months. Today, the figure in respect of both periods is
zero&#151;thanks to Labour&#146;s spending and no thanks to the
position of the
Conservatives.</p><p><a name="06060865000208">On
the pensions debate, about which the right hon. Lady asked, my right
hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions made an
excellent statement just over a week ago, and there will be
parliamentary questions to the Department for Work and Pensions next

to one side. She also claimed that my right hon. Friends the Prime
Minister and the Foreign Secretary, and, by implication, I, have not
answered any questions in respect of rendition. She knows that to be
totally incorrect. My right hon. Friend the Prime Minister said that we
have said everything we needed to say on that, and indeed we have. She
knows very well that nobody could have provided more information to the
House, either orally or in writing, about the issue of
rendition&#151;about the fact that there were four cases of requests
for rendition, all of which occurred when I was Home Secretary, before
2001, and under the Clinton Administration. Two were granted, two were
refused and there have been no cases since 2001. I have given
undertakings to the House, and the simple truth is that if people read
the report&#151;the disreputable report&#151;by Mr. Marty of the
Council of Europe, they will see that he makes no substantive
allegations. I hope that the right hon. Lady does not join that
bandwagon.</p><p><a name="06060865000212">I announced
that there will be a full-day&#146;s debate on 14 June to discuss the
prospects for the European Council. I hope very much that the right
hon. Lady and the shadow Foreign Secretary will use that opportunity to
deal with what <i> The Daily Telegraph</i> described this morning as
David Cameron&#146;s broken pledge on Conservatives in Europe. First,
we heard yesterday from the shadow Foreign Secretary that a clear
pledge, debated endlessly in this House before the
election&#151;[<i> Interruption.</i>] They do not like it. The clear
pledge, debated endlessly in this House before the election, to
withdraw from the common fisheries policy has been torn up, and the
clearest pledge to remove the Conservative party from the European
People&#146;s party and to join a barmy army of obscure right-wing
politicians will also be
broken.</p>

which a 14-year-old boy died after being restrained at the same secure

some of us feel about the inability to raise the issue and to have it
properly debated on the Floor of the House because of the continuing
delay in reconvening the inquest? Will he ensure that a statement be
made or a debate held on the Floor on this very important
matter&#151;one boy has died, and another has required
oxygen&#151;to set out what happened and what is being done to end
those practices, which are causing such damage to young
people?</p><p><a name="06060865000215"><b><a name="06060865001205">Mr.

will know that there are always difficulties in raising matters in this
House when court 
<br><notus-date day="8" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>8 Jun 2006 : Column 403</b><br>proceedings are pending. That said, I take full note of what she has
said today and will, along with appropriate ministerial colleagues, do
my very best to ensure that she and the families concerned are provided
with as much information as possible, and an explanation, in advance of

David Heath (Somerton and Frome) (LD):</b> I thank the Leader
of the House for his prompt response following the last Business
Questions on the issue of the Bichard inquiry; that was in marked
contrast to the performance of the Home Office.</p><p><a name="06060865000217">The Greater London authority
inquiry into 7/7 threw up yet another unfulfilled recommendation of a
major public inquiry. Can we have a debate on the way in which we keep
track of these matters and on how we ensure that when serious inquiries
into disasters are held, the recommendations made are adhered to and
implemented at the earliest possible
opportunity?</p><p><a name="06060865000218">Following
the welcome news of the apparent demise of al-Zarqawi in Iraq today, no
one would be naive enough to think that that spells an end to the
violence in Iraq. This is the tenth time at Business Questions that I
have asked for a proper debate on the foreign affairs aspects of Iraq.
When he was Foreign Secretary, the Leader of the House indicated that
he would have welcomed such an opportunity. The time is right for such
a debate; will he ensure that we have one before the summer
recess?</p><p><a name="06060865000219">I also noted
the fact that we are to have a debate on Europe on Wednesday 14 June.
Given that some parties do still have friends and influence in Europe,
will the Leader of the House suggest to the Minister for
Europe&#151;his predecessor&#151;that he comes to the House on that
day to spell out the Government&#146;s position on putting an end to
the absurd charade of moving the European Parliament to Strasbourg
permanently, with all the costs to the British taxpayer that that
entails. It is time we put an end to this nonsense once and for all,
and this country should be setting a lead in the
matter.</p><p><a name="06060865000220">Lastly, could
we have a debate on fixed-term contracts? I noted the attempt by the
Leader of the House to enliven the Prime Minister&#146;s monthly
press conference today, and the Secretary of State for Health&#146;s
offer in her statement yesterday to be fully accountable for future
failures in the health service. If we had fixed-term contracts for
Cabinet Ministers, we could have targets, appraisals and tests for
value for money. We could see whether premises were being used. Most
importantly, we could ensure that people did not outstay their welcome
in Cabinet
posts.</p><p><a name="06060865000221"><b><a name="06060865001207">Mr.
Straw:</b> The hon. Gentleman&#146;s first question was in
respect of the inquiry into the 7 and 21 July terrorist outrages last
summer. May I say that full account is always taken of inquiry reports
and that there was a meeting recently of the Cabinet Committee on
international terrorism, which looked carefully at the conclusions of
the GLA inquiry and discussed many of its findings? That will continue,
because it is in everybody&#146;s interests that we learn the lessons
from what happened last 7 July, and indeed on 21
July.</p><p><a name="06060865000222">On the issue of
the death of al-Zarqawi, let me say that my right hon. Friend the Prime
Minister has described it&#151;on this occasion, I happen to think
that it 
<br><notus-date day="8" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>8 Jun 2006 : Column 404</b><br>is entirely appropriate that it should be so described&#151;as good
news, because that man was an evil butcher who was killing Iraqis, as
well as coalition forces, in large numbers. Nothing was going to stop
him, I am afraid, until he was stopped in this way. I may say that I
hope that we can put on record our admiration for all those in the
Iraqi forces and the coalition forces, as well as others, who were
responsible for his
apprehension.</p><p><a name="06060865000223">I
understand entirely what the hon. Gentleman says about the case for a
full debate on foreign policy. I am alive to that, as is my right hon.
Friend the Chief Whip. Our only difficulty is finding the time,
alongside many other requests. I say to the hon. Gentleman that there
is an opportunity to raise those matters in the Wednesday debate on
Europe next week, because Iraq&#151; [<i> Interruption.]</i> Well, he
makes a sedentary gesture&#151;a polite but critical sedentary
gesture, indicating that he does not entirely accept what I am saying.
I have to say to him that before the European Council will be Iraq,
Iran and the middle east, so there is every reason for him to use that
opportunity, along with his right hon. and hon. Friends, to debate
those matters next
week.</p><p><a name="06060865000224">The
hon. Gentleman raised the issue of Strasbourg as the seat of the
European Parliament. That arrangement is now friendless, except for
those in the host country. I am sad to say that, as my right hon.
Friend the Member for Rotherham (Mr. MacShane) has just reminded me,
that was one of a number of errors made by the Major Government in
1992, because they set that arrangement in concrete. We all have to
deal with that.</p><p><a name="06060865000225">The
hon. Gentleman also asked about fixed-term contracts. I do not think
that there is a case for them, and I would put this request way below,
for example, a request for a debate on the tax system. I hope very much
that the Liberal Democrats will use their next Opposition day for a
debate on it, because what is clear from the announcements being made
today is that they are ditching higher rates for the rich for higher
taxation for
everyone.</p><p><a name="06060865000226"><b><a name="06060865001208">Mr.
Barry Sheerman (Huddersfield) (Lab/Co-op):</b> My right hon.
Friend might have noticed the launch of the Commission for Global Road
Safety report at the QE2 building this morning: eight nations are
backing a call to take seriously the fact that 1.2 million people die
every year on the roads, mainly in the developing
world.</p><p><a name="06060865000227">Many of us in
the developed world have brought down the number of people killed and
badly injured on the roads, but in the developing world that is one of
the most common causes of death and serious injury. Will my right hon.
Friend urge an early debate on that matter and its global implications?
We cannot talk about global sustainability when we exclude what is
probably the fifth largest killer in the developed world. Will our
Government adopt a higher profile by pursuing the aim of bringing this
dreadful, useless loss of human life to an
end?</p><p><a name="06060865000228"><b><a name="06060865001209">Mr.

to highlight that issue. I can think of a country not in the developing
world, but in Asia, with the same population as the UK and lower road
usage, but with deaths on the road running at nearly 25,000, compared
with 3,000 in this country. It is a major epidemic across the world, of
both deaths and serious injuries. I know that my right hon. Friends the
Secretaries of State for International Development and for Transport
take seriously the need for us to evangelise in other countries on our
experience of bringing down road deaths and
injuries.</p><p><a name="06060865000230"><b><a name="06060865001210">Mr.

al-Zarqawi. I know that everyone else would join us in
that.</p><p><a name="06060865000231">No one beats me
in supporting the forces in their determination to seek out those who
would support terrorist acts in the UK, but a number of people in the
Islamic community are now quite concerned that there is a deep game
going on among the extremists to try to discredit those who are
supportive of the British authorities in their search for such
information. The raid in Forest Gate, just down the road from my
constituency, and the continuing search, with nothing yet found, for
those weapons was matched on Wednesday&#151;48 hours ago&#151;by a
raid in Dewsbury and the arrest, or rather lifting, of an
individual.</p><p><a name="06060865000232">I
understand that in the same street in Dewsbury and in the same
house&#151;the house of Sheikh Yacoub Munshi&#151;on Saturday 3
June, the director of the Defence Academy, Lieutenant-General Kiszely,
visited that family. That man&#146;s grandson was lifted on Wednesday
and taken by the police, supposedly in connection with the arrests in
Canada. I think that the police are now weakening their position over
him, and it may be that he is
released.</p><p><a name="06060865000233">My concern
is simply this: we have a delicate situation, and I am not criticising
the police, but I wonder to what degree the various Departments are
talking to each other, such that a senior general, for good reasons,
visits a family to support those who have been supportive, only to find
that same family subsequently targeted. I urge the Leader of the House
to ask the Home Secretary to come to the House to make a
statement.</p><p><a name="06060865000234"><b><a name="06060865001211">Mr.
Straw:</b> I take seriously what the right hon. Gentleman has
just said, and of course I understand the delicacy of that matter, not
least with my constituency background, but I say to hon. Members that
there is a dilemma facing not just the intelligence services and the
police, but every Member of the House, which is, do the agencies and
the police act on credible intelligence, knowing, of course, because
that is the nature of intelligence, that it might not be fully
accurate, or do they ignore it, knowing that it might well be accurate?
If they ignored it, and a terrorist outrage followed, the opprobrium on
them would be far greater than in the reverse situation. That is the
dilemma facing the police and the intelligence agencies. I believe that
they carry out their job phenomenally well, and they deserve our full
support.</p><br><notus-date day="8" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>8 Jun 2006 : Column 406</b><br><p><a name="06060865000235"><b><a name="06060865001212">Mr.

such immigration may benefit the middle and upper-middle classes,
because those immigrants tend to work in restaurants or to clean
offices and homes, that level of immigration is not so good for the
less well off in our society, who end up competing with the newly
arrived for scarce resources such as housing, education, health and

Contrary to myth, there is a high degree of control over immigration

have no family connections here. The hon. Gentleman knows that, but he
would know more if he talked to fruit farmers in Herefordshire, Kent
and many other areas, and not just to people in what he describes as
more prosperous areas. I could take him to a factory in my constituency
that would not be operating without low-skilled workers from eastern
Europe, because the owners could not recruit others to do those jobs.
That is a reality, and we have to choose between maintaining employment
at its current levels with all the protections, including the minimum
wage, that we introduced and he voted against&#151;[Hon.

was a period when we dealt on the Floor of the House not only with

which were debatable and could be voted on here. The House gave up that
facility when Westminster Hall was introduced, and it is for the House
to decide whether that was a fair exchange. I shall not express my
personal view, save to say that the Modernisation Committee will wish

Friend&#151;any party aspiring to be in government has to think about
this&#151;that only so much time is available to us. The debates on

Gove (Surrey Heath) (Con):</b> On a point of order, Mr.
Speaker. I ask for your help in your role as protector of
Members&#146; rights against the abuse of their privileges by the
Executive. It was my understanding that when Ministers and other
Members visited another Member&#146;s constituency, they wrote to
them beforehand to explain the purpose of the visit. Yesterday, the
Prime Minister visited Frimley Park hospital in my constituency without
giving me any prior notice of his visit. Earlier this week, the
Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Minister with responsibility for
veterans visited the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for
Eastbourne (Mr. Waterson), again without giving advance notice. It
seems to me an abuse of the House when Ministers visit constituencies
for party political and propagandist purposes without giving due
notice, thereby denying Members the right to raise issues of pressing
concern to their constituents such as the future of Frimley Park
hospital and its upper gastro-intestinal unit. As you well know, Mr.
Speaker, that is a matter of deep concern to me and to my constituents,
and I would have loved to have the chance to ask the Prime Minister why
his Department of Health was closing a world-beating centre. I was
denied that opportunity by the arrogance of the
Executive.</p><p><a name="06060865000295"><b><a name="06060865001263">Mr.
Speaker:</b> I understand that the hon. Gentleman should have
notification when another Member visits his constituency, but that does
not give him the right to question any Minister solely because they are
in the constituency. I must say, in defence of the departments of both
the Chancellor and the Prime Minister, that they are very conscientious
about notifying hon. Members. I know that from my own experience, but I
will bring the matter to the Prime Minister&#146;s attention and see
what is happening in his office.</p><p><a name="06060865000296"><b><a name="06060865001264">Mr.

as a Member of the House, I think that an oral ministerial statement

guidance,

<br><notus-date day="8" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>8 Jun 2006 : Column 418</b><br>when that is not the case. Sometimes Ministers come forward to make
statements to the House, and the hon. Gentleman will know that when a
Minister seeks to make a statement, I have no power to reject that
statement. Of course the House has a dilemma: we must consider the
importance of the Supply day, but Opposition Members in particular are
very keen for Ministers to come to the House to make statements. So we
have that difficulty as
well.</p><p><a name="06060865000300"><b><a name="06060865001266">Mr.

question witnesses on Tuesday on that Bill, having expected it to be
available some time ago. We now know that it will not be available
until Monday, and we may have to find some way to tell the witnesses
whom we want to question about it what it contains. That is not a
satisfactory way to proceed, particularly when the Minister of State,

completely alternative system of scrutiny in which she chooses the
witnesses and the people who carry out the

Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Constitutional Affairs
(Bridget Prentice):</b> I beg to move, That the Bill be now
read a Second
time.</p><p><a name="06060865000309">I am
pleased that, after much debate and discussion in the other place, the
Bill has finally come to the House. It is part of a much wider set of
initiatives that we are promoting: we are determined to tackle
practices that might stop normal activities, because people either fear
litigation or have become risk-averse. We want to stop people being
encouraged to bring frivolous or speculative claims for compensation,
and the provisions in the Bill will help us to do just that. They will
reassure people who are concerned about being sued that, if they adopt
reasonable standards and procedures, they will not be found
liable.</p><p><a name="06060865000310">The Bill will
also put in place the legislative framework needed to regulate claims
farmers&#151;those people who encourage consumers to make
claims&#151;too many of whom are cowboys who have abused the system
for too long, and we are going to put a stop to it.</p><p><a name="06060865000311">Part 1 contains provisions on
the law of negligence and statutory duty and on apologies, offers of
treatment and other redress. Clause 1 relates to the law of negligence
and statutory duty, and some hon. Members have had concerns about the
need for that clause. We believe, however, that it is important and
that it will have
benefits.</p><p><a name="06060865000312">The
Better Regulation Task Force in its report &#147;Better Routes to
Redress&#148; made clear its view that, although a compensation
culture does not exist in this country, the perception that it does can
have a real and damaging effect on people&#146;s behaviour. That can
be particularly significant in respect of activities provided by
voluntary organisations and
others.</p><p><a name="06060865000313">Last
autumn, Volunteering England found that nearly one in five
organisations said that people had stopped volunteering for them
because of fears about risk and liability and that nearly a quarter of
organisations said that volunteers had been deterred from joining them
in the first place by concern about those issues. Those fears may well
be out of proportion and based on inaccurate perceptions, but they are
very real. So there is a need to provide reassurance to those who are
concerned about possible litigation&#151;not only in the voluntary
sector, but elsewhere too&#151;and about how the law in this country
works. That is what clause 1 will
do.</p><p><a name="06060865000314">The way that
clause 1 will work is that, in deciding a negligence claim or a claim
for breach of a statutory duty that involves a standard of care, the
court must consider whether the defendant owed a duty of care to the
claimant and, if he did owe such a duty of care, 
<br><notus-date day="8" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>8 Jun 2006 : Column 420</b><br>whether that duty was breached, and whether the claimant suffered loss
or injury as a result. In considering the second of those
factors&#151;whether the duty of care was breached&#151;the court
must consider the standard of care, and whether the defendant fell
short of that standard.</p><p><a name="06060865000315">In this country, the ordinary
standard of care used in considering whether negligence is involved is
that of reasonable care, and whether the defendant has met that test is
a question of fact for the court to decide, having regard to all the
circumstances of the case. Clause 1 is therefore concerned only with
the approach of the court to assessing that question of fact. It does
not concern or change what the standard of care should be, nor whether
the defendant owed a duty of care to the
claimant.</p><p><a name="06060865000316"><b><a name="06060865001272">Mr.
David Jones (Clwyd, West) (Con):</b> I hear what the hon. Lady
has to say, but does not clause 1 go further than that by requiring the
claimant to put together a risk assessment&#151;in other words, to
specify what steps should have been taken by the defendant in complying
with the duty of care? Does that not go beyond what is required of the
defendant at the
moment?</p><p><a name="06060865000317"><b><a name="06060865001273">Bridget
Prentice:</b> No. The hon. Gentleman is putting more into
clause 1 than is actually there. Clause 1 provides that, in considering
a negligence claim and deciding whether the defendant should have taken
certain steps to meet a standard of care either by precaution or
otherwise, the court may have regard to whether a requirement to take
those steps might prevent an activity that is desirable from taking
place or whether it might discourage people from undertaking functions
in connection with that activity. That reflects the existing law and
the approach that the courts have already taken and the view that they
have already expressed, particularly in judgments in the higher
courts.</p><p><a name="06060865000318"><b><a name="06060865001274">Mr.
Andrew Dismore (Hendon) (Lab):</b> Perhaps my hon. Friend
might offer a definition of desirable activity as it is a new concept
in common law, which, as far as I can see, has not been defined by any
previous authority. Her comment that the provision simply restates the
existing law, the Tomlinson <i> v.</i> Congleton borough council ruling,
which is the most recent authority on the issue, makes it quite clear
that the sort of exclusion to which she refers does not apply across
the board, particularly with an asymmetric relationship&#151;for
example, the employee-employer relationship. Will she therefore
undertake to table an amendment to correct clause 1, to put right the
fact that it does not accurately reflect the law as it presently
stands?</p><p><a name="06060865000319"><b><a name="06060865001275">Bridget
Prentice:</b> The view that was expressed in the Tomlinson
<i> v.</i> Congleton ruling, which is the most recent case, as my hon.
Friend rightly says, is reflected in clause 1. The clause will have a
range of benefits. It will reassure those who are concerned about
possible litigation by making clear how the law works and it will help
counter the view that people should cease activities for fear of
litigation. I know that hon. Members will say that that will bring more
cases to court. Any form of legislation brings the opportunity for
people to bring a case to court so that the common law is established
clearly. We should not be overly concerned in that 
<br><notus-date day="8" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>8 Jun 2006 : Column 421</b><br>respect. Clause 1 and clause 2, which has been
added, make it clear that the law is clear, that people know where they
stand and that the courts will use common-sense judgments in ensuring
that people understand what desirable activities are and where the
balance lies between the desirable activity and any precaution that
individuals need to
take.</p><p><a name="06060865000320"><b><a name="06060865001276">David
Howarth (Cambridge) (LD):</b> I fully accept that the
Government&#146;s intention is not to alter the law but to maintain
it as announced by the House of Lords in the Tomlinson case. That gives
rise to the difficulty that the hon. Member for Hendon (Mr. Dismore)
mentioned. Another problem with the way in which the clause is drafted
is the phrase &#147;breach of statutory duty.&#148; There are
statutes that set up standards of care, breaches of which are less than
full negligence. An example is the Consumer Protection Act 1987. Is it
the Government&#146;s intention to change the way in which that Act
works by adding this new
clause?</p><p><a name="06060865000321"><b><a name="06060865001277">Bridget
Prentice:</b> There is a straightforward answer to that
question. No. It is not our intention to do that.
</p><p><a name="06060865000322"><b><a name="06060865001278">Paddy
Tipping (Sherwood) (Lab):</b> I am grateful to my hon. Friend
the Minister for being willing to debate the phrase &#147;desirable
activity&#148; at this stage. It may well be an issue to be discussed
in Committee. &#147;Desirable activity&#148; implies a notion of
public good. I am concerned about public services, say accident and
emergency units or ambulance services, in which people may work with
difficult clients. Does the phrase imply that their conditions of
employment and their access to the civil courts will be less at risk
than for people not engaged in activities involving the public
good?</p><p><a name="06060865000323"><b><a name="06060865001279">Mr.
Deputy Speaker (Sir Michael Lord):</b> Order. Before the
Minister answers, may I take up the point made by the hon. Member for
Sherwood (Paddy Tipping)? I do not wish to hinder the debate today, but
I am sure that the Minister and other hon. Members will bear in mind
the fact that the Bill involves some complicated matters that are
probably best dealt with in Committee. That aside, it is quite in order
for the Minister to make her usual
observations.</p><p><a name="06060865000324"><b><a name="06060865001280">Bridget
Prentice:</b> Thank you, Mr. Deputy Speaker. You have rightly
led us towards the way in which we should conduct the debate today. I
am conscious that many hon. Members want to participate, so I will try
to be as brief as I can in responding to my hon. Friend.</p><p><a name="06060865000325">My hon.
Friend makes an important point about emergency services. We have
sought to capture with the term &#147;desirable activity&#148; the
well-established concept of taking into account the wider social value
of activities. The emergency services are a good example of that. If my
hon. Friend will allow me, I will leave the matter there and perhaps we
can pursue it in
Committee.</p><p><a name="06060865000326">Clause 1
will have a range of benefits. It will help counter the view that
organisations should stop activities for fear of litigation. It will
form a valuable part of the work that we are undertaking to tackle
perceptions that lead to risk-averse behaviour. It will improve the
system for those with valid claims. It will also ensure that the law is
widely known and applied.</p><p><a name="06060865000327">I mentioned
in response to the intervention by the hon. Member for Hendon (Mr.
Dismore) that clause 2 
<br><notus-date day="8" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>8 Jun 2006 : Column 422</b><br>had been added to the Bill. It provides for an apology and an offer of
treatment or other redress which shall not of itself amount to an
admission of negligence or breach of statutory duty. That clause
stemmed from an Opposition amendment, which the Government have been
happy to accept. It reflects the approach that has been taken in clause
1 in that it does not change the law but provides reassurance on how it
works and encourages the giving of apologies and other offers of
treatment and redress. I hope that that is something that the whole
House will welcome.</p><p><a name="06060865000328">The clause also reflects the
approach taken in the NHS Redress Bill, which was debated earlier this
week, and should help to reduce the number of cases in which
adversarial disputes about liability prevent early rehabilitation in
cases involving personal injury. I am sure that hon. Members across the
House have had constituents come to them in circumstances in which the
length of time and the adversarial nature of proceedings have made
matters much worse than they would have been had they been dealt with
in a more simple and straightforward
fashion.</p><p><a name="06060865000329"><b><a name="06060865001281">Simon
Hughes (North Southwark and Bermondsey) (LD):</b> In clauses 1
and 2 do the Government seek to codify&#151;to put into written
statute&#151;the present law? Do the Government seek to take the law
as the courts have defined it and put it into an Act of Parliament? If
that is the case, there may be merit in that. The Government have a
long-term plan which many of us support to codify the law so that
people have a clear view about what it stands
for.</p><p><a name="06060865000330"><b><a name="06060865001282">Bridget
Prentice:</b> It is not my wish to enter into a debate on the
merits of common law and case law versus codification, although the
hon. Gentleman is right to say that we have a long-term ambition, as
most Governments do, to codify the law properly. What I am trying to
say about clauses 1 and 2 is that they seek to clarify the situation so
that people feel comfortable with the activities in which they
participate. It does not reduce the protection available to claimants.
It will be open to the courts, as now, to decide, for example, whether
the terms in which an apology is given amount to an admission of
liability in the circumstances of an individual
case.</p><p><a name="06060865000331"><b><a name="06060865001283">Lembit

&#214;pik:</b> In the context of what the Minister is
saying, it is my understanding as a supporter of clauses 1 and 2 as far
as they go, that they offer a form of protection to volunteers and
volunteer organisations who are losing volunteers because of the
perception that she discussed earlier. Is it the Government&#146;s
intention to make it clear to those voluntary organisations that those
clauses will give them some legal protection against vexatious and
spurious claims, which are having a practical and measurable effect on
volunteering in the United Kingdom?</p><br><notus-date day="8" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>8 Jun 2006 : Column 423</b><br><p><a name="06060865000334"><b><a name="06060865001286">Bridget

as he and others have done in their constituencies. I do not want to
commit the Government to something particular on this, but I hope that
I can develop some ideas by the time the Bill becomes law, we hope in
or around October, so that perhaps we can send out a clear message to
voluntary organisations, schools and, indeed, to the public in general,
about what the position is as part of our general encouragement to
volunteer and not to be afraid to come

the previous intervention defeat her own argument? If the purpose of
clause 1 is simply to clarify existing law, which of course the Lord
Chief Justice told the Constitutional Affairs Committee could not be
done in a single sentence, why does she need a great long pamphlet
explaining what the law is? Is it not better simply to set out in
detail in that pamphlet what the law is for organisations without
tinkering by means of clause 1, which will create a whole batch of new

way of ensuring that people, whether in organisations or as

practices we want to stamp out fall into three main areas. The first is
the encouragement of frivolous claims, by raising false hopes about the
compensation available, through high-pressure marketing techniques,
such as my hon. Friend the Member for Amber Valley (Judy Mallaber)
described. Secondly, consumers are misled about the options for funding
their claim; in some cases, companies do not let them know that there
is a free alternative and, in others, they sell inappropriate
additional services, such as loans to fund insurance premiums. Thirdly,
we want to protect consumers against poor-quality advice where claims
managers act directly for them.</p><br><notus-date day="8" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>8 Jun 2006 : Column 425</b><br><p><a name="06060865000355">Citizens
Advice frequently has to pick up the pieces when claims farmers leave
consumers high and dry. Its 2004 report, &#147;No win, No Fee, No
Chance&#148;, referred to a woman who had tripped and suffered cuts
and bruises. Three years later, she was offered &#163;500
compensation from the company concerned, but on the advice of a claims
management company she it turned down and was encouraged to borrow
money to pursue the claim. She eventually won &#163;1,200 but that
was deducted from her loan, leaving a shortfall of &#163;950 which is
still accruing interest. Clearer information about the risks and the
likelihood of additional costs that would have to be met from her own
pocket might have led to a better
outcome.</p><p><a name="06060865000356"><i> Which?

evidence is actually to the
contrary.</p><p><a name="06060865000357">My
Department and the Advertising Standards Authority have recently funded
comprehensive market research on the impact of claims advertising,
which, among other things, confirmed that people have limited
understanding of what is involved. Terms such as &#147;No win, no

be at fault is not always apparent. The research is being presented to
the bodies responsible for the various advertising codes, and they are

result.</p><p><a name="06060865000363">Part
2 provides a proportionate and responsive framework for regulating the
industry. Clause 3 defines claims management services and provides an
order-making power to target the regulation in specific areas.
Companies will need to seek authorisation only if they are providing a
regulated claims management service. We intend to provide by order that
the regulated services include personal injury, mis-selling of
financial products, employment, criminal injury compensation and
housing disrepair. The Bill is flexible. It allows new areas to be
brought into the regulatory net as problems arise and it will allow
areas to be removed from regulation if the problems subside.</p><p><a name="06060865000364">Clause 4
allows a range of options for delivering regulation. We want an
efficient solution that will be effective for the benefit of consumers.
We are entering a period of considerable change in the legal services
market. Last month I published a draft Legal Services Bill, which will
reform the regulatory structure of legal services. I expect the
regulation of claims management services eventually to be integrated
into that structure. Another uncertainty is the impact of statutory
regulation on claims management companies. I have to tell the
House&#151;in a sense this reflects the point raised by the hon.
Member for Kettering (Mr. Hollobone)&#151;that that is unpredictable.
Recent analysis by Datamonitor predicts that the industry might shrink
considerably, because once stringent regulatory standards are applied,
false claims will, by their nature, disappear. In the short term, we
need a flexible solution that can tackle the worst abuses. A
longer-term solution can then be found once the landscape is more
certain and we can have a more considered look at
it.</p><p><a name="06060865000365"><b><a name="06060865001309">Mr.

Gentleman the question, but the next line in my speech is: we have
considered various options on the best way in which to proceed,
including whether there should be a role for the Claims Standards
Council. I can confirm that the Department for Constitutional Affairs
will initially regulate the industry directly. My right hon. Friend the
Secretary of State will be the regulator. The core elements of direct
regulation will be: the Secretary of State as regulator, with
day-to-day responsibility for regulation delegated to a civil servant
with the appropriate skills and experience; a monitoring and compliance
function, contracted out to a trading 
<br><notus-date day="8" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>8 Jun 2006 : Column 427</b><br>standards unit responsible for supporting the Secretary of State in
carrying out authorisation, monitoring, complaints and enforcement; and
a non-statutory advisory committee made up of representatives of the
financial services and insurance industries, the legal profession,
consumer groups and the claims management sector.</p><p><a name="06060865000367">Our prime
concern is to safeguard consumer interests. To that end, those wishing
to provide claims management services will be required to seek
authorisation from the regulator. The system will have teeth. As a
condition of authorisation, authorised persons will be required to
comply with strict rules and any person breaking those rules risks
having their authorisation suspended or removed. There will be a clear
mechanism for dealing with consumer complaints and authorised persons
will need to have indemnity insurance. I hope that that covers the
right hon. Gentleman&#146;s question.</p><p><a name="06060865000368"><b><a name="06060865001311">Mr.

will she just add one more comment about the Government&#146;s
thoughts on the future? At the beginning, the regulator will be the
Secretary of State. Is that intended to be a permanent solution or is
it intended that, in time, we will move on and that, for example, one

right. This is intended to be an interim solution. In a sense, the Bill
itself is an interim solution before the draft Legal Services Bill, and
the structure that it provides, come into place. It is the intention
that the regulation would come under the umbrella of the legal services

<p><a name="06060865000374">The
regulation needs to be proportionate. Clause 5 gives the Secretary of
State the power to exempt persons or classes of person. Our central
focus must be to tackle commercial claims farmers. We therefore intend
to exempt solicitors, barristers, legal executives and those who are
subject to regulation by the Financial Services Authority. However,
those exemptions will apply only to the extent that those concerned are
already regulated in the provision of claims management services. A
solicitor who offers claims management services through a business
separate from his practice would still need to be authorised. That
approach will avoid duplication in the regulation of claims management
activities, although some organisations may find that they are
regulated by more than one regulator for different activities. We have
no wish to impose unnecessary burdens on those who provide valuable
services on a voluntary basis. Individuals who offer advice
voluntarily, such as those working on a voluntary basis in a legal
advice centre, are specifically excluded from the scope of the
legislation.</p><p><a name="06060865000375"><b><a name="06060865001317">Tony

there is a form of internal regulation? Will she say how the Government
intend to move forwards on the concept of the exemption of trade unions

Democratic Mineworkers perhaps has done in
Nottingham?</p><p><a name="06060865000376"><b><a name="06060865001318">Bridget

intend, therefore, through secondary legislation, to exempt charitable
organisations that provide claims advice and to exempt independent
trade unions, where they provide services to their own members and
their own members&#146; families.</p><p><a name="06060865000377">I know of and
agree with the genuine concerns about the activities of a small number
of trade unions, particularly in relation to coal health compensation
schemes. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State and I take those
concerns seriously. However, few would dispute the high quality of
legal services provided by the vast majority of trade unions to their
members. The power to exempt by secondary legislation will give us the
necessary flexibility to exempt trade unions, but where appropriate,
that can be withdrawn for individual unions where the consumer is
losing out.</p><br><notus-date day="8" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>8 Jun 2006 : Column 429</b><br><p><a name="06060865000378"><b><a name="06060865001319">Mr.

the Minister not accept that there is concern that trade unions are
completely unregulated in the area? If she is saying that solicitors,
the majority of whom behave properly, and all other professionals in
the area are to be regulated, how can she possibly justify exempting
trade unions, especially given the concerns about the way in which some
trade unions have behaved? Is that simply because the Labour party is
funded by the trade unions and many unions are solvent only because of
their claims management
activities?</p><p><a name="06060865000379"><b><a name="06060865001320">Bridget

exemption will apply to independent trade unions on the certification
officer&#146;s list. If the hon. Gentleman thinks that such trade
unions are not already subject to a form of regulation, he
misunderstands some of the legislation that the previous, Conservative
Government put in place. Trade unions that are not classified as
independent will need to seek authorisation, as will those that provide
regulated claims management services to
non-members.</p><p><a name="06060865000381">The
Secretary of State will be able to attach conditions to an exemption.
We will draw up a code of practice with the trade union movement that
will provide a benchmark by which trade unions&#146; provision of
claims management services can be judged. The Secretary of State, as
the regulator, will take into account evidence of any breach of that
code when considering whether to remove the exemption of trade
unions.</p><p><a name="06060865000382"><b><a name="06060865001321">Mr.
Dismore:</b> I wholeheartedly welcome part 2 of the Bill,
unlike part 1. As a former trade union solicitor, I think that the
trade union schemes are important, especially owing to the way in which
test cases can be financed through unions&#146; legal systems. The
last big case that I did before I was elected to the House was against
the former Home Secretary, the right hon. and learned Member for
Folkestone and Hythe (Mr. Howard). It was supported by a consortium of
11 trade unions and led to the end of attempted reforms to the criminal
injuries compensation scheme, which would have cost the victims of
criminal injuries a sum in the region of &#163;150
million.</p><p><a name="06060865000383"><b><a name="06060865001322">Bridget

from the numerous discussions that I have had with trade unions that

of their members. We have already condemned the practice of
organisations that abuse the system and would thus be caught by the
Bill.</p><p><a name="06060865000385">The new
framework for legal services regulation will provide a suitable
opportunity to review the effectiveness of the arrangements. For firms
falling within the scope of the regulator, we need to make sure that
the regulation can be enforced effectively. The regulator will thus
have the power to investigate breaches of the rules and the code of
practice. He will be able to require the provision of documents and to
obtain a warrant to enter and search premises. The regulator will also
be able to impose sanctions, including suspension and withdrawal of
authorisation.</p><br><notus-date day="8" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>8 Jun 2006 : Column 430</b><br><p><a name="06060865000386"><b><a name="06060865001323">Mr.

when he said that trade unions are not covered in the area at present?
However, they will be covered when the Bill is passed because the vast
majority of trade unions, given their high standards, will be able to
meet the code of conduct that she is outlining, whereas the rogue
elements, such as the UDM and others, will fall foul of it. Does she
further agree that trade unions do not charge for their legal services
at the moment because since we have had conditional fee agreements,
money that comes to the union, which allows it to fight the test cases,
is brought back as a success fee from the other
side?</p><p><a name="06060865000387"><b><a name="06060865001324">Bridget

interests of their members, although, in fairness, we should not expect
a Conservative spokesman to do so. We will draw up a separate code of
practice for trade unions under the exemption through consultation and
discussion with the TUC. I am sure that all trade unions that wish to
be part of the system and to look after their members&#146; best

voluntary sector&#151;there is a cross-over every single day? I
represent a Scottish mining area and, indeed, am a member of the
National Union of Mineworkers. In my office, it is common practice to
discuss every single day with the voluntary sector and citizens advice
bureaux how we can get best practice in the area. That should be
recognised in the
code.</p><p><a name="06060865000389"><b><a name="06060865001326">Bridget

surprising that Labour Members know and understand that vulnerable
people, whether they are members of trade unions or individuals who go
to citizens advice bureaux, need expert legal help. Trade unions,
citizens advice bureaux and other organisations are freely available to
give such help. We should commend them on doing that, rather than
suggesting that they do so for their own
profit.</p><p><a name="06060865000390">Let me return
to the regulation. If people carry on providing claims management
services regardless of the regulation, the regulator will be able to
apply for an injunction to prevent them from continuing to provide
claims management services while he investigates and gathers evidence
to proceed with a prosecution. If necessary, he can also request a
warrant to enter and search premises. Anyone who is found guilty of the
offence could face a term of up to two years&#146; imprisonment, a
fine, or both. I think that I can say to the House that the
cowboys&#146; days are
numbered.</p><p><a name="06060865000391"><b><a name="06060865001327">Mr.

practices in the sector. However, it is important to companies such as
the National Accident Helpline, which is in my constituency, that the
Bill create as level a playing field as possible. Given the good
reputation of trade unions that has been mentioned by Labour Members,
should not the burden of proof be the other 
<br><notus-date day="8" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>8 Jun 2006 : Column 431</b><br>way round? Should not the Bill cover everyone? If trade unions and

exempt.</p><p><a name="06060865000392"><b><a name="06060865001328">Bridget
Prentice:</b> The very fact that we are having this discussion
demonstrates that the trade unions, voluntary organisations, the Law
Society and other bodies with different forms of regulation have shown
that the exemption is an appropriate way of proceeding. I repeat for
the hon. Gentleman&#146;s benefit that anyone who is given an
exemption, but breaches the code of practice, could be brought back
into the regulatory framework. The beauty of the Bill is that it is
sufficiently flexible to allow that to happen. The comments of Labour
Members show that trade unions are doing excellent work in the vast
majority of cases. We can have every confidence that that will continue
to be the case under the exempted
procedure.</p><p><a name="06060865000393">The
framework provides flexibility to respond to a changing market. It is
proportionate and closes the regulatory gap, and it will provide
similar regulatory requirements for claims farmers and solicitors. It

that the Department for Constitutional Affairs will regulate the claims
management industry. Given what she said about how that will fit with
the legal services reforms planned by her Department, will she be a
little clearer about the timeframe she envisages for the introduction
of the regulatory framework? Given the mood of the House, does she
agree that if in the meantime the unregulated claims management
industry is to continue, there is a great deal more that the Law

its members&#146; choice of whom to work with in managing

hon. Members will want to look at, ready by October. There will then be
a transitional period during which applications will be made to the
regulator, who will consider them. We hope to have the system fully
operating by April 2007. I accept the hon. Gentleman&#146;s point
about the Law Society, and indeed others who already have a regulatory
framework in place. They should now be looking to ensure that they take
a more proactive stance on these matters. I should say that the Law

the Bill because we recognise the need to tackle the perception of a

risk aversion should not be understated. It is important that the
Government are issuing guidance to public bodies on what constitutes
negligence. I disagree with the hon. Member for Hendon (Mr.
Dismore)&#151;he and I, as lawyers, understand these concepts. To
educate people, particularly those in public bodies who want to run
school trips and the like, is a sensible thing to do. The hon.

has been made clear from the outset that its purpose is to declare what
the existing law is, and to spread that knowledge more widely. To read

an aspect of the law that needs to be declared so that people can go on

Heald:</b> The Bill tries to deal with the way in which the
law of negligence operates, as the hon. Member for Manchester, Central
(Tony Lloyd) suggested in the case of mesothelioma. Mesothelioma cases
should be dealt with rapidly, preferably out of court because, given
the terminal nature of the condition, people with a diagnosis have only
a short time&#151;often, only 12 to 18 months&#151;in which to act.
A speedy out-of-court scheme is the best way forward. Many victims of
mesothelioma cannot make a claim, because they do not know who was
their former employer&#146;s insurer. I am happy to hold 
<br><notus-date day="8" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>8 Jun 2006 : Column 437</b><br>discussions on Barker with the Minister once she has received legal
advice but, in addition, we must try to improve the tracing service so
that more people can make a claim. On the question of who pays, it is
the people who did wrong in the first place and their insurers who
should do so.</p><p><a name="06060865000435">I accept that
it is important to provide a simple, workable procedure, but one of the
problems with Barker is that people have evaded their
responsibilities<i> &#151;[</i><i> Interruption.</i><i> ]</i> Well, we
must try to find ways of making insurance companies trace their
records. Better insurance companies already do so, but we must
encourage others to take action, too. We are keen to enter into
constructive discussions with the Government on the Barker judgment

done.</p><p><a name="06060865000436"><b><a name="06060865001361">Mr.

Heald:</b> The hon. Gentleman has got the facts wrong. The
main liability does not fall on the insurers but on the Government, as
claims are made against the Ministry of Defence, schools and so on.
There is therefore a case for Government, insurers, and companies that
cannot trace previous insurers to come together in a simple scheme.
This is an urgent problem, because of the speed with which the
condition progresses, but it will be with us for a very long time
indeed. Most estimates suggest that mesothelioma cases will peak in
2020, which is a long way away so, for the future, it is important to
introduce a simple system that works. I hope that the Government can
act as an honest broker, but we should also bear in mind the fact that
they have an interest, too. As I said, however, we are prepared to take
a constructive approach.</p><p><a name="06060865000438">In addition
to the Constitutional Affairs Committee, which produced an excellent

us well by publishing a very good report, &#147;Better Routes to

Association, in which 85 per cent. of respondents agreed that

addition to the abolition of legal aid for personal injury cases, the

<p><a name="06060865000440">My
hon. Friend the Member for Canterbury (Mr. Brazier) and other hon.
Members have cited many such cases, and I should like to make special
mention of the examples provided by the scouts and the Field Studies
Council . We have all seen headlines in the newspapers: a teacher 
<br><notus-date day="8" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>8 Jun 2006 : Column 438</b><br>won &#163;55,000 after slipping on a chip at school; a boy received
&#163;4,000 after falling 1 ft from a tree; and a council tenant who
had drunk 10 pints fell in the middle of the night as he tried to
change a light bulb. I am sure that the hon. Member for Hendon would
say that those are meritorious claims, but they give rise to questions,
and they are certainly food and drink to the tabloid newspaper
industry.</p><p><a name="06060865000441"><b><a name="06060865001363">Mr.
Dismore:</b> I am loth to accept tabloids as a guide to what
is happening in the law courts, because they rarely reported accurately
the cases in which I have been involved. The most famous example is the
McDonald&#146;s coffee case, which was successful because, despite
numerous warnings, McDonald&#146;s super-heated its coffee to such a
high temperature that the individual who brought the case suffered
third-degree burns. Those facts were not reported properly or
fully.</p><p><a name="06060865000442"><b><a name="06060865001364">Mr.
Heald:</b> What people think is important, too. In &#147;The
Man Who Shot Liberty Valance&#148;, it was said once a fact becomes
myth in the west it is the myth that is printed. There is a perception
that there is a compensation culture, and we cannot ignore that
perception. I do not agree that we should ignore educational
leaflets.</p><p><a name="06060865000443"><b><a name="06060865001365">David
Howarth:</b> The hon. Gentleman began by accepting that in
reality there was not such a problem, as the number of claims has
fallen. Those of us who have doubts about clause 1 want to know how
passing a law will solve a problem that relates to perception, not
reality.</p><p><a name="06060865000444"><b><a name="06060865001366">Mr.
Heald:</b> I know that this is not popular in the Cambridge
law faculty, but we can deal with the problem by accepting a clause
that declares what the law is and advertising widely what its effect
will be. According to the Better Regulation Task Force, tort costs in
the UK, as the hon. Gentleman said, are low compared with those in
other countries. The Law Society, the Country Land and Business
Association and others
say:</p><a name="06060865000966"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;The fact
is, Britain spends less on compensation than almost any other
industrialised country...the number of accident claims had

Brazier:</b> It is not inconsistent on the one hand to accept
the fact that there is not a general compensation culture, and on the
other, to argue that the attitudes of the lower courts towards sport
and adventure training is deeply damaging. In the USA, there are five
times as many compensation claims as there are in the UK, but most
American states have a provision that protects sport and adventure
training from the ordinary standard of negligence in court
cases.</p><p><a name="06060865000446"><b><a name="06060865001368">Mr.

that should be dealt with in clause
1?</p><p><a name="06060865000449"><b><a name="06060865001370">Mr.
Heald:</b> The matter needs to be reviewed but, given that the
Bill deals with the civil aspects of compensation, I am not convinced
that clause 1 is the place to do so. My hon. Friend raises an important
point, which needs to be fully considered and reviewed. It would be
interesting to hear from the Minister, perhaps later, whether the
Government intend to do
that.</p><p><a name="06060865000450">When I was
speaking to Norwich Union earlier this week, its representative
explained to me that the current common law is clear and well
established, and that Norwich Union questions whether new legislation
on negligence is necessary. That was also the view of the
Constitutional Affairs Committee, but we do not go that far. We believe
that there is a case for clause 1, and that it is important to get the
wording right. We have some comments to make about that in due course.
As my noble Friend Lord Hunt made clear in the other place, the courts
will have to build up their case law on the basis of the Bill if it is
passed. I agree with the Minister that that is unlikely to create the
huge difficulties that some
claim.</p><p><a name="06060865000451">Clause 2
recognises my noble Friend&#146;s wish to support rehabilitation and
early settlement of claims. The clause is one of his attempts to
establish that if at an early stage an insurance company or an employer
makes an apology and offers treatment, remedial works or whatever is
necessary, that should not prejudice any later legal action.</p><p><a name="06060865000452">My noble Friend achieved an
important change in the law which will help to encourage mediation,
boost rehabilitation and hopefully prevent cases from coming before the
courts except where absolutely necessary. Citizens Advice and the
Association of British Insurers are keen that such proposals should be
pursued, as am I. We are pleased that in the other place the
Under-Secretary of State said that she would not argue further about
clause 2. I hope that the Minister will give us an assurance that she
does not intend to remove or substantially amend it in this
place.</p><p><a name="06060865000453">One
aspect that we intend to pursue is personal responsibility. It is an
important issue and we shall press the Government to define the
responsibilities of individuals and to consider whether in certain
circumstances that might provide a defence of individual negligence.
The matter has been considered in other jurisdictions. There is a
problem for those who run leisure parks and other institutions where
there is an element of risk. If someone is grossly irresponsible and
negligent, it should be possible to defend a claim on that
basis.</p><p><a name="06060865000454">The Minister
mentioned the case of Barker <i> v.</i> Corus, and I have set out our
views and our constructive approach on
that.</p><p><a name="06060865000455">Have
the Government any plans to deal with a problem pointed out by Citizens
Advice? In hospitals the advertising of claims management services and
legal services seems 
<br><notus-date day="8" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>8 Jun 2006 : Column 440</b><br>rather inappropriate. When the Minister reflects on the regulation of
claims management companies, will she consider whether advertising is
an aspect that needs proper
attention?</p><p><a name="06060865000456">Although we
agree that regulation is long overdue, we believe, as I said earlier,
that the trade unions need to be considered. I pay tribute to the work
of many trade unions. I have worked as a volunteer in advice centres
and undertaken cases for trade unions, and many of them provide an
excellent service in the area of personal injury and employment law.
However, if solicitors and all the other groups are to be regulated, is
it possible to exempt the trade unions, which would be completely
unregulated in this area?</p><p><a name="06060865000457">It is mentioned that the Union
of Democratic Mineworkers has had its problems, but that it is not the
only trade union which has been criticised for making money out of
referrals of this sort. It is said that many trade unions are solvent
only because of this area of their activities. I notice that the right
hon. Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, East and Wallsend (Mr. Brown)
seems to agree with
me.</p><p><a name="06060865000458"><b><a name="06060865001371">John

Gentleman disagrees, he can take it up with me some other
time.</p><p><a name="06060865000462">The
Government suggest that the regulator should be the Lord Chancellor,
but that is not adequate. People expect a regulator who will deal with
organisations in the financial and insurance sector. Surely it is not
beyond the Minister to persuade one of the economic regulators to take
on the role. It would be better if the Office of Fair Trading or the
Financial Services Authority could be persuaded. We agree that the
Claims Standards Council is not the answer. We want a proper regulator
with an established reputation who can put a little fear into those who
have been running those businesses in a way that has not been
ideal.</p><p><a name="06060865000463">The
question remains whether the proposed regulation is adequate. Our view
at this stage is that it does not seem to be. On the breadth of
regulation, will the Minister ensure that regulation does not interfere
with legitimate practices, such as insurers offering treatment or
vehicle repairs to insured third parties at an early stage? If that is
to be regulated or even prohibited, as is suggested, that would
interfere with the agenda of trying to encourage early settlement and
rehabilitation.</p><p><a name="06060865000464">We
will want to explore these many matters in Committee. In general, we
welcome the Bill. It is not perfect in every respect. It provides us
with an opportunity to tackle the perception of a compensation culture,
to ensure that some common sense and proportion are injected into
compensation cases, and to ensure that unscrupulous claims management
companies are unable to exploit the vulnerable. The Bill has our
support this
afternoon.</p><br><notus-date day="8" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>8 Jun 2006 : Column 441</b><br><h5 align="left"><a name="06060865001046">1.58

(Lab):</b> I begin by congratulating my hon. Friend the Minister
on her introduction to the Bill. One of the great pleasures of being in
this place is to be able to follow an expert speaker speaking with
knowledge on a specialist subject. Unfortunately, one does not always
get the opportunity to do that, and on this occasion I do not. The
knowledge of the hon. Member for North-East Hertfordshire (Mr. Heald)
about the way in which trade union legal services work does not show
hands-on experience. He seemed a little hazy about the real issue
involved in the mesothelioma cases as well, although my hon. Friend the
Member for Barnsley, West and Penistone (Mr. Clapham) tried to put him
right about
that.</p><p><a name="06060865000466">I
shall confine my remarks to part 2, which deals with claims management
services. It is the Government&#146;s intention, as my hon. Friend
announced today, that the Secretary of State would be the regulator.
That is, I think, intended only as a temporary expedient, and the
Government&#146;s long-term intention is that the mechanisms that
form part of the new regulatory framework for legal services will
encompass these arrangements as well. The Minister will correct me if I
have got that wrong, but it seems to be the direction in which we are
heading. That seems perfectly
sensible.</p><p><a name="06060865000467">I
want to deal with three aspects: regulation in controversial areas,
which essentially means personal injury cases; trade unions, which I
know something about; and the mesothelioma situation. I should declare
my interest as a member of the GMB trade union. I was an official of
the union before I was elected to Parliament, I maintain close
connections with it, and I am proud of my long-standing relationship
with it.</p><p><a name="06060865000468">Conservative
Members have made much of the need to regulate unions, but the Minister
made it clear that there will be a code of practice, and that if unions
breach it they will lose their exemptions. In other words, if a union
behaves like a claims farmer, it will be treated as such. As a Labour
Member, I think that that is absolutely right, and I am pretty certain
that my right hon. and hon. Friends agree with
me.</p><p><a name="06060865000469"><b><a name="06060865001376">Mr.

organisations that refer cases to solicitors. Unions do that&#151;but
they are not regulated, are
they?</p><p><a name="06060865000470"><b><a name="06060865001377">Mr.
Brown:</b> The hon. Gentleman is correct to say that
organisations that refer cases to solicitors are regulated by the Bill,
and so they should be. The relationship between a trade union and its
individual members is based on the rule book, which is itself a
contract. The primary reason for joining a trade union is not to get
access to its legal services; people join for a whole range of reasons,
which are primarily concerned with work and bargaining between the
employer and the employees collectively. Alongside that negotiating
relationship, trade unions offer a range of services, one of which is
the provision of free legal services at the time of need. It is a very
different kind of organisation from the claims farmers that we are
seeking to regulate, which go out to find whether there is a cause for
action, and then, if there is something that can plausibly be made
something of, pass it on to a solicitor. They are claims farmers, and
should be regulated as such.</p><br><notus-date day="8" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>8 Jun 2006 : Column 442</b><br><p><a name="06060865000471"><b><a name="06060865001378">Tony
Lloyd:</b> My right hon. Friend is right to say that no Labour
Member would want any union to operate as a claims farmer without being
treated as one. Will he confirm that far from trade unions not being
regulated, there is a whole host of legislation that determines how
trade unions can deal with their members, gives remedy to members when
they are in dispute with their union, and so on? In fact, the
Conservative Government brought in quite a lot of that legislation,
which this Government have not
changed.</p><p><a name="06060865000472"><b><a name="06060865001379">Mr.
Brown:</b> I am reasonably certain that the hon. Member for
North-East Hertfordshire was more enthusiastic about that legislation
than I was. One cannot escape the fact that trade unions are highly
regulated. They are governed by specific laws, and there is a specific
certification
officer.</p><p><a name="06060865000473">Professional
people are deemed to be regulated by their own professional
organisations. The hon. Member for North-East Hertfordshire announced
proudly that he is a lawyer. Lawyers are regulated by the Law Society.
It is worth pausing to consider how well it does that. To help us, we
have the report from the legal services ombudsman for England and
Wales&#151;incidentally, there is no analogous report about the
TUC&#151;in which she examines how well the Law Society has done as a
regulator of the legal profession in the most controversial area that
we are discussing: the miners&#146; compensation cases.</p><p><a name="06060865000474">I do not have time to read out
the whole document, but let me read some of the key findings. The
ombudsman
states:</p><a name="06060865000967"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;It
became clear to me during my investigations that the Law Society had
not put into practice their stated approach for dealing with these
cases&#148;&#151;</p></ul><p><a name="06060865000475">that is,
the miners&#146; compensation cases. She found that the Law Society
had</p><a name="06060865000968"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;failed to obtain
solicitors&#146; files or to ask them to provide relevant
papers.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06060865000476">It
had</p><a name="06060865000969"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;failed to take

to put their conciliation proposals in writing to the miners&#146;
authorised
representatives&#148;.</p></ul><p><a name="06060865000478">What
makes this a lot worse, from my point of view, is that those authorised
representatives include Members of Parliament. To behave in a
high-handed way towards Members of Parliament in respect of individual
cases is completely and utterly unacceptable to me, and I think that I
speak for a great many Members when I say
so.</p><p><a name="06060865000479">The ombudsman goes
on to say that the Law

summary:</p><a name="06060865000974"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;In

them.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06060865000484">That is
pretty damning stuff. I am sorry to have read out all the failures, but
there are a lot of them. Although the Government are right not to want
to regulate twice over&#151;we want only one regulator; I do not
quarrel with that approach&#151;the regulation must be properly done.
It is clear that in this case it was very inadequately done. It is not
for me to set out what the reasons are, but it is for me to assert that
it has to be put right. That means that miners must get the justice due
to them, and that the lawyers who have taken money that they should not
have taken must give it back. We as a House should assert that as a
principle, and we look to the Minister to do whatever she can through
the powers that her office has to ensure that matters are put right as
quickly as
possible.</p><p><a name="06060865000485"><b><a name="06060865001380">Mr.

have been scandals about the way in which solicitors and claims farmers
have behaved&#151;and, as we heard from the right hon. Member for
Berwick-upon-Tweed (Mr. Beith), the way in which some unions have
behaved. The Government are introducing independent regulation for
solicitors and claims handlers, but what is happening to the trade
unions?</p><p><a name="06060865000488"><b><a name="06060865001383">Mr.

unions must adhere to the code of practice that the Minister mentioned.
If they do not, and behave like claims handlers, they will be treated
as such, as they should be. I should have thought that the hon.
Gentleman and I could agree on
that.</p><p><a name="06060865000489"><b><a name="06060865001384">Mr.

anti-trade union point, which is not uncommon among Conservative
Members&#151;<i> [</i><i> Interruption.</i><i> ]</i></p><p><a name="06060865000491"><b><a name="06060865001386">Mr.
Deputy Speaker:</b> Order. We cannot have interventions from a

somewhat
circular.</p><p><a name="06060865000492"><b><a name="06060865001387">Mr.
Brown:</b> Those are my thoughts precisely, Mr.
Deputy Speaker. However, I would like to say a little about where the
unions stand on the issue. Most unions do not behave in the
reprehensible way described so effectively in that report. In most
unions there is a rule-book relationship between the union member and
the union as an institution. Legal assistance is available when members
want it, not specifically when members have just joined the union.
According to the Trades Union Congress, some 64,000 new personal injury
cases were taken up on behalf of their members last year by TUC
affiliates. It is important for us to do nothing to impinge on that
relationship, and the enormous strengths that would not be there if
there was a different structure. I know from my experience before I
came to the House that trade unions can proceed with cases in difficult
areas that become test cases, or vanguard cases. No individual
solicitor acting for an individual claimant would have the resources to
take on such ground-breaking cases.</p><p><a name="06060865000493">I have been involved in
settlements relating to industrial deafness and vibration white finger.
There have been advances that are largely due to individual unions
taking up test cases and funding class actions. I was a young official
at the GMB when John Edmonds was the national industrial officer for
the electricity industry. He went on to become general secretary of the
GMB. We made an agreement with the nuclear industry to try to secure
compensation for victims of radiation in the industry, given the
possibility of their developing leukaemia. That agreement, gained
partly through the law and partly through negotiation, has not yet been
superseded in the courts. It has stood the test of time for 30 years.
That illustrates the value to working people in difficult, even
terrible, circumstances of membership of a trade union that can handle
the law astutely and well, and has the financial resources to bring an
action much too big for any individual claimant to afford. On the back
of successes in the courts, the union was able to use its industrial
muscle to negotiate a good, enduring agreement with the employers for
people who did not deserve to be victims of the industrial injuries
that they had suffered.</p><p><a name="06060865000494">That brings me to mesothelioma,
which, as most Members will know, is a horrible condition. There is no
known cure, although there are palliatives. Alimta, a new drug, helps
in some cases, but provides only remission. It does not reverse the
condition, although it provides some comfort. Dying of mesothelioma is
a horrible way to die, made all the more horrible when people see the
sufferings of their loved ones as they go. I believe that we as a
Parliament should stand in the victims&#146; corner, but in any event
we should be able to vote on how cases are handled in the courts. It is
a question of whether it is possible to join all the potential
employers to the action and have the damages 
<br><notus-date day="8" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>8 Jun 2006 : Column 445</b><br>assigned proportionately, which used to be the arrangement, or whether
it is necessary to identify the specific employer who caused the
injury, which is what the new judgment means. It represents a
substantial setback for a number of such cases.</p><p><a name="06060865000495">The condition
takes time to develop. We are talking about working conditions that
prevailed in the past, notably in heavy industries such as mining,
shipbuilding, heavy engineering, the railways and the merchant marine
service. The condition might develop in any area where asbestos was
used, perhaps sprayed, as a fire retardant, or a construction material.
Those cases are emerging now, and there is nothing that we can do to
stop the process. The hon. Member for North-East Hertfordshire was
right to say that the number of cases would peak quite some way into
the future.</p><p><a name="06060865000496">Working
practices in industry in those days meant that people would go to one
job and carry out a task, and might then perform a similar task on a
different project, perhaps for a different employer. It is difficult to
identify the employer for whom a person was working at the precise
point when he inhaled a specific fibre&#151;not one that was too big
to inhale, and not one that was so small that it was exhaled, but one
that was just the right size to lodge in the lung and cause pleural
plaque and eventually mesothelioma.</p><p><a name="06060865000497"><b><a name="06060865001388">Mr.
Heald:</b> Will the right hon. Gentleman give way?

the House, and to the Government in particular, is for us to be allowed
a vote at some stage on whether to return the position to where it was
before, or to confirm the new judgment of the House of Lords. I for one
would vote for the former, but there is a whole separate set of issues
relating to pleural plaque and whether it constitutes an injury. I
think that my hon. Friend the Member for Sherwood (Paddy Tipping) was
absolutely right to raise the issue, and I agree with him, but the
matter is still before the House of Lords and it is probably right for
a decision to be made there before we reach our own
decision.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="06060865001047">2.16

honest assessment is that it will not be easily done, but I am sure
there is consensus in the House that it is right and proper for us to

reason why we cannot intervene. The situation is paradoxical. We are
having a substantial debate about whether a Bill states what the law is
or what we think it ought to be in the cases of people who have
suffered. Whatever the law is, I believe that Parliament is at liberty,
indeed has a duty, to decide what should happen, because there are

waiting for us to do

the Bill fairly

couple of general points about the context of the Bill. I am grateful
for having been given the opportunity to talk through with the Minister
the Government&#146;s approach when she took up her responsibilities
and I took up mine. Although the Bill is small, it deals with what a
lot of people consider to be big issues&#151;issues that arise all
the time. This is real politics that matters in the real world. I did
not previously know the figures, but there appears to be no dispute
that we are talking about a business that is worth &#163;10 billion a
year: in other words, 1 per cent. of our gross domestic product is
circulating in the compensation industry.</p><p><a name="06060865000507">There are two
serious flaws in the current system. First, the various accidents and
injuries that occur&#151;collisions, incidents in the park, incidents
on trips with scouts or guides&#151;total some &#163;2 billion a
year in claimants&#146; legal costs. Much worse&#151;this figure
astounded me, but I have not seen it contradicted&#151;more than 90p

<br><notus-date day="8" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>8 Jun 2006 : Column 447</b><br>spent on costs. <i> [Interruption.] </i>My hon. Friend the Member for
Cambridge (David Howarth) says that that is not right, but even if that
figure is too high, this is still a significant issue. Pursuing what is
a legal entitlement in civil law to appropriate compensation is often a
hugely expensive exercise. So there are many issues to resolve and much
work to do on the question of gaining access to justice in the civil
world in a fair
society.</p><p><a name="06060865000508"><b><a name="06060865001395">Paddy
Tipping: </b>Does the hon. Gentleman accept that this is an
issue in coalfield communities and for textile workers? For example,
women textile workers with conditional fees arrangements backed by a
loan often end up owing more than the award that is made. So in that
respect, he is quite
right.</p><p><a name="06060865000509"><b><a name="06060865001396">Simon
Hughes:</b> I represent people who worked in the docks and who
lived in the old dock-worker community&#151;although perhaps not to
the same degree as other Members&#151;for whom the same issues arose.
There were significant knock-on effects.</p><p><a name="06060865000510">I want to make two other
general points. This debate is not unrelated to the great debates that
we have had in this place on incapacity benefit, time off work and so
on. Sometimes, even though people are physically able to go back to
work, they are advised not to do so because the compensation has not
been sorted out and the legal case has not ended. We want a healthy and
working society, but we also need to get the balance right between
people&#146;s liberties and their duties to each other. There are
some significant issues to deal with in that
regard.</p><p><a name="06060865000511">I was not
doing this job when the Bill was launched last autumn, so I checked to
see what my predecessor, my hon. Friend the Member for Somerton and
Frome (Mr. Heath) said then. The title of the first page of his very
brief notes was, &#147;Compensation Bill modest but
welcome&#151;Heath.&#148; <i> [Interruption.] </i>That was a
description of the Bill, not of him, although he is probably both those
things. He went on to
say:</p>

<a name="06060865000976"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;We all
agree that there is an urgent need to deal with and regulate no win, no
fee &#145;claim farmers&#146;, but we need to look very carefully
at the issue of duty of care...the idea that this Bill presents a
massive set of plans to tackle the compensation culture is a huge
oversell.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06060865000512">To be fair to
the Government, I am not sure that they said that the Bill was going to
do all that. It clearly is in some ways modest, but it is none the less
important.</p><p><a name="06060865000513">Given that
the Bill started its life in the other place, I checked to see what my
noble Friend Lord Goodhart said when he kicked off our comments. The
Bill&#151;not least clause 1, to which I shall return&#151;was
considered in the other place for quite a long time. On Second Reading,
Lord Goodhart
said:</p><a name="06060865000977"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;This
is undoubtedly a well meaning Bill, but being well meaning is not
enough. Part 1, which is clause 1, is at best unnecessary and may well
lead to confusion and still more litigation. Part 2 unquestionably has
a useful and desirable objective&#148;.&#151;[<i> Official Report,

clause 1 alone was debated for some nine hours in Grand Committee, and
for two hours on Report.</p><br><notus-date day="8" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>8 Jun 2006 : Column 448</b><br><p><a name="06060865000515">I
join the hon. Member for North-East Hertfordshire (Mr. Heald) in paying
tribute to colleagues from all parties&#151;and in particular to the
Minister in the Lords with responsibility for the Bill&#151;and to
the Conservative and Liberal Democrat Front Benchers, who worked very
well together. Lots of amendments, and progress, were made. I also pay
tribute to Lord Hunt of the Wirral, who did a lot of good work for the
Conservative party. I looked to see what the general collective wisdom
was at the end of the debate. Lord Goodhart
said:</p><a name="06060865000978"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Part 2
has now been both changed and improved to an unusual
degree&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06060865000516">that is true;

made&#151;</p><a name="06060865000979"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;and it is
now a very much better Bill than it was when it was brought
forward...As for Part 1, I remain dubious as to whether Clause 1
will do more good than harm. It presents a real risk of causing serious
problems. However, I am pleased that the Government have accepted
Clause 2...Overall, I welcome the fact that this Bill will now go
on to the other place.&#148;&#151;[<i> Official Report, House of
Lords</i>, 27 March 2006; Vol. 680, col.
577.]</p></ul><p><a name="06060865000517">I could
not quite work out whether Lord Goodhart was saying, &#147;Thank
goodness we&#146;re not going to be preoccupied with it any
more&#148;, or, &#147;There is a lot more work to do, and you guys
have got to get on with it.&#148; But anyway, here the Bill is, and
we will seek to do just
that.</p><p><a name="06060865000518">As
the Minister said in her introduction, we must deal with the
significant issue of new unregulated businesses dropping leaflets
through our letterboxes seeking business, unsolicited. As the
Government said, it is sensible initially to deal only with what are
the most live issues, of which personal injury is obviously the biggest
and most important. Housing disrepair is another issue that is raised
regularly in our surgeries, and others include employment, criminal
injury compensation and the mis-selling of financial services, which is
an increasing problem not just in London but elsewhere.</p><p><a name="06060865000519">Having been in the House for as
long as I have, I take the fairly robust view&#151;I hope that
colleagues of similar long service agree&#151;that we need as little
legislation as possible, not as much as possible, and that it should be
as simple as possible. I approached this Bill on that basis. I also
believe that we should regulate as little as possible. We are in great
danger of having too much regulation, which is why the Better
Regulation Task Force exists. Governments understand that we are trying
to whittle down the amount of regulation. That said, of course
consumers need a degree of protection, and the Bill is about getting
that balance right. If we are to have regulation&#151;we Liberal
Democrats are persuaded that we should&#151;it should be effective
and proportionate and go only as far as is necessary in dealing with
the problems that have arisen. At the end of the exercise, the judgment
is whether we have got that balance
right.</p><p><a name="06060865000520">So if we are to
have regulation, we clearly need a regulator. Again, I take a fairly
simple view. I am absolutely opposed to the idea that every time we see
a new problem, we should set up a new regulator and new committees, and
new structures and organisations involving new people and new costs.
Rather, we should look around to see who else exists who can do the
job. I share the Minister&#146;s view, however, that the two
potential candidates in the financial services world were not the right
ones. I also share her view that the other existing bodies that
appeared suitable to do the job were not the right ones, and that it
would be better 
<br><notus-date day="8" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>8 Jun 2006 : Column 449</b><br>for the regulator to be a member of the family
regulating legal and other services.</p><p><a name="06060865000521">However, we have to have an
interim stage. It might seem slightly bizarre to think of the Lord
Chancellor as the regulator of claims farmers, but that job will keep
him occupied in his post-Lords-speakership days and justify his saying
to the Prime Minister, &#147;I&#146;ve got plenty
to do.&#148; It might even justify his salary
being kept at the same level. Following that interim stage, we will
need to move on. Once the draft Bill on legal services has been
enacted, I hope that we will have a single, streamlined and minimalist
regulatory system that costs as little as possible and occupies as few
people as
possible.</p><p><a name="06060865000522">The
much-heralded progress that everyone applauds is clause 2&#151;I have
heard very little criticism of it&#151;which was not in the Bill at
its outset. It is very simple, but it deals with a very important
issue. We have all been there. I remember stopping suddenly in my
vehicle one day&#151;it was an election day&#151;at a set of
traffic lights and someone immediately behind me failing to stop. On
another election day, exactly the reverse happened. I was looking over
my shoulder and by the time that I turned round, the fellow in front
had stopped and I had not. One then thinks, &#147;Dare I say
sorry?&#148; Dare one apologise when in some cases, it is
self-evident that the accident is the fault of the person behind, who
has run into the stationary vehicle in
front?</p><p><a name="06060865000523"><b><a name="06060865001397">Mr.
Heald:</b> Did you ask, &#147;Are you my
constituent?&#148;</p><p><a name="06060865000524"><b><a name="06060865001398">Simon
Hughes:</b> As the hon. Gentleman, who also once fought the
North Southwark and Bermondsey seat, says, that was exactly the
question. The accident happened at The Blue shopping centre, and the
person in question was a constituent of mine, so the response was
slightly different.</p><p><a name="06060865000525">Clause 2
states:</p><a name="06060865000980"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;An
apology, an offer of treatment or other redress, shall not of itself
amount to an admission of negligence or breach of statutory
duty.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06060865000526">It is very
important for a courteous society that we do not say that someone will
be liable for all the consequences financially just because they
naturally said sorry. That is simple and welcome, and much easier than
the great debate on clause 1.</p><p><a name="06060865000527">We probably should not have
started from here; we should have had a draft Bill, or we should have
sent it to a Special Standing Committee where evidence could have been
taken. Behind me sits my hon. Friend the Member for Cambridge, whose
specialist subject in life is, as he will explain, this bit of the law;
we have the best academic advice available. A kind of seminar is going
on as to what the law should be.</p><p><a name="06060865000528">I agree with the
Government&#146;s proposition as set out in the excellent Library
research paper that</p><a name="06060865000529"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;we
strongly should oppose any culture where people believe that if there
is an injury there must inevitably be someone else to blame, and
someone else to pay. And we oppose people being encouraged to believe
that it is always worth &#145;having a go&#146;, however meritless
the claim.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06060865000530">I hope that
there is consensus on
that.</p><p><a name="06060865000531">I
hope that there is consensus also on something the Prime Minister said
just after the last election; not about his future, but about the
future of the Bill. He said:</p><br><notus-date day="8" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>8 Jun 2006 : Column 450</b><br><a name="06060865000532"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;The
Bill will also clarify the existing common law on negligence to make
clear that there is no liability in negligence for untoward incidents
that could not be avoided by taking reasonable care or exercising
reasonable skill. Simple guidelines should be issued. Compliance should
avoid legal action. This will send a strong signal and it will also
reduce risk-averse behaviour by providing reassurance to those who may
be concerned about possible litigation, such as volunteers, teachers
and local
authorities.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06060865000533">All
of us who did law know that the most famous such case is probably
Donoghue <i> v</i> Stevenson, whose pre-eminent judge in the House of
Lords was one of my Welsh secondary school&#146;s great academic old
boys, Lord Atkin. The principle that he set out still applies
today;</p><a name="06060865000981"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;In
English law there must be, and is, some general conception of relations
giving rise to a duty of care, of which the particular cases found in
the books are but instances...But acts or omissions which any
moral code would censure cannot in a practical world be treated so as
to give a right to every person injured by them to demand
relief.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06060865000534">The debate has
focused on whether the law as set out in that case in 1932 and in the
2004 Tomlinson <i> v </i>Congleton<i> </i>borough council case is
sufficient.</p><p><a name="06060865000535">In the
Tomlinson judgment, Lord Hoffman and Lord Hobhouse made two simple
things clear; first, that people must be allowed to take risks and,
secondly, that the landowner should not be worrying that he has to
protect himself against people doing what they want to do on
mountainsides and in fields. Lord Hobhouse made an important point
about liberty, saying that it should never
be</p><a name="06060865000536"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;the policy of the law
to require the protection of the foolhardy or reckless few to deprive,
or interfere with, the enjoyment by the remainder of society of the
liberties and amenities to which they are rightly entitled. Does the
law require that all the trees be cut down because some youths may
climb them and fall? Does the law require the coastline and other
beauty spots to be lined with warning notices?... The pursuit of an
unrestrained culture of blame and compensation has many evil
consequences one of which is certainly the interference with the
liberty of the
citizen.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06060865000537">The
test for the blessed clause 1 is whether it adds anything to the
current law. I hope that we get a formulation that meets the concerns
of the Select Committee chaired by my right hon. Friend the Member for
Berwick-upon-Tweed and of those who say that adding &#147;desirable
activity&#148; poses a problem and that making it a permissive rather
than an obligatory requirement on the courts may add very
little.</p><p><a name="06060865000538">If
a doctor does something wrong when operating on or treating a patient,
the doctor is, by definition, carrying out a desirable activity. If a
tattooist does something wrong, they may be regarded as not carrying
out a desirable activity in the same sense. There is a danger that the
liability for negligence of the doctor may then be lowered in a way
that the public would not expect. I am not against seeking to codify
the law, but above all, I want to send a message that we must not
discourage people from doing desirable
things.</p><p><a name="06060865000539"><b><a name="06060865001399">Mr.
Brazier:</b> The problem with the excellent Tomlinson judgment
was that it related specifically to a very reckless individual. Most of
the cases that provide the most problems for organisations such as the
Scouts and sporting organisations do not relate to individual
recklessness, but to exactly what clause 1 addresses: namely, the court
suggesting that somebody should have carried out yet another safeguard
to prevent something.</p><br><notus-date day="8" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>8 Jun 2006 : Column 451</b><br><p><a name="06060865000540"><b><a name="06060865001400">Simon
Hughes:</b> I understand that, which is why I am more
sympathetic to clause 1 than my right hon. Friend the Member for
Berwick-upon-Tweed and my hon. Friend the Member for Cambridge. We
cannot pass a law that has no effect. Once we pass a new law, the
courts must take account of it and of some of the explanatory notes and
so on. We have to be clear: adding uncertainty will not be
helpful.</p><p><a name="06060865000541"><b><a name="06060865001401">Mr.
Heald:</b> I do not mean to trespass on the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s good will, but does he agree that we quite often
declare in statute what the law is, with the idea not particularly of
wanting to change it, but of wanting to clarify it? An example is the
Constitutional Reform Bill. He and I were anxious that it should make
it clear at the beginning that the role of the Lord Chancellor in
protecting the legal system should remain his duty, so we said it in
the Act for that purpose and to declare
it.</p><p><a name="06060865000542"><b><a name="06060865001402">Simon
Hughes:</b> And that is why I have not said that I am
wholeheartedly opposed to seeking to get this right. But if we start to
introduce phrases that do not have a legal definition, we might get
into a new set of definitions, which might mean that the law becomes
uncertain, not
certain.</p><p><a name="06060865000543"><b><a name="06060865001403">David
Howarth:</b> The central point here is, was the law unclear
before? Was it unclear after Tomlinson? Was it even unclear before
Tomlinson? <i> [Interruption.]</i> The hon. Member for Canterbury (Mr.
Brazier) says yes, but the question is, in what way was it unclear? If
there was a specific way in which it was unclear, that is the way in
which it should be made clear in the Bill. So far as I can tell, there
is no suggestion from the Government that that is what is going on with
clause
1.</p><p><a name="06060865000544"><b><a name="06060865001404">Simon
Hughes:</b> I think that my hon. Friend will not like the
answer to that question. I take the view that if it is possible to
encapsulate in one or two sentences in an Act of Parliament what the
law is, rather than drive people back to reading five House of Lords
judgments, we should do that. Therefore, it is better to write
something down as the law of the land, if we can, than to have to go
and read the words of the great legal minds of the country, because
most people do not go there, it is more difficult and there is more
than one judgment. So, if we can, let us do
it.</p><p><a name="06060865000545">The
last point that I want to make is about the rest of the Bill, which is
much less controversial. There is one controversial issue left in the
regulatory system, which was touched on by the right hon. Member for
Newcastle upon Tyne, East and Wallsend and others. It is the question
as to how we ensure fair play for all who are involved in the business
of dealing with claims and the
rest.</p><p><a name="06060865000546">As I understand
it, clause 3 says that if somebody, as an individual, is involved, but
not as part of their business, they are exempt, or potentially exempt.
I want to ensure that, at the end of the legislative process, there is
a level playing field so that members of trade unions&#151;in the
past, I acted for Thompson&#146;s, which did a lot of trade union
work as solicitors and instructed 
<br><notus-date day="8" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>8 Jun 2006 : Column 452</b><br>me and others&#151;who expect that, once they have paid, they will get
a service, are in the same position as those who join a political
party, the Co-operative movement, a voluntary organisation or whatever
and are also told that they will get a service. Provided that there is
a level playing field and everybody is treated the same, if the
organisations are of the same sort, that is
reasonable.</p><p><a name="06060865000547">Of course,
we need to ensure that individuals are not under some great regulatory
system if they are doing something voluntarily and in a way that
everybody understands does not give them a legal relationship, with the
liability that
follows.</p><p><a name="06060865000548">The Bill does
not deal with a lot of issues, which will be left on the agenda and
have been set out by the Association of Personal Injury Lawyers and
others, and which we shall have to revisit to achieve better access to
justice in the civil law. However, the Bill does some important things.
As my hon. Friend the Member for Somerton and Frome said, it is modest,
but it is none the less important for that. However, I fear that we
still have quite a bit of work to
do.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="06060865001048">2.41

Lloyd (Manchester, Central) (Lab):</b> I begin by welcoming
the consensual tone of the hon. Member for North Southwark and
Bermondsey (Simon Hughes). I also want to make a few brief points about
the role of the trade unions and about the question of mesothelioma,
which is enormously
important.</p><p><a name="06060865000550">I should
perhaps start by saying that I have an interest as an active trade
unionist and as chair of the trade union group of Labour MPs. I also
have an interest in the asbestos industry, because I worked in an
asbestos factory when people were systematically subject to risk that
ought to have been criminal, not simply the subject of compensation. If
I have some reasonably strong feelings on the subject, perhaps Members
of the House will
understand.</p><p><a name="06060865000551">I was
disappointed by the speech of the hon. Member for North-East
Hertfordshire (Mr. Heald) in that he wanted to perpetuate a certain
type of myth, which, I am afraid, goes back to the visceral view among
some of those who occupy the Conservative Benches that trade unions are
fundamentally a bad thing. The reality is that if most members of trade
unions were asked in whom they had greatest trust in pursuing on their
behalf an employment claim or a claim for personal injury, the trade
unions would figure highly in terms of a relationship of
trust.</p><p><a name="06060865000552">That
does not for one second ever absolve those trade unions&#151;the
Union of Democratic Mineworkers in the east midlands is one&#151;that
have behaved spectacularly badly with respect to the members and have
operated, de facto, as claims farmers. However, it is important to
establish that there is a position of trust between trade union members
and their unions as their
representatives.</p><p><a name="06060865000553">In
that light, the hon. Gentleman, who is absent from his place and who
told the House that trade unions make their money by claims, did not
give an accurate picture of reality. I wish that, when pressed, he had
been prepared to justify his claims from the Front Bench and name the
trade unions that he claims are abusing the position of
trust.</p><p><a name="06060865000554">It is important
that, for example, lawyers maintain professional integrity and that
their clients believe that 
<br><notus-date day="8" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>8 Jun 2006 : Column 453</b><br>most lawyers operate honestly and decently, even though we accept that
there are rogue lawyers in the system. In the same way, it is important
that members of trade unions have the same trust. It is not reasonable
to use the facilities of this House of Commons to make a generalised
condemnation of trade unions in a way that is designed actively either
to mislead or to pursue a partial
point.</p><p><a name="06060865000555"><b><a name="06060865001406">Mr.
Heald:</b> I thought that it was common knowledge that trade
unions are paid a referral fee when they send a case to a solicitor and
that, in many cases, they also receive success fees. Is the hon.
Gentleman suggesting that I am wrong about
that?</p><p><a name="06060865000556"><b><a name="06060865001407">Tony
Lloyd:</b> I am not suggesting that the hon. Gentleman is
wrong about that, but he knows that that is not what he said. I will
make him an offer. If he reads exactly what he said in <i> Hansard</i>
tomorrow and is prepared to come and apologise to me personally if he
was wrong in what he said about trade unions making their income from
referrals, I will also read <i> Hansard</i> and apologise to him if I am
wrong about it. I would even be prepared to make a point of order to
make that apology to the House. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will be
big enough to do the same, because the problem is that his comments
were not only an unfortunate misrepresentation, but a distorting
misrepresentation. I am very disappointed that the new Conservative
party should adopt its old position of hostility towards the trade
unions.</p><p><a name="06060865000557">No member of a
trade union wants rogue trade unions that operate against the interests
of their own members. Nobody seeks to justify the situation seen in the
east midlands, of unions acting as claims farmers, and that should be
condemned by every Labour Member of Parliament and by the trade union
movement. We have to ensure that if a trade union operates as a claim
farmer, it will not benefit from the general exemption offered to trade
unions. The code of practice to which the trade unions will be expected
to adhere must be sufficiently strong to regulate their role properly,
in a way that is analogous to the regulation of the legal profession
and others on this issue. That is an important part of the bargain for
trade unions and would be accepted by most Members of Parliament as
automatic, but more importantly it would be accepted by most trade
unionists and their trade unions. The balance that my hon. Friend the
Minister struck is important, because it establishes, not that trade
unions have special rights, but that trade unions have a particular
position of trust on behalf of their members and that has been
respected. It is the rights of the ordinary members of trade unions
that are protected by this
legislation.</p><p><a name="06060865000558">I
am also concerned about the issue of mesothelioma and the capacity of
the Bill to serve as a vehicle to change the law on Barker. As my right
hon. Friend the Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, East and Wallsend (Mr.
Brown) has already said, that is an important issue. We know that those
who are diagnosed with mesothelioma, sometimes many decades after they
have left the company, industry or situation that exposed them to
asbestos, face a grim prognosis. People generally live only a short

Barker judgment to be reversed, because the present situation&#151;as
my hon. Friend the Member for Hendon (Mr. Dismore) pointed
out&#151;is bad because it splits liability and therefore in the many
cases in which the companies no longer exist the individual firm that
contributed to causing mesothelioma will be able to avoid paying
compensation.</p><p><a name="06060865000563">In fact, the
problem is worse than that. The allocation of risk process means that
the accepted defence in many cases will be that non-existent companies
bear a greater proportion of responsibility for the factors leading to
mesothelioma. Claimants will get only tiny levels of compensation as a
result, and that is simply unfair. The Barker judgment has no
legitimacy, and a change in that respect is needed very
urgently.</p><p><a name="06060865000564">I
very much welcome my hon. Friend the Minister&#146;s clear commitment
that the Government are looking to make a change. Many hon. Members
have raised this matter in the Chamber&#151;my hon. Friend the Member
for Amber Valley (Judy Mallaber) did so with my right hon. Friend the
Prime Minister yesterday&#151;and elsewhere. We know that the

an amendment, whether it comes from the Government or the Back Benches,
will do the trick, although I understand that it may not be possible or
practical to devise an appropriate proposal in the time

John Greenway (Ryedale) (Con):</b> First, I remind colleagues
of my entry in the Register of Members&#146; Interests. In warmly
welcoming the Bill, I remind the House of the work of the all-party
insurance and financial services group, which I have chaired since
1992. For many years, we have taken a close interest in the issues
covered by the Bill. In anticipation of the draft Bill, we took
evidence last year from a number of organisations and 11 witnesses in
total, including various insurance lawyer trade associations, the
industry and even the Claims Standards Council. We issued our report in
November.</p><p><a name="06060865000573">There are
three features of the current compensation environment&#151;I shall
not be drawn into a debate on whether there is a compensation
culture&#151;against which to judge the likely effectiveness of the
Bill: risk aversion, rehabilitation and the regulation of claims
managers. Risk aversion is important because, as we all know, many
events or activities do not take place because of concern over
potential claims for negligence in respect of personal injuries. Public
liability insurance costs have risen to the extent that many activities
do not take place because there is no public liability insurance cover
and the leisure industry has seen a dramatic increase in the cost of
both employee and public liability insurance.</p><p><a name="06060865000574">Secondly, rehabilitation is
important because we are still not doing nearly enough to ensure that
people who suffer major injuries as a result of a workplace or motor
accident are treated quickly and got back to work quickly.</p><p><a name="06060865000575">Thirdly, the regulation of
claims managers is important because of the widespread malpractice by
so-called ambulance chasers, run by some pretty ruthless and
unscrupulous people who are happy to sell 
<br><notus-date day="8" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>8 Jun 2006 : Column 456</b><br>on the introduction of a victim while contributing precious little
towards the speedy and satisfactory handling of a claim. The no win, no
fee basis of claims handling is confusing to claimants, often results
in significant parts of their compensation being hived off to pay legal
bills and has contributed to a situation in which legal fees amount to
a staggering 40 per cent. of all personal injuries claims
costs&#151;money better used to rehabilitate and compensate victims
and, I dare say, better used if we all had to pay lower premiums for
the insurance cover that we have to purchase. In the end, we all pay;
insurers have no money other than what we pay them in
premiums.</p><p><a name="06060865000576">I shall deal
with the three items in turn. On risk aversion, the new definition in
clause 1 is meant to enshrine in statute the current understanding of
the law of negligence. We have already had considerable debate on
whether that clause is necessary, whether it adds anything to existing
law and whether, if it does not, it has any point. Back in November,
the all-party group agreed with the lawyer associations that clause 1
should be dropped, but the Government have not been persuaded to accept
that view. If, as looks likely, clause 1 remains, I hope that we will
be able to examine it in further detail in Committee because it is
critical to understand precisely what the clause means.</p><p><a name="06060865000577">I am concerned about some of
the new concepts, particularly &#147;desirable activity&#148;, that
may require a new definition, but I sense from listening to
today&#146;s debate that there may already be something new in the
definition and perhaps more in the Government&#146;s intentions than
they have admitted&#151;though I do not say that in a critical way.
If the new definition clarified what precautions might be
disproportionate in persuading people not to go ahead with a desirable
activity&#151;that seems to lie behind what the definition
suggests&#151;it could have a positive aspect.</p><p><a name="06060865000578">As other
Members have suggested, it is important that the courts, including the
lower courts with which my hon. Friend the Member for Canterbury (Mr.
Brazier) has a bone of contention, fully understand Parliament&#146;s
intentions. It is wholly desirable that voluntary organisations, who
obviously rely on volunteers and do not have access to an army of
expensive lawyers, understand precisely the legal implications of what
they
do.</p><p><a name="06060865000579">I
want to make one other point about the insurance aspect. Many
activities do not take place simply because people cannot afford the
public liability insurance cover. The long-term test of the new
definition in clause 1 should be what it does to public liability
insurance underwriting. I rather suspect that, for quite some time,
underwriters will wait and see what happens in all the court cases that
I know the hon. Member for Hendon (Mr. Dismore) thinks are
likely&#151;we had an exchange about the matter one evening in one of
the Dining Rooms recently. We need to keep that prospect in
mind.</p>

<p><a name="06060865000580">I turn next
to rehabilitation. Just one issue has dominated our news for the past
six weeks. It is nothing to do with politics, the state of the world or
even Iraq. It is Wayne Rooney&#146;s broken metatarsal. It has
dominated every news bulletin and every newspaper. We all hope that he
has been miraculously rehabilitated, but that experience is in stark
contrast to the long delays experienced by people with workplace and
motor accident injuries in getting the rehabilitation that they need to
get them back to work.</p><br><notus-date day="8" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>8 Jun 2006 : Column 457</b><br><p><a name="06060865000581">Clause 2 is a
hugely welcome addition because it can provide new impetus to efforts
to get people rehabilitated quickly. That is better for claimants and
for employers. It is also better for third parties&#151;people who
have caused accidents. We should not always think that they are being
difficult because they do not have sympathy with the victim. Most of
the time, they do. In the long run, quicker rehabilitation is better
for insurers.</p><p><a name="06060865000582">All the
evidence points to the fact that the more quickly someone can be
rehabilitated, the more likely it is that they will recover from the
injuries that they have suffered in an accident, especially motor
accidents in which people suffer whiplash injuries, back problems and
so on, and the more likely it is that, for the good of them, of all of
us and of their families, they have the chance to get back to work. So
I welcome the addition of clause 2 and congratulate my noble Friend
Lord Hunt of Wirral and his colleagues in the other place on
introducing it.</p><p><a name="06060865000583">The
regulation of claims managers is a long overdue measure. Some right
hon. and hon. Members have concerns, as I do, at the notion of yet more
regulation, but currently we have the farcical situation in which the
arranging and sale of an insurance policy is subject to statutory
regulation, and the loss adjusters who assist the insurers in the
handling and measurement of claims are regulated through their
professional body&#151; the Chartered Institute of Loss
Adjusters&#151;but claims farmers are not regulated at all. Yet it is
in the management of claims that abuse and mischief lies. &#147;The
proof of the pudding is in the eating&#148; is an old saying, but it
is only at the point of claim that people understand whether the
insurance policy that they bought provided them with the protection
that they thought it did when they paid the premium. It is at the point
of claim that the real value lies.</p><p><a name="06060865000584">Undoubtedly, whether the
individual policy holder claims for himself against his own policy is
an issue about which we should be concerned, but it is far worse if we
are dealing with the management of a claim in respect of a third party,
who has a right of action under the policy as a result of what has
happened, but has no relationship with the insurance company in the way
that the policy holder does. It is critical that we get the claims
management industry properly
regulated.</p><p><a name="06060865000585">For the
regulation to work, it must be comprehensive. There has been much
discussion about exemptions. I want to make two points about them. If
there are exemptions, the bodies that regulate exempt organisations
must have equivalence in their regulatory bite. I am reassured by the
Minister&#146;s comments that if trade unions, about which there has
been much discussion, do not match up, they will be subject to tougher
regulation.</p><p><a name="06060865000586">The most
critical thing is definition. I strongly urge the Minister to regulate
the activity and avoid the danger of simply regulating the name
&#147;claims farmers&#148;. My experience in the matter comes from
the past 10 years&#151;all the time I have been a Member&#151;of my
election to the Insurance Brokers Regulation Council, which was a
statutory regulator, but we regulated the name &#147;insurance
broker&#148;. If a firm used the title &#147;insurance
broker&#148;, it had to be regulated by the IBRC. Of course, many
people practised, in effect, as insurance brokers but called themselves
insurance consultants, so when we disciplined a broker and 
<br><notus-date day="8" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>8 Jun 2006 : Column 458</b><br>chucked them out of the profession they carried on in business under
another name. We have to avoid that situation in respect of claims
farmers.</p><p><a name="06060865000587">It
is also critical that the regulator has the power to exclude, and that
there is no route back for the cowboys to whom the Minister referred
several times. That means that we need strong codes of conduct, but we
also need clarity about precisely what they can and cannot do in their
presentations to claimants and possible clients and in the
advertisement of their
services.</p><p><a name="06060865000588">The
Government have made huge progress by specifying that the regulator
will be the Department for Constitutional Affairs, even if only
temporarily. I heard the comments of my hon. Friend the Member for
North-East Hertfordshire (Mr. Heald) and I understand his sense of
disappointment that we are not being provided with a distinct
regulator. However, we have to bear in mind the other side of the
argument. There are probably only about 500 claims management firms and
my hunch is that half of them could be driven out of business, which
would reduce their number to 250. Even charging them reasonable fees
would not give us a basis for funding a regulator to do all that I have
suggested needs to be done. We may have to wait until the new regulator
has been set up under the Legal Services Bill to bring all the threads
together.</p><p><a name="06060865000589">I
am disappointed, however, that the Financial Services Authority has not
agreed to undertake the regulation process. Claims management is
related to insurance products. It is a financial services issue, so
that is largely where the regulation should be. The intention is not to
pursue a vendetta against claims managers but to ensure that they
operate professionally and that we protect consumers from the
unscrupulous. We must also ensure that the accident or event that is
the subject of the claim, which is a bad enough experience for the
individual, does not become a double whammy, due to bad advice about
how to claim. All of us have heard about such experiences in our
surgeries.</p><p><a name="06060865000590">Madam
Deputy Speaker, I hope that you and the House will forgive me for not
staying until the end of the debate, as I have another duty to perform.
I particularly wanted to take part in the debate and hope that my
comments show that I am very much behind what the Government want to
do. The Bill is long overdue and I wish it well. The regulation of
claims managers and strengthening the possibility of rehabilitation are
two developments that we can all warmly welcome, and from which all our
constituents will benefit in the long
run.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="06060865001050">3.9

hands on, with real cases, helping real victims. I remain a consultant
with my law firm, but I have not taken cases since I came to this
place. I am a founder member of the Association of Personal Injury
Lawyers, a former member of its executive committee and a former Law
Society specialist assessor for its panel of personal injury
lawyers.</p><p><a name="06060865000592">My job here

lawyers, I would probably 
<br><notus-date day="8" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>8 Jun 2006 : Column 459</b><br>welcome clause 1, because it will wave off not just a mere gravy train
but a veritable Orient Express of rich cordon bleu sauces for the legal
profession. It will create a tsunami of litigation that will flood the
courts with cases of such complexity, and in such volume, that Jarndyce
<i> v.</i> Jarndyce will look like a small claims debt recovery action
in comparison.</p><p><a name="06060865000593">Clause
1 creates confusion where there is settled law. It will jeopardise
safety standards, creating a charter to kill and maim with impunity. It
will deprive deserving claimants of their just compensation and will
create a two-tier system whereby victims of identical accidents have
entirely different outcomes. I chair the Joint Committee on Human
Rights, which has expressed criticisms of clause 1. We were not
persuaded that the clause accurately reflects the subtleties of the
existing law of negligence. It restricts access to legal redress by
claimants, including vulnerable groups. We believe that the clause will
be applied in a manner that restricts claimants&#146; access to
justice and runs the risk of being in breach of our country&#146;s
obligations under articles 2, 3 and 8 of the European convention on
human
rights.</p><p><a name="06060865000594">It
is claimed that all that clause 1 does is restate the law, but if that
is the case, it raises the question: why do it? The common law has
developed over the past 75 years in particular, starting perhaps with
the Donoghue <i> v. </i>Stevenson principle and ending, most recently,
with Tomlinson <i> v.</i> Congleton borough council. There have been
many other cases in between. In no way does the clause accurately
restate the law. The Lord Chief Justice made it clear to the
Constitutional Affairs Committee that</p><a name="06060865000982"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;it is quite impossible to
encapsulate the law of negligence in a single
sentence.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06060865000595">Despite the Government&#146;s
protestations and the Minister repeating herself until she is blue in
the face, clause 1 manifestly fails to reproduce the common law as it
presently stands. In reality, the clause is simply a reaction to the
popular misconception of the compensation culture, which has been
roundly rubbished by everybody who has bothered to look at it. The
facts show a decline in claims, not an increase&#151;so why reinforce
prejudice?</p><p><a name="06060865000596">Clause 1
is riddled with ambiguity, uncertainty and a lack of legal precision.
It starts off by giving the court discretion about whether to apply it.
That in itself will lead to many legal arguments about whether the
judge should or should not have exercised his discretion in the first
place. It refers to the need for the claimant to identify the taking of
precautions&#151;a positive case required from a claimant that was
not previously required. This is about expecting a claimant to deliver
a positive safety regime for the defendant if they are going to win
their case. The clause introduces a whole new concept into common law
of &#147;desirable activity&#148;, which the Bill fails to define.
The Minister indicated earlier that she was not prepared to define it
through an amendment.</p><p><a name="06060865000597"><b><a name="06060865001416">Paddy
Tipping:</b> The Minister made it clear that there would be
other cases before the court to test that out. Rather than clarifying
the law, the provision is going to lead to
debate.</p><br><notus-date day="8" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>8 Jun 2006 : Column 460</b><br><p><a name="06060865000598"><b><a name="06060865001417">Mr.
Dismore:</b> Exactly&#151;my hon. Friend is right. We will
have a plethora of cases interpreting the provision. The courts could,
in the end, come to the same conclusion as the Minister and say that
there is no difference between it and the existing common law. They may
rely on Pepper <i> v. </i>Hart and say that that is what the Government
said. However, I doubt that. Even if that were the case, it would
happen only after extensive, expensive examples were tried in the House
of Lords&#151;or, possibly by then, the new supreme court.
</p><p><a name="06060865000599">In
reality, clause 1 creates a brand new series of defences, rebalancing
the scales of justice against injured employees, travellers or
schoolchildren and in favour of the multinational insurance industry.
It does not replicate the key point in Tomlinson that willing consent
to the risk is necessary, and that the principles laid down there are
not appropriate when there is a real lack of informed choice or an
imbalance of power, such as between an employer and employee, or a
public authority as against children and vulnerable pensioners. I am
truly appalled that a Labour Government should propose such a measure
to weaken the rights of the small person against the mighty
insurer.</p><p><a name="06060865000600">The
Government say that there is no need to exclude employment accidents
from clause 1, but some jobs involve more desirable activities than
others. Some are very desirable, but hazardous; some are less so, but
safer. When I was in practice, for many years I represented injured
firefighters. The principles of liability towards firefighters were
well established in the House of Lords many years ago in the case of
Ogwo <i> v. </i>Taylor. The clause considerably weakens those
principles, and reopens some of the arguments that were put forward by
the defence in the House of Lords and rejected. A seriously injured
firefighter could well see his or her right to compensation undermined
or even removed by the rebalancing of the law.</p><p><a name="06060865000601">Of course, if
the employment were a less desirable activity, perversely, the new
defence would not work. There would thus perhaps be stronger protection
for people with less desirable occupations. Journalists, estate agents
or even Members of the House might thus attract greater protection than
a firefighter, who does what might be considered to be a more desirable
activity.</p><p><a name="06060865000602">The
situation becomes even worse when we find that clause 1 goes beyond
negligence and covers breaches of statutory duty&#151;exactly the
sort of cases that Lord Hoffmann said should be excluded from the test
in Tomlinson. Statutory duties underpin the health and safety regime,
especially for some of the most dangerous occupations, such as those in
construction. Contrary to the Government&#146;s contention in the
other place, very few of those statutory duties are absolute duties.
There is a strong argument that we do not comply with EU directives in
that respect already. The duties are circumscribed by conditions that
use such phrases as &#147;reasonable practicability&#148;,
&#147;practicability&#148;, &#147;appropriate&#148;,
&#147;suitable&#148; and &#147;adequate&#148;. Some duties are
already too weak, without watering down the protection still further
through the desirability defence. All the duties apply without fail
when there is an asymmetric power relationship, such as the
employee-employer relationship, the relationship between a public
authority and an individual citizen, or the relationship between an
occupier and a visitor.</p><br><notus-date day="8" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>8 Jun 2006 : Column 461</b><br><p><a name="06060865000603">If we are
thinking about the construction industry, should we consider whether
some projects are more desirable than others? For example, people might
think that it is rather more desirable to build Wembley stadium than it
was to build the dome. What about the position of children? What of a
school-run mum who crashes her 4x4 while ferrying her children and her
neighbour&#146;s children to school? Going to school is a desirable
activity, which might weaken the case, but it could be argued that it
would have been rather more desirable for the occupants of the vehicle
to walk to school, instead of going by car. There could thus be an
argument about which activity would be more desirable. In those
circumstances, there would be a risk of there being a lesser standard
for the passengers, and anyone whom the mum hit crossing a red light,
than would be the case if the accident happened on the way home and the
occupants of the vehicle had decided to call at McDonald&#146;s for
an unhealthy burger and chips, which could well be considered to be
entirely undesirable. There is thus a paradox. It simply cannot be
right that a less desirable activity gives the claimant a stronger
case.</p><p><a name="06060865000604"><b><a name="06060865001418">Helen

restate the law; it dramatically changes it, and weakens it from the

good reason, because between 2000 and 2005, claims against local

existing law already provides for that. If it is true that the clause
simply restates the law, the Government must accept that argument.
Contrary to the words that the hon. Member for North-East Hertfordshire
(Mr. Heald) tried to put into my mouth, I warmly welcome the idea that
we should issue guidance and publications to explain the law as widely
and fully as possible&#151;but frankly, I do not think that the
clause is going to be the talk of school staff rooms, or scout leaders
in the pub after a volunteering exercise. The fact remains that people
will be far more interested in the guidance than what the clause might
or might not
state.</p><p><a name="06060865000610">The real effect
of the measure will be not to encourage volunteering, but to put young
people at even more risk when they participate in adventurous
activities. It will also discourage parents from allowing their
children to undertake such activities. It will create different
standards. For example, in relation to driving, a minibus of scouts
going to camp would have less 
<br><notus-date day="8" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>8 Jun 2006 : Column 462</b><br>protection than a bunch of football supporters going to a match. The
clause will lower safety standards, lead to fewer precautions and
condone
negligence.</p><p><a name="06060865000611">What
responsible parents would allow their children to go mountaineering,
open-sea canoeing or sailing if they were told, &#147;By the way,
this is a desirable activity, so if Johnny or Jill is hurt badly,
breaks a limb, becomes paraplegic, or is even killed, and if
it&#146;s our fault, there may be no compensation as a
result.&#148; Clause 1 stinks, and must be withdrawn from the Bill.
It does not restate the law, but weakens the position of the average
ordinary person in the
street.</p><p><a name="06060865000612">We should use
the Bill to redress the balance. We should consider what needs to be
done to improve the position of accident victims. There needs to be a
clear exemption from clause 1 for employers&#146; liability cases,
and from clause 2 for trade unions. We need to recognise that in the
past the courts have, in many respects, failed accident victims, and we
should take this opportunity to put right those mistakes.</p><p><a name="06060865000613">We have
already heard at length about Barker <i> v.</i> Corus and other asbestos
cases; we have heard about the pleural plaques cases; there is the
Crown Proceedings (Armed Forces) Act 1987, about which I made a point
earlier; and there are many similar points to be made about asbestos.
But that is only the start. If an insurer makes an admission of
liability early in the case, why should that admission not be binding
on it? The case of Sowerby says that it is not, and when a case is
further down the track the insurer can say that it has changed its mind
and does not admit liability after all. How does that strengthen the
rights of claimants and avoid the need for
litigation?</p><p><a name="06060865000614">The
Law Commission, in its 1999 report, made it clear that damages for
personal injury claims were far too low. It recommended that in cases
where general damages exceed &#163;3,000 they should increase by
between 50 and 100 per cent. The Court of Appeal considered that in the
case of Heil <i> v. </i>Rankin, and did not do as the Law Commission
recommended, but said that it was a matter for Parliament. It is a
matter for Parliament, and we should take this opportunity to deal with
it.</p><p><a name="06060865000615">This Government
rightly introduced the system of periodical payments to allow those who
are seriously injured to have compensation assessed and paid out over
the rest of their lives. However, the system for indexing those
payments is drastically wrong. It simply refers to the retail prices
index and does not take account of the fact that many of the elements
in those compensation awards are tied not to the RPI but to much higher
indexes, such as the index of average earnings. We should use the
opportunity of this Bill to put right that injustice and ensure that
claimants receive the compensation to which they are
entitled.</p><p><a name="06060865000616">The discount
rate applied to an assessment of a future loss of earnings has been
fixed at 2.5 per cent. since 2001. It is supposed to reflect the
returns that a claimant can expect when investing his award, but unless
it is reviewed regularly the discount rate does not accurately reflect
market changes, which could put the claimant at a disadvantage. That,
too, needs putting right, and the Bill is a vehicle by which we could
do
so.</p><p><a name="06060865000617">I
agree with the hon. Member for Ryedale (Mr. Greenway) that
rehabilitation is a crucial process for any injured
claimant. There has been considerable 
<br><notus-date day="8" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>8 Jun 2006 : Column 463</b><br>discussion between the Government and stakeholders about ensuring early
rehabilitation for claimants. Where liability is clearly established,
insurers should have a statutory duty to ensure that funds are released
to facilitate early, appropriate and independent rehabilitation. That
would provide the impetus needed to ensure that rehabilitation becomes
an integral part of the compensation system. Again, we could take the
opportunity of putting such a duty in the Bill, but the Government have
indicated that they are not prepared to do
so.</p><p><a name="06060865000618">I
was tempted to say that I would not vote for the Bill because of clause
1, which dramatically weakens the right of people in this country to
compensation, thus pandering to the insurance industry, to the tabloids
and to the myth of the compensation culture. But I shall vote for
Second Reading because I passionately believe in the need for
regulation of claims farmers, as set out in part 2. This is an
opportunity to do some good in that respect, and the positive changes
that I have advocated would take that even further. I first advocated
regulating claims farmers many years ago, long before I came here, and
I raised the issue at the very first meeting I had with a Minister in
what was then the Lord Chancellor&#146;s Department, back in 1997.
Nearly 10 years on, I am very pleased that the Government have, at long
last, recognised the problem and are dealing with it. This has been a
serious problem since the 1980s, when claims farmers first got off the
ground.</p><p><a name="06060865000619">I hope that
the Government will reflect on clause 1. It has little, if any, support
beyond the tabloids, and even that is not clear. It is not supported by
the lawyers, by the Constitutional Affairs Committee or by my
Committee. I understand from the hon. Member for Ryedale that it is not
supported by the insurance industry. Nobody has a good word for
it&#151;except the Government, the official Opposition and the hon.
Member for Canterbury, who thinks that it does something entirely
different from what the Government say it does. It is opposed by the
TUC, the Association of Personal Injury Lawyers and the Law
Society&#151;just about everyone who has the interests of the little
man or woman at heart, as opposed to the multinationals. We should not
pander to myths; we should look at the evidence and at the harm that
clause 1 will cause. I urge the Minister to look at the impact of what
could be a useful reforming measure and to get rid of clause 1. Let us
go ahead with part 2, which is badly
needed.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="06060865001051">3.24

pleases my hon. Friend the Member for Montgomeryshire (Lembit
&#214;pik).</p><p><a name="06060865000621">I shall
speak briefly about the work that the Committee on Constitutional
Affairs did on compensation culture and on the Bill. As many hon.
Members have said, we were not satisfied with clause 1. We
said:</p><a name="06060865000983"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;It
neither satisfies those people who wish for volunteers to be provided
with a special defence against claims of negligence, nor 
<br><notus-date day="8" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>8 Jun 2006 : Column 464</b><br>does it clarify the law. Instead, it is likely to lead to additional
litigation, as people turn to the courts to define the precise nature
of the provision.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06060865000622">I shall return to that
point.</p><p><a name="06060865000623">The Committee
did not conclude that conditional fee agreements or litigation had
created a compensation culture, but rather that there was a perception
of such, with a variety of causes, that was not soundly
based.</p><a name="06060865000984"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#148;We
found no evidence that conditional fee agreements or personal injury
litigation were a significant factors in causing risk aversion, and
personal injury litigation has not increased in recent
years.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06060865000624">We
said:</p><a name="06060865000985"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Risk
aversion has a number of complex causes, including advertising by
claims management companies, selective media reporting, a lack of
information about how the law works and, on occasion, a lack of common
sense among those who implement health and safety guidelines. Risk
aversion of this sort is a concerning modern phenomenon that has an
adverse effect on individuals and on the economy as a whole. Instead of
a statutory provision restating the law of negligence what is required
is a clear leadership by the
Government&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06060865000625">We
went on to suggest that that</p><a name="06060865000986"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;should include an education
programme making clear that risk management does not equate to the
avoidance of all risk and active engagement by the Health and Safety
Executive to ensure that it adopts an approach which is proportionate,
does not over-regulate vulnerable sectors and instead offers
appropriate advice and
support&#148;.</p></ul><p><a name="06060865000626">On
balancing risk, the Committee was given a strong impression by the HSE
that balancing different risks was not something in which it engaged.
The classic example is the HSE stopping a commuter station from being
opened because the platform was not long enough. Somebody might get out
through a door, not obeying the guard&#146;s instructions, and sprain
or break an ankle. That is a lower risk and a lower injury than if all
commuters got into their cars and drove on congested roads into the
city. There is the balancing of risks from two different areas. The
system is not equipped to carry out that exercise, which leads to the
consequences about which hon. Members are concerned.</p><p><a name="06060865000627">There is also
the widespread and gross misuse of health and safety arguments, and
sometimes on the basis of mere error. A lovely example of that is
provided by the Lord Chief Justice, who was told when he went to a
governors&#146; meeting at his old school that he could no longer
take an early morning dip in the swimming pool because there was no
lifeguard or qualified member of staff present to supervise his swim.
As a modest man, he did not assert, &#147;I am the Lord Chief
Justice, and this would not stand a moment&#146;s chance in my
court.&#148; If he had done so, that would have helped to spread
greater knowledge of the law.</p><p><a name="06060865000628">Perhaps more often health and
safety arguments are used as an excuse when a public body does not want
to spend some money or does not have a budget for something that is
clearly necessary to enable an activity to take place. Health and
safety is often loosely quoted when it is not the real reason for not
doing something. </p><p><a name="06060865000629">On
clause 1, most accepted authorities will say that the Tomlinson case
got it right, and that there is no clearer and sounder definition of
what the law says than what came out in that judgment. I will not quote
them again because my hon. Friend the Member for North Southwark and
Bermondsey (Simon Hughes) 
<br><notus-date day="8" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>8 Jun 2006 : Column 465</b><br>referred to Lord Hoffmann&#146;s trenchant words on the subject. There
are real dangers in trying to second guess, as is done in clause 1.
That relates particularly to satellite litigation on, for example, what
might be desirable activities. That is only one of the areas in which
litigation could take place on the basis of clause 1, and examples of
that have already been given.</p><p><a name="06060865000630">If, as the Government concede,
there is to be litigation to establish the meaning of clause 1, that
immediately defeats its sole objective, which is to give people a
clearer understanding of what the law is now. The moment that we get
into fresh litigation, we have to wait for that understanding to
exist.</p><p><a name="06060865000631"><b><a name="06060865001423">Mr.
Brazier:</b> I have heard that argument several times. Can the
right hon. Gentleman explain why providing an extra defence for an
organisation that may be sued would lead to extra
litigation?</p><p><a name="06060865000632"><b><a name="06060865001424">Mr.
Beith:</b> It is not an extra defence. Indeed, the Government
differ from the hon. Gentleman, because they have sought to make it
clear that the provision does not add a legal protection that does not
already exist. It is simply designed to remind the public and the
courts of the basis of the law as it stands, and it will not create any
new legal defence. The clause will be read by people from one end of
the country to the other, so it must be clear. It must be clear, too,
as he has rightly suggested, in the lower courts. The Lord Chief
Justice said that he did not know who was going to read clause
1:</p><a name="06060865000987"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;The average
man in the street is unlikely to be reading clause 1. As far as the
judges are concerned, and judges and lawyers are the ones likely to be
reading statutes, and the clause sets out to define the
position...not to change
it&#148;.</p></ul><p><a name="06060865000633">We should make the
position clear so that cases related to the Pepper <i> v. </i>Hart case
have regard to the fact that Ministers have said that the law is not
changed by the provision. Litigation will, however, arise from measures
such as the desirable activities provision.</p><p><a name="06060865000634">There are two other dangers.
Public authority staff are at a disadvantage, because they engage in
desirable activities. The Government state that the clause is not
intended to effect a change in the law, but there is a danger that that
will give false comfort to voluntary organisations. My Committee took
evidence from voluntary organisations, including the scouts, whose
evidence impressed us, not least because they have made efforts to
ensure that risk management was built into their systems and training.
The problems are greatest for small voluntary organisations that do not
have the facilities or experience built up by larger organisations. If
we are not careful, the clause will give them false comfort.</p><p><a name="06060865000635">Turning to other issues, I am
glad that the Minister gave me a clear, precise answer about who will
regulate claims handlers. I sympathise with the Government&#146;s
position, as we must look at what emerges from the proposed regulation
of lawyers before we decide where responsibility should reside. In the
meantime, the Secretary of State should do the job, so that he has
something to do now that all his other responsibilities have been taken
away. As a result, my Committee would have oversight responsibility for
the claims-handling process, and we look forward to making sure that it
works.</p>

provisions, anyone who, like me, represents a mining constituency will
be concerned about the gross abuses of which claims handlers, trade
unions and the Law Society, which failed to regulate lawyers, were
guilty. Several firms of solicitors were deeply and disgracefully
involved in that huge scandal, defrauding vulnerable people whom the
Government had set out systematically to protect from any
costs&#151;indeed, they paid for that protection. The exemption
provisions must be proof against such a scandal, while recognising that
trade unions and voluntary bodies such as citizens advice bureaux do a
great deal of work to direct claims and ensure that people receive
appropriate legal advice. The Committee must look carefully at the
exemption provisions so that they meet the objective of ensuring that
people whose claims are dealt with by a trade union or a voluntary body
are not at a disadvantage if they are defrauded or not provided
for.</p><p><a name="06060865000637">Most of the Bill
is much needed, but clause 1 may prove to be a great deal more trouble
than it is worth, as it may not satisfy genuine anxieties about
participation in voluntary activity or the promotion of sports that
involve an element of risk. Many of those anxieties are based on a
misunderstanding of the law, on fears of prosecution by the Health and
Safety Executive, on misunderstanding of the provisions required by the
HSE and, indeed, on a series of things that the clause is not designed
to
address.</p><p><a name="06060865000638"><b><a name="06060865001425">Mr.
Brazier:</b> I am grateful to the right hon. Gentleman for
giving way once more. He took evidence in his Committee from Derek
Twine of the Scout Association. The concerns of the Scout
Association&#151;we are dealing with the civil law here, not the
HSE&#151;are based on a series of court cases that it has lost, some
of which, I know, were cited to the right hon. Gentleman in evidence,
yet his report did not reflect that at
all.</p><p><a name="06060865000639"><b><a name="06060865001426">Mr.
Beith:</b> I am sure that the hon. Gentleman will refer later
to one or two cases which do not even appear in the law reports. That
will be helpful to us. If cases are not resolved satisfactorily in the
lower courts on the basis of the law as we know it to be
post-Tomlinson, it will be necessary for those cases to go to appeal
and to go up the system to ensure that they are dealt with
satisfactorily. If that places an unreasonable burden on some of the
voluntary bodies involved, such as the Scout Association, we must
address that. We will not necessarily help them if we put in a clause
which they think provides them with a protection which, in fact, it
does not.</p><p><a name="06060865000640">I shall
listen to the remainder of the debate with considerable interest,
because I think that the hon. Member for Canterbury (Mr. Brazier) and
my hon. Friend the Member for Montgomeryshire genuinely believe that
this restatement of the law will provide an additional legal
protection. It is not the Government&#146;s view, as they have
clearly stated, that the law is changed.</p><p><a name="06060865000641">The Government are wrong, as
the hon. Member for Hendon (Mr. Dismore) pointed out, on a different
point. They are wrong that the Bill does not restate the law, because
in relation to employees it clearly has that effect, but in relation to
the defence that can be advanced by an organisation engaged in
providing a voluntary activity or a risky sport, it is not intended to 
<br><notus-date day="8" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>8 Jun 2006 : Column 467</b><br>change the law. If it does, the House should know that it does. The
Government cannot rely on two Back-Bench Members insisting that it
does. In a Pepper <i> v. </i>Hart judgment later in the day, it will not
be their view that is considered, but that of Ministers. At this point
I shall rest my case, as I want to hear other
views.</p><p><a name="06060865000642"><b><a name="06060865001427">Madam

Tipping (Sherwood) (Lab):</b> I am grateful for the
opportunity to speak in support of the Bill. Claims handlers have been
described as cowboys. If that is the case, coalfield communities such
as north Nottinghamshire are the wild west. The activities of claims
handlers have caused false hopes, false expectations and real concerns
and financial difficulties, not just to people who work in the mining
industry, but for the women in the textile industry who have been
gullible enough to make deafness claims through claims handlers. I
strongly support part 2. The regulation of claims handlers is long
overdue.</p><p><a name="06060865000644">My
hon. Friend the Member for Hendon (Mr. Dismore) was hostile towards
clause 1. I am agnostic. I would like to see the phrase
&#147;desirable activity&#148; defined. It is not defined. In her
opening remarks the Minister made it clear that there would be further
court cases to test the scope of the phrase. Rather than clarifying the
law, that may well lead to confusion and
delay.</p><p><a name="06060865000645">I am concerned
about the position of public sector workers&#151;people who work in
difficult environments, such as the fire brigade or the ambulance
service. They are undertaking desirable activities, but the level of
protection that they have under the clause may be less than they have
at present. I am with the right hon. Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed (Mr.
Beith). His Select Committee has considered the matter. I am agnostic
about the way forward. I do not think the clause moves us on, and I
look forward to a rigorous debate on clause 1 and its
significance.</p><p><a name="06060865000646">Clause 1
is well balanced by clause 2. All bodies, particularly public bodies,
ought to be prepared to apologise much more readily than they do. An
apology is simply good practice. An early acknowledgement that things
have gone wrong and that the institution is sorry could save a great
deal of litigation later
on.</p><p><a name="06060865000647">Let
me turn my remarks to part 2. As I said, claims handlers have ridden
roughshod over coalfield communities, and the difficulties involving
coal health claims are well documented. It is not only down to claims
handlers but to solicitors and, I have to say, to trade unions. Hon.
Members are right to question why trade unions should be exempted from
the Bill by secondary legislation. I have come to support that view,
but we must be very careful about what it says in the code of practice
that the Government intend to introduce.</p><p><a name="06060865000648">We must not be swayed by
traditional allegiances to organisations such as trade unions. The
unions have done, and continue to do, a tremendous job. They have
brought forward test cases that have radically changed the law and have
benefited working people&#151;but at this 
<br><notus-date day="8" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>8 Jun 2006 : Column 468</b><br>stage, given recent events, we must ensure that claimants are at the
centre of our concern. Where trade unions act as claims
handlers&#151;as they do; let us not kid ourselves&#151;they must
not be exempted. I am determined that the code of practice should make
that clear. People who have been ripped off in north Nottinghamshire
and other coalfield communities will be astonished and dismayed if a
loophole is left open so that illegitimate, immoral activities can be
undertaken by trade unions acting as claims
handlers.</p><p><a name="06060865000649">Another
aspect that the code of practice will have to cover is that of a trade
union acting for a member and his or her close family and for a wider
group of people. Trade unions sometimes act for groups of people far
extended from their traditional activities. For example, the south
Wales branch of the National Association of Colliery Overmen, Deputies
and Shotfirers acts for people in the Kent coalfield who are not
members of that organisation. The code of practice must make it clear
that there is a difference between acting for members and acting for a
wider audience.</p><p><a name="06060865000650">It is
important that the code of practice is discussed with the TUC, which
will, I am sure, be positive and helpful. It should not act as a
sleeping watchdog but ensure that it intervenes heavily to stamp out
abuse. Of course, some trade unions are not, and never will be,
affiliated to the TUC. The code of practice must make it absolutely
clear that trade unions, whether affiliated or not, operate
legitimately within it.</p><p><a name="06060865000651"><b><a name="06060865001429">Mr.
Heald:</b> As the hon. Gentleman knows, I am concerned about
this point as well. Solicitors, for example, are also exempted but they
are regulated in this field by the Law Society and, soon, by another
regulator. The problem with the unions is that they have no regulator
in this field. He will know that there have been some dreadful examples
of union misbehaviour in this respect. Is he really satisfied with this
exemption?</p><p><a name="06060865000652"><b><a name="06060865001430">Paddy
Tipping:</b> I am making it clear to the Minister that I will
be satisfied only if the secondary legislation and the code of practice
really do the job for which the hon. Gentleman asks. When trade unions
act as claims handlers, they must be treated as claims handlers. I do
not, in principle, object to unions charging a reward fee for a
successful claim. I know the benefit that will result if the money is
used by the trade union movement for other activities, such as taking
on test cases. However, I believe that it must be absolutely clear that
the claimant understood the nature of the contract when he signed it.
It is obvious from the whole claims scenario that that has not been
happening.</p><p><a name="06060865000653">The
Minister is right, in the short term, to want to regulate claims
handlers through the Department, but I hope that that is an interim
solution. I should like there to be a regulatory framework separate
from the Department. As others have said, a new legal services board
will provide useful opportunities, but in the long term I should like
to see more
independence.</p><p><a name="06060865000654">A number
of my hon. Friends have mentioned the Barker case and asbestosis. I am
impressed by what the Minister has said publicly today and privately to
colleagues who have pressed her on the issue: that the Government will
try to establish a process to resolve it. 
<br><notus-date day="8" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>8 Jun 2006 : Column 469</b><br>This is a matter of life and death. It is also a matter of simple
fairness and simple justice. I cannot understand the House of Lords
judgment, and I hope that we will act with equity and fairness to
resolve the issue. Although I probably do not need to do so, I seek an
assurance from the Minister that over the next few days, and certainly
in the next fortnight, we shall be able to engage in discussions about
the process or mechanism that is
required.</p><p><a name="06060865000655">I
mentioned pleural plaques earlier. I accept that the litigation is now
further down the road. The Court of Appeal has put many hundreds of
cases on hold and the claimants are waiting for them to go to the House
of Lords, but I know people who are suffering with pleural plaques, I
know the history of payment over 20 years, and I know that&#151;as
with the Barker case&#151;the law is changing fundamentally for
working people. I hope that we will act with social justice again to
resolve the cases of people who, through no fault of their own and
through the fault of their employers, have been disadvantaged and put
at risk.</p><p><a name="06060865000656">This is a
good Bill, which has been improved in the other place. It is concerned
with the essential elements of looking after claimants and workers. I
am conscious, however, that we must work hard to improve it even more.

their graciousness in accepting

touch briefly on what society is in danger of losing. I shall end with
a few ideas for strengthening the Bill.</p><p><a name="06060865000659">When I introduced my private

keep us informed&#151;and we are delighted that the Government have
introduced the
Bill.</p><p><a name="06060865000663">The truth is
that a huge amount of damage is being caused. In 2003, the Central
Council of Physical Recreation and Sport England conducted the largest
survey ever in the field of volunteering in sport and outdoor
activities. It listed eight factors that were damaging volunteering,
top of which came</p><a name="06060865000991"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;risk,
fear of blame and the threat of
litigation.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06060865000664">More
recently, the Scout Association carried out a survey of 1,100 scout
masters. It stated
that</p><a name="06060865000992"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;69 per cent. agree
or strongly agree that the recruitment of new volunteers is made more
difficult because of fears of being sued...a staggering 92 per
cent. agree or strongly agree that risk-aversion is affecting the range
and nature of activities being offered to young
people&#148;,</p></ul><p><a name="06060865000665">at a time when
30,000 youngsters cannot get into the scouts because they do not have
enough scout masters, and when almost twice that number are waiting to
join the girl guides for the same
reason.</p><p><a name="06060865000666">That leads me
to my second point. Why does that state of affairs exist, or is it just
a perception&#151;an urban myth? I believe that it is a reality,
given the large number of cases that have been fed to me. We sent a
dossier of them to Baroness Ashton, who was very courteous about
meeting us; however, we were told that, because her Department did not
have law reports on those cases, even though we had given the dates,
the courts and the names of the judges, it could not comment on
them.</p><p><a name="06060865000667">I then read the
proceedings on the Bill in another place. Lord Goodhart, speaking for
some of the Liberal Democrats&#151;although not, it seems, I am
relieved to hear, for the Liberal Democrat Front Benchers in the
Commons&#151;said:</p><a name="06060865000993"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;There are, of course,
reports of cases where damages have been awarded to people who are the
authors of their own misfortunes. It is difficult to find authentic
texts for these judgments and I suspect that some of them are urban
myths. Some of them are reported; some were decided before the law was
clarified in the Tomlinson case; and some are simply bad decisions,
which are unavoidable in any legal system.&#148;&#151;[<i> Official

Parliament is: is a pattern developing, or not?</p><p><a name="06060865000669">Six days after Lord
Goodhart&#146;s speech, and while the Bill was still before another
place, a court case took place in Manchester. It was one of many cases
inflicted on the scouts while the Bill was being debated in the Lords.
The scouts&#146; legal adviser
said:</p><a name="06060865000994"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;I attach
a note of a recent case in which the Scout Association lost following
an injury to a brownie attending a scout panto...chairs were set out in
the village hall and the brownie was injured on allegedly sharp piece
of metal protruding from one of the chairs...Apart from
individually inspecting every chair with considerable resource
implications endangering the running of such an event it is hard to see
what more the group could have done. To add insult to injury the Judge
awarded the claimant twice our counsel&#146;s valuation of the claim
and 20 per cent. more than the claimant asked
for!&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06060865000670">It cost the
association
&#163;15,000.</p><p><a name="06060865000671"><b><a name="06060865001432">Mr.
Beith:</b> Does the hon. Gentleman think that that claim would
have failed if clause 1 had been enforced?</p><br><notus-date day="8" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>8 Jun 2006 : Column 471</b><br><p><a name="06060865000672"><b><a name="06060865001433">Mr.
Brazier:</b> Yes, and I will explain why in a moment. I am
clear that clause 1 does change the law.</p><p><a name="06060865000673">Judge Tetlow presided over the
Manchester case that I mentioned. In summing up, he said:</p><a name="06060865000674"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;It follows there was a jagged
edge which should not have been present in an area likely to be
inhabited by children. Something had gone wrong. I do not think the
defendant can avail itself by relying on the licensing officer&#146;s
inspection. The defendant set out the chairs and was in a position to
remove any chair that was broken or defective. The system obviously
went wrong for this chair to slip through the net.&#148; Actually,
the chair was never found but, on the balance of probabilities, it was
decided that a defective chair was the cause.</p></ul><p><a name="06060865000675">&#147;It presented a reasonably
foreseeable risk of injury and should have been removed. I therefore
find that the defendant failed to take reasonable steps to ensure the
reasonable safety of the
claimant.&#148;</p><p><a name="06060865000676">The
point is that these chairs and the premises had been checked by the
scoutmasters, and the licensing officer from the council had done a
safety check, too. In the end, the judge&#146;s view was that an
additional and burdensome extra check should have been carried out; a
check of every chair.</p><p><a name="06060865000677">There could not be a clearer
example of something to which clause 1 would have applied. The clause
asks whether or not, by taking precautions against a risk, we could
prevent a desirable activity from being undertaken or, more
importantly, whether we could discourage persons from undertaking
functions. The one thing about which the Scout Association, the Girl
Guides and all the other groups to whom we have talked are clear is
that anyone who has been hauled through a case like this as a
scoutmaster, guide leader or whatever almost invariably leaves the
Scouts or Guides and so do a lot of their
friends.</p><p><a name="06060865000678"><b><a name="06060865001434">David
Howarth:</b> First, for Lord Goodhart&#146;s sake, will the
hon. Gentleman place in the Library the documentation he has about the
case so that, at a later stage, we can all read what the judge said in
full? Obviously there is no time in a Second Reading debate to go
through the whole
judgment.</p><p><a name="06060865000679">The test in
clause 1 is the existing law; the precaution that it is said the
defendant should have taken is tested against its cost and its
benefits. There is no change brought in by clause 1 that would affect
the case that he has mentioned. The problem is the way in which it was
applied by the judge, but that cannot be changed by having a new
statute.</p><p><a name="06060865000680"><b><a name="06060865001435">Mr.
Brazier:</b> I half agree with the hon. Gentleman. Without
exception, all the cases have come from the last 12 or 13 years; not a
single case arose before 1993, and we have had a flood since. There has
been a change of interpretation that has had nothing to do with
anything that Parliament has done. That is true, but crucially, by
spelling the point out&#151;we can get into semantics as to whether
it is a change in the law or not&#151;there is a real chance that the
lower courts will take this on board. Tomlinson was an excellent
judgment but it dealt with a rather narrow point about an individual
who was behaving extremely recklessly. I hope that this measure will
embrace a wider range of cases, as I have tried to
describe.</p><br><notus-date day="8" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>8 Jun 2006 : Column 472</b><br><p><a name="06060865000681"><b><a name="06060865001436">Lembit
&#214;pik:</b> Does the hon. Gentleman agree that it is
evident that the individuals in the case he mentioned were not
protected by the law? Something went wrong; the courts ignored all the
guidance given to them. Some of my hon. Friends here do not completely
agree with clause 1, but in Committee we must recognise that there is
an imperative to put some legal protection in place to prevent the kind
of outrage that the hon. Gentleman has just
described.</p><p><a name="06060865000682"><b><a name="06060865001437">Mr.
Brazier:</b> Exactly.</p><p><a name="06060865000683">Let me give
details of a second case, from a large dossier; the Gaping Gill
incident. In summary, a scout troop visited a beauty spot and some
parents were invited to come along as additional supervisors. On the
way, a little boy asked a scoutmaster if he could investigate a cave in
the side of a hill that they had passed. The scoutmaster said no, that
it was dangerous and explained why. The boy asked his father, who said
yes, took him to the entrance and gave him a lighter. The poor little
boy walked over a 300 ft cliff to his death. His elder brother was
serving in the troop.</p><p><a name="06060865000684">Two years
later, when the boy&#146;s elder brother left the troop, the father
sued the Scout Association. The scoutmaster was declared to be
negligent in a British court of law on the grounds that having spotted
an &#147;urban parent&#148;&#151;a parent from an urban
environment&#151;the scoutmaster should have taken more active steps
to prevent the boy from getting into the cave because he could not be
expected to understand the
danger.</p><p><a name="06060865000685">Let me make it
clear that not only the scouts furnished us with cases. We have had
them from the guides, the mountaineering community and the Royal
Yachting Association, as well as one from a
school.</p><p><a name="06060865000686">We must
understand how much is at stake and how much damage is being done to
our country. The Duke of Edinburgh, who is the patron of the Campaign
for Adventure, has said in
public:</p><a name="06060865000995"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;The
danger for society is not that people take risks, it is that they do
not take risks because they see risk as entirely negative rather than
the very positive thing it really can be and most often
is.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06060865000687">By coincidence,
almost the same month, the Lancashire education advisers issued a
statement:</p><a name="06060865000996"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Many
Duke of Edinburgh Award Schemes and other providers of diverse
educational opportunities are having trouble
recruiting&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06060865000688">volunteers</p><a name="06060865000997"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;due
to fear of unfair
litigation.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06060865000689">Sir Chris
Bonington, who addressed the inaugural meeting of the all-party group,
said:</p><a name="06060865000998"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;A sense
of adventure is vital for children growing up and society as a
whole.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06060865000690">If
young people are not offered opportunities to take risks and to learn
to expand their horizons in a properly organised and structured
environment, the less enterprising will turn into couch potatoes while
the more enterprising will get out and make their own opportunities for
risk. We see that in joy riding, people playing chicken on railway
lines and a string of other unhappy
events.</p><p><a name="06060865000691">I rather agree
with the comments made by the right hon. Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed
(Mr. Beith) on balancing risk. Those are the risks we have to balance
with the damage we are doing to voluntary organisations, and indeed
professional ones, that provide adventure training and sport.</p><br><notus-date day="8" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>8 Jun 2006 : Column 473</b><br><p><a name="06060865000692">Let me spend
my last couple of minutes looking at ways in which we could strengthen
the Bill. I want to make four points, two of which, funnily enough,
were put forward by the Field Studies Council. First, there is perhaps
something to be said&#151;this is the only part of the speech made by
the hon. Member for Hendon (Mr. Dismore) that I agreed
with&#151;for a clearer definition of &#147;desirable
activities&#148;. Lord Hunt made an excellent stab at
this.</p><p><a name="06060865000693">The basic point,
if the House will forgive me for repeating it again, is that there is
no contradiction between saying, on the one hand, that there is no
compensation culture and accepting, on the other, that in this specific
area&#151;a tiny proportion of all cases, involving adventure
training and sport&#151;real damage is being done. The American
experience proves it. America is the worst country in the world for a
compensation culture, but there is specific protection for sport and
adventure training in the law of many American states and a much higher
burden of proof. I would be happy to have provision restricted to
sport, adventure training, physical recreation and educational
purposes, or something similar. I leave it to others wiser than me to
draft the
clause.</p><p><a name="06060865000694">My
second point is that, having restricted the provision, we really should
say &#147;shall&#148; rather than &#147;may&#148;. I entirely
understand the objection to that made by the Minister in the courteous
hearing that she gave us, but that objection would surely be coped with
if we had a more restrictive definition of &#147;desirable
activities&#148;. As time is short, I shall move on from that
point.</p><p><a name="06060865000695">The third issue
concerns landowners and farmers; there was a close vote in another
place on it. The plain fact is that all organisations such as the
scouts and the guides, as well as those that provide for schools that
want to visit farms, can operate only with the good will of the farming
community. I cannot see why&#151;this does not have to follow the
exact wording promoted in the House of Lords&#151;we cannot have an
element of clause 1, or indeed an extra clause, that specifically
provides comparable comfort for those who make their land available for
such activities.</p><p><a name="06060865000696">The
fourth and final point was also made by my hon. Friend the Member for
North-East Hertfordshire (Mr. Heald). We must consider the
possibility of including a specific measure to address the issue of
those who disobey instructions or behave manifestly recklessly. As my
hon. Friend pointed out, that is important for people who run leisure
parks and provide opportunities for youngsters to do adventurous things
professionally, but it is even more so for those who do so in a
voluntary context. If somebody deliberately sets out to disobey an
instruction and brings a serious accident on themselves, that should be
a stronger defence than it appears to be now, as the Gaping Gill
incident all too sadly illustrates. If somebody is drunk or drugged,
the same point should apply. I am glad that the Field Studies Council
supports that
move.</p><p><a name="06060865000697">This
is a good measure&#151;I have confined my remarks to the first two
clauses&#151;and it is one that most hon. Members support. I strongly
urge the Government to consider strengthening the first clause so that
it provides even clearer protection for those who provide
opportunities, frequently on an unpaid basis, for
young people to test the boundaries and grow as individuals in a
structured 
<br><notus-date day="8" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>8 Jun 2006 : Column 474</b><br>way that is not necessarily safe, but is sensibly balanced in terms of
risk. That is what they need if they are to grow up without feeling the
need to take the sort of risks that none of us wants to see them
take.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="06060865001054">4.6
pm</h5><p><a name="06060865000698"><b><a name="06060865001438">Mr.
Michael Clapham (Barnsley, West and Penistone) (Lab):</b> I
shall confine my remarks to part 2 of the Bill. I take on board what my
hon. Friend the Member for Hendon (Mr. Dismore) said about clause 1 and
I note the controversy. I shall examine the results of the
consideration in Committee of that clause, but overall it is a good
Bill.</p><p><a name="06060865000699">My hon. Friend
the Member for Sherwood (Paddy Tipping) made the point about the
exemption. One has to make a clear distinction between trade unions and
claims farmers, and look at the legal services that trade unions have
provided over time. They have pushed the boundaries of the law and in
so doing have made society a fairer place. Trade unions and their legal
services have made civil society a better society.</p><p><a name="06060865000700">Part 2 will
bring structure and regulation where there was none previously and it
is essential that we are able to provide regulation of claims farmers.
My hon. Friend the Minister suggested that there were some 500 claims
farmers, and I suggest that half of them have come into being since the
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease scheme started under the coal
health scheme. At present, there are 582,000 registered claims for
COPD, 170,000 registered vibration white finger claims and 15,000
posthumous vibration white finger claims. That is 767,000 claims, and
many of the claims farmers saw the opportunity to exploit the
community.</p><p><a name="06060865000701"><b><a name="06060865001439">Mr.
Heald:</b> I agree with the hon. Gentleman about claims
farmers, but I know that he is a member of the National Union of
Mineworkers. It has been reported that a firm of solicitors acting for
the NUM</p><a name="06060865000999"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;advised miners
to sign an agreement letting the NUM &#145;fund&#146; their legal
claims&#151;for chronic chest diseases and a crippling hand
condition...in return for paying part of their eventual
compensation to the
union.</p></ul><a name="06060865001000"><ul><p class="tabletext">The miners were
not told that in reality the Government, not the NUM, was paying the
legal costs&#148;.</p></ul><p><a name="06060865000702">How can the
hon. Gentleman justify not regulating a union that behaves like that?
It is disgraceful.</p><p><a name="06060865000703"><b><a name="06060865001440">Mr.
Clapham:</b> I cannot justify the fact that the solicitors to
which the hon. Gentleman has referred did not provide the expected
standard of professional advice. They should have advised claimants
that they did not need to make the payment that was requested when they
signed the form.</p><p><a name="06060865000704"><b><a name="06060865001441">Mr.
Heald:</b> The union was
responsible.</p><p><a name="06060865000705"><b><a name="06060865001442">Mr.
Clapham:</b> It was the solicitors who were at fault, not the
union. Trade unions and their legal services have worked to provide a
better society. I do not know which area of the NUM was involved in the
case to which the hon. Gentleman refers, but I presume that it was in
Yorkshire or the north-east. I maintain that the solicitors involved
did not advise clients properly, and so failed to provide the proper
service.</p><br><notus-date day="8" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>8 Jun 2006 : Column 475</b><br><p><a name="06060865000706"><b><a name="06060865001443">Mr.
Heald:</b> The firm of solicitors involved in the case was
Raleys, and the NUM apparently took &#163;10 million out of the
compensation awarded to miners. How can that possibly mean that unions
should not be
regulated?</p><p><a name="06060865000707"><b><a name="06060865001444">Mr.
Clapham:</b> As I said, there is a clear distinction between
trade unions and claims farmers. The solicitor in the case that we are
discussing failed to give the expected standard of professional
service. Payments were made to the trade union, which had asked its
solicitors to ensure that a form of authority was signed by claimants.
I do not excuse that, but the solicitors should have explained that
claimants could go to another firm of solicitors that did not seek
payment. The fact that that was not explained makes the solicitors
culpable.</p><p><a name="06060865000708">There is a
very big difference between claims farmers and trade unions, as I shall
explain by reference to a couple of cases in my constituency. Lots of
elderly people live there, and many are the widows of miners. One lady,
Mrs. Leadbeater, was approached by a claims farming organisation using
a name that gave the impression that it was linked to the trade union
movement or to the Coal Industry Social Welfare Organisation. That is a
common practice, and one of which I hope that my hon. Friend the
Minister is aware. </p>

<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060608/debtext/60608-0442.htm"/>


<p><a name="06060865000709">In
this instance, the claims farmer called itself the Miners Welfare
Compensation Agency Ltd. It approached Mrs. Leadbeater about her claim,
and she thought that she was dealing with a legitimate organisation
related in some way to CISWO. The agency took the claim and passed it
to a firm of solicitors in Manchester called Lopian Wagner. When the
claim was settled, Mrs. Leadbeater found that &#163;9,000 had been
deducted from her damages and paid on to the claims
farmer.</p><p><a name="06060865000710">When a claims
farmer works with a solicitor, a very complex situation is created. I
and my hon. Friend the Member for Barnsley, Central (Mr. Illsley) got
involved in the case and, with the help of one of the BBC&#146;s
local political programmes, we forced the solicitors involved to pay
back the money. We advised Mrs. Leadbeater to take her case to another
solicitor, which she did. She took action against the original
solicitors through the Law Society, and the matter eventually went
before a Law Society disciplinary committee. As a result, that firm of
solicitors were fined and had to pay &#163;1,800 for the trauma that
it had caused to my constituent.</p><p><a name="06060865000711">Another example from my
constituency involved a company called Zuco Legal Ltd. As often
happens, that company came into being simply to exploit problems in
mining communities. It garnered 5,000 claims, and then wrote around to
various firms of solicitors. One of those firms was Towells of
Wakefield, which passed to me the letter that it received from
Zuco.</p><p><a name="06060865000712">Zuco succeeded
in selling on the claims that it had gathered, although I emphasise
that Towells would have nothing to do with the proposal. Zuco sold
those claims on at &#163;400 or &#163;500 per claim, although we do
not know the exact figure. It made &#163;2.25 million and then
disappeared from the scene. That is the sort of problem that has
occurred in mining communities.</p><br><notus-date day="8" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>8 Jun 2006 : Column 476</b><br><p><a name="06060865000713">I hold to the point that there
is a clear difference between claims farmers and trade unions. I accept
that some trade unions may have behaved less well than one would have
expected, but that does not alter the fact that, in the case mentioned
by the hon. Member for North-East Hertfordshire (Mr. Heald), it was the
solicitor who failed to provide the level of service generally expected
of a solicitor.</p><p><a name="06060865000714"><b><a name="06060865001445">Mr.
Beith:</b> I have great respect for the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s work, but he cannot escape the fact that, in respect
of the money that arrived in the NUM&#146;s accounts, it is not
sufficient to say that the solicitor should have told union members
about it. The NUM knew that its members were getting that money, so it
should have told them as well.</p><p><a name="06060865000715"><b><a name="06060865001446">Mr.
Clapham:</b> Let me deal with that point. The right hon.
Gentleman may not be aware that, as my hon. Friend the Member for
Bassetlaw (John Mann) has mentioned before, a deal was done with the
Union of Democratic Mineworkers, which had a separate arrangement. It
was not offered to other trade unions in the industry, though it was
offered later when some trade unions had abandoned their in-house legal
services. Consequently, certain areas of the NUM went into an
arrangement with solicitors whereby a payment would be passed from them
back to the NUM on the basis that a form of authority would first be
completed. I would have thought that, in that context, the onus was on
the solicitor acting for the trade union to advise the client that he
could go down the street to a firm of solicitors that would not charge
him. The fact that the solicitors did not do that makes them culpable.
It is not the trade union, but the solicitors who are at fault. We must
also understand the reason why the problem came about. It happened, as
I said, because of preferential treatment being given to some miners
unions and not to
others.</p><p><a name="06060865000716">Moving on to
part 2, its purpose is to bring some form of regulation to claims
farmers. Where the claimant has a relationship with a trade union, we
have been able to ensure that the Law Society acts for them. I have
referred many complaints to the Law Society, most of which were dealt
with, bringing redress to claimants who could claim back the money held
by law firms to pay for the services provided by the claims farmer. I
continue to hold to my point that there is a clear distinction between
the trade unions and claims farmers. One or two trade unions may not
have provided the service that they should have, but that should not be
used to tarnish the whole trade union movement. In my estimation, the
trade union movement has been a force for
good.</p><p><a name="06060865000717">I now come on to
the Barker case and the Minister&#146;s comments about it. It is
essential to overturn the Barker judgment and to go back to the law as
established in the Fairchild case. In that case, it was clearly
established that the responsible employer or insurer had to pay full
damages to claimants suffering from exposure to asbestos and
mesothelioma. I believe that we must return to that principle and hope
that the Minister will table a Government amendment in Committee to
achieve it.</p><p><a name="06060865000718">There has
been a marked increase in mesothelioma claims over the last 40
years.</p><br><notus-date day="8" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>8 Jun 2006 : Column 477</b><br><p><a name="06060865000719">For example, in 1966, there were just 153
claimants; today, there are almost 2,000 diagnoses of mesothelioma
cancer each year, and the prediction is that the number will increase.
The Health and Safety Executive&#146;s latest projection is that it
is likely to peak in about 2015, reach a plateau and then taper away by
2050. However, one authority&#151;an investigative journalist, a man
by the name of Peter Martin, who wrote an article in <i> The Sunday
Times</i><i> Magazine</i> of 16 May 2004&#151;has estimated from his
research that 186,000 deaths are likely between 2000 and 2050, as a
result of exposure to asbestos. So it is essential that we return to
the law as set by the Fairchild ruling.</p><p><a name="06060865000720">A little earlier in an
intervention on my hon. Friend the Member for Manchester, Central (Tony
Lloyd), I referred to the fact that, under the Barker decision, people
could not make a claim under the Pneumoconiosis etc. (Workers&#146;
Compensation) Act 1979, and I did so because of a legal opinion that I
received by e-mail from a QC by the name of Allan Gore, who practises
at 12 King&#146;s Bench Walk. I shall read the pertinent part for the
Minister:</p><a name="06060865001001"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;In
Barker no answer is offered to the question. But if fair in Fairchild,
why is it not fair now? Surely the answer cannot simply depend on what
was argued in each case? Victims will now obtain only partial damages
in many cases. This leaves cases outside the 1979 Act so that safety
net is not
available.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06060865000721">That is why I
have referred to the fact that redress under the 1979 Act would not be
available, but the Minister has been advised that it would be
available.</p><p><a name="06060865000722">I have no
doubt that the Government could say that redress is available under the
1979 Act for claimants to make such claims, but I can understand the
logic that has decided that the 1979 Act is not available for that
purpose. One of the planks of the Barker decision was that, if people
were unable to identify one of the employers for whom they worked,
their damages would be reduced accordingly. The 1979 Act provides for
claims to be made where an employer has either gone out of business or
cannot be traced, or there is no insurer. So it logically follows that,
given the Barker decision, there could be no claim under the 1979 Act.
If that is the legal decision, the Government must ensure that the
route to redress under the 1979 Act stays
open.</p><p><a name="06060865000723">Overall, this is
a good Bill. It will deal effectively with claims farmers and allow us
to introduce some regulation and order, and by doing so, we will avoid
people being exploited in the way that they have been exploited in
mining
communities.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="06060865001055">4.23

Wright (Rugby and Kenilworth) (Con):</b> I declare an interest
as a non-practising barrister, although not in the field of personal
injury or negligence. I want to say a few words about part 2, which I
welcome, and then to say a little more about part 1. I am certain that
part 2 is an entirely appropriate and necessary measure, which will
introduce some consistency and ensure that claims farmers are treated
in the same way as lawyers and insurers. That is entirely welcome. Like
my hon. Friend the Member for North-East Hertfordshire (Mr. Heald), I
hope that that there will be full consistency, and that trade unions
will be included in the general consensus.</p><p><a name="06060865000725">As the House has heard, the
Constitutional Affairs Committee, of which I am a member, has
considered 
<br><notus-date day="8" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>8 Jun 2006 : Column 478</b><br>the Bill in some detail and concluded in its investigation that there is
no compensation culture. There is broad agreement not only about that,
but about the fact that there is a perception of a compensation
culture. In my view, that is almost as bad. That perception is
widespread and profoundly damaging, as other hon. Members have said.
Claims management companies have contributed substantially to that
perception, and that is one of the many good reasons for regulating
their behaviour. The Government wish to go further to address the
apparent perception that there is a compensation culture&#151;and
that brings me to part 1 of the Bill.</p><p><a name="06060865000726">There is no doubt that the
perception of a compensation culture must be challenged and changed,
because it is doing a great deal of damage. Of course it is right that
if somebody suffers injury or loss as a result of negligence they
should receive compensation for their loss. That is clear, and it is
the law, but it seems to me that a sense that there is no longer any
such thing as a straightforward accident for which no one is to blame,
and that someone is always to be held financially accountable, is
corrosive.</p><p><a name="06060865000727">It is
clear that people are not rushing to the courts to pursue claims. That
is what the evidence shows us, but it is also clear that many of those
who operate voluntary organisations and the like still have a profound
fear that they might do that, and that fear has to be addressed by the
House. That fear is important because it inhibits activities which are
not only enjoyable, as my hon. Friend the Member for Canterbury (Mr.
Brazier) has described, but can be extremely valuable for the economy.
That is important, because clause 1 is about persuading people that the
position is as the Government argue it to be.</p><p><a name="06060865000728">The law does not prohibit
someone from operating a voluntary organisation or running a scout
troop or adventure training organisation or anything like it, but the
law will consider someone&#146;s behaviour, and if it is reasonable
and they have taken appropriate measures to ensure that risks are
limited, they will not be liable. However, that is not the perception.
The perception is that if people run an event, they may be liable. That
is important, because the effect is difficult to measure. When we look
at the figures, we can see whether accident claims have gone up or
down. That is quantifiable, but we cannot quantify the things that do
not happen&#151;all the decisions taken by teachers not to run a
school trip, or by youth club organisers not to undertake a potentially
dangerous activity that they fear may leave them liable to legal
action. There is an area of undisclosed and undeterminable activity
that is not happening, and that is the real root of the problem.
</p><p><a name="06060865000729">There is no doubt
that that non-activity is real. This is a genuine and far-reaching
problem. I do not want, and I am sure that other hon. Members do not
want, to live in a society where in some activities that our children
pursue in their education it is made impossible for them to fail, while
they are told that other activities are too risky for them even to try.
If we pursue that sort of scenario, we will discourage our potential
entrepreneurs and scientists from trying the type of activities that
inevitably involve risk, but without which progress cannot be made in a
competitive economic 
<br><notus-date day="8" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>8 Jun 2006 : Column 479</b><br>environment. That is the kind of Britain that I fear we are moving
towards, not because of a reality but because of a
perception.</p><p><a name="06060865000730">I support
wholeheartedly the Government&#146;s intention and aspiration to
address that perception, but I have severe doubts whether clause 1 is
the way in which we should go about doing so. My basic principle is
that if we can do something better without making extra legislation, we
should do so. That is something that will be explored as the Bill
progresses through the House. I wonder whether the Government can
achieve what they, quite properly, want to achieve other than by
constructing something like clause 1. Clause 1, as the Government have
made perfectly clear, restates the law. In their view it does not
change the law, although I appreciate that some hon. Members disagree
with that assessment. The Government believe that clause 1 is about
expressing the law more clearly and making clear to everyone who has an
interest in this area of the law exactly what it
says.</p><p><a name="06060865000731">What the
Government really need to do is to get that message across to the
people likely to be affected by the law, but the way to do it is not
with a clause in a new piece of legislation, which will hardly come
immediately to the attention of people engaged in voluntary activities,
or who run scout troops, adventure training or anything of that nature.
Those people will want to hear directly from the Government what their
responsibilities are and what they are liable for. That is a
communication job; it is an exercise in getting the message across. It
is&#151;dare I say it?&#151;a public relations exercise. If there
was ever a job for the Government, that must be it. However, given all
the problems that have been outlined about clause 1, all the
difficulties of defining precisely what a desirable activity is and all
the possible downsides that we have discussed, could we not do things
in another way? I hope that in the course of the debate we shall
consider that point more
carefully.</p><p><a name="06060865000732">To be fair
to the Government, they have accepted that they cannot simply rely on
clause 1 to get across the message that the compensation culture is a
myth and that people should not change their behaviour as a result of
that myth. There is clearly much more to be done. In an intervention on
my hon. Friend the Member for North-East Hertfordshire, I referred to
activities that are not covered by clause 1 and which relate to the
Health and Safety Executive. There is much work to be done in that
regard. If the Government are to succeed in persuading those who
operate in the voluntary sector and elsewhere that they are not liable
to penalties, in the form either of prosecution by the HSE or of a case
brought by someone injured in an accident, they will have to consider
not only the civil law but also the criminal law, and ensure that the
HSE gives clear guidance about what people are safely able and entitled
to do.</p><p><a name="06060865000733">I hope that
the Government will go further and consider the work of the HSE and
make sure that the guidance it issues is clear, and does not change
behaviour in undesirable
ways.</p><p><a name="06060865000734"><b><a name="06060865001448">Mr.

<br><notus-date day="8" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>8 Jun 2006 : Column 480</b><br>Friend suggests. A farmer in my village used to give up two days to
display lambs to young children&#151;one to raise money for the
parish church and the other to raise money for the local hunt. He can
now do neither, because the HSE warned him that the children might
catch a disease if they touched the lambs. That has had a devastating
effect on our small village, so how can we reach out to such
people?</p><p><a name="06060865000735"><b><a name="06060865001449">Jeremy
Wright:</b> I am grateful to my right hon. Friend, who makes a
valid point. Part of the difficulty is that the HSE appears to operate
on the premise that it must do whatever is necessary to reduce the
prospect of an accident almost to zero. That approach is fundamentally
flawed and, as many Members have said, although we should look for
methods of reducing risk, we must always accept that we cannot
eliminate it entirely. We must also accept that if we reduce to almost
nothing the chance that people&#151;especially young
people&#151;will engage in potentially risky activities, we shall
damage their development far more than the risk of an accident would.
The Government will have to look at the matter in a broader context
than that presented by the
Bill.</p><p><a name="06060865000736">It is important
that we recognise what is right about the Bill: it addresses the
long-overlooked issue of how to regulate the claims farming industry.
That is welcome and we shall make sure, as the Bill goes through
Committee, that those provisions work as well as possible. To achieve
that, the Government must avoid drawing attention away from their
primary purpose by leaving clause 1 as it is, because it may simply act
as an unwelcome distraction from what the Bill will, I hope, do
effectively.</p><p><a name="06060865000737">The
Government can address the perception that we have a compensation
culture, but they need to get their information transmission mechanisms
right, and to send the right messages through Departments, through the
HSE and through regulation of the claims farming industry that the
compensation culture is not a reality, and never can be. It would
distract us, and the individuals whom we are trying to help, to talk
incessantly about the sorts of legalistic problems that clause 1 throws
up. I hope that the Government will take those comments on board and
that the Bill can be improved still further as it progresses through
the House.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="06060865001056">4.35

Mann (Bassetlaw) (Lab):</b> I intend to ask a number of
questions of the Minister and the House, and I hope that people will
take them into consideration as the Bill progresses. I will address
each question by illustrating what I am talking about with an example
from the mother of all gravy trains, the scamming of money from miners.
I pay tribute to more than 1,000 of my constituents who have already
taken action&#151;many of them successfully&#151;against more than
35 firms of solicitors and a whole range of claims handlers.</p><p><a name="06060865000739">The first example involves a
claims handler called IDC. Many of my constituents signed a form that
said that IDC would pay the costs of the claim. It even contained a
clause about what would happen if the claimant deliberately misled the
company. In fact, the opposite happened. A firm of solicitors called
Gorman Hamilton got the claim from IDC and wrote to my constituents to
say:</p><br><notus-date day="8" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>8 Jun 2006 : Column 481</b><br><a name="06060865001002"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;You, as our client, are
liable for our costs but, as you know IDC Ltd have agreed to pay them
on your behalf.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06060865000740">That was not true. The
Government were paying the costs. It was a scheduled case. There were
never any costs being paid by IDC. Here we have a conspiracy between a
solicitor and a claims handler. My question for the Government is: what
will happen with that conspiracy if there are different agencies
regulating the claims handler and the solicitor? That is the nub of the
issue.</p><p><a name="06060865000741">I have some
minutes from the national marketing meeting of IDC. Oxley and Coward
solicitors, Park Hutchison solicitors, Marrons solicitors, Whittle
Robinson solicitors, and Russell Young solicitors were all at that
meeting. IDC went through the importance of knowing the needs of
solicitors and what they consider &#147;good referrals&#148;, of
looking at the screening processes and of the &#147;personal
touch&#148;. Mention is made of &#147;MTFS&#148; or &#147;make
them feel special&#148;. That is with reference to the clients.
Mention is also made
of:</p><a name="06060865001003"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;The
introduction of a theme to build on in order to provoke a response and
to attract and hold the favourable attention of the prospect whilst the
selling message is being
told.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06060865000742">There is a
discussion of whether to use a shotgun or a rifle approach to the
marketing of the product.</p><p><a name="06060865000743">The question of collusion
between solicitors and claims handlers is at the heart of the issue.
Under the heading of questions raised from the floor, the minutes
state:</p><a name="06060865001004"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;With
this strategy in place expect clients to cross from Union Solicitor to
IDC.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06060865000744">That was the aim of
that marketing meeting. The question of the two culprits together is
important.</p><p><a name="06060865000745">The second
example involves PR and Associates. Again, a number of my constituents
signed a common law claim form, headed &#147;Common Law
Claims&#148;. The offer was that the costs would be covered for a
common law claim, and the claimant would pay 15 per cent. plus VAT in
return. That sounds fair, but of course, those were not common law
claims, despite the fact the Kidd and Spoor Harper
said:</p><a name="06060865001005"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;In
accordance with... your Agreement...we have
deducted&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06060865000746">the fee to PR
and Associates from the claim. Here we have the solicitor doing the
work on behalf of the claims handler. There is a cast iron case against
the solicitor, but how will that be affected in terms of how the claims
handler is
regulated?</p><p><a name="06060865000747">The third
example involves Union and General Services. It is the same old thing.
The contract says that the company will pay the costs of the fee. This
time the firm of solicitors is called Robinson King, and &#163;3,284
was deducted in this particular case. The letter
states:</p><a name="06060865001006"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;you are funded
by Union &amp; General Services...I enclose a copy of the signed
agreement...I have forwarded this cheque on to Union &amp; General
Services who will deduct their...fee and provide you with a
cheque&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06060865000748">for the rest. How
will that be dealt with? Money has passed wrongly to a third
party.</p><p><a name="06060865000749">Separately,
Union and General Services, which was a limited liability company, has
gone into receivership. When we started to raise the issue, the company
was closed down. How will the regulation affect such a scam company,
which was set up by a Mr. Revell from Doncaster, a former union
official? It was a pretence to call the company Union and General
Services. Given 
<br><notus-date day="8" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>8 Jun 2006 : Column 482</b><br>that the company put itself into receivership, we would not be able to
take a common-law case against it to the small claims court because it
is no longer in existence. How will the ability of companies not to be
pursued be dealt
with?</p><p><a name="06060865000750">Another of my
constituents, Mrs. Beckett, went to Raleys, a firm of solicitors that I
have already named. She was
told:</p><a name="06060865001007"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;NUM funding is
available only through this
firm&#148;.</p></ul><p><a name="06060865000751">However, Mrs.
Beckett did not go through the NUM, but contacted Raleys directly by
using Yellow Pages. Despite that, she was
told:</p><a name="06060865001008"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;You are
of course at liberty to explore other types of funding arrangements,
however we cannot guarantee that they will protect you from the need to
pay any expenses or from the amount that your solicitor may recover
from your
compensation&#148;&#151;</p></ul><p><a name="06060865000752">not
true!</p><p><a name="06060865000753">I have a copy of
the kind of publicity that Raleys puts out from a brochure produced by
one of the health authorities. Raleys says, &#147;Millions won in
compensation,&#148; and asks miners to come forward, but the
publicity makes no mention of the NUM. However, when one goes to
Raleys, as did another of my constituents, Mr. Dunstan, the situation
becomes clearer. He was
told:</p><a name="06060865001009"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;If you
do not wish to take up the option of Union backing then it will be
necessary for us to consider alternative funding arrangements. If you
are not eligible for legal aid then it will be necessary to discuss
funding your case by either private funding or through a conditional
fee agreement.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06060865000754">However,
we should not forget&#151;the letter was written in 2000&#151;that
the Government were paying the
fees.</p><p><a name="06060865000755">The letter
continues:</p><a name="06060865001010"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;If
you choose to fund your claim on a private basis then you will be
liable for the costs and disbursements of this firm in dealing with
your claim. You will also be responsible for the opposition&#146;s
costs, should you
lose&#148;&#151;</p></ul><p><a name="06060865000756">not true;
it is a lie. The letter then sets out a statement on conditional fee
arrangements and
says:</p><a name="06060865001011"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Please
find enclosed a form of authority confirming the funding options which
you would
prefer.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06060865000757">The
TUC briefing for the debate makes the situation when dealing with
unions clear. The vast majority of unions are decent organisations that
deal with members who can get remedies in a range of ways. However,
Mrs. Beckett was not a member of a union and Mr. Dunstan was a retired
member. The situation was affecting non-members, not members, so
remedies available for members, ranging from the certification officer
to common law governed by statute, would not be available. Precisely
how would that be
addressed?</p><p><a name="06060865000758">Of course,
we have also heard about another union: the Union of Democratic
Mineworkers. I have lots of similar forms that contain such phrases
as:</p><a name="06060865001012"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;I will pay ...
a fee ... to cover the cost of pursuing this
Claim&#148;.</p></ul><p><a name="06060865000759">However, that
should not be the case. One of the dilemmas is that although the
majority of people went through solicitors, so the Law Society would be
involved, some did not. That is precisely why I intervened on the
Minister to ask about the Government&#146;s ongoing three agreements
with UDM Vendside. There are no solicitors involved and no consumer
right is available. The people involved have never been to court or had
dealings with solicitors 
<br><notus-date day="8" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>8 Jun 2006 : Column 483</b><br>before. Many of them are in their 80s and 90s, and their only remedy is
to go to court to get justice, but that does not appeal greatly to
people of that
age.</p><p><a name="06060865000760">There is far more
to the situation. I have a form from a Mrs. Cocker. The Vendside bit of
the form has been covered by a sticker for Walker and Co., which is not
known to my constituent. An individual employee of Vendside and the UDM
had set up a different company. That company then takes a cut. I know
that because I have a copy of the minutes of a UDM meeting in January
2002 between Beresfords solicitors, the UDM leader, Mr. Stevens, and
Clare Walker&#151;Walker and Co. The minutes explain in graphic
detail who gets what cut of the money. There is a range of information
detailing what Beresfords, Vendside and Clare Walker will be getting.
The minutes also cite a company called Melex that is being set up, 90
per cent. of which is owned by the Beresford
family.</p><p><a name="06060865000761">Letters
between Beresfords and the Law Society have come into my possession.
Beresfords has been asking, in essence, how it can get around the Law
Society rules on referral fees. They ask, &#147;Can we set up a third
party?&#148; They do not call it Melex, but Melex comes into
existence. Who should get paid? Obviously, the Beresford family get
some money, but so does Clare Walker. But it goes on, because then
there is the conditional fee arrangement, and insurance. In some cases,
Beresfords hands matters on to another firm of solicitors&#151;its
panel&#151;which themselves pay a fee back to Beresfords. In a
hearing loss claim, there could be five or six different deductions.
There is an amount for the ATE Insurance commission&#151;the minutes
say who is going to get a bit of that. There is the Melex money. There
are the vetting, administration and marketing
fees.</p><p><a name="06060865000762">That leads me to
my key point. It is very easy to set up new companies to get round the
guidelines. In other words, people say, &#147;It&#146;s not a
referral fee&#151;that&#146;s not allowed under Law Society rules.
It&#146;s a marketing fee.&#148; It is only when someone manages to

same work. Walker and Co. was doing the marketing; Vendside was doing
the marketing; Beresfords was doing the marketing. Oh, and there is
another firm, Indiclaim, which was doing the marketing as well. There
are lots of different people doing the marketing. We must ensure that
these dodges are not allowed.</p><p><a name="06060865000763">I understand that some of these
companies are now charging money for training. Training has nothing to
do with my constituents. There are different ways of skinning the cat
and getting the money. Another firm of solicitors, BRM, is paying
&#163;500 plus VAT to Indiclaim. Another one, Wake Smith, has done a
better deal, as it has to pay only &#163;300 plus VAT to Indiclaim.
My constituents have never heard of Indiclaim Ltd. They do not realise
that it is owned by one of the people running Vendside, which is owned
by the UDM. We must ensure that people cannot wriggle out of
regulation. It is essential that the Government use the opportunity of
their agreement with the UDM to look into the matter in graphic
detail.</p><p><a name="06060865000764">The Law

acceptable.</p><p><a name="06060865000766">It

David Jones (Clwyd, West) (Con):</b> I wish to declare an
interest as a member of the Law Society. Like Members on both sides of
the House I warmly welcome the Bill, particularly part 2, although I do
have reservations about part 1 which I will touch on

of the activities of these so-called claims farmers&#151;an
expression which appears to have supplanted the traditional
&#147;ambulance chasers&#148;&#151;is long overdue. Whether or
not there is a compensation culture in this country is a matter of
debate, and it has been debated today. The Better Regulation Task Force
took the view firmly that it was a myth, and certainly it appears that
costs in negligence actions in this country are considerably lower than
those in the United States, France, Germany, Australia or other major
jurisdictions. Nevertheless, there is, as appears to be widely
accepted, at least a perception of a compensation culture, and that is
having a significant and detrimental effect on the national life of
this country.</p><p><a name="06060865000769">The
compensation culture, if it is not a reality, appears to be something
that the claims farmers are aimed at creating. We have seen their
marketing campaigns. We have seen also their slogans, such as,
&#147;Where there is blame, there is a claim&#148;. These slogans
are clearly intended, aggressively, to encourage the pursuit of actions
for personal injury. Such advertising can frequently raise unrealistic
expectations in the minds of vulnerable people.</p><p><a name="06060865000770">Since legal aid was abolished
in 1999 for personal injury claims, the no-win, no- fee regime that has
replaced it has made it more difficult for potential litigants,
particularly those who are less sophisticated than others and therefore
more vulnerable, to obtain legal redress. It is unfortunate that it is
precisely those people&#151;more vulnerable potential
claimants&#151;whom the claim farmers seek to attract. Perhaps the
expression &#147;prey upon&#148; might be more
appropriate.</p>

<p><a name="06060865000771">I am sad to
say that the more vulnerable in our society find the prospect of
approaching a solicitor intimidating. They find the prospect of making
a free telephone call to a claims farmer a more attractive option. Once
the potential litigant is in the clutches of the claims farmer, it is
often difficult for them to get out.</p><p><a name="06060865000772">The abuses of claims farmers
have been catalogued this afternoon. As time is short and because other
Members wish to speak, I will not rehearse them. There is no doubt that
regulation of the industry is a matter of priority and one that is long
overdue. I congratulate the Government on bringing legislation
forward.</p><br><notus-date day="8" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>8 Jun 2006 : Column 485</b><br><p><a name="06060865000773">The activity of claims farmers
has its consequences. Their pursuit of the creation of a compensation
culture has created an increasingly risk averse society. We have heard
the stories of school teachers and scout leaders who have been
dissuaded from taking young people in their charge out on what would be
valuable and character-building expeditions.</p><p><a name="06060865000774">Many years ago, when I was
considerably younger, I used to go rock climbing. I did it because I
enjoyed the risk. When one is clinging 100 ft up on a rock face, it is
difficult to think of anything other than maintaining that position on
the rock face. I would not begin to pretend that I was in any sense a
Chris Bonington, but I enjoyed the experience. I was taken into the
mountains by a guide called Terry, but I wonder whether these days
Terry would be so willing to take me to the mountains. He has probably
heard about the culture of where there is blame, there is a claim and
he might well be dissuaded from doing so.</p><p><a name="06060865000775">I believe
that that is happening. We have heard from my hon. Friend the Member
for Canterbury (Mr. Brazier) of the experiences that have been related
to him. This is sad. Risk is a fact of life; we take risks every day.
Risk is good and it develops character. If we are being dissuaded from
taking risks by the activities of claims farmers, we need to deal with
the culture that they are
generating.</p><p><a name="06060865000776">I applaud
the aims of the Government in bringing forward part 1. I understand
what they are trying to do. They are trying to deal with the risk
aversion that has been built up. They are trying to provide what I
imagine is a statutory defence, based upon what they say is common law
as it now
exists.</p><p><a name="06060865000777">Clause 2 is an
extremely valuable component of the Bill. I congratulate Lord Hunt for
ensuring that the provision was introduced into the Bill. I similarly
congratulate the Government on accepting Lord Hunt&#146;s valuable
amendment and incorporating it into the Bill. It achieves a number of
things. It deals with the simple issue of courtesy. If someone has
caused damage or injury to another individual, in a courteous society
he should be encouraged to apologise. As we have heard, he is
frequently inhibited from doing so, because that may amount to an
admission.</p><p><a name="06060865000778">The
problem extends even further, as we have heard. The clause will give
insurers the opportunity to pay for a certain amount of treatment for
people who are injured. The fact that that treatment is paid for will
give considerable solace to the claimants but, in due course, it will
reduce the value of claims that are made and ultimately reduce
insurance premiums across the
board.</p><p><a name="06060865000779">I
am concerned, however, about clause 1. I applaud its aim of seeking to
ensure that the courts pay regard to the question of whether certain
steps should have been taken by defendants or whether it would be
unreasonable to expect them to take them. However, it is poorly drafted
and, if we are not careful, it will become a fertile source of
litigation in future. The application of the clause by the courts when
considering such cases is not mandatory but permissive. The word,
&#147;may&#148;, is used, but &#147;shall&#148;, is preferable,
because it would give the lower courts the guidance that they need,
ensuring that they consider the matters dealt with in the clause.
However, the drafting is loose&#151;there are references to
&#147;particular steps&#148; and &#147;a particular way&#148;,
but the 
<br><notus-date day="8" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>8 Jun 2006 : Column 486</b><br>glaring omission is the nature of &#147;a desirable activity&#148;.

important issue: it must be addressed in Committee, as the clause
requires significant improvement. Notwithstanding that reservation, I
applaud the Bill, which is long overdue. I welcome its introduction by
the Government, and I hope that, pursuant to its enactment, regulations
will be adopted and made law. If the House passes the
legislation&#151;and I hope that it does so&#151;it will do a great
service to some of the most vulnerable people in the

Roberta Blackman-Woods (City of Durham) (Lab):</b> I welcome
the Bill, as it tries to stem the development of a compensation culture
and deal with risk aversion. It seeks, too, to discourage and resist
bad or unwarranted claims while improving the system for people with a
valid compensation

welcome the fact that the Bill will establish a regulatory scheme to
control runaway claims management companies, but I share concerns with
the TUC about clauses 1 and 2. I thank the Government for their recent
statements acknowledging those issues, and I congratulate the Minister
on her opening speech, which addressed some of my concerns. The TUC is
worried that the wording of clause 1 requires a worker injured in a
&#147;desirable activity&#148; to prove a higher degree of
negligence than a worker who suffers the same injury in a different
activity, leading to the creation of a two-tier system in which workers
engaged in desirable activities receive one standard of care while
other workers receive a different one. The Government have said that
the clause will not alter the standard of care required of employers,
and I should be grateful if the Minister would confirm that. As other
hon. Members have mentioned, there are also concerns that it is not
entirely clear what constitutes a desirable activity. It would be
helpful if that could be clarified in
Committee.</p><p><a name="06060865000785">I support
the measures to restrict the compensation culture. Over the past five
years there have been many abuses by claims farmers. Many of those
companies actively encourage frivolous claims, combined with misleading
advertisements targeted at certain parts of the country&#151;areas
where there was heavy industry. I represent a constituency in Durham
where such companies have targeted their activities at former miners.
Still, even though we acknowledge that, we cannot and must not
compromise the protections afforded to our
workers.</p><p><a name="06060865000786">I share the
concern of the TUC that in clause 2 it would be wrong to group trade
unions with the ferocious claims management companies. I declare an 
<br><notus-date day="8" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>8 Jun 2006 : Column 487</b><br>interest. I am a member of the GMB and have been very active in the
union for some time. I wish to put that interest on
record.</p><p><a name="06060865000787">I have
recently been reading some of the speeches from the first parliamentary
Labour party a century ago. It is interesting that those early speeches
in the House were in defence of trade unions. They also reminded
Conservative Members of the advantages of belonging to a trade union.
It is extraordinary that we have to do that
today.</p><p><a name="06060865000788"><b><a name="06060865001455">Mr.
David Anderson (Blaydon) (Lab):</b> Does my hon. Friend agree
that the main drive from trade unions is against a compensation
culture? What we want is a culture at work in which people do not get
killed, maimed or damaged for life. Trade unions want to stop that
happening, which is the opposite of claims farmers, whose purpose is to
prey on people who have been through those
experiences.</p><p><a name="06060865000789"><b><a name="06060865001456">Dr.
Blackman-Woods:</b> I thank my hon. Friend and agree that, of
course, the primary activity of trade unions is to provide services for

claims.</p><p><a name="06060865000790"><b><a name="06060865001457">Mr.
Heald:</b> We all agree that trade unions do a useful job, but
is the hon. Lady seriously trying to justify what the NUM was doing in
the example given a moment ago by the hon. Member for Bassetlaw (John
Mann) and in the example that I gave? The union was doing exactly what
claims farmers do and taking a cut of the miners&#146; money. Is the
hon. Lady saying that that is fine and that we should not regulate
trade
unions?</p><p><a name="06060865000791"><b><a name="06060865001458">Dr.
Blackman-Woods:</b> I shall deal with that point in a moment.
We should not forget that unions are constantly working to prevent the
injuries that lead to claims in the first place. That is a very
important distinction between trade unions and claims farmers. Whereas
such companies choose to maximise profits, trade unions seek to
maximise protection for their members and my
constituents.</p><p><a name="06060865000792">Trade
unions represent more people making personal injury claims than any
other body, so it is important that unions are not undermined in the
eyes of their members by being lumped together with disreputable claims
companies. Trade unions do need regulation, and I shall deal with that.
The TUC has outlined a number of reasons why union legal services are
usually completely different from claims farmers. First, unions are
already heavily regulated. Secondly, when a member makes a claim, the
union will work for a fair settlement, often to keep medical and legal
costs to a minimum. Thirdly, as my hon. Friend the Member for Blaydon
(Mr. Anderson) said, unions&#146; primary task is to protect their
members. Fourthly, unions link the work that they do on compensation
with work on prevention. Fifthly, unions do not automatically steer
their members towards claiming compensation from their employer: many
union claims are made to state compensation funds, which is an entirely
legitimate task.</p><p><a name="06060865000793">It is for
those reasons that unions and certain not-for-profits need a specific
exemption in the Bill. I applaud 
<br><notus-date day="8" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>8 Jun 2006 : Column 488</b><br>the Government&#146;s statement that they will be afforded an
exemption in regulations, but it is important that in drawing those up
it is clear that trade unions have to operate within a code of
practice, and that if they act like claims farmers, they must be
treated as such. I am sure that all hon. Members would accept
that.</p><p><a name="06060865000794">I want to say a
few words about the Barker ruling on mesothelioma victims, which has
acted very much against their interests. The Government have called it
&#147;disappointing&#148; and pledged to consider a response to it.
I urge them to respond soon. In my opinion, the judgment fails to
recognise the realities of the problems that the victims are facing. It
is often impossible for them to show which particular employer caused
the disease, so several previous employers are thrown into the frame.
The former Association of British Insurers scheme dealt with that
complexity, but that is no longer possible. It is impractical for the
claimant to trace everyone concerned, especially because, as my hon.
Friend the Member for Hendon (Mr. Dismore) observed, they often have
only a short time to live after the disease has been
identified.</p><p><a name="06060865000795">It is
important that the Barker ruling does not influence the judgment that
we are awaiting on pleural plaques. Like many MPs who represent
ex-mining areas, several people who come to my surgeries suffer from
such diseases, and we must ensure that they are protected. I urge my
hon. Friend the Minister to take action as soon as
possible.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="06060865001059">5.7
pm</h5><p><a name="06060865000796"><b><a name="06060865001459">David
Howarth (Cambridge) (LD):</b> I should start by declaring an
interest, in that I still receive the occasional royalty for the books
on this subject that I wrote several years ago. However, I am not a
member of the Law Society or a barrister. I completely agree with the
speeches by my fellow Constitutional Affairs Committee members, my
right hon. Friend the Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed (Mr. Beith) and the
hon. Member for Rugby and Kenilworth (Jeremy Wright). Perhaps my speech
will be seen as a technical footnote to
theirs.</p><p><a name="06060865000797">I want to
concentrate on my worries about clause 1. Part 2 has been entirely
justified by the tales that we have heard today about the extraordinary
cases of claims farming in the mining areas. The problem with clause 1
concerns the perception that there is a high risk of being sued when it
is not justified. I hope that the people on the other side of the
debate who support clause 1 will accept that there are circumstances in
which it is justified for one person to be sued by another. When one
person is injured by another person&#146;s foot, there should be a
high risk of the person who did the injuring having to pay
compensation. That is just and right; it also serves the social purpose
of reducing the risk of unreasonable action causing harm.
</p><p><a name="06060865000798">The perception arises
from two sources&#151;legal error and excessive litigation. I will
deal with legal error in a moment, but everyone now seems to accept
that there is no compensation culture in the sense that the number of
claims being made in any part of society are rising fast&#151;they
are not. In fact, in most parts of the legal world the number of tort
claims is
falling.</p><p><a name="06060865000799">Interestingly,
there is evidence that the number of claims must have risen rather
dramatically between the 
<br><notus-date day="8" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>8 Jun 2006 : Column 489</b><br>late 1970s and the mid-1990s, when the figures became more widely
available&#151;between the Pearson report and the time when national
figures became available through the recovery unit. Oddly, during the
period when the number of claims apparently increased, no one seemed to
complain about the compensation culture, whereas in an era when the
number of claims is falling, complaints about it are
common.</p><p><a name="06060865000800"><b><a name="06060865001460">Mr.
Brazier:</b> Again, the hon. Gentleman is confusing the issue
of an overall compensation culture with the specific concern of the
public that worthwhile voluntary and sporting activities are being hit.
During that period of increase, there was not one of the bad cases to
which we have referred. All the cases that have affected the public in
a big way have arisen since the mid-1990s.</p><p><a name="06060865000801"><b><a name="06060865001461">David
Howarth:</b> That is an interesting point, which would benefit
from further research. It is difficult to know what was going on across
the board during that intermediate period. I have a different view: I
believe that what is really going on is that the insurance companies
want an excuse, or an explanation, for the vast increase in premiums
that they have been imposing during the more recent period. Instead of
pointing to their own problems in managing their investments, they
point to various claims and start talking about the compensation
culture.</p><p><a name="06060865000802">The
question is whether clause 1 by itself can deal in any useful way with
the perception of excessive litigation. The Government repeated today
that they are not trying to change the law, which raises the issue of
how the clause can make a difference. There is a particular problem in
respect of &#147;breach of statutory duty&#148;, which was added by
the House of Lords and which poses a grave danger that the Bill will
change the law, accidentally. &#147;Breach of statutory duty&#148;
is a very slippery phrase, covering a wide range of types of legal
action. It covers types of liability that do not quite constitute
negligence. Reference was made earlier to the test of reasonable
practicability. We are talking about something that is not strict
liability. I fear that clause 1 will accidentally apply to such
actions, and will reduce liability.</p><p><a name="06060865000803">The clause
attempts to bring statutory form to the law after Tomlinson. It came as
no great surprise to most lawyers that the Tomlinson case went the way
that it did. The law with which we are dealing dates back to
1946&#151;to the Daborn case, which involved the use of a
left-hand-drive ambulance during the war. I think that this answers the
points made by the hon. Member for Canterbury (Mr. Brazier). The
ambulance was involved in an accident, and the question that arose was
whether the fact that we were at war and needed all the ambulances we
could get, including American ambulances, could be taken into account
in determination of whether the way in which the ambulance had been
driven was negligent.</p><p><a name="06060865000804">The Court of Appeal decided
that there was no liability, because what could be taken into account
was what Lord Justice Asquith called</p><a name="06060865001015"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;the importance of the end to be
served by behaving this way or
that&#148;.</p></ul><p><a name="06060865000805">That has been the
law for 60 years.</p><p><a name="06060865000806">When judging
whether a precaution is required by the law of negligence, we must
judge whether the benefits of 
<br><notus-date day="8" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>8 Jun 2006 : Column 490</b><br>the extra precaution that it is claimed should have been
taken&#151;including the social benefits&#151;outweigh the costs.
There has been no change in the law in that regard. It seems to me that
the case raised by the hon. Member for Canterbury is simply a case in
which the established rule has been badly applied. The problem is that
there is no way in which an extra law can be passed to stop judges from
getting the existing law wrong in its application. We cannot make laws
about the application of the law. That is trying to do too much; it is
expecting too much out of statutes. The legal system is peopled by
human beings, who make mistakes. Error is inevitable, which is why
there are appeals. Error is inherent in a system where someone is
allowed sometimes successfully to sue somebody else for damage caused
by their fault. Occasionally the system will go wrong, and a case will
get through in which damages are unjustifiably paid. The only way to
prevent that is by having no liability at
all.</p><p><a name="06060865000807"><b><a name="06060865001462">Mr.
Brazier:</b> The fact is that these cases do not occur only
occasionally; the problem is that they keep on arising. The scouts are
one of the few voluntary organisations that have the resources to fight
such cases. If clause 1 is strengthened, as I and others have argued,
so that it states &#147;shall&#148; rather than
&#147;may&#148;, and it is clear that Parliament wants to point
specifically to sport and adventure training and related activities
such as educational trips, that will at least send a signal to judges
of the relevant calibre.</p><p><a name="06060865000808"><b><a name="06060865001463">David
Howarth:</b> I was about to come to the point about signals.
The claimed benefit of the clause is that it sends a signal, but the
question is: to whom? Who reads statutes? Not members of the general
public, but only lawyers and judges. If lots of lower court judges have
been ignoring the course of the law for the past 60 years, including
the most recent judgments of the highest court in the land, what extra
benefit will we get by passing a statute? Such people are just as
likely to ignore a statute as they are to ignore the House of
Lords.</p><p><a name="06060865000809">The other
supposed benefit is that the clause will fix the
law.</p><p><a name="06060865000810"><b><a name="06060865001464">Mr.
Heald:</b> Does the hon. Gentleman not agree that combining
the new declaration in clause 1 with the provision of educational
leaflets to the entire public sector would be a useful way of
proceeding?</p><p><a name="06060865000811"><b><a name="06060865001465">David
Howarth:</b> I agree that leaflets would be very useful, but I
cannot see what extra good having a new clause provides, apart from its
being a starting point for a press release. My main problem with the
Bill is that it seems to use statute as a press release; I would rather
use a press release than a
statute.</p><p><a name="06060865000812">Clause 1
makes the law less flexible. The idea that there is a benefit in fixing
the law is the opposite of the truth. The fundamental benefit of the
common law is that it uses ideas, rather than specific formulae of
words. Formulae can become out of date but ideas do not; putting things
in statute can make matters worse, not
better.</p><p><a name="06060865000813">The risk on
the other side of the equation is that there will be further
litigation. The hon. Member for Canterbury asked: how can that be,
given that this is supposed to be a protective clause? The answer is
that 
<br><notus-date day="8" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>8 Jun 2006 : Column 491</b><br>there will be more appeals, and more cases will be
fought in court in the first place, rather than settled, because the
law will be unclear. It must be made absolutely clear why that is the
case.</p><p><a name="06060865000814">The phrase
&#147;desirable activity&#148;, as contained in clause 1, is
ambiguous. Because of how the law currently works, there are two ways
in which an activity can be desirable. It can be desirable
privately&#151;people pay for it and therefore want it&#151;and
publicly, in the sense that it gives benefits to society as whole that
are not captured by individuals. The crucial question will be: does the
new phrase include either or both those types of benefit? It will take
a long time for that very basic point to get through the courts. The
benefits of the new clause, which are very minor, are outweighed by its
risks and costs. In terms of the law of negligence, putting forward
this new clause is itself negligent in the classic sense.</p><p><a name="06060865000815">I want to finish by making
three points, the first of which has already been made but needs to be
re-emphasised. The Health and Safety Executive is the bigger part of
the problem of the perception of a compensation culture, and of the
fear of organising voluntary events, than is the civil law. I do not
know whether the Bill is the right place in which to deal with that
problem, but it must be dealt
with.</p><p><a name="06060865000816"><b><a name="06060865001466">Mr.
Dismore:</b> The problem is not so much the HSE but the health
and safety industry, which perpetuates the myths about what is and is
not required by the law as a self-justifying raison
d&#146;être. The problem is not so much the HSE; it is all the
people who feed off the misinterpretations of the
requirements.</p><p><a name="06060865000817"><b><a name="06060865001467">David
Howarth:</b> That is right, but the HSE does do some rather
odd things in terms of its
targets.</p><p><a name="06060865000818">The insurance
industry has a vested interest in claiming that there is a compensation
culture and in trying to reduce the scope of liability. If that happens
in a sudden and unexpected way, the industry gets a windfall
profit.</p><p><a name="06060865000819">Finally,
central to my doubts about clause 1 is my view on statutes being used
as press releases. I do not think that the clause can do any good, but
I suppose it does do some good for the Government, who can say that at
least they are trying to do something about a real problem. However, it
will not change the real world. We are passing a law and I think the
law deserves more respect than
that.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="06060865001060">5.20

Wyatt (Sittingbourne and Sheppey) (Lab):</b> I have sent my
apologies for not being here for the Minister&#146;s opening remarks.
I want to register that I am a trustee of TimeBank, the largest
volunteer organisation in Britain. Before 6 July last year, we were
asked to do a volunteering exercise for the Olympics. We registered
over 70,000 volunteers before 6 July, when we won the games. We have
registered substantially more since. We will have approximately 85,000
to 100,000 volunteers in 2012. What correspondence has there been
between the Minister, the Department for Culture, Media and Sport and
Lord Coe on whether clause 1 will cover more than 100,000 volunteers?
The Olympics will be a high security

absolutely certain that, as it stands, they will be covered.</p><p><a name="06060865000821">I would
also like to register that I am an ambassador for the Girl
Guides&#151;I shall return to the movement in a moment&#151;and
that I am co-chair, with the hon. Members for Canterbury (Mr. Brazier)
and for Montgomeryshire (Lembit &#214;pik), of the all-party group on
the matter. The noble Baroness Ashton has given the group exceptional
time&#151;more than four hours&#151;to examine clause 1 in huge
detail. The Minister also saw us recently and I thank her for that. We
cannot complain about the time and access we have had, but we would
like the Government to think about &#147;will&#148; and
&#147;shall&#148;, which the hon. Member for Canterbury
mentioned.</p><p><a name="06060865000822">I
want to mention the iceberg effect. A dear friend who gave evidence in
confidence has a small castle. One particular American tourist went
over a rough bridge in stiletto heels, and guess what? She twisted her
ankle, and sued the owner of the castle. And guess what? Because the
owner of the castle is a reasonably famous person, they did not want
the law suit and settled out of court for &#163;8,000. This is
completely and utterly obscene.</p><p><a name="06060865000823">The scouts, guides, yachtsmen
and the Territorial Army are sick to death of going to court and
spending &#163;15,000 to &#163;100,000 a case; that money is gone
but they have had to spend it. The Chancellor has asked for a volunteer
community; we want over 500,000 volunteers over the next ten years. We
have to secure the legal framework for these
people.</p><p><a name="06060865000824">When
I went to Oxford as a very old man, a wonderful chap called Andy
Widdowson broke his neck playing rugby. When he broke his neck, his
parents did not sue the referee, the college, the rugby club or the
Rugby Football Union; they were just concerned about the well-being of
their son. We were, too, and we raised over &#163;60,000 for him, in
1981 figures. In Wales recently, a boy aged 15 broke his neck playing
rugby. Whom did the parents sue? Was it the Welsh Rugby Union? No;
amazingly. Was it the Welsh Schools Rugby Union? No; extraordinarily.
Was it the school? No. Was it the coach? No. It was the referee, and
they won. This is ridiculous and absurd. We have to allow risk in life
and we have to find a way in clause 1 to cover
exercise.</p><p><a name="06060865000825">We
have all talked about obesity rates and there is 70 per cent. less
activity among schoolchildren than there was 30 years ago. How on earth
are we going to solve that if we do not solve the risk element of
clause 1? That is
fundamental.</p><p><a name="06060865000826">Remember,
the girl guides have 600,000 members, and there are 50,000 girls on the
waiting list because it needs 8,000 more volunteers. There are not the
volunteers to come forward for the girl guides, which is
crackers&#151;absolutely nuts. We must resolve this issue in clause
1.</p><p><a name="06060865000827">Finally, the hon.
Member for Canterbury and I have looked at the American states, Western
Australia and so on. Philosophically, at some other stage, we must come
back and redefine what we mean by national insurance. We established it
in the 1940s, and it is inappropriate for a modern society not to take
a legal position on insurance for covering
volunteers.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="06060865001061">5.25

regulate claim farmers. In my constituency, they are preying on the
vulnerable and weak.</p><p><a name="06060865000829">I
also put on record my thanks to the Minister and her civil service team
for how they have engaged with me and other constituency Members who
are dealing with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease claims and have
experience of claim farmers in relation to the framing of the
Bill.</p><p><a name="06060865000830">I want to
concentrate on three points. The first is the need to regulate claim
farmers, and the second is who should be the regulator. The final point
relates to the legislation covering, in particular, the reference to
trade unions and
solicitors.</p><p><a name="06060865000831">Claim
farmers are simple middle men and nothing more. In my
constituency&#151;my hon. Friend the Member for Bassetlaw (John Mann)
has already referred to this&#151;firms have been created simply for
the purpose of raping the CPOD scheme. People have been forced to sign
agreements they do not understand, and claim farmers have also made
bogus claims in advertisements. Also, when they have been talking to
people, they have given the impression that they are solicitors or
legally qualified when clearly they are
not.</p><p><a name="06060865000832">Some
of the most disgraceful individuals are former National Union of
Mineworkers activists, who are working for these claim farmers. They
have tried to blur the edges with the implication that they are somehow
still connected with legitimate trade unions. I deplore those former
activists, who have thrown their lot in with greedy claim farmers and
clearly have prostituted any principles that they had, simply to make a
quick buck for themselves and their new
employers.</p><p><a name="06060865000833">I want to
refer to two cases in my brief contribution. My hon. Friend has already
referred to IDC, or FreeClaim IDC, as it is now called, which is a
claim handling firm that was set up in the last 10 years and is based
in Ashington, Northumberland. I want to refer to a case that involves
Mr. Jobes, my constituent, who was approached by the firm and filled in
an agreement with it. It did what all claim handling firms did, and
passed his case on. It went to a Liverpool-based firm called Silverbeck
Rymer.</p><p><a name="06060865000834">At
the conclusion of the case, Silverbeck Rymer deducted &#163;3,600 of
the compensation given to Mr. Jobes and passed it on to IDC to cover
&#147;IDC&#146;s costs&#148;. As my hon. Friend has already said,
no costs were involved in the case because the Government paid them
all. IDC and Silverbeck Rymer knew that at the time. My problem was how
to address
that.</p><p><a name="06060865000835">I
could not go for IDC because it is not regulated, so I went after
Silverbeck Rymer through the Law Society. I pay tribute to the case
officer who dealt with this. In a highly critical judgment, the
adjudicator said of the
case:</p><a name="06060865001016"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;I have
concluded that
they&#148;&#151;</p></ul><p><a name="06060865000836">that is,
Silverbeck
Rymer&#151;</p><a name="06060865001017"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;did not
explain matters to Mr. Jobes so that he could properly understand the
funding arrangements and he was not, therefore, in a position to give
informed consent to the deductions
made&#148;.</p></ul><p><a name="06060865000837">The key
point, which my hon. Friend also made, is that those claim farmers
could not have operated without collusion with solicitors. Mr. Jobes
could not have been defrauded or robbed without the collusion of
Silverbeck Rymer with a claims handler.</p><br><notus-date day="8" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>8 Jun 2006 : Column 494</b><br><p><a name="06060865000838">I challenge the Law Society to
examine Silverbeck Rymer&#146;s books, as well as those of every
single solicitor who has had dealings with IDC, to see how much they
have deducted and force them to pay it back. That is the only way to
ensure that those people get justice. I will follow up that challenge
and I hope that my hon. Friend the Minister can
assist.</p><p><a name="06060865000839">Firms are not
being honest with people about the courses of action open to them, such
as help from legitimate trade unions that do not charge anything or
home insurance policies. Under the scheme, there is no reason why any
legitimate law firm should charge clients a single
penny.</p><p><a name="06060865000840">I also welcome
the removal of the regulation of claims from the industry. The Claims
Standards Council was a joke, although it tried to claim that it was an
independent adjudicator. FreeClaim IDC was on the council&#151;the
same company that defrauded and robbed my constituent, Mr.
Jobes.</p>

<p><a name="06060865000841">It has been
argued that trade unions should be excluded from regulation by the
Bill, but I do not agree. Most trade unions, which are ethical and well
run, should not be constrained by burdensome regulation. However, my
hon. Friend the Member for Bassetlaw has already pointed out that the
UDM, which has been running a claims farm operation, would not be
covered if we excluded all trade unions.</p><p><a name="06060865000842">It saddens me to say that
Thompson&#146;s, a trade union solicitor, is doing the same thing, in
league with the Durham NUM. The firm sent all MPs a briefing note this
week asking us to argue for trade unions to be excluded, which
states:</p><a name="06060865001018"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Trade
unions should be specifically excluded from regulation in Part 2. The
suggestion that unions will be excluded as long as they can show that
they comply with certain conditions is an unnecessary and overly
complex formulation.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06060865000843">But
in Durham Thompson&#146;s has been involved in a con. Individuals
with COPD claims, many of whom have never been members of the
NUM&#151;such as widows or other relatives&#151;have been asked to
join as associate members for &#163;20 a year. That money&#151;and
some cases go on for five or more years&#151;does not give them many
rights and they are not covered by the certification officer rules.
People pay the &#163;20, fill the form in and it is then passed to
Thompson&#146;s solicitors, so it appears to be a joining fee to
access the scheme. Some people have been threatened that if they stop
paying the &#163;20, the action will be stopped.</p><p><a name="06060865000844">In addition, and even more
scandalously, people have been asked to sign a form allowing 7.5 per
cent. to be deducted from the final settlement. That money is not kept
by Thompson&#146;s, because of course its costs are paid by the
Government, but passed to the NUM. The agreement states that that is
done to &#147;indemnify&#148; the individual against any costs, but
we all know that there are no costs for the trade union or the lawyers,
because the Government pay them. As in the Silverbeck Rymer case, the
NUM is acting as a claims
handler.</p><p><a name="06060865000845">I
congratulate my hon. Friend on his tenacious work on the Raleys case.
The judgment a few weeks ago stated clearly that Raleys was acting as a
claims handler and could not justify the deductions that it had made
and passed on to the NUM in Yorkshire, and I think that that also
applies to Thompson&#146;s in Durham. I challenge Thompson&#146;s
to pay back every penny that it has deducted from my
constituents.</p><br><notus-date day="8" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>8 Jun 2006 : Column 495</b><br><p><a name="06060865000846">One of the
reasons given for deducting the money is that the NUM needs the money
to pursue further claims and continue its activities. But under the
scheme Thompson&#146;s alone has received &#163;92 million in
fees, &#163;2.5 million of which was for constituents of
mine. If further test claims are necessary or the NUM in Durham needs
money to keep going, Thompson&#146;s should pay, instead of poor
claimants, such as some of my constituents, who have struggled to
understand the complexities of the scheme and been bemused by some of
the sharp practices involved.</p><p><a name="06060865000847">I expect
better from a company such as Thompson&#146;s. I dealt with it in my
time as a trade union officer, and have the highest regard for it, but
its actions in Durham are nothing short of a disgrace. The TUC should
take steps immediately to ensure that the money is paid
back.</p><p><a name="06060865000848">I welcome the
claims handling regulations, as anyone who does not conform to the code
of conduct will be classed as a claims handler. The hon. Member for
North-East Hertfordshire (Mr. Heald) asked whether trade unions should
be covered by the Bill if they act as claims handlers. I believe
wholeheartedly that they should be.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="06060865001062">5.35

Bill.</p><p><a name="06060865000850">I worked in the
voluntary sector before I came to the House. My experience there, and
with the community initiatives that my constituents in Bishop Auckland
have tried to take, demonstrates to me that the fear of litigation and
punitive levels of insurance deter small-scale but worthwhile
activities.</p><p><a name="06060865000851">Many hon.
Members will know that the annual miners&#146; gala&#151;the
&#147;Big Meeting&#148;&#151;has been going for 121 years.
Indeed, many will have taken part in that wonderful cultural festival,
which is rooted in the history and traditions of mining in Durham and
across the north. It begins early in the morning, when people in
villages across the county march behind their own banner and band and
listen to the miners&#146; hymn. Then they get on the bus and go into
Durham for the Big
Meeting.</p><p><a name="06060865000852">This year,
there will be a parade of 100 banners and bands. It will end at the
race course, where people will listen to speeches and enjoy the
fairground. The whole day is an affirmation of the human spirit. Life
and leisure are not about shopping&#151;they are about history, music
and the values of solidarity and community.</p><p><a name="06060865000853">The event is
highly valued. In my constituency, the people of Spennymoor this year
raised money for a new banner, which will be taken to the cathedral and
blessed by the bishop. I am sure that the House will join me in
congratulating my hon. Friend the Member for Bolsover (Mr. Skinner),
whose portrait is on the banner.</p><p><a name="06060865000854">However, local village events
are threatened by the dreaded compensation culture. A so-called health
and safety expert belonging either to the county council or the
police&#151;I do not know which, because both organisations blame
each other&#151;has said that, 
<br><notus-date day="8" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>8 Jun 2006 : Column 496</b><br>although the village parades last only 20 minutes, they must fulfil the
appropriate requirements. That means that they must put up notices of
road closures two or even three weeks before the event. Moreover, the
notices must be made to a particular specification by a traffic
management company, and they must be put up by trained operatives
because of the alleged risks that crossing the road poses to ordinary
citizens.</p><p><a name="06060865000855">The
cost is proving to be astronomical. After last year&#146;s gala, I
received a list of complaints from people throughout the county. The
County Durham Association Of Local Councils carried out a survey, which
found that the costs sometimes amounted to hundreds of pounds. For
example, they came to &#163;294 in Shildon, and to a staggering
&#163;1,580&#151;plus value-added tax!&#151;in Peterlee. As a
result, 10 per cent. of villages have said that they have cancelled
events already because of the problem, and 70 per cent. have said that
the costs involved might dissuade them from holding an event in the
future.</p><p><a name="06060865000856">There are many
rural villages in the west of my constituency. They hold carnivals
along traditional lines, and are facing the same problem. For example,
at last year&#146;s remembrance service in Middleton in Teesdale, a
veteran was told that she could not carry the Union jack because she
was over 60 and would not be safe in the
traffic.</p><p><a name="06060865000857">The Bill will
be helpful because the present situation is unbalanced. Costs, problems
and risks are taken into account, but not benefits. We are destroying
not only enjoyable days, but communities. Communities are like
families: they need to do things together&#151;they need to meet to
maintain social cohesion. We are in a crazy situation where we are
paying people to set up community development offices and to run
initiatives, while we are destroying the home-grown ones with that
ridiculous
culture.</p><p><a name="06060865000858">Given that

welcome the fact that the Minister recognises that there is a serious
difference between genuine trade unions doing their jobs for their

of an insult, because the work done by trade unions in supporting their

work in this country.</p><p><a name="06060865000861">The vast majority of

<br><notus-date day="8" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>8 Jun 2006 : Column 497</b><br>shop stewards or other local officials who carry out their roles
professionally, without payment or reward, and they do so by being
properly trained and accredited. Without their knowledge and skills,
they could not do that job. Their work is part and parcel of the day
in, day out work of representing their colleagues at work to the best
of their ability. Most of them would be over the moon if they did not
have to do that work, because that would mean that their members were
not getting killed, maimed, injured or stressed out. Their members
would not face a life of penury, illness and injustice Those people
would not have to worry about how they will provide for their partners
and children, about how they will pay their mortgages or about what the
future would bring.</p><p><a name="06060865000862">As
was said earlier, more than 64,000 new claims were laid through trade
unions&#151;that is 64,000 men and women who face an uncertain
future, and 64,000 cases that may not have been taken up, for the
reasons given earlier by my hon. and good Friend the Member for City of
Durham (Dr. Blackman-Woods), if local trade unions had not supported
those people through those very traumatic times.</p><p><a name="06060865000863">I am
certainly not suggesting that those claims should go through a system
with no control&#151;I would never suggest that. Indeed, I believe
that the present trade union legislation strictly controls the
behaviour of trade unions in many ways. That is exactly what we are
trying to do today. In those claim cases it is clearly necessary to use
the legal profession. Those legal people are controlled by their
professional society. If their society is not doing its business, as
has been said today, perhaps that is the real issue that we should be
debating in the House, not what trade unions are
doing.</p><p><a name="06060865000864">There
is a fundamental difference between people whose job in life is to rip
people off and other people whose job in life is to represent people.
Trade unions do not want to be involved in rip-off work; they do not
want their members to be treated negligently or their lives to be
ruined. Genuine trade unions do not want to play any part in the
get-rich-quick operations that some of the rip-off merchants engage in.
That is why trade unions put so much emphasis on health and safety
legislation&#151;red tape as it is often disparagingly called in the
House&#151;and why they campaign long and hard to get proper
protection for their members at work.</p><p><a name="06060865000865">Trade unions do not want to
such work on behalf of their members&#151;to be honest, they do not
really need it&#151;but they will keep on doing it to defend their
members as long as they are being abused at work. Legal cases are
time-consuming, usually costly and drain resources, and they are in
many ways a sign of failure&#151;the failure of the employer to look
after the worker properly, the failure of the unions to negotiate
proper health and safety legislation and the failure of hon. Members to
ensure that we provide a safe working environment for people.</p><p><a name="06060865000866">Union reps could spend their
time and effort on much more productive and rewarding work, but they
accept their responsibility and they do whatever it takes to help their
members. There is no pleasure in winning
compensation cases for members, except the
knowledge that those members should be financially secure for the rest
of their lives. But all the money in the world will not give workers
their lives back.</p><br><notus-date day="8" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>8 Jun 2006 : Column 498</b><br><p><a name="06060865000867">People who have lost limbs,
people who have suffered from asbestos-related diseases or people burnt

of problems that are dealt with day in, day out by trade union reps
cannot turn back the clock just because a cheque drops through their
letterbox.</p><p><a name="06060865000868">Unions are
representatives acting for the collective good. They are a world away
from get-rich-quick cowboys who are little better than ambulance
chasers. They have experience in the workplace where their members work
that lawyers will never be able to replicate. They know first hand what
life in the workplace is like. They do not have to be drawn a map or
told what is going on. They know. If we insist on lumping trade unions
into the legislation, that knowledge will be lost. It will give greater
clarity if the clear exemption for trade unions is built into the Bill
as laid out. They are not claims farmers in any
way.</p><p><a name="06060865000869">The Barker ruling
is a disgrace to the House. Trade unions and their legal services teams
should be able to work through us in this House to overturn that
disgraceful decision taken in the other place. It is about real people.
I support our work with the asbestos mesothelioma support groups. It is
a disease that lies dormant for 30 years and then sparks off. People
suffer horribly and then die&#151;nothing else, that is the story.
Okay, drugs like Alimta may help and let us hope that we can make
progress with that, but if we do not overturn the Barker decision, the
reality will be that of a man facing a firing squad armed with five

bullet, so nobody is found guilty, but the truth is that they should
all be found
guilty.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="06060865001064">5.46
pm</h5><p><a name="06060865000870"><b><a name="06060865001472">The
Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Wales (Nick
Ainger):</b> This has been an interesting debate. We have
covered a range of issues, not necessarily all directly connected with
the Bill before us. It has been a good debate for that. Several hon.
Members have raised points related to the Bill, to which I shall
shortly respond, but first I shall reiterate the benefits that it will
have.</p><p><a name="06060865000871">I
should declare an interest, as everyone else seems to have done. From
1978 until 1992 I was a branch secretary of the Transport and General
Workers Union, and in 1986 I received &#163;1,500 in compensation for
an industrial injury, which was negotiated for me by the
union.</p><p><a name="06060865000872">The provisions
on negligence and statutory duty will provide much-needed reassurance
for the voluntary sector and for others who are concerned about
possible litigation. They will ensure that all courts, including the
lower courts, are aware of the guidance given by the higher courts.
They will serve a valuable purpose in improving awareness of this
aspect of the law and ensuring that normal activities are not prevented
by the fear of litigation and excessively risk-averse
behaviour.</p><p><a name="06060865000873">All
hon. Members have agreed on the importance of regulating claims
management services and putting in place vital safeguards for
consumers. My hon. Friend the Member for Blaydon (Mr. Anderson) and
others, especially those representing coal mining constituencies,
have described some of the problems&#151;to put
it mildly&#151;that arise with those intermediaries and the way in
which they mislead people who make claims. The regulatory 
<br><notus-date day="8" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>8 Jun 2006 : Column 499</b><br>framework that we have set out is both proportionate and targeted at the
areas where there is the greatest potential for consumer detriment. It
is consistent with the Government&#146;s better regulation agenda,
and will ensure that standards are raised in the
industry.</p><p><a name="06060865000874">The
regulation of claims management services is a necessary step for
protecting consumers. The safeguards that we propose will ensure that
bad practices stop and the era of unregulated claims management
companies misleading consumers and leaving them out of pocket will be
brought firmly to a close.</p><p><a name="06060865000875">A number of
hon. Members have raised the Barker decision in the House of Lords
relating to mesothelioma. I reiterate what the Under-Secretary of State
for Constitutional Affairs, my hon. Friend the Member for Lewisham,
East (Bridget Prentice) said: it is the Government&#146;s intention
to address this issue as soon as possible. Hon. Members have stressed
the importance of speed, because of the nature of the disease. My hon.
Friend the Member for Hendon (Mr. Dismore) made the good point that
unless new legislation is introduced, if we leave it to the courts, it
could be years and years before the matter is properly resolved.
Colleagues will be reassured not just by my words but by those of my
hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State for Constitutional Affairs in
opening the debate, and those of the Prime Minister the other
day.</p><p><a name="06060865000876">In the same
vein, we await the decision of the House of Lords on pleural
plaque&#151;a subject that was raised by my hon. Friend the Member
for Sherwood (Paddy Tipping). It is not appropriate to say what we will
do until we have heard the final
decision.</p><p><a name="06060865000877"><b><a name="06060865001473">Mr.
Heald:</b> One concern is that it is not only insurers but the
Government, too, who have substantial liabilities. Is the hon.
Gentleman aware of the estimated costs of those liabilities in respect
of the Ministry of Defence and the Department for Education and Skills,
both of which could have significant liabilities for
mesothelioma?</p><p><a name="06060865000878"><b><a name="06060865001474">Nick
Ainger:</b> The hon. Gentleman is right. Other Departments
have, or will have, significant liabilities, but the fact
remains&#151;<i> [</i><i> Interruption.</i><i> ]</i> The judgment is not
that old, but all Departments are considering it. Our position is that
we want to try to assist claimants who are, rightly, arguing for joint
and several
liability.</p><p><a name="06060865000879">Several
Members spent time on clause 1, and I shall try to address some of the
many points that were raised. The Government do not believe that
putting a definition of desirable activity into the Bill is
appropriate. The provision gives the court the flexibility to consider
all the relevant circumstances in the case, to reach a fair and just
decision. Including a definition of &#147;desirable activity&#148;
could imply that certain types of desirable activity had more weight
than others.</p><p><a name="06060865000880">Clause 1
addresses a misperception of how the law works, which has taken hold to
such an extent that it affects behaviour. It is a legitimate function
of legislation to address such matters. The law may be familiar to
lawyers and insurers, who deal with it on a daily basis, but it is not
familiar to people and organisations concerned about possible
litigation. The clause will show them the 
<br><notus-date day="8" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>8 Jun 2006 : Column 500</b><br>importance that the Government attach to the issue
and will make the law more widely
known.</p><p><a name="06060865000881">My
hon. Friend the Member for Hendon and the hon. Member for Cambridge
(David Howarth) believe that the inclusion of clause 1 will lead to a
tsunami of litigation&#151;I think that was the phrase that my hon.
Friend used. The Government do not believe that will be the case. The
clause reflects the existing law and the guidance given by the higher
courts, and should not fuel any increase in litigation. It will
discourage the bringing of claims based on the proposition that
reasonable care involves all steps required to prevent accidents in any
conceivable circumstances, regardless of the effect of requiring those
steps.</p><p><a name="06060865000882"><b><a name="06060865001475">Mr.
Dismore:</b> A few moments ago, my hon. Friend said that the
interpretation of the phrase &#147;desirable activity&#148; would
be a matter for the courts, thereby implying that the courts would have
to try cases to decide what it was. He has now said that there will not
be more litigation as a result of the clause. How can he square those
two arguments? If the courts have to interpret the phrase, more cases
will go to trial and there will inevitably be more
litigation.</p><p><a name="06060865000883"><b><a name="06060865001476">Nick
Ainger:</b> Every court that has to settle a claim will have
to decide on the facts. The provision will not increase the number of
cases; it merely notes that desirable activity is an important
factor.</p><p><a name="06060865000884"><b><a name="06060865001477">David
Howarth:</b> The point we are trying to make is that there
will be more appeals, and more cases forced to trial rather than
settled. That is where the extra costs will
arise.</p><p><a name="06060865000885"><b><a name="06060865001478">Nick
Ainger:</b> I appreciate that point, but the Government do not
take that view. I am sure that the matter will be debated in Committee.
I hope, for the sake of my hon. Friend the Minister who will be there,
that it will not be debated at quite such length as it was in the House
of Lords, but I am sure that Members will spend some time on
it.</p><p><a name="06060865000886"><b><a name="06060865001479">Mr.
Brazier:</b> The point that the splendid legal adviser to the
scouts, Andrew Caplan, made to us is not only that he welcomes the
clause, but that it may encourage other organisations to show the
courage that the scouts have shown in fighting those wretched people
when an unjustified vexatious claim is put
forward.</p><p><a name="06060865000887"><b><a name="06060865001480">Nick
Ainger:</b> The hon. Gentleman makes his case very
well.</p><p><a name="06060865000888">The concept
that we have sought to capture by the term &#147;desirable
activity&#148; is the well-established one of taking the wider social
value of activities into account. That reflects the existing law. The
courts are already able to&#151;and do&#151;take these matters into
account when considering all the circumstances of an individual case.
</p><p><a name="06060865000889">My
hon. Friend the Member for Sherwood raised his concern, and the
concerns of the TUC, in relation to the impact of clause 1 on certain
employees. May I try to reassure him? It is suggested that clause 1
would change the law so as to put at a disadvantage those who are
employed in public service occupations that are arguably desirable,
such as firefighting, compared with those employed in commercial
operations such as retail sales, which may not be seen as desirable.
However, that 
<br><notus-date day="8" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>8 Jun 2006 : Column 501</b><br>is not correct. It appears to be based on a misconception, first, as to
the purpose and meaning of the term &#147;desirable activity&#148;
and, secondly, as to the existing law. That is to say that the approach
of the courts is to balance risk and the effect of preventive measures
on an activity. On the first point, &#147;desirable&#148; was
expressly chosen by parliamentary counsel as a term wide enough to
encompass the wide range of existing case law&#151;in contrast to
terms such as &#147;socially
useful&#148;.</p><p><a name="06060865000890"><b><a name="06060865001481">Mr.
Dismore:</b> Will the Minister give
way?</p><p><a name="06060865000891"><b><a name="06060865001482">Nick
Ainger:</b> I have covered the point that my hon. Friend made
in his
speech.</p><p><a name="06060865000892">The
hon. Member for Rugby and Kenilworth (Jeremy Wright) raised the need
for a good communications strategy. The Government recognise that.
There is a ministerial working group, together with a stakeholder
group, which is developing that communication strategy with the idea of
using champions in the volunteering sector. Volunteering England is
involved. There will be that communications strategy in relation to
part 1.</p><p><a name="06060865000893">I am grateful
that colleagues have endorsed the usefulness of clause 2 and the
benefits that it will bring. I can assure the House that we have no
intention of removing or amending that clause in any detrimental way.
On the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Sittingbourne and
Sheppey (Derek Wyatt), I am assured that clause 1 will apply to
volunteers working during the Olympics.</p><p><a name="06060865000894">All Members
welcomed part 2. The only dissenting voice that I could hear was from
the Opposition Front Bench in relation to the exemption for trade
unions. I reiterate that trade unions will be subject to a code of
conduct, and that if they are found to be acting like claims handlers,
their exemption will be removed and they will be subject to the same
regulation as a claims handler. In relation to the abuses of the coal
health scheme, as chairman of the coal health monitoring group in
Wales, may I reiterate the call of my predecessor that the parasites
living off the back of what is undoubtedly the biggest industrial
claims scheme ever&#151;we have paid out &#163;3 billion to miners
and their relatives&#151;should return all the fees that they have
claimed from the
claimants?</p><p><a name="06060865000895">I am sure
that there will be further, and perhaps lengthy and interesting,
discussion in Committee on the provisions in the Bill. I commend the
Bill to the House.</p><p><a name="06060865000896"><i> Question put and agreed

David Winnick (Walsall, North) (Lab):</b> I am pleased to have
the opportunity to talk about the Manor hospital. I should explain that
I applied for the debate because of the urgent and pressing need for
major development work to be undertaken at the hospital, which is in my
borough of Walsall. Until recently, it was expected that a
private-finance-initiative contract would be agreed to and that the
work would begin early next year. Unfortunately, that has turned out
not to be the case and there has been some delay. It is because it is
essential for the work to be agreed to so that it can begin in early
2007 that I thought it necessary to apply for a debate on the Floor of
the
House.</p><p><a name="06060865000915">As
I am sure that the Minister knows, the three Members for the borough
met the Secretary of State on 3 May. We briefly explained the situation
to her and, of course, strongly urged that the work should be allowed
to proceed. I should point out that the Manor hospital, which is the
only acute hospital in the borough, provides a full range of hospital
services for a population of some 253,000. It has 620 beds. The last
major work took place 12 years ago when a new maternity unit was built,
which was welcomed since it was essential. However, the rest of the
site was built on a piecemeal basis from 1830 onwards. Given the
deficits that some hospital trusts have experienced in recent times, I
am sure that the Minister will be pleased to know that the Manor
balanced its budget in the past financial
year.</p><p><a name="06060865000916">I
am pleased that my right hon. Friend the Member for Walsall, South (Mr.
George) is in the Chamber. He will be emphasising the same point as me.
At present, 40 per cent. of the buildings on the hospital site
are&#151;to use a phrase that has become familiar in the past few
weeks&#151;not fit for purpose. It is a tremendous job maintaining
those buildings and, obviously, a very expensive one as
well.</p><p><a name="06060865000917">I
give the example of the hospital&#146;s east wing, which was built in
the late 19th century. It houses children&#146;s services,
women&#146;s surgical wards, dedicated theatres and diagnostic
facilities. The wing has a fire certificate until next year, and all
the indications are that it is unlikely to be renewed. The three
Members of Parliament, my right hon. Friend the Member for Walsall,
South, the hon. Member for Aldridge-Brownhills (Mr. Shepherd) and
myself, have seen for ourselves wards on the first floor of the east
wing which can no longer be used because of their defects and lack of
safety. It is most unfortunate that such accommodation lies empty for
those
reasons.</p><p><a name="06060865000918">Coming
to the present, much detailed work has been carried out by the hospital
management in drawing up a scheme in line with PFI requirements. That
was done so that, as I said, major investment work can start next year.
Unfortunately, in the last few months, the hospital has learnt that
Treasury rules have been changed and that the contracts that everyone
expected to be agreed have been delayed. That has, understandably,
caused much anxiety. Will the work go ahead? Will we go into next year
with no contracts signed and with the east wing as I described? One can
understand the strong concern in the borough.</p><br><notus-date day="8" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>8 Jun 2006 : Column 506</b><br><p><a name="06060865000919">We
are a borough known to some extent for our quarrels and
difficulties&#151;which sometimes reach national level&#151;not
only between political parties but, in some cases, within them, but we
are unanimous in our view that this work should be carried out. We are
very devoted to the Manor hospital. Even if this was not the case I
would be saying the same, but I happen to be a former patient. When I
suffered a heart attack in 1995, the hospital helped to save my life. I
speak now as a Member of Parliament for one of the three constituencies
in the borough served by the hospital, but I just put that on the file,
so to speak. I know that my right hon. Friend the Member for Walsall,
South has been an out-patient at the hospital on various
occasions.</p><p><a name="06060865000920">A hopeful
sign&#151;no doubt the Minister will deal with this&#151;is the
visit on 22 and 23 May of officials from his Department&#146;s PFI
unit. My understanding is that the hospital has proposed some variation
in the scheme which would reduce capital cost, and some of the
proposals discussed by the unit and the hospital management would mean
that some of the work due to be covered by the PFI contract would be
outside it. That is welcome. I should add that I am not a devotee of
PFI contracts. I would rather things were different, but I am a
realist, and if the only way major work can be undertaken is through
PFI, so be it.</p><p><a name="06060865000921">I hope
that the Minister will be in a position today if not to say
yes&#151;it would be too optimistic of me to believe that&#151;then
to give some reassurance to the people in the borough that there is
every possibility that the PFI contracts will be agreed to, with the
fact that some of the work will be outside the contracts making the
whole scheme more affordable. That is a hopeful sign, and I hope that
the Minister will be able to take up what I have just said.</p><p><a name="06060865000922">There is a wish that the matter
should be finalised before Parliament goes into the summer recess,
which will be in about five to six weeks&#146; time. Perhaps the
Minister will be able to indicate whether the information, one way or
the other, will be known to us by that time.</p><p><a name="06060865000923">The three Members involved have
met the Secretary of State, this debate is now taking place and we will
continue to do whatever we can to sustain the pressure so that this
vital work&#151;I repeat myself deliberately because it is
essential&#151;can be started next year. No further delay can
possibly be justified. I look forward, with some optimism, to the
Minister&#146;s
response.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="06060865001067">6.11
pm</h5><p><a name="06060865000924"><b><a name="06060865001485">Mr.
Bruce George (Walsall, South) (Lab):</b> I am grateful to my
close colleague, my hon. Friend the Member for Walsall, North (Mr.
Winnick), for introducing this short debate. Our colleague, the hon.
Member for Aldridge-Brownhills (Mr. Shepherd), has sent his apologies.
This is a cross-party endeavour to ensure that a proper decision is
made.</p><p><a name="06060865000925">I know that the
route towards PFI is strewn with delays and side-tracking. I can
understand that. There is a history of rather difficult negotiations. I
hope that at the end of the day, and pretty soon, the Department will
acquiesce to the scheme proceeding. It is pretty obvious that there
have been some disastrous PFIs. I understand why the Minister must be
cautious. However, the problem is acute. As my hon. Friend the Member
for Walsall, North has said, there is a crisis.
Half of the buildings currently in the hospital
could be 
<br><notus-date day="8" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>8 Jun 2006 : Column 507</b><br>annexed by the black country museum. They are part
of the black country&#146;s history. Yet the fire department has
stated clearly that these buildings, despite new buildings over the
past decades, will not be granted a certificate. It will be impossible
for the hospital to continue to be occupied with buildings that could
be open to being sued or brought to court. It has been put on a
warning.</p><p><a name="06060865000926">Not long
after I was elected to this place in 1974, I recall beginning a
campaign for a new Walsall hospital. In 1975, I think that it was David
Ennals, who was from Walsall&#151;the late Lord Ennals&#151;who
said that there would be a hospital. About 12 years later a new
building was put up. It was an incredibly good addition to the site,
which was getting rather elderly. Now, there is a crisis. The primary
care trust and the hospital have got together on a number of important
projects. It would be remiss of me not to say clearly and with pleasure
that enormous improvements have been made since 1979.</p><p><a name="06060865000927">However, there will be a
crisis. The Government and the Treasury have changed the rules, in my
view. Where Walsall hospital thought that it was on target to meet the
Government&#146;s requirements, now it is not. I spoke to Lord Warner
a month or so ago, and also I spoke to the then Minister, my right hon.
Friend the Member for Liverpool, Wavertree (Jane Kennedy). I was led to
believe that my right hon. Friend would offer to meet not a delegation
of Members putting an emotional case&#151;the Secretary of State has
already met the three Members involved&#151;but a small delegation of
specialists. I was told that there was a distinct possibility of that
happening. There was to be a delegation of specialists&#151;the
chairman of the hospital, the chief executive, someone from the primary
care trust and someone from the region&#151;who could argue the case
in detail for what we hope will happen.</p><p><a name="06060865000928">We urge the Minister to use all
the influence that he has with his colleagues to ensure that there is a
continuation of negotiations with the hospital&#151;there is an
excellent team of people&#151;to ensure that whatever is necessary is
done, however rearranged, so that building work can begin. There is
relatively high unemployment in the area and every index of poverty and
deprivation is present in different wards. It would be appalling if the
good work that the Government have been doing so far to enhance health
provision in Walsall hit a brick wall&#151;a brick wall that I
believe has been put up unnecessarily.</p><p><a name="06060865000929">I know that
my hon. Friend the Minister has been well briefed. I hope that the
pleas of two Members, together with those of our Conservative
colleague, are seriously heeded and that the Minister, will make
arrangements for a senior Minister, together with officials from the
Department, to meet a delegation from Walsall, minus Members, to
discuss the technicalities. I know that there have been meetings in
Walsall with officials from my hon. Friend&#146;s
Department.</p><p><a name="06060865000930">I hope
that the promise that I believe was given by other Ministers will be
kept and that we will be able in the few months that lie ahead to say
that the building is on target. I hope that we shall see the good work
of the Government enhanced even further, and that finally we shall
have, for the first time ever, a hospital network and health services
that are fit for purpose and meet the 
<br><notus-date day="8" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>8 Jun 2006 : Column 508</b><br>requirements of our constituents. I once again thank
my colleague, my hon. Friend the Member for Walsall, North, for
permitting me to participate in the
debate.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="06060865001068">6.16
pm</h5><p><a name="06060865000931"><b><a name="06060865001486">The
Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Health (Mr. Ivan
Lewis):</b> May I begin by congratulating my hon. Friend the
Member for Walsall, North (Mr. Winnick) on securing this debate? Both
he and my right hon. Friend the Member for Walsall, South (Mr. George)
have a long track record of promoting the proposed private finance
initiative scheme for the Manor hospital site. As they said, together
with the hon. Member for Aldridge-Brownhills (Mr. Shepherd), they
recently met the Secretary of State to discuss the latest
developments&#151;a subject to which I shall return.</p><p><a name="06060865000932">First, however, may I reiterate
my Department&#146;s continuing support for the modernisation of the
Manor site? That support is not in dispute. The Manor hospital began
life as the local Poor Law Infirmary, and it retains key buildings such
as the east wing, which houses women&#146;s and children&#146;s
services, and St. John&#146;s block, both of which both date back, as
my hon. Friends said, to the 1850s. The remainder of the site has been
developed piecemeal over the decades, resulting in poor clinical
relationships and functional unsuitability. More than 40 per cent. of
the building stock is in an unacceptable physical condition and fails
to meet health and safety requirements.</p><p><a name="06060865000933">As my hon.
Friends pointed out, West Midlands fire service has told the trust that
it is unlikely to be able self-certify fire safety arrangements on the
east wing after December this year. Even now, the wards on the first
floor of the building cannot be used because of concerns about
structural safety. The situation has increasingly hampered the
trust&#146;s efforts further to improve patient services and
efficiency. Walsall Hospitals NHS Trust has an impressive track record
of maintaining low waiting times for out-patient consultations and
elective surgery. Indeed, it has the lowest waiting times in the west
midlands, which should be a source of pride to my hon. Friends. The
trust has had its busiest year ever, treating 20,000 more patients. As
my hon. Friend the Member for Walsall, North said, it is financially
stable and broke even in 2005-06 after it repaid some of its
brought-forward
deficit.</p><p><a name="06060865000934">As
everyone agrees, the key to further improvements lies in the more
efficient working practices that have been designed as part of the new
scheme, but they are unlikely to be realised until the new facilities
are in place. That is why, in early 2001, the Government approved the
initial strategic outline business case for the redevelopment plans
that will be taken forward under the PFI initiative. There was a delay
in moving to the next stage&#151;approval of the outline business
case&#151;as the scheme had to be reconsidered as part of a wider
Wolverhampton and Walsall joint service review. As a result, a revised
proposal was submitted, which was approved by Birmingham and The Black
Country strategic health authority, resulting in the scheme going to
the market in October 2004. Despite further detailed service
development work, the trust was able to issue invitations to tender and
received two successful compliant bids just over a year later in
October 2005 from the major consortiums Skanska Innisfree and
Carillion. Following further evaluation and negotiation, the trust was
poised to appoint its preferred bidder just before Christmas.</p><br><notus-date day="8" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>8 Jun 2006 : Column 509</b><br><p><a name="06060865000935">As my hon.
Friends mentioned, at the beginning of this year we announced a review
of all the major PFI schemes currently in procurement, which included
Walsall. We did this in spite of the proven track record and success of
PFI to date, because we wanted to make sure that the latest schemes
properly took account of the current reforms to the NHS, such as the
choice agenda, the movement of services into primary and community care
settings, the new financial regime&#151;the national
tariff&#151;and assumptions about efficiency gains and long-term
affordability. A team from the Department has therefore been visiting
every relevant trust to work with it on this task. As hon. Members
know, the team first visited Walsall in early April and a follow-up
visit, as we heard, took place at the end of
May.</p><p><a name="06060865000936">That brings me
back to the latest developments. The trust had concluded that, as
previously configured, the scheme was unaffordable. It thus undertook a
root and branch review to ensure maximum flexibility and, wherever
possible, to reduce costs. As my hon. Friends know, the outcome has
been very encouraging, as the trust&#146;s new proposals
significantly reduce the annual payment to the private sector partner,
with minimal disruption to the core service elements of the
scheme.</p><p><a name="06060865000937">It
is worth reflecting what the key savings are. They arise, first, from
postponing the permanent replacement of wards in the south wing and
instead, using a high quality modular building to provide a short-term
replacement for a minimum of five years, which will allow the trust to
make further efficiencies in bed numbers or totally review its
requirement at phase two; secondly, from working with the primary care
trust with the aim of the PCT contributing to the funding of the
diagnostic and treatment centre element of the scheme or delivering
some of this activity in the community; and thirdly, from removing some
of the support work and services from the scheme, such as the managed
equipment service and ancillary services, which will continue to be
provided in-house by the
trust.</p><p><a name="06060865000938">It
is important to emphasise to my hon. Friends and to the House that
these are only proposals at this stage. More work is needed on
finalising costings and seeking agreement with key stakeholders such as
the PCT, as I have mentioned. The success of the proposals also depends
on securing an alternative source of capital for the new modular
building and the demolition of the south wing&#151;a total of
&#163;13 million, to be
specific.</p><p><a name="06060865000939">I
am delighted to be able to announce in the course of the debate that
the Department yesterday agreed to make &#163;13 million available
for this purpose, and we have written to the trust and the SHA this
morning to that effect. Release of this funding will, of course, be
conditional on the submission of a robust and affordable business case.
I know that my honourable Friends will be very pleased to hear this
news, as it also addresses a matter about which I know they are
concerned&#151;the urgency of the situation, which they mentioned in
their contributions. I know that uppermost in their minds is the
condition of the east wing, which, as I said earlier, the trust may not
be able to self-certify for fire safety beyond the end of this year.
The aim is for the women&#146;s and children&#146;s services to
decant from the east wing to the new modular buildings replacing the
south wing. That can now go ahead as part of the main PFI works
programme or separately and sooner, should that be necessary.</p><br><notus-date day="8" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>8 Jun 2006 : Column 510</b><br><p><a name="06060865000940">The
fact that the money has been released owes much to the advocacy of my
hon. Friends and their championing of the cause directly to the
Department and to Ministers in recent months. I know that the community
in Walsall, which cares passionately about the hospital, will be
pleased with the early good
news.</p><p><a name="06060865000941">Under
the PFI review we expect the more advanced schemes like Walsall to have
finalised their revised proposals within a month or so. Those will then
be considered by the Department of Health and the Treasury, alongside
the progress that trusts have made in securing the best commercial and
contractual terms with their bidders, which of course influences the
overall cost of a scheme. We expect to be able to announce our
decisions before the end of the
summer.</p><p><a name="06060865000942">In
conclusion, as a consequence of the debate this evening, I will log the
request by my hon. Friends for a meeting of representatives of the
hospital with Ministers and officials in the Department, but we want
that meeting to go ahead only if it is absolutely necessary. The ideal
scenario, in terms of the progress that has been made in recent weeks,
would be for the local partners to continue doing exactly what they
have been doing and to finalise a bid with the Department, with all the
necessary component parts, as quickly as possible.</p><p><a name="06060865000943"><b><a name="06060865001487">Mr.
Winnick:</b> My right hon. Friend the Member for Walsall,
South (Mr. George) and I are very pleased by the Minister&#146;s
announcement of the &#163;13 million. It goes without saying that
that is good news much to be welcomed by the hospital and the wider
community. The Minister referred, as expected, to the east wing. While
the &#163;13 million is useful, and we are very pleased, grateful,
and whatever other words are appropriate, it is essential that the
major investment&#151;about &#163;160 million in total&#151;start
next year. When are we likely to have the information? What does the
Minister mean by the end of the summer&#151;the beginning of the
summer recess, a little later, or what? Can he give more precise
details?</p><p><a name="06060865000944"><b><a name="06060865001488">Mr.
Lewis:</b> I should make it clear on behalf of the Government
that we would not wish to establish a precedent whereby whenever hon.
Members ask for an Adjournment debate, &#163;13 million is made
available within 24 hours.</p><p><a name="06060865000945">The serious
point is that I would like this matter to be resolved before the summer
recess. That is my hope and objective. We want to respond positively to
the representations that my right hon. and hon. Friends have made on
behalf of their communities and constituents, and we will do everything
possible to make that happen. However, we depend on the local partners
playing their part in ensuring that all the required work is done
appropriately. If that happens, I assure my hon. Friend that we will do
everything possible to ensure that we can give my hon. Friend the news
that he requested before the summer
recess.</p><p><a name="06060865000946">I
believe that the news for Walsall is very positive. There is a little
way to go, but a lot of progress has been made in recent months, and
there is every cause for
optimism.</p><p><a name="06060865000947"><i> Question
