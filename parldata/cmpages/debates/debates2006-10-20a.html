Andrew Dismore (Hendon) (Lab):</b> On a point of order,
Mr. Deputy Speaker. I came in this morning at half-past 7,
as I usually do on a Friday, to prepare for today&#146;s business. I
particularly wanted to prepare for the Bill that I thought would be
first on the Order Paper, bearing in mind that it was listed first
yesterday&#151;the Income Tax (Earnings Exemption for Persons Living
in Poverty) (No. 2) Bill, promoted by the hon. Member for Cotswold
(Mr. Clifton-Brown). I wanted to compare his Bill with the
Opposition&#146;s proposed tax package of &#163;21 billion-worth of
tax cuts to see whether there was anything to be gained from their
proposals that might help me in today&#146;s debate, particularly as
regards their impact on people in poverty. I see, however, that that
Bill has been withdrawn from today&#146;s agenda. Is that because the
Opposition are frightened of debating their tax plans, or is there some
other reason? Is there any way, Mr. Deputy Speaker, in which
we could get that Bill back on to the Order Paper today so that we can
examine those tax plans as against the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
Bill?</p><br>

and many people in Solihull, have been waiting a long time for this
day. I had been in Parliament for only a few weeks when my name came up
in the ballot for ten-minute Bills, so it is well over a year since I
first introduced this Bill. I was a very green new MP, if hon. Members
will pardon the pun, and I did not know my ten-minute Bills from my
elbow.</p><p><a name="06102037000056">Campaigning on
the issues addressed in the Bill was in no small measure instrumental
in getting me elected in the first place as the first ever Liberal
Democrat in a seat held by the Conservatives for 60 years&#151;ever
since the borough was created&#151;so when I was given the
opportunity to introduce a Bill, I grabbed at the chance, despite
knowing very little about how Parliament worked. I think that my
naivety is in some measure reflected in the Bill, which tries to set
right the wrongs in the green planning arena that I feel so
passionately about. I apologise to hon. Members for the fact that the
Bill is something of a shopping list&#151;a basket of remedies for
many of the ills that beset the lives of people who care about the
environment in Solihull and in many other places in England and Wales.
I thank the long-suffering staff in the Public Bill Office, who
translated my wish list into a real, live Bill.
</p><p><a name="06102037000057">Solihull is a leafy
suburb of Birmingham&#151;a place in which many aspire to live. The
motto of the borough is &#147;Urbs in Rure&#148;&#151;or
&#147;town in the country&#148;, for the non-Latin scholars among
us. There are several very strong communities in Solihull, and the
people who live there are proud of their area and passionate about
their environment. What most frustrates people in Solihull is a feeling
of powerlessness. They want a say in the decisions that affect their
lives. They do not want councils or outside individuals making rulings
that they disagree with but are not allowed to object to. What really
hacks them off are decisions about their environment that lead to
selling off green space that belongs to them and building on it. That
is what has happened in
Solihull.</p><p><a name="06102037000058"><b><a name="61020-0001.htm_spnew7"><a name="06102037000669">Andrew
Miller (Ellesmere Port and Neston) (Lab):</b> I am trying to
see where the hon. Lady&#146;s argument fits in with my experience in
my constituency. Perhaps the fact that the planning authority is of a
different political colour makes the difference. I see, for example,
the newspaper headline, &#147;End planning consent, says
Gummer&#148;. I have not experienced the problem with my planning
authority, so is it down to
hers?</p><p><a name="06102037000059"><b><a name="61020-0001.htm_spnew8"><a name="06102037000670">Lorely

to the sale of parkland. The Bill seeks to protect constituents against
the actions of planning authorities that wish to sell off parkland. If
the hon. Gentleman gives me time to make some progress, I hope that
that will become clearer.</p><br>

12,000-signature petition, the Conservative council has sold off an
area of more than 6 acres of parkland not once, but twice in the past
couple of years to fund the rebuilding of a leisure centre. Only a few
weeks ago, a final nail was driven into the coffin of another park in
Shirley, where almost three acres were sold off so that an Asda
superstore, other shops and housing could be built.</p><p><a name="06102037000061">We needed the leisure centre
upgraded and we needed commercial investment in Shirley, where the
superstore will go. However, God is not making any more real estate
and, since parks and green spaces belong to the people, surely they
should have a say. To be fair, consultation has taken place on the
shopping development, but one man&#146;s consultation is
another&#146;s pretending to listen but doing it anyway. The
development company did an excellent sales job and claimed that most
people were in favour of the scheme. On the other hand, a local
referendum claimed that 80 per cent. of local people were against the
superstore. We need a local referendum on such an important issue so
that people can have their say and ownership of whatever comes of the
decision that they make.</p><p><a name="06102037000062"><b><a name="61020-0001.htm_spnew9"><a name="06102037000671">Mr.

suggests. We found in a local survey in Shirley that 84 per cent. of
people were against building on parkland. However, those results, which
were presented for the edification of the local Conservative council,
have been ignored. A joint body, in which the council has entered a
business arrangement with the developers, has conducted consultation
that purports that the majority of people are in favour of the
development. A consultation is only as good as the objectivity of those

Dismore:</b> The hon. Lady is generous in giving way and I
have some sympathy with the Bill. She said that the Secretary of State
would cover the referendum costs, but the Bill does not provide for
that. Clause 7 refers to Parliament meeting the Minister&#146;s
costs. Where does the Bill suggest that the Secretary of State will
meet the costs? What will the Bill cost the public purse? The House is

sympathetic to her aims and objectives. Clause 9, which is entitled
&#147;Interpretation&#148;, lists the various forms of local
authority that the Bill covers. Let us consider Northamptonshire. If
the county council owned some parkland in Northampton and proposed to
sell it off, would a referendum be county wide or restricted to the
people of
Northampton?</p><p><a name="06102037000074"><b><a name="61020-0001.htm_spnew20"><a name="06102037000682">Lorely

referendum would have to be proportionate to the effect on the local
community. If everyone in the district stood to enjoy the amenity, the
referendum should be county wide. However, in the case of a smaller
piece of land, which was specifically enjoyed by a smaller local
community, it would be appropriate for the people of that community to
have the say because they would be

responsibility for planning matters to local authorities. Surely
referendums take responsibility away from the local authorities. Is not
a democratically elected council the right body to make the decisions?
She mentioned the example of the supermarket in her constituency. I
presume that the supermarket concerned has carried out its own surveys
and research and found out that an awful lot of local people want to
shop in a supermarket in that area. Does not that, too, illustrate
local opinion on the

the hon. Gentleman that the ballot box is the final arbiter, but when

trees. I feel very much the same about trees as I feel about green
spaces. Their lifespan is longer than ours and we should be their
custodians and, wherever possible, allow them to survive
unmolested&#151;particularly when they have already been around for
several generations. Right by where the superstore that I have
described is due to be built, there is an almost unique example of an
oak circle. An ancient 350-year-old oak is surrounded by a circle of
oaks, saplings that it has produced which have grown up.</p><p><a name="06102037000085">Trees can, supposedly, be
protected by tree preservation orders. There is, however, an ironic
story about our oak circle. I wrote to the council about the ancient
oak and two other venerable trees in Shirley park, requesting that tree
preservation orders be placed on them. The reply said that there was no
need to have tree preservation orders for trees on council land because
the council was a model custodian and would protect them. If ripping
them up and putting a superstore in their place is an example of
protection, I would not like to see what happened to something that the
council did not want to protect.</p><p><a name="06102037000086">Trees are under threat from all
quarters. Another example is where developers want to develop a piece
of land with mature trees on it, and, knowing that the presence of the
trees could constitute a ground for objection, fell them before
submitting their application. We need a general duty of care on trees
over and above the tiny proportion that are covered by tree
preservation orders.</p><p><a name="06102037000087"><b><a name="61020-0001.htm_spnew29"><a name="06102037000691">Mr.

the symbol of our party, so we are very concerned about the felling of
any trees. I decry the felling of a 350-year-old oak, which simply
cannot be replaced. Has the hon. Lady spoken to the developer about the
replacement of that tree with many more trees, to ensure that the

guidance legislation.</p><p><a name="06102037000092">The second part of my Bill is
similar to the ten-minute Bill of the hon. Member for Tunbridge Wells
(Greg Clark), which covers the practice that has become known as garden
grabbing. I am delighted to support his Bill, which was introduced
almost a year after mine. I am not aware that either he or any of his
Conservative colleagues have supported mine to date, although the
supportive comments from hon. Members on the Conservative Benches today
would tend to contradict that, and I am grateful to them for their
support.</p><p><a name="06102037000093">Clause 3
looks at the planning guidelines that designate back gardens as
brownfield sites. If it has not become apparent already, I must tell
the House that I am no planning expert. To my simple mind, however, a
garden is usually green, not brown. The intention of the planning
guidelines is to ensure that brownfield sites are developed first. That
is highly commendable, but the unintended consequences of designating
gardens as brownfield sites can be seen all over Solihull, and in many
other places. Developers see a relatively easy and cheap opportunity in
an area where house values are high. They knock down a lovely old house
with a big garden and build a block of flats&#151;oops, sorry, I mean
luxury apartments&#151;in its
stead.</p><p><a name="06102037000094">Some people
have accused me of nimbyism, because I am suggesting that building
dense developments literally in someone&#146;s back yard is not
desirable. They could be right. After all, we need affordable homes,
and we need lots of them. However, these so-called luxury apartments
are not affordable homes. They are expensive, because developers want
to maximise profits, and our council, at least, is failing to reach the
affordable homes targets set by the
Government.</p><p><a name="06102037000095"><b><a name="61020-0001.htm_spnew33"><a name="06102037000695">Mr.

had no planning powers. I thought that it was Liberal Democrat policy
to leave such matters in local hands. Any proposal of the kind that she

hon. Lady gave, it is more likely that it would be the householder who
was appealing, as they would presumably support the
development&#151;the case would come before the planning
inspectorate. Only exceptional cases would be considered by the
Secretary of State. Cases of the type that she mentions would never
come before the Secretary of State. With all due respect, she wants to
overturn a tried and trusted, independent system for the sake of a bit
of politicking.

Burt:</b> I am surprised by the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
comments. I accept that there are planning guidelines, and if he allows
me to make a little progress, I will explain in more detail how I
propose to address the problems that he
outlines.</p><p><a name="06102037000102">I do not
blame developers, who are in business to maximise profits. Dealing with
developers is a bit like offering a child the choice between chocolate
and cabbage&#151;they may know that the cabbage is, in theory, good
for them, but they will choose the chocolate every time. It is our
responsibility in the House to ensure that the cabbage is eaten. We
need good, affordable homes on the sites of redundant, obsolete
buildings, and on ground that is currently polluted. Developers are
entitled to some chocolate, but they must eat their cabbage
first.</p><p><a name="06102037000103">There is some
hope in draft planning policy statement 3. I shall read an extract for
the information of hon. Members, and I hope that it will answer the
questions asked by the hon. Member for Ealing, Acton and Shepherd's
Bush (Mr.
Slaughter):</p><a name="61020-0001.htmbrev_1"><a name="06102037000604"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Although
residential gardens are defined as brownfield land, this does not
necessarily mean that they are suitable for development. However, in
determining the policy approach, local planning authorities will need
to have regard to the positive contribution that intensification can
make, for example, in terms of minimising the pressure on greenfield
sites.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06102037000104">Local authorities
can therefore refuse garden-grabbing targets, as long as they meet
Government targets, including the target of building 60 per cent. of
housing on brownfield
sites.</p><p><a name="06102037000105">The way in
which planning applications are dealt with bears scrutiny, and the Bill
proposes two changes. What really upsets many local people is the fact
that they cannot appeal against a planning decision made by their
council&#151;only the council or the developers can appeal. Clause 4
therefore gives local individuals and bodies certain rights to appeal.
Clause 5 deals with situations in which local communities have been
worn down by repeated planning applications. In one street in Solihull,
local residents had to fight 21 separate planning applications, which
put great emotional strain on the community for years. I am glad that
section 70 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 gives local
authorities the power to decline to determine an application for up to
two years, in the case of serial applicants. Clause 5 of my Bill
extends that period to three years, both to deter serial applicants
even more, and to give local communities a rest from planning
pests.</p><p><a name="06102037000106">The Bill may
not be the tidiest measure put before the House, but I hope that, when
voting, Members will recognise the genuine problems that it addresses.

incorporate its contents in future legislation of their own. Parks,
trees and gardens are a vital green lung in our communities. As the
hon. Member for Ribble Valley (Mr. Evans) said, the sad fact
is that when parkland is gone, it is gone for ever. For Shirley park
and Tudor Grange park in Solihull, it is probably too late&#151;the
bulldozers are poised to move in. However, we have some parkland left,
and parks, trees and gardens across the country desperately need and
deserve the stronger protection that the Bill would give them. I
therefore respectfully request hon. Members on both sides of the House
to support the
Bill.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="61020-0001.htmordayhd_3"><a name="06102037000648">10.5

Miller (Ellesmere Port and Neston) (Lab):</b> I have enormous
sympathy with the thrust of the Bill introduced by the hon. Member for
Solihull (Lorely Burt), but as I tried to make clear in my
intervention, her problem is that Solihull has a Conservative council.
I have every sympathy, because I have to deal with a Conservative
county council in my constituency. She was right to say, in her
response, that different planning authorities put different values on
the assets in their custody. Such values are not simply
monetary&#151;there is also the value to the community, based on the
history and culture of, and the environment around, the assets of which
they are custodians.</p><p><a name="06102037000108">Having said that, I think that
the hon. Lady approaches the problem in the wrong way. She has tried to
be absolutist in her drafting of the Bill but, in some circumstances,
that is counter-productive to good governance. I shall speak about
trees in detail, because I have some knowledge of the subject, having
planted many trees myself. A few weeks ago, I cut down a tree that had
been a problem for a long time. I did so because it was in a dangerous
state and because, after considering the cost-benefit of the tree to
the environment, I decided that its contribution was not a positive
one. It was a scruffy sycamore, and sycamores grow like weeds on my
land.</p><p><a name="06102037000109">We must be
careful not to generalise. When considering the conservation and
preservation of trees, we should bear in mind the fact that although
the age of the tree matters, some species are more worthy of protection
than others. Some trees grow like weeds, but others take a long time to
grow. As part of the Mersey Forest project, various species of birch
are being planted as crops, and they grow extremely fast. There is no
logic in making such species subject to the Bill. However, the plight
of the 350-year-old oak that the hon. Lady discussed is an example of
desecration at its worst. It is absolutely disgraceful that people
should have contemplated cutting it down, and I have every sympathy
with her on that
point.</p><p><a name="06102037000110">The Bill as
drafted is fundamentally flawed. I shall try to be helpful in my
observations because if, perchance, it proceeded to Committee, and I
served on that Committee&#151;I accept that that is not a matter for
me&#151;I would certainly table amendments to address some important
points. However, I would ensure that I did so in as deregulatory a
manner as possible. Wearing my other hat&#151;I am Chairman of the
Regulatory Reform Committee&#151;I see some absurdities that are
based on well meaning but ill thought out
regulations.</p><br>

Duddridge (Rochford and Southend, East) (Con):</b> I share the
hon. Gentleman&#146;s concerns about the nature of the Bill, which is
attempting to achieve so much. Does he believe that it is amendable or

aspiration, rather than try to cover so many
bases?</p><p><a name="06102037000112"><b><a name="61020-0001.htm_spnew41"><a name="06102037000703">Andrew

Gentleman shares my concern about the disgraceful behaviour of Solihull
council. To answer his other point, any Bill can be amended to achieve
a desirable result. For example, the Companies Bill, which we dealt
with over the past three days, had rather a lot of amendments, some of
which were criticised by the Conservative party, but the House
supported its spirit and general meaning. That is why many of our
colleagues who were anxious to catch trains yesterday evening were able
to do so.</p><p><a name="06102037000113">My answer is
that it is possible to amend the Bill to address the problems, although
some of that would have to be done through wise intervention by the
Government on issues of definition, because&#151;I emphasise this
point&#151;the Bill uses the word &#147;repeated&#148;. Repeated
planning applications must have a definition. The hon. Member for
Solihull has made provision for regulations to be introduced, and
presumably they would address that problem of definition. Had our dear
old Friday friend, the late Eric Forth, been with us today, he would
have stamped on me straight away for making that observation. He would
have argued that that would be another
regulation&#151;</p><p><a name="06102037000114"><b><a name="61020-0001.htm_spnew42"><a name="06102037000704">The

yes, I think the Bill is
amendable.</p><p><a name="06102037000116">On the sale
of parkland by local authorities, I have general and specific concerns
about clause 1(1). This is an absolutist Bill and it does not cover,
for example, parkland owned by hospital trusts. Perhaps it should. At
my local hospital, the Countess of Chester, which is not in my
constituency, there has been a long-running battle over whether some
land ought to be sold off. It is mature land that would fit the
description provided by the hon. Member for
Solihull.</p><p><a name="06102037000117">I would be
in favour of that land being developed because of the acute shortage of
development land in and around the city of Chester. However, there is,
by any definition, ample green space in that area, as looking over the
city walls means looking over the beautiful countryside of north Wales.
There is no acute shortage of green space&#151;far from it&#151;and
plenty of green spaces in the city are protected under different
statutes. The land belonging to the hospital would be covered by the
spirit of the Bill, if not its definition, as it refers to local
authorities, not hospital trusts, although it would be difficult to
argue that local authorities should be included but other public sector
landowners should
not.</p><p><a name="06102037000118">For example, the
Ministry of Defence is a substantial owner of land that fits the

public bodies have a lot of redundant land. To take an example from my
area, we have not only an MOD site&#151;which I may have the
opportunity to refer to later, Mr. Deputy Speaker, if I
catch your eye&#151;but a lot of NHS land that is now redundant in
relation to that purpose. Do my hon. Friend&#146;s remarks apply
equally to such
land?</p><p><a name="06102037000120"><b><a name="61020-0001.htm_spnew45"><a name="06102037000707">Andrew
Miller:</b> I agree with my hon. Friend, although I thought
about taking issue when he used the word &#147;redundant&#148;.
However, he then referred to land that is redundant for that purpose.
There is an argument, which I shall come to in a moment, about the
circumstances in which it may be appropriate for a local authority or a
public landowner to change the use of land. I am slightly concerned
that the Bill might be too prescriptive to meet the principal point
made by the hon. Member for Solihull about dealing with rogue
landowners such as Solihull
council.</p><p><a name="06102037000121"><b><a name="61020-0001.htm_spnew46"><a name="06102037000708">Mr.
Evans:</b> The hon. Gentleman makes an interesting point about
NHS land, and we should look to widen the Bill&#146;s scope to cover
all sorts of parkland in public use. We should also cover other land.
There were three mental institutions in my constituency when I was
elected in 1992, two of which are no longer used for that purpose. What
provision should be included to prevent a health authority from selling
off land that falls outside the Bill&#146;s
scope?</p><p><a name="06102037000122"><b><a name="61020-0001.htm_spnew47"><a name="06102037000709">Andrew
Miller:</b> The hon. Gentleman makes a fair point. I am not
the greatest procedural expert in this place and I am not sure whether
the Bill&#146;s scope may be expanded sufficiently in that regard due
to the definition that has been used in its long title. However, to
take his example of old mental health institutions, if it were possible
to do that, or if other legislation were introduced, there would have
to be flexibility in relation to their use for other
purposes.</p><p><a name="06102037000123">For example,
there is a rather beautiful building at the Countess of Chester site
that, appropriately, is called the 1829 building&#151;it is a mental
institution of 1829. Clearly, it is not used as a mental health
hospital any longer; it is an administrative centre. However, if
someone were to make a planning application to incorporate the land and
convert the building to flats, I would find it difficult to argue
against the logic of
it.</p><p><a name="06102037000124"><b><a name="61020-0001.htm_spnew48"><a name="06102037000710">Mr.
Evans:</b> Many old mental institutions were asylums, and they
had a lot of trees and open green spaces. Developing existing buildings
is one thing, but building on the open green spaces, or even felling
trees, is completely different from that. One of my local authorities
is considering that issue, and we need protection for those areas
too.</p><p><a name="06102037000125"><b><a name="61020-0001.htm_spnew49"><a name="06102037000711">Andrew

curtilage of the parkland. It is a fair point. The old chapel that

covered by the Bill. That is perhaps wrong because it would make sense
for that building to be utilised in a modern setting. Definitional
problems need to be addressed.</p><p><a name="06102037000126">That applies equally to parks
that are clearly covered by the long title. Hon. Members on both sides
of the House are welcome to visit my constituency office, as my hon.
Friend the Minister has done. It is a converted stable in a park
setting, and the office is rather beautiful. I should put it on the
record that it is one of the best bits of value for money that any hon.
Member has negotiated. That information is, of course, in the public
domain these days.</p><p><a name="06102037000127">The buildings in the parkland
include an old family house that once belonged to the Grace family who
donated it to Ellesmere Port and Neston borough council, which in those
days was called Ellesmere Port urban district council. It was an
amazingly generous gift. The parkland contains the old house, the
stables and ancillary buildings. The buildings are used for public
purposes. The house is used by the Action Transport Theatre Company,
which may well have presented plays to school children in other
constituencies because it has gone as far afield as South Africa. Some
of the older buildings are used by a community gardening project, and
my office is shared with Sure Start. Had the local authority not been
able to find good community use for those buildings, it would have been
a criminal shame to see them standing unused. An argument could be made
for selling some of those where appropriate. I take the point made by
the hon. Member for Solihull that that could be left to the whim of the
local authority, but I am sure all hon. Members would agree that
&#147;where appropriate&#148; is not as black and white as she
suggested.</p><p><a name="06102037000128"><b><a name="61020-0001.htm_spnew50"><a name="06102037000712">James
Duddridge:</b> The hon. Gentleman mentions land that has been
donated to a local authority by a charitable benefactor. Many pieces of
land have been donated to Southend local authority, and conditions are
often attached to the use of such land. Is he as worried as I am that
some of the conditions in the Bill would cut across the original
intentions of those benefactors on the usage of that
land?</p><p><a name="06102037000129"><b><a name="61020-0001.htm_spnew51"><a name="06102037000713">Andrew

to be considered when the Bill is examined

across conditions set out in covenants. That is important and we would
need to examine it carefully. The first park I mentioned, Tudor Grange,
was donated by the Bird family, famous for the wonderful custard that
we still enjoy today. The problem in Solihull is that the land was

states:</p><a name="61020-0001.htmbrev_2"><a name="06102037000605"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;This
section applies to land owned by a local authority which

a definition of the land. What needs to be explained is whose opinion
would be relevant when considering those definitions. Would it be my
opinion, the hon. Lady&#146;s opinion, the local authority&#146;s
opinion, or the opinion of the hon. Member for Rochford and Southend,
East (James Duddridge), who asked what would happen if the land is
county land within an area governed by the district council&#146;s
planning authority? There could be a conflict and we need tight
definitions so that we are clear that the opinion is that of a defined
group of people.</p><p><a name="06102037000134">We
cannot rely on the opinion of the green-ink letter writer who no doubt
communicates with all hon. Members in the Chamber. It has to be the
opinion of a proper authority. The hon. Lady rightly and valiantly
covers the concept of parkland associations in clause 2, and that is a
valuable contribution to the debate. However, we need to be clear about

does not define whose opinion would be relevant to clause 1. That is a
fundamental drafting flaw. We need to be absolutely clear that the Bill
would address the outrageous situation that the hon. Lady described.
That cannot be done by Solihull council because it manifestly does not
care about a 350-year-old oak tree. There needs to be a rational
opinion that is sufficiently independent of the person selling the
land, but the Bill does not define who would have that authority. I

I agree with the hon. Member for Solihull that we should look at the

grateful for the hon. Gentleman&#146;s observation. It is important
for the House to be clear on these important matters. I thought it
appropriate to explore with the Bill&#146;s prime mover some of the
issues before determining which side of the fence I fall on later
today. As drafted, the Bill has
problems.</p><p><a name="06102037000139">On
referenda&#151;I prefer referendums, but I mention the pseudo-Latin
style&#151;it is important to examine the costs and benefits. If
something as significant as suggested by the hon. Lady were proposed,
having a referendum would be a good idea to test public opinion. A
public consultation&#151;not a referendum, but something
similar&#151;took place in my area, in which each household was asked
to vote about residents&#146; parking, which had been a controversial
issue. In the end, the local authority defined the scheme in
consultation with the public and then put it out to a vote. That makes
sense in certain circumstances.</p><p><a name="06102037000140">I would be rather more
careful&#151;it is perhaps an issue of definition&#151;in other
circumstances. The hon. Lady may be too absolutist in saying that a
local authority cannot sell &#147;a piece of land&#148;&#151;any
piece of land, however small for whatever purpose. I mentioned earlier
the problem with buildings inside the curtilage of parklands. The hon.
Member for Ribble Valley (Mr. Evans) provided the example of
an old mental health institution and I mentioned an old chapel. I
postulate that it is a derelict building, so its value is fairly
low&#151;let us say &#163;200,000 as I am not talking London
prices, but those that the hon. Gentleman and I understand. If the cost
of the referendum were &#163;250,000, it would be barmy to proceed on

is. The hon. Gentleman provides the example of a &#163;200,000
building and a referendum costing &#163;250,000&#151;but, frankly,
so what? It would act as a deterrent to a local authority if it thought
that the public was against the sale of part of the woodland. It could
deter the authority from going ahead with the project. He says that the
cost of the referendum could be more than the value of the building,

will do something inside the building that will have huge knock-on
community benefits. The buyer may be a substantial player in the
voluntary sector in the community, so the cost-benefits may need to be
described differently. As I said, I am not an expert on planning law.

bid to redevelop the park under the Heritage Lottery Fund, but I am
convinced that the only reason for that success was the partnership
between the local authority and the Friends of Whitby Park&#151;an

from footballers and bird watchers to bowlers and many others. Dozens
of different users work together positively in the interests of the

whether it is best for local authorities to establish such schemes or
whether things should evolve from the bottom up. However, there are
huge merits in such activity. I can tell the House from my experience
how well such an organisation works and how well it serves Whitby park.
It has provided checks and balances on top-down ideas coming from the
local authority, as well as encouraging dialogue that brings into focus
the needs of all users. When, for example, young people wanted a
hardball court and a climbing wall, there was a dialogue through the
community groups, agreement was reached and the end product is in
place.</p><p><a name="06102037000152">It is manifest

the views of the public seriously. For example, there was a series of
planning applications for the masonic hall in Whitby&#151;in
Ellesmere Port, not in Yorkshire&#151;but the local authority turned
them down, not because the existing building has any particular

trying to create artificial boundaries between town and country. Many

the people in the Public Bill Office. It was felt that agricultural
purposes belonged to a different sphere and that it would be too
complicated to try to legislate for agricultural situations. That is
why agricultural land is not covered by the
Bill.</p><p><a name="06102037000164"><b><a name="61020-0001.htm_spnew71"><a name="06102037000733">Andrew

right. The House recently passed a regulatory reform order governing
the work of the Forestry Commission, allowing more commercial activity
within the confines of lands owned by it. My Committee studied that
matter in some detail. Where land is defined as agricultural land, it
may be proper to leave the wording out of the Bill, but not every tree
in a rural area is planted on agricultural land. They can be in
domestic gardens, or on publicly owned land such as roadsides, and it
would be a mistake for the Bill to draw an artificial boundary between
suburban and rural areas, because there are trees worthy of protection
that grow on such land. I hope that the hon. Lady will consider that
point if the Bill reaches

want to go into, because it would take too much of the House&#146;s
time, but other definitional issues arise from this clause about
species, size, exceptions and what happens when nature does huge damage
to trees. An oak on the verge adjacent to my land lost a branch in the
gales at the beginning of September. Of course, there would have to be
exemptions for trees if, unlike that tree, they were so severely
damaged that they presented a risk to the public. On the other hand,
every sensible effort needs to be made to protect trees. I hope that
the definitional issues can be dealt with sensibly as the Bill
proceeds.</p><br>

individuals to decide. If the public delegate the decision to their
local authority, they have no more say about it. The issue in the hon.

that I am not seeking to make any more political points, but if the
party that has control is carrying out some project in an area where

nature, parkland sometimes sprawls over more than one local authority

of possession of that land and would feel aggrieved if a decision were

The decision to fell a 350-year-old oak tree&#151;if it was not
dangerous or diseased&#151;is appalling. It is shameful that
something as historic and probably as beautiful&#151;I have not seen
it&#151;as that grand oak has been felled. Has it been felled

hon. Member for Solihull (Lorely Burt) on bringing these important
issues before the House. I do not think I have ever been to Solihull, I
have no intention of going there, and I am not even sure exactly where
it is, except somewhere in the middle, but like the hon. Lady, we in my
area suffer from a Conservative council, which is not as robust as it
should be on a number of planning issues, to put it mildly.</p><p><a name="06102037000189">I welcome the broad thrust of
the Bill. It aims to protect the green belt and tackle some of the
problems of overdevelopment. It is wrong to say that people who care
about their local environment and the character of their area are
nimbys. They are not. They are people with genuine concerns. The task
for Government&#151;national Government or local government&#151;is
to find the right balance between protecting the character of an area
and meeting the desperate housing need of people who live in the area
and are not being provided for. That is a difficult balance to strike,
whether at national strategic level, at city-wide level as we grapple
with it through the Mayor of London&#146;s pronouncements on what we
should be doing about housing, or at local level. There are often
tensions between the different levels of government in that
respect.</p><p><a name="06102037000190">In my area we
are extremely concerned about the extent of development that is likely
to be undertaken. In my constituency, for example, over the next 10
years or so, I am expecting 10,000 to 15,000 extra households. That is
in just one constituency. In the borough as a whole, we face the
prospect of three to four times that&#151;a huge amount of
development. It is the fastest-growing part of London in terms of
housing development, which impacts significantly on the character of
the area and on the level of public services being provided. One of my
main concerns about our local authority&#146;s approach is that it
does not seem to be coming to grips with the demand on public services
that that additional growth will create, yet it sometimes seems to
adopt a &#147;rabbit in the headlights&#148; approach to some of
the applications coming its way. We need to think ahead about
education, health&#151;not only primary care, but acute
care&#151;roads and more mundane things like sewerage, water,
electricity and gas

before the House.</p><p><a name="06102037000191">I
referred to the huge problem in my constituency. However, density is
not necessarily a bad thing. I am not sure whether this is apocryphal
or not, but the most densely developed area in Britain is the Royal
crescent in Bath. That shows that with good design, density does not
have to look horrible or make the area an unpleasant place to live. The
challenge is how we can create the mixed communities that we need,
using good design and making better use of
land.</p><p><a name="06102037000192">One of my main
concerns with the Bill is that it appears to be facing two ways at
once. It is somewhat dirigiste, centralising powers and taking them
away from local authorities, yet other aspects of the Bill try to
devolve powers down to the lowest possible level. As such, it may fall
between two stools. I shall develop the point
later.</p><p><a name="06102037000193">We must be
careful not to interfere too much with the powers of local planning
authorities. Indeed, we should give them more powers. I am one of the
signatories to the early-day motion which suggests that local
authorities should be able to impose stronger requirements, for example
in relation to energy efficiency in buildings to tackle climate change,
going beyond the existing building regulations, which they are not
allowed to do at present. In fact, local authorities should be
encouraged to do that, rather than discouraged as they are at
present.</p><p><a name="06102037000194">I take issue
with suggestions by the Opposition, as expressed by the right hon.
Member for Suffolk, Coastal (Mr. Gummer), who is reported to
have made proposals to his leader, under the &#147;quality of
life&#148; heading, to scrap building regulations and abolish the
need for planning permission for alterations to non-listed,
non-conservation area housing built after 1945. That would be a
disastrous policy. The policy area &#147;quality of life&#148; also
provokes a wry smile from me, because that was the name of the policy
adopted by Lady Porter and Westminster city council&#151;most hon.
Members will know that I was the leader of the Labour group on the
council during her evil regime&#151;to mask her abuse of the planning
policies of the council to gerrymander the area for her own political
ends. Part of the gerrymandering scheme was never actually brought to
light because the district auditor drew stumps after examining the
housing allocation policy and did not examine the wider policies
adopted. In any case, it is interesting to note that the phrase
&#147;quality of life&#148; has been resurrected in Tory party
policy.</p><p><a name="06102037000195">Having said
that I welcome the broad thrust of the hon. Lady&#146;s intentions, I
turn to the Bill itself. She has admitted, with reason, that the Bill
is poorly drafted. Unfortunately, we have to address the Bill as it is
before us today, not as she would like it to be. If the late Eric Forth
had been here, he would have had little trouble in taking the Bill
apart, and I shall seek to emulate him in expressing my concerns about
it, as it is something of a curate&#146;s
egg.</p><p><a name="06102037000196">On introducing a

<notus-date day="20" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><b>20 Oct 2006 : Column 1150</b><br>nothing or very little. My concern is that although the Bill has a
degree of cross-party support for its objectives it is not very modest,
as the hon. Lady has tried to pack too many aims into it. Each of the
separate clauses of the Bill could be a private Member&#146;s Bill in
its own right. Perhaps she has been a little ambitious. The more issues
in a Bill, the more likely it is that someone will object to one of
them, leading to the downfall of the
Bill.</p><p><a name="06102037000197">I am also
concerned that the Bill has no price tag. I raised that point in an
intervention in the hon. Lady&#146;s speech earlier, and it is
incumbent on the House to have a rough idea of how much legislation
will cost before passing it. We also need to know where the costs will
fall, be it on the Government or local government, and on the
respective taxpayers. People in my constituency are very concerned
about the level of their local taxes, and the Bill contains no
provision for the costs to be
defrayed.</p><p><a name="06102037000198">My main
concern crops up in the first line of the long title, which
reads:</p><a name="61020-0001.htmbrev_6"><a name="06102037000609"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;To
impose conditions on the sale of
parkland&#148;.</p></ul><p><a name="06102037000199">I take
exception to the word &#147;sale&#148;, which means disposing of
land permanently, in this case presumably to a developer. But how does
that address the problem of the multifarious ways of developing land
that may not involve sale? For example, in my constituency, the local
authority is engaged in three major regeneration schemes of council
estates&#151;Spur Road/Stonegrove, West Hendon and Grahame
Park&#151;and it has come up with all sorts of complicated
arrangements and partnership deals. It is arguable whether the land is
being sold, leased or is still partly in the council&#146;s
ownership. One could argue that it had been sold for &#163;1, but a
case could also be made for the opposite view. By restricting the Bill
to sale of land, the hon. Lady would create a series of loopholes for
local authorities to use, if they were so
minded.</p><p><a name="06102037000200">The Grahame
Park estate is a major regeneration scheme designed to create a large
number of additional homes in the area. I take grave exception to the
scheme because it will provide no additional social housing. Indeed, it
will result in the net loss of social housing units, which is bizarre.
It is funded by a large growth of properties for sale, but part of the
scheme involves building on a significant area of green land around the
pond. It is a dense scheme and it will eat into the green land on the
estate. One of the key issues is the way in which the local authority
has consulted people, and it has not had a ballot of those living in
the area affected, as the hon. Lady suggests should happen. It would
have given the scheme more credibility if proper ballots had been held,
focused on the area. I agree with the hon. Lady on that point, and it
has certainly been a controversial issue on the estate and more
widely.</p><p><a name="06102037000201">I am also
concerned that the long title states that the Bill applies only to
local authorities&#151;an issue that I took up in an intervention in
the speech by my hon. Friend the Member for Ellesmere Port and Neston
(Andrew Miller), who helpfully raised the issue of land owned by the
Ministry of Defence. My constituency contains a lot of MOD land, much
of which is called Inglis Barracks and will probably be sold off next
year when the British Forces Post Office moves from the site to its
brand new premises elsewhere in London. That will release an enormous
site for housing development,

under any normal assessment. That disposal would not be covered by the
Bill.</p><p><a name="06102037000202">My constituency
also contains the old Hendon airfield, which was the first in the
country and a major second world war airfield. It has been nibbled away
and built on over the years, and the MOD disposed of the last big chunk
about 10 years ago. It was called the RAF East Camp site and it is now
a major housing development. Although it was technically a brownfield
site, before construction started it certainly looked like a greenfield
site. There are difficulties of definition of brownfield, greenfield
and parkland, and the land in question would certainly have fallen
within the scope of clause 1(1)(e). While it may have been a brownfield
site, it had certainly contributed to biodiversity in the area. The
Bill is broadly drawn, and would probably have caught that
site.</p><p><a name="06102037000203">Large NHS sites
are also disposed of, and that is not necessarily a bad thing. The new
Edgware hospital, opened by my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister
last spring, was in large part financed against the sale of land no
longer required on the site. It was a brownfield site that will be
redeveloped for housing, and that was a beneficial land disposal. In
the not too distant future, the Colindale hospital site will be
disposed of, after the elderly residential patients are moved out. The
land around the hospital is mostly
parkland.</p><p><a name="06102037000204"><b><a name="61020-0001.htm_spnew86"><a name="06102037000748">Andrew

have produced yet another result. That shows the difficulties with the

south&#151;would have had a large say in whether the hospital should
be redeveloped as it has been, to create the brand new community
hospital. Under the phraseology in the Bill, they would have been
excluded from that decision-making process. Therefore my hon. Friend
makes an important point, and I shall later give a few further examples

central Government, that is far more democratically remote than if it
is done by a local authority. Even if the Bill is not enacted, if a
decision is made to dispose of land, the local authority can, in theory
at least, be voted out by the local people, whereas the decision-making
processes at national level are far more remote. Although individual
Members might jump up and down about particular disposals, they will
obviously be relatively less influential than

the phrases &#147;public garden&#148; and &#147;purposes of

exactly does &#147;a disused burial ground&#148; mean? Often, large
parts of burial grounds are disused while other parts some distance
away are used. In that context, let me refer back to my experience on
Westminster city council. Most people are aware of the appalling
scandal of the Lady Porter regime&#151;one of its first
scandals&#151;when it sold three cemeteries for 5p each, and the
asset stripping that came with that. Coincidentally, although
Westminster city council owned the cemeteries, two of them were
situated in the London borough of Barnet&#151;one of them in my
constituency, and another in the neighbouring constituency of Finchley
and Golders Green.</p><p><a name="06102037000215">If
we are to dispose of such cemeteries, this question arises: who will be
consulted as part of a referendum? The relatives of people buried in
the cemetery? Westminster council tax payers, who own the cemeteries
that are being disposed of? London borough of Barnet residents, where
the cemeteries are situated? I would have been happy with any of those
options, if they had been in force at the time when Lady Porter decided

George&#151;not that that stopped it being burned down in spectacular
fashion earlier in the summer, when it was under development. It had
become something of a nature reserve, primarily because it had been
fenced off from the public for a long time. However, that is difficult
to define. Obviously, we have the definition of a site of special
scientific interest, and we have relatively small ones dotted around

on to subsection (2), and the discussions that we have been having
about the issue of referendums and consultation. I mentioned earlier
the sale of Westminster city council cemeteries. Indeed, my hon. Friend
the Member for Ellesmere Port and Neston raised another such example.
There is a major concern in that, if consultations are not properly
done or defined, they can be rigged to produce the desired result. The
best recent such example in my constituency was Barnet council&#146;s
decision to reopen Partingdale lane&#151;a country lane that had been
closed off at one end by the previous Labour administration, in
accordance with the residents&#146; wishes. The council was
determined to reopen the lane and had a fake consultation, which the
residents challenged successfully through judicial review. A further,
much wider consultation took place, which inevitably produced the
result that the council wanted, because it was spread so wide that
those most directly affected&#151;those who actually lived
there&#151;were completely outvoted by those for whom the road might
provide rather tenuous potential help with their transport links. So
there is a real problem with how we define who should be consulted in a
local
referendum.</p><br>

possibility of referendums serving to undermine, rather than
strengthen, local democracy. There is certainly a need for much better
and more effective consultation on the part of local authorities, but I
question whether referendums are the best way of doing it. The hon.
Member for Ribble Valley came up with a whole series of very
interesting suggestions, but I should be concerned if such referendums
were linked to local government elections or, indeed, any other
elections. There is always the risk that a single issue, which might
not be fundamental to the governance of the local or wider area, could
become dominant, to the extent that the election becomes a single-issue
campaign.</p><p><a name="06102037000233"><b><a name="61020-0001.htm_spnew100"><a name="06102037000762">Mr.

but I recall that as we approached the European elections, the Prime
Minister gave us a referendum on the constitution in order that he
could separate out that issue and that people could vote on the
constitution. He felt that without such a referendum his own chances
might be damaged. As it was, it did not really matter, because he did
very poorly in the European elections. However, my point is that a
referendum can actually strengthen democracy by separating out the
issue in question.</p><p><a name="06102037000234"><b><a name="61020-0001.htm_spnew101"><a name="06102037000763">Mr.

probably a question of horses for courses, according to the nature and
scale of the issue to be consulted on.</p><p><a name="06102037000238">I am also concerned about the
issue of referendum participation rates, which was raised by the hon.
Member for Ribble Valley. In my local government area, the electorate
is some 350,000. If only 5 per cent. of the electorate turn out at a
referendum&#151;whether or not it is linked to a local authority or
other election&#151;because only 5 per cent. are affected by the
issue in question, we are talking about an enormously expensive
operation for a very limited benefit. Moreover, what will it tell
people at the end of the process? The hon. Gentleman hit on an idea
when he talked about the experience of California, where a proposition
can be put on the ballot paper, but only after it has been petitioned
by a certain threshold of local government electors. Perhaps that is
the way forward. The presenting of a petition by a certain percentage
of electors in a ward, constituency or borough is a possible way of
triggering a referendum. We certainly need some form of
threshold.</p><br>

question, which is, how does one have such a system without undermining
the whole democratic process itself? If we are to have the occasional
referendum on whether a particular piece of land should be sold, that
is one thing. I am certainly not advocating the extension of the
California system in its entirety, whereby every issue under the sun
would be balloted at a local election or otherwise. We are talking
about a relatively limited issue, but I should be concerned if the
decision to hold a referendum on the disposal of land became a Trojan
horse for referendums on a whole batch of other issues as well. In my
view, that would certainly undermine the whole principle of
representative government on which our constitution is based.</p><p><a name="06102037000241">I question whether clause 2 is
really necessary. In my area, various friends&#146; groups maintain
and try to improve parks. Establishing a parkland association seems an
extremely bureaucratic and formalised way of proceeding. How does the
hon. Member for Solihull expect a local authority to ensure that an
association is properly representative of the local
community?</p><p><a name="06102037000242"><b><a name="61020-0001.htm_spnew107"><a name="06102037000769">Lorely
Burt:</b> The clause states that a local authority
&#147;may&#148; establish a parkland association. I took on board
the point made earlier by the hon. Member for Ellesmere Port and Neston
(Andrew Miller), who referred to top-down and bottom-up approaches. As
far as our group is concerned, a bottom-up approach is generally
preferable.</p><p><a name="06102037000243"><b><a name="61020-0001.htm_spnew108"><a name="06102037000770">Mr.
Dismore:</b> I hear what the hon. Lady says, but clause 2(2)
also imposes a duty on a local authority in terms of the representative
nature of an association. I suspect that no local authority would adopt
that permissive power, because it would create far more problems than
it would be worth. However, in a given area&#151;we all have such
areas&#151;two or three local people might be very exercised about a
particular issue, while others might be half-interested and most not
interested at all. The latter group might be rather more representative
of the community, by definition, than those who have taken a specific
interest. It would be very difficult to ensure that such an association
was appropriately diverse in ethnicity, age, occupation, interest and
so on, particularly in a very diverse multicultural constituency such
as mine, where a plethora of different groups and interests would need
to be represented. So such a way forward is rather a pious
hope.</p><p><a name="06102037000244">Clause 3 gives
rise to a very important issue that is at the heart of the debate
surrounding development and affordable homes. In my area, one often
finds on turning a street corner that the old houses have been knocked
down and a block of flats has gone up. That happens far too much,
particularly on the main roads in my constituency, and it seems to be a
trend that is impossible to stop. We need to think about how we can

prescriptive in the manner of the Bill is to over-egg the pudding,
because the Bill provides none of the balance that might be needed in a
particular area. I am with the hon. Member for Solihull, in that this
issue has to be taken into account. However, the Bill gives no
indication of the size of garden in question. In my area, gardens range
from several acres, at the rich end of the constituency, to postage
stamps at the poor end. Different considerations might well apply to
those two extremes and to the range in between.</p><p><a name="06102037000245">The development of back gardens
is a major concern for residents of Mill Hill, in my constituency,
where the big gardens and houses happen to be located. Some people have
sold off their back gardens to developers, who have applied for
planning consent to build four or five houses on that land. That raises
access issues, as well as the question of overdevelopment. However, if
what are virtually slum clearance projects relating to houses with very
small back gardens were caught by the provision, that could work
against the benefit that the hon. Member for Solihull is trying to
achieve. Perhaps she therefore needs to think a little more about that,
although the broad thrust of trying to protect back gardens and zoning
them as greenfield sites is appropriate. We must do something to
protect what is, certainly in my constituency, part of the green belt,
even if it is not formally defined as such.</p><p><a name="06102037000246">We must not, however, allow
nimbyism to get in the way of trying to provide homes for people in our
areas who need them. There is a desperate housing shortage in my
constituency, which the London borough of Barnet seems to be doing very
little to address. Its new housing strategy does not seem to put
anything like sufficient emphasis on, for example, the need for social
housing. In London, the purchase of what are termed affordable homes,
even with the subsidised schemes available to buy properties, is still
way beyond the means of many Londoners, including in my constituency.
The only real hope of new housing for such people is social housing,
which, unfortunately, the London borough of Barnet&#151;completely
wrongly, in my view&#151;seems little concerned to provide. Whatever
conditions and ideas are put forward on planning, we must make sure
that they do not prevent people from having the housing that they
desperately need.</p><p><a name="06102037000247"><b><a name="61020-0001.htm_spnew109"><a name="06102037000771">Mr.

try to square the circle of protecting the green belt and providing the
necessary housing, some of the suggestions to resolve development and
zoning problems are becoming progressively wackier. The most bizarre
suggestion came in the summer from the right hon. Member for Wokingham
(Mr. Redwood), who said that we should reclaim and sell
underwater land to developers, which would encompass</p><a name="61020-0001.htmbrev_11"><a name="06102037000614"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;a mighty city called Thames

policy is also sinking fast if it is based on what he has in
mind.</p><p><a name="06102037000253">To return to
the specifics of the Bill, the hon. Member for Solihull needs to think
a little more about clause 3. I do not object to her intention to
protect greenfield back gardens, but we need to be more precise about
the language and thresholds used, and perhaps provide some
countervailing argument in relation to housing need. As I said in my
opening remarks, on the one hand she is trying to adopt a localising
policy in relation to a referendum, while on the other hand the clause
is very centralising, and contains no provision to take account of
local circumstances and local needs. It is just too prescriptive. That
brings me back to my earlier point that the Bill is a little too
ambitious. I am not sure which hon. Gentleman initially proposed the
Bill to deal just with this one issue; I spoke in support of that Bill
in principle at the time, although with some reservations about the
wording. To achieve the right balance, however, a self-contained Bill
with more than one clause dealing with all the different aspects is
required.</p><p><a name="06102037000254">On clause 4
and the right to appeal against granted planning permission, the hon.
Lady has hit on an interesting subject. People in my constituency get
very cross when the Conservative-controlled council gives planning
consent to projects that, frankly, it should not allow. Other than
judicial review, which is virtually impossible in planning
cases&#151;rather than the cost, the law itself gets in the way, as
the test is so high&#151;local communities have no remedy whatever to
challenge decisions of local planning authorities. With regard to
clause 1, that is particularly so where the development is one in which
the local authority may be involved, as in the case of the schemes in
my constituency that I mentioned, and it is giving itself planning
consent to do its own thing. Where is the check and balance in the
democratic process to control a local authority giving itself planning
consent? At the moment, there is none,

the new extended powers that will go to the London Mayor. Those powers
are a very blunt instrument to deal with an issue that might not merit
such huge attention, and they are very hit and miss, as the Secretary
of State, with the best will in the world, will not involve himself in
an issue that is relatively small beer nationally, although it might be
a big concern locally. The hon. Lady needs to work harder on the
wording. There are all sorts of different development plans, and all
sorts of sub-plans, such as area action plans. Some work on definitions
is therefore needed.</p><p><a name="06102037000255">In addition, who is permitted
to object to the application? That is where I bring in my concerns
under the Human Rights Act. As the hon. Lady might know, I am Chairman
of the Joint Committee on Human Rights, although my Committee has not
considered her Bill&#151;which I suspect she is not surprised to
hear&#151;so I am speaking from my immediate impressions rather than
from any considered legal analysis. I would be concerned, however,
about whether the clause engages article 1 of the first protocol of
part 2 on protection of property. Does it affect property rights in a
way that may contravene the Human Rights Act? I asked her
earlier&#151;I suspect that the answer is no&#151;whether she had
had her Bill monitored or proof-read, as it were, for compliance with
the Act. If it does not comply with the Human Rights Act, the House has
no business passing it.</p><p><a name="06102037000256">The reason that I raise this
issue is that several conflicting property rights are involved. There
is the question of proportionality, which the Human Rights Act
reflects, as well as the property rights of the person who owns the
land that will be developed, perhaps the property rights of the
shareholders of the company that owns it, and the property rights of
people who may not be on the land but whose house prices may be
affected by a development. All those conflicting aspects have to be
taken into account when such measures are proposed.</p><p><a name="06102037000257">Again, there is the question of
a society &#147;sufficiently representing&#148; local amenity
interests. All our constituencies have effective and well-established
amenity groups. For instance, my constituency has the Mill Hill
Preservation Society, an active group that considers such issues, and I
pay tribute to its sterling work and the money that it sometimes has to
raise to fight appalling planning applications which it seems the local
authority might permit or it sometimes has to raise on appeal. I have
no doubt that it is representative of the local community, and 100 or
more people turn up to its annual meetings. We also know, however, as
we are all politicians, that it is often relatively easy to set up
behind the scenes a front organisation for a political party or for a
small group of people in order to hijack an organisation if it is not
well attended and effective. I would be concerned at growth in such
front organisations or in the hijacking of organisations, which the
hon. Lady&#146;s Bill as it stands might provoke. Will she explain
how she would define a society that sufficiently represents local
amenity interests?</p><p><a name="06102037000258">There is also the question of
how a local amenity is to be defined. There could be differences of
view. I agree with the hon. Lady in principle about the need to

planning guidance and local authority planning policies, however they
may be expressed in whichever document, but she should tighten the
definition of those who are entitled to object. If we are not careful,
the planning inspectorate, which is already bogged down with appeals
against refusals, will become bogged down with appeals against consents
as well.</p><p><a name="06102037000259">The right to
appeal should exist, although I hope it will never be used. It might
cause those who make planning decisions to be a little more careful
about what they say, and a little more considerate of local feeling,
which is often overlooked. In particular, constraints imposed by the
Standards Board for England suggest that councillors representing
particular wards should not participate in the planning process, which
strikes me as an Alice in Wonderland approach to planning. Wherever
that approach originated, it needs to be sorted out. In my view,
someone who has been elected to represent an area should be able to
speak out on behalf of his or her constituents, whatever the Standards
Board may say. If that is against Government policy, so be it. I feel
quite strongly on the
subject.</p><p><a name="06102037000260"><b><a name="61020-0001.htm_spnew113"><a name="06102037000775">Mrs.

Lady Porter. I will say no more, Mr. Deputy Speaker, as I
see you are about to tell me off for straying down the highways and
byways of Westminster history yet again. My basic point is that the
hon. Lady should be a little careful about the definition, although I
support the basic thrust of clause
4.</p><p><a name="06102037000262">Clause 5 deals with
repeat planning applications. My area has been bedevilled by them. One
problem with which the law has yet to get to grips is the submission of
applications that are a little like those that preceded them, but not
sufficiently similar to be classed as repeat applications. We need to
examine that aspect of planning law, and adopt a rather more
broad-brush approach. If the site is the same and the application is
more or less the same, it should be deemed to be a repeat
application.</p><p><a name="06102037000263">We all
know what developers do. They will try to buy up a row of family houses
with options to winkle out people who do not want to sell. They will
put in a planning application for 50 flats, which is turned down. They
will then put in an application for 45 or 40 or 35 flats. Each
application will be just different enough not to be caught by the
regime, in order to wear down local opposition. That should not be
allowed. We need a much tougher approach to such behaviour by
developers.</p><p><a name="06102037000264">The hon.
Lady suggests a three-year rather than a two-year threshold. She has
not said why she feels that two, three or, for that matter, five years
would not be equally appropriate. Perhaps she will tell us why she
plumped for three years. I do not think that the

with the present rules relating to repeat applications is the one that
I have just described&#151;applications that are not really different
from those that preceded them.</p><p><a name="06102037000265">Clause 6 concerns trees. Like
everyone else, I like to hug a tree, although not an oak tree with a
green top&#151;when it is a logo, that is. I am quite happy to hug an
oak tree for real. What worries me is that although the clause refers
to</p><a name="61020-0001.htmbrev_12"><a name="06102037000615"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;trees in urban or
suburban areas&#148;,</p></ul><p><a name="06102037000266">there
is no reference to trees in general. Examples were given earlier of
trees in rural areas that ought to be protected. What about those
trees? Perhaps the hon. Lady should delete the reference to urban or
suburban areas, and refer simply to the preservation of trees more
generally. Development is taking place in the countryside. I know that
that is, to a degree, a politically controversial issue between the
parties. We all want as much development as possible on brownfield
sites, but inevitably there will be some encroachment on green land,
and in those circumstances we should ensure that mature, historic trees
are protected as much as possible in that environment as
well.</p><p><a name="06102037000267">Clause 7 refers
to expenses. I challenged the hon. Lady on the subject earlier. I am
concerned about the fact that we have no indication of the potential
cost of the Bill. We might have a rough idea if we considered the
clauses one by one in relation to our constituencies, because we all
have a pretty good idea of what is happening on or own patches, but the
notion that we could assess the likely cost nationwide is an impossible
dream.</p><p><a name="06102037000268">At this point
I should put on my Eric Forth hat. The late Eric Forth would have taken
the hon. Lady to pieces, but I shall try to be a little more gentle. As
she has presented the House with a Bill that is likely to cost
taxpayers money, we need to know what the cost will be. For instance,
will the cost of an appeal against a grant of planning consent be borne
by the appellant, the developer or the central Government taxpayer,
through the planning inspectorate? A plethora of appeals against grants
could lead to a very expensive
operation.</p><p><a name="06102037000269">We also
need to know the potential cost of the referendums proposed by the hon.
Lady. We can all probably work out what the cost would be in our
constituencies, but how many referendums does she expect to be held in
a year? Answering that question would require a breakdown of the number
of planning applications and land disposals taking place in a year,
which would be a major research project in its own right. Until we have
a grip on the scale of the problem, it will be impossible to attach a
price tag. The hon. Lady ought to do a bit of research to try to
establish, perhaps by means of a survey of local authorities, how many
such cases have arisen in the past five or 10 years. That would produce
an average number of cases, from which it would be possible to
calculate the likely number of referendums and, in turn, the cost
involved.</p><p><a name="06102037000270">The hon.

no cross-reference between clause 1 and clause 7. As it stands, clause
7 would apply only to central Government costs, and as far as I can see
the lion&#146;s share would result from the planning appeals clause.
It seems that the cost of a referendum will fall on the poor old local
government taxpayer. That may not be a bad thing, but if there is to be
a trigger mechanism, people ought to be aware of what a referendum will
cost them in council tax. The importance of the issue could then be
weighed against the cost of consultation. There is a lacuna in the Bill
with which the hon. Lady must deal: what will it cost Joe Public in
income or council
tax?</p><p><a name="06102037000271">Regulations under
clause 8 would be made under the negative resolution procedure. I have
concerns about that, given that we are talking about significant
property issues. Why has the hon. Lady chosen to implement the Bill
through the negative procedure instead of the affirmative procedure to
which such issues are much more suited? Particularly as regards some of
the key planning issues, I should think that the House would want to
have its say through the affirmative procedure instead of merely trying
to annul proposals from the Department.</p><p><a name="06102037000272">I turn to the commencement
provisions. Clause 10(2) says that the Bill would come into effect
within two months of its passing through Parliament. That is a rather
ambitious timetable. There could be several consequences if the Bill
came into force so quickly. A blight could suddenly be put on a scheme
that is halfway through because no one has had time to prepare for the
Bill. Planning blight is already a problem. We could find that people
are trying to trigger referendums all over the place without giving any
thought to the bureaucracy involved for local authorities in
implementing them. A mandatory two-month period would leave no wriggle
room to make the Bill
work.</p><p><a name="06102037000273"><b><a name="61020-0001.htm_spnew115"><a name="06102037000777">Mr.
Evans:</b> There is also a danger that if the period is too
long some local authorities that were thinking of trying to dispose of
parklands might bring that forward. We must be careful about the
timing.</p><p><a name="06102037000274"><b><a name="61020-0001.htm_spnew116"><a name="06102037000778">Mr.
Dismore:</b> The hon. Gentleman makes another important
point.</p><p><a name="06102037000275">What else might
happen? If the Secretary of State had to issue guidance on back
gardens, I suspect, knowing the wheels of Whitehall, that it would take
rather more than two months to draft guidance on such an important
issue affecting so many people. I have highlighted several of the
issues and problems that would have to be addressed in such guidance.
There would have to be consultation among interested parties as to how
it should be drafted, as is always the case, rightly, when PPGs are
issued. Local authorities, developers and community groups would have
to be consulted to ensure that the guidance to the local planning
authority is correct. That consultation period would have to take more
than two months. There is nothing in the commencement date provisions
for different commencement dates for different clauses, as might have
been appropriate.</p><p><a name="06102037000276">If
there were to be appeals against grants for planning consultation, the
planning inspectorate would

<notus-date day="20" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><b>20 Oct 2006 : Column 1163</b><br>have to gear up for them. The Bill would require it to do something that
it has never been asked to do before. It would have to hire and train
additional staff to cope with an inevitable increase in appeals, as
well as undertaking a degree of retraining for existing staff as to
what criteria they should take into account when judging such appeals,
and developing the basic ground rules for the process that would need
to be established. The cost regime would also have to be worked out and
consulted on. The hon. Lady needs to think about some of the
implications.</p><p><a name="06102037000277">Clause
5 refers to a period of two years or three years. Where did the
three-year period come from? I suspect that it was plucked out of the
air. The Department would need to consult people more widely about the
practicalities as regards the appropriate period to determine whether
it should be two years, three years, or possibly longer. It would have
been better for clause 5 to give the Secretary of State a
regulation-making power to vary the two or three-year period after
appropriate consultations, with an affirmative resolution placed before
the House.</p><p><a name="06102037000278">Clause 6
deals with guidance to local planning authorities on the protection of
trees. The Secretary of State would be required to issue guidance under
section 197 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990. We have
canvassed several different ways in which that could be achieved, and
whether it is necessary to extend the provision to rural as well as
urban and suburban areas. There may be a need to have different
guidance in different parts of the country. Rural development may
require different guidance from urban development and, again, from
suburban development. Each aspect would require wide consultation with
amenity groups and, I suspect, arboricultural experts as well as local
authorities. The idea that one can achieve such consultation and
produce the guidance in two months is wishful
thinking.</p><p><a name="06102037000279">When
considering cost, we must not forget the Treasury&#151;the elephant
in every room when we discuss private Members&#146; Bills&#151;and
the provision that it would need to set aside for the Department for
Communities and Local Government to enable it to meet the additional
costs involved. Budgets are always under pressure and we would need
additional resources to meet the planning inspectorate&#146;s costs.
Local authorities will not have factored the cost of holding
referendums into their budgets and perhaps we should be more
sympathetic about allowing them to budget for such
matters.</p><p><a name="06102037000280">There are
several alternatives to clause 10(2). I agree with the hon. Member for
Ribble Valley that the period should not be too long. However, what
constitutes too long a period? Allowing for the consultations, drafting
and budgeting processes, it would be difficult to bring the Bill into
force in a shorter time than 12 months. An alternative would be to
provide that some clauses were effected at a time that the Secretary of
State &#147;may or shall prescribe.&#148; That commonly happens
with such
Bills.</p><p><a name="06102037000281"><b><a name="61020-0001.htm_spnew117"><a name="06102037000779">Mr.
Evans:</b> To safeguard against local authorities trying to
dispose of land in the interim period, perhaps the Government could let
them know that, if they tried such tricks, their applications could be
called in.</p><br>

from the Department that such behaviour would be viewed dimly. However,
the hon. Member for Solihull should reconsider clause 10(2), because
two months is far too short a period and somewhat overambitious. I
understand her enthusiasm for the Bill, but if she wants to reintroduce
it in the next Session&#151;it clearly has little prospect of making
progress this Session&#151;she might like to ponder on some of the
concerns that have been expressed today about its drafting and perhaps
return with a measure that was a little more modest and better worked
out.</p><p><a name="06102037000283"><b><a name="61020-0001.htm_spnew119"><a name="06102037000781">Mr.

Mr. Deputy Speaker. I am sure that you recall that, at the
beginning of today&#146;s proceedings, the hon. Member for Hendon
(Mr. Dismore), while telling us about the early hour that he
arrived here and the excitement with which he reads every day&#146;s
Order Paper, said that the Bill promoted by my hon. Friend the Member
for Cotswold (Mr. Clifton-Brown) had disappeared from the
Order Paper since yesterday. I believe that approximately 15 private
Members&#146; Bill have disappeared, but not that promoted by my hon.
Friend, which did not appear on yesterday&#146;s Order Paper. The
hon. Member for Hendon may therefore have inadvertently misled the
House. I am sure that, in the interests of accuracy, you will want to
correct the record, Mr. Deputy

order was such that it did not strictly constitute a point of order.
However, I have now allowed the hon. Member for Uxbridge
(Mr. Randall) to make a counter point, from which I am sure
the House will benefit. If he is correct, all our sympathies go to the
hon. Member for Hendon because a little more attention to detail would
have spared him an early morning alarm

congratulate the hon. Member for Solihull (Lorely Burt) on promoting
the Bill. I agree with much of its content although, by her own
admission, it is not the tidiest measure. I would not be so critical as
to use the word &#147;untidy&#148;, but the number of clauses and
the breadth of the subject matter that the Bill attempts to cover do
not make for good legislation. However, they make for a good, extensive
debate.</p><p><a name="06102037000286">The hon.
Member for Ellesmere Port and Neston (Andrew Miller) spoke of the Grace
family in his constituency. In Southend, several families have donated
land to the local authority for a specific purpose. I am particularly
concerned about circumstances in which land has been donated to the
local authority with the express intent of being used for educational
purposes in the town. If that land were left as parkland, and nothing
were done with it because of a lack of investment, the terms of the
Bill could mean that that parkland could not have a new city academy
built on it, for example.</p><br>

impossible to adapt for other uses land that had been donated for use
as a sports facility and was being used as a playing field. Nowadays,
however, people do not go out and play rugby, football or hockey as
much as they used to; instead, they are more likely to undertake
sporting and fitness activity in a gym. It might therefore be more
appropriate that the land have a gym built on it for public use, rather
than remaining as a playing field.</p><p><a name="06102037000288"><b><a name="61020-0001.htm_spnew122"><a name="06102037000784">Lorely
Burt:</b> I am sorry to intervene on the hon. Gentleman so
early in his speech. It is certainly not the intention of the Bill that
anyone should be precluded from building on land that has been
specifically intended for such a purpose. The intention is that local
people should have a say in the matter.</p><p><a name="06102037000289"><b><a name="61020-0001.htm_spnew123"><a name="06102037000785">James
Duddridge:</b> There might be a contradiction between what
local people want now and the original intention for the use of the
land. For example, I have played sports a number of times on land that
was given to the local authority specifically for the use and benefit
of a big company in the town. If that company were to move away from
the town, would it not be more appropriate to sell the land&#151;for
whatever purpose, and to whatever company, including a
supermarket&#151;so that other land could be purchased near the new
corporate headquarters? Sometimes what local people want and the
original intention for the land do not match up perfectly.</p><p><a name="06102037000290">Unlike my hon. Friend the
Member for Ribble Valley (Mr. Evans), I am not a great
supporter of local referendums. The example of California clearly
demonstrates what can happen when we reach referendum overload.
Moreover, certain propositions within a referendum can be
contradictory, and, if used too frequently, referendums can be
detrimental to local democracy.</p><p><a name="06102037000291">I enjoyed the lengthy
contribution of the hon. Member for Hendon (Mr. Dismore). It
is unfortunate that he is no longer in his place. I felt, however, that
he did his modesty a disservice with his constant references to the
late Eric Forth. I knew Eric only for about a year, but I think that
the hon. Gentleman has a little more to do before he reaches the dizzy
heights of my late right hon. Friend.</p><p><a name="06102037000292">Clause 1 refers to &#147;a
piece of land&#148;. If my reading of this provision is correct, it
is a little too prescriptive. I can imagine areas of parkland of which
only a modest element may be given up, in which case a consultation
would not be needed. For example, there might be a proposal to build a
small road down one side of a park to allow access to a larger area.
Also, proposals to use small pieces of land for certain purposes would
not need to be subject to the same degree of consultation as others
relating to larger projects. Building an Asda supermarket on parkland,
for example, is materially different from building a small scout hut in
the corner of a piece of land.</p><p><a name="06102037000293">On behalf of local authorities,
I was angered by the proposal in clause 2 that</p><a name="61020-0001.htmbrev_13"><a name="06102037000616"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;local authorities may establish a

do not see why they should not already do so. Independent elected
officials do not need to wait for

State&#151;to give them permission to establish such an association.
Clause 2 also
says:</p><a name="61020-0001.htmbrev_14"><a name="06102037000617"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;The
Secretary of State may make regulations about parkland
associations.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06102037000295">I believe,
however, that the House already gives Secretaries of State far too much
power to regulate, and to give them the power to regulate parkland
associations that are, at the moment, rather ill-defined would be very
unwise.</p><p><a name="06102037000296">I enjoyed
reading clause 3, and I support most of its provisions. However, I have
already mentioned that the Bill covers too many issues&#151;indeed,
the private Member&#146;s Bill introduced by my hon. Friend the
Member for Tunbridge Wells (Greg Clark) deals with the development of
private gardens in a lot more detail. I recognise, however, that
including clause 3 has given us another opportunity to support the move
to make building on the back gardens of private houses slightly more
difficult.</p><p><a name="06102037000297">Clause 4
is about the right to appeal against planning permission granted by
local government. Again, that is a laudable provision, but I am not
sure that it fits particularly well in the Bill. In Southend, some of
the ugliest buildings were built by the local authority. Certainly, the
civic centre, which was built in the 1950s and &#146;60s, would
benefit from demolition. If one went around any town centre pointing
out the worst buildings, one would find that they were usually built by
the local authority or by Government. The same duty of care, and the
same protections in respect of quality of architecture, should apply to
local government and Government buildings, and to private sector
buildings.</p><p><a name="06102037000298">Clause 6 on
the protection of trees is interesting but, again, the subject is very
complicated, and I suspect that any measure that could do it justice
would run to many pages. A number of hon. Members expressed concern
about the phrase &#147;urban or suburban&#148;, and the hon. Member
for Solihull responded on that point. I suggest exempting agricultural
land&#151;that would do the job, and it seems that it would not
present any further problems. Several hon. Members spoke about problems
arising from different species of tree, and the lack of a definition of
large and mature trees. Certainly, that needs to be sorted
out.</p><p><a name="06102037000299">There has been a
lot of emotive talk about the 350-year-old oak tree. I do not want to
go into detail because I do not know the specifics of the situation,
but we should be careful about making broad, sweeping statements. There
are cases in which one could imagine cutting down even the oldest of
trees to build something, even if the building were something as lowly
as a supermarket. If the whole community has to travel 30 miles in
polluting cars to get to a supermarket; if an extra road, which would
cause further pollution, is needed so that people can get to that
supermarket; and if, as part of the developer&#146;s proposal, 100
new oak trees were to be planted, perhaps the equation does balance.
Often, when we oppose a development, we pick on certain features of the
case because they sound good; a lesser spotted butterfly or a very rare
oak is good for PR, but that does not necessarily make for good
legislation.</p><p><a name="06102037000300">I share
the concerns expressed by hon. Members on both sides of the Chamber
about the lack of detail 
<br>

<meta name="Date" content="20 Oct 2006">

<notus-date day="20" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><b>20 Oct 2006 : Column 1167</b><br>about expenditure in the Bill. It occurs to me that it does not make
sense for the Crown to pay for all of the measures. If a supermarket is
looking to build in an area, and the local authority, or indeed this
House, decides that a referendum is needed, surely it is for the
supermarket to pay for that referendum as part of its costs. I remind
hon. Members that I do not agree with holding such referendums, but if
the Bill were enacted, and referendums were required, surely it would
be for the supermarket or the developer to pay for
them.</p><p><a name="06102037000301">On clause 9, it
is a personal bugbear of mine that unitary authorities never seem to be
mentioned in legislation. I represent a constituency in which there is
a unitary authority, and we feel a little left out. The Minister for
Local Government looks at me quizzically. I have raised the subject
before, and I understand that unitary authorities are covered by the
terms &#147;county council&#148; and &#147;district
council&#148;, but we do feel like the poor relation. In addition, it
strikes me that, simply to avoid wasting paper, it would be much more
efficient if we set out a definition of local authorities in one piece
of legislation, rather than having to do so in every Bill, which makes
no sense whatever.</p><p><a name="06102037000302">I
am sure that the hon. Lady will want to reflect on clause 10, and the
good points made by the hon. Member for Hendon about the two-month
period and what will happen to existing applications. My hon. Friend
the Member for Ribble Valley (Mr. Evans) made some good
suggestions, too. Perhaps we could block new sales, if the Bill were
made law.</p><p><a name="06102037000303">I
congratulate the hon. Member for Solihull on the Bill, but because of
the number of problems with it, I will not support it in its current

of important issues.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="61020-0001.htmordayhd_7"><a name="06102037000652">12.20

Conservative Members have characterised their party as one of low

the most part, is fussy and nannyish, is largely unnecessary.</p><p><a name="06102037000305">I was going to confine myself
to clause 3, but I shall illustrate my point with brief reference to
other clauses. How widespread, for example, is the evil that clause 1

which exercises there, but there is some open space. Because my

<notus-date day="20" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><b>20 Oct 2006 : Column 1168</b><br>space is rare, so it is even more precious than it is to the
constituents of hon. Members who have large areas of open space in
their constituencies. In the past 30 years, I can recall only one
successful attempt to build on parkland. Inevitably, it was a
Conservative council that decided for reasons that are now lost in the
mists of time to construct town houses on the edge of the beautiful
Victorian Ravenscourt park just outside my constituency. It was a sin
and a crime, and the council were soon thrown out for that and many
other offences. The case for legislation is debatable, because over the
years I have discovered that popular opposition to such schemes is
easily mobilised, particularly with the advent of better means of
communication such as the net.</p><p><a name="06102037000307">Like a number of hon. Members,
I am not a fan of referendums, partly because the public are not fans,
and turnout is often lamentably low. If referendums are to be part of
our constitutional structure, they should be reserved for major
constitutional issues, as has been the case in the past. We have held
referendums on the then common market and on devolution, and we may
hold one on the euro in future. A referendum on the sale of land is,
however, too specialised. Unfortunately, for the first time in 20
years, there is a Conservative council in one of the boroughs in my
constituency. In the past four weeks, it has decided to close one of
the largest schools in the borough without proper consultation, to sack
every home help and to tear up the affordable rented housing programme.
All those issues are as important to my constituents as the issue
raised by the hon. Lady.</p><p><a name="06102037000308">Are we to have referendums on
every issue that comes up locally? Is that not something that we are
all familiar with the Liberal Democrats doing&#151;changing their
mind about deciding when they want to use one route and when they want
to use another? Having elected a local authority, for good or ill,
there are other ways to put pressure on it than constant resort to
referendums, which might not have a great deal of validity, as we have
seen from some voluntary referendums on raising tax
levels.</p><p><a name="06102037000309">Equally, in
relation to clause 5 and the points made about trees, which featured a
lot earlier in the debate, there are tree preservation orders as well
as well-laid-down regulations and local authority powers to protect
trees. I agree that those are abused&#151;often, if not by local
authorities, then by developers&#151;but it is my submission that the
remedy, again, is in process, not corrective
legislation.</p><p><a name="06102037000310">To come
to clause 3, which is perhaps the clearest in the Bill, I fear that the
hon. Member for Solihull is being led up the garden path by the
Conservative party. Before the long recess, I took part in an
Opposition day debate&#151;I do not know whether she did so
too&#151;but I found that debate quite surreal. If I recall
correctly, only the day before the debate was held the subject was
changed from general housing policy to the narrow and specific issue
of, as it is put, building on back
gardens.</p><p><a name="06102037000311">I
found that a peculiar choice of subject for a reason that might inform
and help the hon. Lady in considering whether she wants to proceed with
the Bill. Contrary to what the Conservative party has said, the
classification of back gardens as brownfield land originated in 1985,
under a Conservative Administration. Indeed, as late as 1992, planning
guidance said:</p><br>

Sometimes it may be acceptable to develop back gardens for new housing

environment.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06102037000312">Since
the Labour Government were elected in 1997, development on previously
residential land&#151;that, of course, is not back gardens, but could
be the footprint of a house or another property&#151;has dropped
dramatically. In 1986, the proportion of ordinary dwellings built on
previously residential land stood at 26 per cent., whereas it was down
to 15 per cent. in 2004. The hare has been set running, but by the
people responsible for the original offence, and that offence has been
largely addressed.</p><p><a name="06102037000313">If
the hon. Member for Solihull intends to pursue the clause, I must
return to the point that I made during an intervention. There is a well
tried and trusted planning process in this country, although it is not
always reliable because organisations and human beings are fallible. It
is largely delegated to local authority level and subject to
checks&#151;not principally at Secretary of State level, but at
planning inspectorate level. Any scheme that flies in the face of what

myth that, willy-nilly, any developer or householder can make a quick
buck without any reference to the planning authority. Of course, that
would not be the case if the right hon. Member for Suffolk, Coastal
(Mr. Gummer) had his way and Conservative party policy
changed to allow that untrammelled development, but only untrammelled
development for post-1945 properties, because, presumably, that does
not matter. I do not know how many post-1945 properties there are in
some of the leafier and coastal constituencies around the country, but
there are quite a lot in my constituency, such as the South Acton
estate, the largest housing estate in west London, which is subject to
substantial redevelopment plans. The incoming Conservative council in
Ealing seems intent on pursuing a substantial intensification of
density and use of that estate, including taking away much of the green
land. The estate is unique in the sense that although many people live
there and it is large, it has some very pleasant green areas. Those are
likely to disappear if the Conservative council has its way with its
development plan.</p><p><a name="06102037000315">I
do not hold the hon. Lady responsible for the Conservative party facing
two ways. I am simply asking her to be careful. As my hon. Friends the
Members for Hendon (Mr. Dismore) and for Ellesmere Port and
Neston (Andrew Miller) illustrated, although on the one hand the
Conservatives appear to be fully in support of the Bill, on the other
the right hon. Member for Suffolk, Coastal is in favour of unrestricted
planning. Presumably, to trump that, we have the proposal by the right
hon. Member for Wokingham (Mr. Redwood) for cities in the
sea. In fairness to him, I read the report on that in the <i> Financial
Times</i>, and although my hon. Friend the Member for Hendon correctly
gave the right hon. Gentleman&#146;s view that the country could

Secondly, because there may be more roguish elements of overdevelopment
to which she could turn her attention. I do not seek to associate her
with the unrestricted-development wing of the Conservative party, but I
fear that there is a danger not only of encumbering the statute book
with overwrought legislation, but also of tarring her party with the
same brush that has blotted the record of the Conservative
party.</p><p><a name="06102037000321">I do not want
to repeat what I said in the debate before the summer recess, but when
I thought about and puzzled over why, at the last moment, the
Conservative party changed from a general debate on housing policy, on
which there is much to be said, to a narrow debate about back gardens,
I concluded that it was because of, for want of a better term,
dog-whistle politics. When there is such a degree of housing need,
which I am sure is as true in the hon. Lady&#146;s constituency as it
is in my own, of all types&#151;including the intermediate market
and, in particular, affordable and social rented housing&#151;we need
to consider the signal that is sent on that, whether by the
Conservative party or the Liberal party. The central and crucial issue
is, in fact, a non-issue, and the Labour Government have addressed the
possible designation of back gardens as brownfield sites. If we say,
however wrongly, that that is the key issue in housing policy, what
that says to me and my constituents who are living in overcrowded
conditions, who are on housing waiting lists or who cannot get their
first foot on the property ladder is: we do not want to build; we want
to stop building, wherever possible.</p><p><a name="06102037000322">I am not
saying that that was the hon. Lady&#146;s intention in drafting the
Bill or that particular clause, but I highlight the danger of her and
her party becoming tarred with the same brush&#151;one of accelerated
NIMBY-ism and a callous disregard for those who are in housing need. I
acknowledge that that is not the hon. Lady&#146;s intention and I
applaud the principle of the Bill, but I believe that we do not need
it.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="61020-0001.htmordayhd_8"><a name="06102037000653">12.35

<notus-date day="20" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><b>20 Oct 2006 : Column 1171</b><br>a Bill on an important issue. I come largely to praise the Bill, not to
bury it, but I have a few concerns about the detail. I am happy to
support the Bill on the ground that, if it were introduced, even in its
present state, it would leave us in a better position than we are in
now. I would like to improve it in Committee, but we should not lose
sight of the Bill&#146;s considerable merit in moving us in the right
direction. We should support the Bill&#146;s general
thrust.</p><p><a name="06102037000324">I, too, have
many concerns about referendums. My main criticism of the Bill would be
that it seeks at all levels to bypass the local authority. In some
ways, a referendum would bypass the local authority and in others we
would still end up with central Government control over the planning
system. I would rather see us move in the direction of giving much more
responsibility to local authorities for planning matters in their areas
rather than relying on either a referendum or on central Government
control over planning. That is my main criticism, but the Bill still
moves us in a better direction.</p><p><a name="06102037000325">I genuinely believe in local
democracy. I believe in localism and I am delighted that the
Conservative party under the leadership of my right hon. Friend the
Member for Witney (Mr. Cameron) is moving in that direction.
I support it wholeheartedly. If we really believe in localism, local
democracy is what we should support. There is no more emotive issue for
local authorities to discuss and decide than planning. It raises
people&#146;s hackles and it is the issue that most people living in
a local area are concerned about. If local democracy and local councils
are to mean anything, we must give those councils responsibility over
local planning decisions.</p><p><a name="06102037000326">Local council elections are a
key feature of local democracy, but if we take planning issues away
from councils and put them to a referendum, we will get even lower
turnouts than in many local elections. I prefer decisions on planning
to be taken mainly by the local authority, and in particular in respect
of residential developments, by local authorities alone. I do not
accept that central Government or a planning inspector from Bristol can
know better than the local democratically elected council what is best
for a local area. I thus prefer moving away from the idea of
referendums towards giving local authorities the responsibility for
taking decisions.</p><p><a name="06102037000327">I
hasten to add that I am not against referendums per se and there are
sometimes circumstances in which a referendum is appropriate, as the
hon. Member for Ealing, Acton and Shepherd's Bush (Mr.
Slaughter) said. On issues of constitutional importance, referendums
are very important. I greatly favour a referendum on our continuing
membership of the European Union. I suspect that it may be a while
before we get one, but referendums should be confined to such issues of
national importance rather than being conducted willy-nilly for every
planning application. Once we start down the track of holding local
referendums for some planning applications, there will be a clamour to
extend the process to all of them. The whole system could get out of
hand.</p><p><a name="06102037000328">I completely
disagree with the hon. Member for Ealing, Acton and Shepherd&#146;s

made, but which the hon. Member for Shipley (Philip Davies) may have
missed. The number of new dwellings on previously residential land,
which includes gardens, as a proportion of all new dwellings is lower
than in the late 1980s. The figures I gave were 26 per cent. in 1986
and 15 per cent. in 2004. I agree that we should not go over history,

constitutes building on previously residential land, does the hon.

she says. As many Members know, building on gardens is a recent, not a
long-standing, problem. Such garden developments are a blight on many
villages: not only do they overlook people&#146;s property, they
change the nature of villages in which people have lived for many
years. Few people would think of a nice green stretch of garden as a
brownfield site. For people in the country, a brownfield site would be
land that was derelict or had been used industrially.
</p><p><a name="06102037000337">It is essential that
the Government do something about the problem and I wholeheartedly
endorse the Bill introduced by my hon. Friend the Member for Tunbridge
Wells (Greg Clark) to deal with it. At the time, the Government said
that they would draw up their own proposals, so I hope that the
Minister will enlighten us about how they plan to deal with the
problem.</p><br>

for Ealing, Acton and Shepherd&#146;s Bush did not make is that many
Labour Members signed my hon. Friend&#146;s early-day motion on the
subject, yet when there was an Opposition debate on a motion with
exactly the same wording, they voted against it. Labour Members should
have realised that they were voting against what they had signed; some
of them certainly showed a degree of
inconsistency.</p><p><a name="06102037000339">In the
villages of Baildon and Eldwick in my constituency in particular, the
building of houses on gardens is a disturbing, major trend that is
blighting large parts of those villages and others. I know that the
local residents in Eldwick and Baildon in particular expect action. If
the Government will not support this Bill or that introduced by my hon.
Friend the Member for Tunbridge Wells, I urge them to do something to
curb this blight on many of our communities, because it is a big
problem.</p><p><a name="06102037000340">I would much
prefer that such issues were decided by the local council, free from
the threat of being taken to a planning inspector or the Secretary of
State. One big disadvantage of our system generally is that local
authorities often do not make the decision that they want to make but
make a decision with the threat of an appeal to a planning inspector
permanently hanging over them. They often approve planning applications
unwillingly because they feel that they have no choice because of all
the centralised planning guidance and the threat of the huge cost of an
appeal hanging over them. I would much prefer that, particularly on
residential developments, local authorities were given the freedom to
make such decisions on the basis of what was best for their local area
rather than according to the reams of planning guidance handed down to
them, along with the threat of an appeal. I find some aspects of the
Bill worrying, because in many respects that threat of appeal would
still be hanging over
them.</p><p><a name="06102037000341"><b><a name="61020-0001.htm_spnew134"><a name="06102037000796">Mr.

made clear, I want a proper process for the local authority to be the
body responsible for deciding planning matters in a local area. At the
moment, local authorities are blighted by the threat of a planning
inspector and the Secretary of State overturning that decision.
Residential developments in many constituencies are happening not
necessarily because the local public want them, and not even because
the local planning authority wants them, but because of all the
planning guidance that comes down from central Government and the
threat of an inspector and an appeal. That is the part of the planning
process that I should like to tackle and I would much prefer the Bill
to be far more robust in tackling the problem of central Government
control over local planning decisions.</p><br>

some central control over planning issues such as prisons, and perhaps
the building of nuclear power stations, for which a local authority may
never want to give planning permission, but I would much prefer to see
local authorities given far more power to make decisions on residential
developments for themselves, and far less central Government
interference and far less of a threat from a planning
inspector.</p><p><a name="06102037000344">Getting
back to the gardens issue, if local authorities were given the freedom
to decide these things for themselves without Government guidance and
the threat of an appeal hanging over them, they would be much more
likely to turn down applications for houses to be built in gardens than
they are at the moment because of the current planning laws. As
somebody who strongly believes in localism, that must mean giving local
authorities, and even parish councils, much more say over planning
matters in their locality. They surely must know best what is right for
their area&#151;certainly better than the Secretary of State or a
planning inspector.</p><p><a name="06102037000345">I
endorse the comments of my hon. Friend the Member for Ribble Valley
(Mr. Evans) about trees. The issue raised by the hon. Member
for Solihull is clearly an important local one, but I would not want us
to start legislating simply on the basis of one local issue in one
constituency. When we are setting the laws of the land, we need to look
at a wider picture than that. The issue of gardens affects almost every
constituency; some of the other issues may be more parochial. I am sure
they are important in Solihull, but they may be less important
elsewhere.</p><p><a name="06102037000346">I welcome

introduce proposals to give local authorities more powers and local
residents more control over what goes on in their locality. We must get
rid of the nanny state mentality whereby the Government want to
interfere in every aspect of everyone&#146;s life and every aspect of
every local decision. They should give up some of their power and
control, and trust local councils and local people to make the right

at great length about the pleasures and difficulties of local
referendums. The hon. Member for Ellesmere Port and Neston (Andrew
Miller) pointed out that many local authorities&#151;including my
own&#151;already hold the equivalent of referendums when they wish to
gauge local people&#146;s views on issues such as parking schemes.
Inevitably, 50 per cent. are for and 50 per cent. are against, so it
comes back to the local authority making a decision, as they are
elected to do. Leaving aside the costs and other technicalities, I am
not sure that we would be much further forward if we were to have such
referendums.</p><p><a name="06102037000352">My
husband is the leader of East Sussex county council, which recently had
a parish referendum on whether a village should remain part of the

rest of the parish voted for the village to remain. That left the
matter no further forward and indicates some of the difficulties with
local referendums.</p><p><a name="06102037000353">I
was taken aback by clause 2 on parkland associations, because in my
constituency and the wider London borough of Bromley there are many
local people who are friends of the parks. They attract much support
and do much good work, encouraged by the council. The clause is
redundant, because there is nothing to stop concerned people setting up
parkland associations. I cannot believe that a local authority would be
anything other than delighted, because many parkland associations do
the work that local councils cannot do because of the miserly
Government
settlement.</p><p><a name="06102037000354">Like many
of my hon. Friends, I support in principle what the hon. Lady is trying
to achieve in clause 3, and I was a sponsor of the Bill introduced by

developments &#147;in character&#148;. Those of us who were
involved in politics at that time, although not necessarily as Members
of Parliament, will remember that the thinking behind that was to allow
elderly people living in big family houses to build a house in the
garden, in keeping with the rest of the property. We have tiptoed round
the difficulty that has emerged since this Government promulgated the
view that there should be greater density of housing. That gave
developers the green light to apply to build blocks of 48 flats in back
gardens. It is that policy of increasing density, not the development
of back gardens as such or our original planning guidance, that is at
fault. About two years ago, I had the privilege of raising that issue
in an Adjournment debate, when I pointed out&#151;and the Minister
cheerfully agreed&#151;that in my constituency the Government wished
to increase density from 30 houses an acre to 50. That would, of
course, completely change the nature of my constituency, by turning it

Bromley, my borough, it is 46 per cent. That highlights the pressure
that there is, and why our constituents are so concerned. Throughout
England and Wales, there is revulsion about blocks of flats
inappropriately being built in back gardens.</p><p><a name="06102037000359">I have huge sympathy with
clause 4 on the right to appeal against grants of planning permission,
because the developers go on and on and on, until, through attrition,
the local residents die from frustration if not old age. However, like
so much else of the Bill, the clause needs to be much better thought
through to ensure that a balance is maintained so that some development
can go ahead, because Members in all parts of the House agree that
there is a need for more housing. A blanket provision such as this
would not create the best balance in the planning system.</p><p><a name="06102037000360">On the guidance on protection
of trees, I do not think that any one&#151;including the Conservative
party, with its brave new logo&#151;would be against the idea of
ensuring that venerable trees are saved as much as possible. It is part
of the negotiation that a good planning department will have with a
developer that trees should be retained where they have some value.
However, the proposal of the hon. Member for Solihull would be yet
another expense to the taxpayer, because part of the reason why local
authorities cannot give as much protection to trees as they might like
is that it

Woolas):</b> I congratulate the hon. Member for Solihull
(Lorely Burt) on achieving this debate on her Bill on the Floor of the

differences with her predecessor, but he too was a champion for her
constituents, and I am glad to see that he has been succeeded by
another such Member.</p><p><a name="06102037000363">The debate has been good,
important and timely. It airs issues that are being debated around the
country. It is such a shame that the British media choose not to report
what is of interest to the public; if they did, perhaps they would find
their sales going up rather than down.</p><p><a name="06102037000364">We have had some very good
contributions from all parts of the House, in a genuine debate. My hon.
Friend the Member for Ellesmere Port and Neston (Andrew
Miller)&#151;he has offered his apologies, Madam Deputy Speaker, for
having to leave early on constituency business&#151;spoke
comprehensively. He discussed his own constituency and office, and
asked whether buildings within designated parks and open spaces would
be included in the guidelines. The answer is that where such buildings
are associated with the sporting or recreational use of the open space,
they would be covered, and where they are not, they would not. In lay
person&#146;s language, that means that an outbuilding used for
lawnmowers and suchlike, or a tea room that is part of the recreational
facilities, would be included as part of the park. However, a house
that is completely separate from the park land&#151;and, indeed, from
my hon. Friend&#146;s office&#151;would not be covered. I am not
sure whether that was the answer that he wanted regarding the
implications for his office, but it does at least confirm that he was
right in his assumption.</p><p><a name="06102037000365">My hon.
Friend the Member for Hendon (Mr. Dismore) spoke
comprehensively and with great knowledge. He pointed out that in his
view, the Bill faces two ways: it tries to empower, but it also tries
to impose. He had some strong criticisms of the policy proposals from
the right hon. Member for Suffolk, Coastal (Mr. Gummer),
which I will come to in a moment. My hon. Friend gave the example of
cemeteries that are owned by Westminster council, but are in the
borough of Barnet, pointing out the potential difficulty, therefore, in
knowing whom to approach. I can also envisage circumstances in which a
park is within one borough but its users are mainly from another
borough or area. That of course raises the age-old problem of how far
one devolves such powers.</p><br>

Ealing, Acton and Shepherd's Bush (Mr. Slaughter) spoke well
and gave principled and practical reasons why he thought the Bill was,
in his words, unnecessary. He did the House a service by pointing out
that although it is right not to live in the past, it is useful to draw
lessons from the past where relevant. It is the case that, as a
proportion of new houses, more houses were built in gardens in the
1980s than are built in gardens now. That is a fact, and facts are
stubborn things.</p><p><a name="06102037000370">The
question was asked whether the Bill complies with the Human Rights Act
1998. I take guidance from you on these matters, Madam Deputy Speaker.
The rules of the House are that Government Bills must get the
certificate, as it were, prior to coming before the House. Of course,
private Members&#146; Bills are open to examination by the relevant
Committee. Common sense dictates that as a private Member&#146;s Bill
progresses through the House, that would have to be considered. When I
voted for the Human Rights Act, however, I was more worried about Nazi
persecution than about some of the matters that are assigned to the Act
in public debate. I think that I best not go further into that
subject.</p><p><a name="06102037000371">How could I
neglect to mention the hon. Member for Ribble Valley (Mr.
Evans), who made a thoughtful speech? As hon. Members will know, his
constituency is one of the most beautiful in the country, so he is
familiar with preservation of green spaces, parks and so on. He raised
some interesting points from a non-partisan angle.</p><p><a name="06102037000372">The hon. Member for Rochford
and Southend, East (James Duddridge) spoke well and with knowledge. He
made the important point that a scout hut or some other such public
amenity being built in a park would have to be considered in a
completely different category from, say, an Asda supermarket. That
point reflects the difficulties of drawing the boundaries, whether in
law or planning guidance. Were there to be a referendum in his
constituency on whether the council should be allowed to grant planning
application for a scout hut, my guess is that the turnout would be low
and that the result would be an overwhelming yes. He also drew our
attention to the potential paradoxes or dilemmas relating to local
authorities making planning applications for their own buildings. He
indicated that he thought that his civic building was not exactly one
for the world heritage list. I invite him to the north-west of England
to see our beautiful Victorian buildings. He does, however, make a good
point.</p><p><a name="06102037000373">The hon.

not include all those that in common language are described as
unitaries, such as metropolitan boroughs. As the Minister for Local
Government, I am well aware of that category of councils properly
called unitaries. I have a little reminder in my notebook not to forget
them. How could I, given their prominence and importance in our public
life? I therefore genuinely thank him for his thoughtful
comments.</p><p><a name="06102037000374">The hon.
Member for Shipley (Philip Davies) spoke well too, and posed some
dilemmas to the House. He said&#151;I think I quote him
accurately&#151;that &#147;local people know best&#148; for their
area, and that there was a case for parishes having planning powers.
Parishes, of course, are statutory consultees but have no powers. One
could make a case for localised decisions at parish level. However, as
was said by one of Oldham&#146;s Conservative councillors&#151;we
still have one or two, or one, I think, at the moment&#151;with
regard to Liberal Democrat policies for my area, we all know that
Liberal Democrats have a policy for every street but none for the
borough. That is the problem with localism taken too far. Were planning
left entirely to local authorities, I doubt whether the United Kingdom
would ever have had an airport, a railway or any other parts of our
infrastructure.</p><p><a name="06102037000375"><b><a name="61020-0001.htm_spnew140"><a name="06102037000802">Philip

residential developments in particular. I recognised that other matters
require some kind of central control. I agree with my colleague in
Oldham about the Liberal Democrats&#146; policies, but in planning
matters, surely what is right for one area may not be right for
another, and what is right for one part of the district may not be
right for another part of that district. With planning, surely localism
is a good thing.

which I shall return later, and which is also relevant to what was said
by the hon. Member for Beckenham (Mrs.

planning were to be restricted to local authority areas, I do not see
how a case could be put for housing development that would meet the

and agreement; otherwise chaos would
ensue.</p><p><a name="06102037000378"><b><a name="61020-0001.htm_spnew142"><a name="06102037000804">Mrs.

perhaps take account of the informal arrangements that are developing
among local authorities to enable them to control the agenda rather
than accepting it from central

hon. Gentleman said that these matters should be left to the local

Member for Solihull. She does not want to leave the sale of parkland in
her borough to the local authority; as she explained so eloquently in
her speech, she wants to do the opposite, and take power away from the
authority. The hon. Member for Shipley says that he wants to devolve
power to local authorities. The message seems to be,
&#147;We&#146;ll devolve power as long as we agree with the
decisions that are then taken.&#148; I therefore take it that if
Bradford metropolitan borough&#151;for that fine city covers his

Conservative administration that would not make such a stupid decision,

that if electors do not like an administration&#146;s policies, they
can change it at the next election. The logical implication is that he
profoundly disagrees with what is being done in Solihull and is calling
on its electors to change their administration at the next election.
Does that not mean that he is calling for a Labour vote in Solihull? I
shall leave that question hanging in the
air.</p><p><a name="06102037000394">The Government
are sympathetic towards some aspects of the Bill. Its
intention&#151;I think that there is consensus in the House on
this&#151;is to give people locally more control over their
neighbourhood and more of a say in how it is run. The Government are
committed to ensuring that all communities have access to good quality
green space, parks and open land. However, it will be no surprise that
we do not think that this Bill is the right way to go about achieving
those aims. Accordingly, we cannot support it.</p><p><a name="06102037000395">Before I explain the reasons
for that, it is worth considering the context in which we discuss the
Bill. Parks and open spaces are much more dynamic and flexible in
supporting community life and cohesion than they have been for some
time. Our research shows, not surprisingly, that 91 per cent. of people
say that they improve their quality of life. I commend to the House a
recent production of the BBC programme &#147;Gardeners&#146;
World&#148;, which examined in some depth the improvement&#151;its
word, not mine&#151;that has taken place in parks and gardens as a
result of the policies that the Government have adopted.</p><p><a name="06102037000396">As Members of Parliament, we
all share the idea that our parks and open spaces have a glorious
tradition and heritage. I personally believe that we forgot their
importance and value towards the end of the last century. One of the
most damaging aspects of imposing the policy of compulsory competitive
tendering on local councils was its impact on our parks. I never
disagreed with the competitive tendering part; it was the compulsory
element that was damaging. In relation to parks, it made people
consider the price, not the quality. As a result of that policy, people
could cut the grass without tending the flowers or painting the
railings, and they could keep the gates locked all day. We have
successfully turned the policy round, and made good progress.</p><p><a name="06102037000397">The Public Accounts Committee

Deputy Prime Minister launched a sustainable communities plan that set
out a new vision, which put communities at the heart of development. In
that important speech, he gave parks, gardens and open spaces a central
role. Through the plan, we have implemented a range of initiatives and
brought new funding to the programme. That halted the decline of the
green spaces and started to improve them, and has been a key factor in
making our towns and cities better places to live. The recent
&#147;State of the Cities&#148; report acknowledged
that.</p><p><a name="06102037000400">However, I am
not complacent. We need to ensure that every community benefits from
good-quality green spaces, and we therefore remain committed to
following through our green spaces programme. We will respond to the
Public Accounts Committee&#146;s report in full in due
course.</p><p><a name="06102037000401">One of the
great gifts of a park, whatever its nature, is that it extends its
welcome to everyone, irrespective of who they are. We have all
benefited from parks and we all understand their importance. I hope
that in our debate, we will consider the full range of urban green
spaces that planning policy guidance note 17 sets out. Several hon.
Members have referred to that important document. It constitutes
planning for open space, sport and recreation rather than some
undefined notion of &#147;parkland&#148;. It recognises that
different spaces have different functions. Although parks and open
spaces lend themselves as subjects for community involvement and
decisions at neighbourhood level, that should not be a replacement for
council
involvement.</p><p><a name="06102037000402">As the
hon. Member for Solihull said, many of the excellent parks groups were
formed in the 1990s in response to the crisis that faced parks and open
spaces. There are also the successfully established friends of parks
groups, which my hon. Friend the Member for Hendon mentioned. They have
made a big difference to the management of parks and improving what
they can do. Although some groups go on to manage parks&#151;I am
sure that we all support local people taking over the running of a
park&#151;others have a consultative and advisory role. The green
flag award scheme, which we support, backs that up and provides
standards to which our parks and open spaces can aspire. In England,
409 green spaces hold the green flag award, and the number increases
every year&#151;a great achievement by our parks managers throughout
the country, as the BBC programme, which featured the beautiful
Alexandra park in the borough of Oldham, exemplified
superbly.</p><p><a name="06102037000403">There is
also the green pennant award, which recognises community management and
achievement. Those awards help to promote innovative ways in which to
involve local communities in the design and management of public
spaces.</p><p><a name="06102037000404">In the past
five years, a tremendous turnaround has taken place in the fortunes of
parks in England. They are generally getting better. Local people
recognise that and use them more. In many parts of our country, they
are one of the&#151;unfortunately few&#151;areas where different
groups of people meet and mix. That is welcome. All that is largely due
to the commitment, investment and effort of central and local
government,

dedicate their lives to nurturing their parks. We can all see the pride
that they take in
them.</p><p><a name="06102037000405">I now turn to
what we believe to be wrong with the implications&#151;not the
intentions&#151;of the Bill. Clause 1 seeks to restrict the sale of
parkland or other types of open space owned by local authorities. It
would require a local authority to hold a referendum before making such
a sale, which would depend on the outcome of the referendum. Under the
Local Government Act 1972, local authorities may dispose of land in any
manner they wish, but if they want to dispose of land that is used for
public recreation or as a public garden, they must advertise their
intentions in a local newspaper and consider any objections. Many hon.
Members would probably say that that was welcome but insufficient, in
terms of the input from local people.</p><p><a name="06102037000406">That is why additional
Government planning policies already provide robust protection for the
open spaces that local communities need. These policies are set out in
planning policy guidance note 17, introduced in 2002, which covers open
space, sport and recreation. It states that existing open spaces and
sports and recreational land should not be built on unless an
assessment has been undertaken by the local authority that has clearly
shown the open space or land to be surplus to the requirements of the
local community. In undertaking that assessment, the local authority
must take into account all the functions that that open space can
perform. So the provisions in the Local Government Act 1972, together
with the protection for open spaces provided by planning policies, are
sufficient to ensure that the parkland that local communities need is
not sold without account being taken of the needs and views of local
people.</p><p><a name="06102037000407">It might be
helpful if I also mention the situation in relation to sports and
recreation grounds owned by schools, because there is a different
regime in place for them. I shall explain the background to this for
the benefit of the House, because it is directly relevant to the
debate. School playing fields are afforded particular protection by
section 77 of the School Standards and Framework Act 1998, which
empowers the Secretary of State for Education and Skills to protect
school playing fields from disposal or change of use.</p><p><a name="06102037000408">Local authorities require the
prior consent of the Secretary of State before they can sell school
playing fields, and I shall explain the context in which that is
allowed. They would have to demonstrate that such sports facilities
were surplus to the needs of the local community, which is a very hard
test indeed. Furthermore, all proceeds from any such sale must be spent
on new sports and educational facilities. That Act was backed up by
further guidance in November 2004, which states that the sale of
playing fields must be a last resort, if its purpose is to raise funds
to improve other sports and educational facilities, and that the school
must seek alternatives sources of funding.</p><p><a name="06102037000409">The accusation that is
sometimes made that the number of sports fields and facilities in our
schools has gone down is therefore unfair, because it does not take
into account the net position. Those tough criteria applied to schools,

authorities a new power to establish parkland associations, and it
would require those authorities to ensure that such associations were
representative of the local community. As the hon. Member for Solihull
explained, the clause would also allow the Secretary of State to make
regulations about parkland associations. Although we want to encourage
community engagement, creating a new, specific regulatory structure for
parks is neither necessary nor desirable, and I shall try to persuade
hon. Members of that.</p><p><a name="06102037000411">It is not necessary to give
local authorities new powers to create parkland associations, because
in many areas local authorities and communities are already
implementing such arrangements&#151;for example, through the creation
of trusts and through the &#147;friends of&#148; groups that my
hon. Friend the Member for Hendon and I mentioned. Furthermore, I am
not sure that it is clear from the Bill how the creation of parkland
associations would give parklands more protection from development
pressures&#151;and increased protection is, of course, the main
intention behind the
Bill.</p><p><a name="06102037000412">The Bill does
not suggest to whom such associations would be accountable, and it does
not make clear whether they could represent and protect the interests
of the local community better than the elected council. Requiring local
communities to manage all council green space would impose a financial
and resource burden that many communities may not have the capacity to
handle. That would, in turn, threaten the renaissance of parks and
green spaces. The proposal goes against the idea of giving local
authorities greater flexibility to act as leaders in carrying out such
strategies in their communities, and it goes against the idea of
working in partnership with other bodies and community organisations.
In short, although the provision is well intended, I fear that it could
impose another layer of
bureaucracy.</p><p><a name="06102037000413">Proposals
for community management of urban green spaces should instead continue
to be considered and developed as part of a wider strategy on
neighbourhood and citizen engagement. I hope that that encourages the
hon. Member for Solihull. I can tell her that her Bill has influenced
policy development on the matter, as her suggestions made a great deal
of sense. The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister, as it then was,
worked in partnership with the Home Office to establish the community
and management work group, which involves experts from the voluntary
and community sector. It has commissioned research on the benefits of
community ownership and/or management of local assets. In addition, it
has considered: the scope of current community ownership and management
of physical assets; the legal and financial parameters; the costs and
risks involved; and the resultant funding and capacity-building needs
and provision. The work group published two reports on the topic
earlier this year. One was entitled &#147;Communities Taking
Control&#148;, and the other was called &#147;Community
Assets&#151;the benefits and costs of community management and
ownership.&#148;</p><p><a name="06102037000414">In

even better, news for the right hon. Gentleman: in September this year,
my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Communities and Local
Government announced a community ownership and management review, to
consider how we can take such issues forward in practice. The review is
headed by one of our country&#146;s most senior and respected chief
executives, Mr. Barry Quirk of the London borough of
Lewisham. That group will work closely with the Office of the Third
Sector, within the Cabinet Office, and it will report in spring, or
after Christmas, with an action plan setting out workable proposals for
implementation. It looks at assets across the piece. I cannot give any
commitments, as I am not familiar with the museum in the right hon.
Gentleman&#146;s constituency, but knowing his part of the world, the
measure probably offers a nice fit. In case there is mischievous
reporting&#151;I suspect, however, that journalists are probably in
another building for Friday lunchtime&#151;that does not mean that
the Government propose to remove assets from local
councils.</p><p><a name="06102037000417">The review
will take as its starting point the two working group reports to which
I referred, and existing powers and policies that facilitate the
transfer of the ownership or management of local public assets to
community groups. It will consider how those powers can be better used,
what unnecessary barriers remain and whether further powers and policy
changes are required to overcome them. The review offers an opportunity
to share existing good practice in the field of regeneration, and it
underlines our commitment both to community-led regeneration and to
joined-up work between community groups and local authorities&#151;it
is wrong to think that there is conflict between the two. The outcomes
of the review will feed into the 2007 comprehensive spending review, so
it is a win-win situation for public bodies and the community sector;
both will benefit from our approach.</p><p><a name="06102037000418">There is even
more good news, as the Government-funded public space

Members on both sides of the House.</p><p><a name="06102037000419">Clause 3 would require the
Secretary of State to issue guidance to local planning authorities to
the effect that the gardens of private houses should be regarded for
development control purposes as greenfield sites, and that applications
for planning permission for significant developments in such locations
should normally be refused. The hon. Lady and other hon. Members have
bemoaned the use of back gardens for housing development. I am familiar
with the issue, having grappled with it in my constituency. I shall be
non-partisan in setting out the background, as it is important that we
base our debate on facts. The classification of gardens as brownfield
sites is not new. Residential land is classified as a developed land
use, and the classification covers all the land associated with a house
or flat, including any garden. The same applies to industrial land,
where the classification covers all the land associated with a factory
or industrial premises, including any landscaped areas. Those
classifications have been used for land use change
statistics&#151;LUCS&#151;since 1985.</p><p><a name="06102037000420">Current policy appears in
planning policy guidance note 3 and in draft planning policy statement
3, on which the hon. Member for Shipley asked me to comment and which,
when finalised, will replace PPG3. The policy defines previously
developed land, which is referred to more loosely as brownfield land,
on a basis consistent with the long-established definition in LUCS. The
principle that gardens are brownfield is therefore not new. Hon.
Members have pointed to the impact of planning guidance on back
gardens. Planning policy guidance
states:</p><a name="61020-0001.htmbrev_27"><a name="06102037000630"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Homes
with large back gardens are a common feature in many urban, suburban
and village areas. So it has long been acknowledged that sometimes it
may be
acceptable&#148;&#151;</p></ul><p><a name="06102037000421">I
emphasise the word,

Friend the Member for Ealing, Acton and Shepherd&#146;s Bush referred
to that, so it is worth concentrating on the fact that there is
agreement across the House, and probably between the parties, on the
wisdom of that statement, which was made some time
ago.</p><p><a name="06102037000423">That quotation is
not from the present guidance, but from that introduced in 1992, so it
has long been acknowledged that sometimes it may be acceptable to
develop back gardens for new housing, where it is in keeping with the
character and quality of the local environment. It was helpful of the
hon. Member for Beckenham to enlighten the House as to the intention of
the policy at the time, which she said was to do with pressure in
relation to particular housing&#151;to build extensions and so on, I
assume.</p><p><a name="06102037000424">The current
PPG3, introduced in 2000, stated that there should be a clear priority
for brownfield development over greenfield. At the time, that statement
was welcomed by all, and I hope and expect that it is still a policy
that is welcomed by all. However, it also included safeguards for
quality and said

Lait:</b> I reiterate the point that the interplay of that
guidance and the Government&#146;s desire to increase housing density
has put the pressure on. If I might say so, also involved is the loose
wording of the planning guidance, which allows developers to produce
blocks of one and two-bedroom flats that, for instance, are at the same
tree level and have a pitched roof, and that can be said to be sort of
in character because the other houses round about have pitched roofs.
The problem is that a house for a family is replaced by one and
two-bedroom flats. That is the cause of the
pressure.</p><p><a name="06102037000427"><b><a name="61020-0001.htm_spnew155"><a name="06102037000817">Mr.
Woolas:</b> I thank the hon. Lady for explaining why this is
such a hot issue. I understand that, and I have constituents who have
said it to me, but if she will allow me to finish my argument we might
have a better understanding of the
situation.</p><p><a name="06102037000428">The
Government&#146;s intention, when they publish the final PPS3 later
this year, is that the new policy will strengthen the emphasis in
current policy on the quality and design of buildings and their
neighbouring environment, and reinforce the need for all development to
be in suitable
locations.</p><p><a name="06102037000429">Selective
small-scale redevelopment of houses and back gardens, carefully
planned, can contribute&#151;I emphasise, can contribute&#151;to
achieving a better housing mix and help to meet housing needs, so long
as the new development, for example, complements the neighbouring and
wider locality in terms of nature and scale, is suitable, and is of
good-quality design. However, that does not mean, by any stretch of the
imagination, that all back gardens are suitable for development.
Defining a garden as brownfield does not bring with it in planning
policy a presumption that the garden should be
developed.</p><p><a name="06102037000430">As well as
local planning authorities being able to turn down inappropriate back
garden development because it is of poor design or inappropriate to the
local area, a wide range of other matters need to be considered in
deciding whether to allocate land for housing and whether to grant
planning approvals. The range of matters includes the location and
accessibility of the sites and the capacity of existing and potential
infrastructure&#151;a point made by many hon. Members many times.
That includes social infrastructure, such as schools and hospitals,
which residents often raise with
us.</p><p><a name="06102037000431">We also need to be
clear about the facts. It is certainly true that the Government have
increased the emphasis on the use of brownfield land. Environment
groups and Members of Parliament on both sides of the House welcomed
that policy. It clearly makes sense to develop on brownfield sites
instead of greenfield sites. We believe&#151;there is strong evidence
for this&#151;that as a result of those policies, in part, there has
been a renaissance in our towns and cities, with the regeneration of
many abandoned industrial sites and a substantial reduction in the
amount of greenfield land needed for development.</p><p><a name="06102037000432">According to the Urban Task
Force, 90 people lived in Manchester city centre in 1990. That figure
today is

<notus-date day="20" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><b>20 Oct 2006 : Column 1188</b><br>25,000. That is a direct and indirect result of planning policy changes.
There are other examples, and I am sorry if I am being
Mancunian-selfish. I should, of course, talk about Britain&#146;s
third city, Birmingham, where a similar story could be described.
<i> [Interruption.]</i> I move quickly on as the Whip, my hon. Friend
the Member for Birmingham, Hall Green (Steve McCabe), heard what I
said.</p><p><a name="06102037000433">I want to draw
attention to the serious fact mentioned by my hon. Friend the Member
for Ealing, Acton and Shepherd's Bush. I do so not just to show the
historical importance of the figures, but to ensure that the debate is
informed. The proportion of homes built on greenfield land has fallen
from 44 per cent. in 1997 to 26 per cent. today. That is linked to what
the hon. Member for Beckenham said about density and increasing the
density of population in non-greenfield areas.</p><p><a name="06102037000434">For the benefit of the House,
let me emphasise that the pressure on housing development is almost
entirely due to demographic changes rather than population changes. The
policies of the Conservative party are contradictory. On the one hand,
at a macro level, it recognises the need for housing supply based on
demographic changes such as people living longer, higher levels of
divorce and people getting married later in life. Those pressures are
real, and at a macro level the Conservatives seem to welcome the need
to increase housing, just as the Conservative Governments of 1955 and
the early 1960s did. However, when it comes to the rub, they object to
it at a local
level.</p><p><a name="06102037000435"><b><a name="61020-0001.htm_spnew156"><a name="06102037000818">Philip
Davies:</b> In the Minister&#146;s list of things that are
causing pressures on housing, such as divorce and demographics, he
missed out immigration. I am sure that that was a casual slip. In an
answer to my hon. Friend the Member for Isle of Wight (Mr.
Turner) a while ago, the Government said, if I remember rightly, that
virtually a third of all new housing was going to be required because
of immigration. Perhaps they should tackle the problem of all this
legal and illegal immigration, because then we would not need all these
houses&#151;</p><p><a name="06102037000436"><b><a name="61020-0001.htm_spnew157"><a name="06102037000819">Madam
Deputy Speaker:</b> Order. A significant matter it might be,
but the matter before us is one of housing and parkland
spaces.</p><p><a name="06102037000437"><b><a name="61020-0001.htm_spnew158"><a name="06102037000820">Mr.
Woolas:</b> We seem to have gone from a beautiful oak tree,
which we all wish to protect, to perhaps the most contentious subject
of debate in the House. The evidence does not back up the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s point in respect of pressure on housing. It is the
wheres, whens and hows of that pressure that informed the policy that
we pursue, although I understand his
point.</p><p><a name="06102037000438">Let me put on
record another important set of statistics in order to set the debate
into context. The proportion of homes built on previously residential
land is lower now than it was in the 1980s. In 1990, for example, 20
per cent. of homes were built on land that was previously residential.
The proportion in 2005 was 16 per cent.&#151;a figure that includes
homes built on the footprint of previous buildings and which is not
confined to homes built on drives or back
gardens.</p><br>

London boroughs, which I mentioned in my earlier

Woolas:</b> The hon. Lady is trying to hold me and the
Government responsible for the decisions of local authorities. There
are many examples of local authorities turning down proposals to
develop gardens on the basis of existing planning guidance, let alone
the future planning guidance to which I
referred.</p><p><a name="06102037000441">The
Government believe that more homes need to be built to meet the needs
of future generations. National planning policy in PPS3 sets a
framework for regional and local planning, but it is very much the role
of local planning authorities to decide the approach and strategy for
the location of housing development in their particular areas. The
issue should not be about blocking whole categories of development as
either greenfield or brownfield, but about quality and appropriateness.
In the end, new homes need to be built somewhere and local authorities
need to take sensible decisions about the most suitable location for
the new homes that we need. I also ask the House to consider another
serious point. If the Bill were passed, hon. Members would be quick to
bemoan to Ministers the fall in the value of the houses affected. It is
much better to get the balance right.</p><p><a name="06102037000442">Clause 4 would introduce a
third-party right of appeal where councils are unwilling to oppose an
application that contravenes the local plan, so that local people could
appeal directly to the Secretary of State. As hon. Members know, third
parties do not have the right of appeal against planning decisions as
do applicants, because it is the responsibility of local planning
authorities to act in the general public interest when determining
planning applications. Local authorities must determine planning
applications in accordance with the development plan for the area
unless material considerations indicate otherwise. Those can include
views expressed by local residents and other third parties&#151;a
point that all Members would do well to take note of for their advice
surgeries.</p><p><a name="06102037000443">A right for
third parties to appeal to the Secretary of State against a decision by
a local authority to grant planning permission would not be consistent
with our democratically accountable system of planning. Elected
councillors represent their communities and they must take account of
the views of local people on planning matters before decisions are made
and subsequently justify their decisions to their
electorate.</p><p><a name="06102037000444">Overall,
the hon. Member for Solihull makes an important point in her Bill, but
it has to be balanced against the rights and responsibilities of
elected councillors. I hope that I have been able to provide convincing
arguments to explain the Government&#146;s problems with the
Bill&#146;s implications rather than its intent. I have not had time
to go into all the details, but I believe that I have answered all the
specific questions raised in the debate. I therefore invite the House
carefully to reflect on my
arguments.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="61020-0001.htmordayhd_11"><a name="06102037000656">1.59

to say a big thank you to every Member who has taken the time and
trouble to be in the Chamber on a Friday to discuss this important
Bill. I am very grateful for all the constructive remarks made on both
sides of the
House.</p><p><a name="06102037000446">The hon. Member
for Ellesmere Port and Neston (Andrew Miller) described the Bill as
flawed but amendable in Committee. I took great heart from that. He
raised important points, which should be taken into consideration,
about the land covered by the measure and about public sector land. He
also drew attention to the fact that trees outside urban and suburban
areas but in non-rural areas were not covered by the Bill. We should
consider including a provision on that
point.</p><p><a name="06102037000447">The hon. Member
for Ribble Valley (Mr. Evans) was enormously helpful and
made many good points, especially about referendums. His suggestion
that a referendum should be triggered by a specific number of
signatures is worth thinking about and could be developed. Like other
Members, he made some helpful comments about costs. His proposal to
minimise costs by holding the referendum, whenever possible, while
another election was taking place was well
received.</p><p><a name="06102037000448">The hon.
Member for Hendon (Mr. Dismore) also mentioned costs and
said that there should be a pre-regulation cost assessment. I entirely
agree, but I did not want to tie up civil servants&#146; time by
producing a lot of costings before the Bill went into Committee,
because of the costs involved in doing so. The hon. Gentleman asked why
clause 5 specified a change from two to three years and suggested that
it would be better for the Secretary of State to have the power to vary
the time. On reflection, I think it probably would be better. He
mentioned the short time period within which the measure would come
into force. The hon. Member for Ribble Valley helpfully pointed out
that the Secretary of State could have the power to vary the timescale,
which would be helpful.</p><p><a name="06102037000449">The hon. Member for Hendon
(Mr. Dismore) accused me of facing two ways&#151;a
criticism rarely levelled at a Liberal Democrat. He said that I seek
both to empower and to impose. I probably have to plead guilty, because
the Bill would empower and impose, where necessary, at different stages
of the process.</p><p><a name="06102037000450">The
hon. Member for Rochford and Southend, East (James Duddridge), who is
no longer in the Chamber, felt that the scope of the Bill was too wide.
On reflection, I agree. He thought that the garden-grabbing Bill
promoted by the hon. Member for Tunbridge Wells (Greg Clark) was better
and more thought-out than my Bill. It is indeed more thought-out and
has more detail, and I am happy to commend that, but it was introduced
almost a year before my
Bill.</p><p><a name="06102037000451">The hon. Member
for Rochford and Southend, East wanted more detail about the oak tree

trees. Like the hon. Member for Ellesmere Port and Neston, he referred

friends of parks do excellent work; the Bill would merely strengthen
their
hand.</p><p><a name="06102037000452">The
hon. Member for Ealing, Acton and Shepherd&#146;s Bush
(Mr. Slaughter) felt that the measure was a non-issue and
that we do not particularly need such legislation, but tens of
thousands of people in England, and especially in Wales, would
disagree. He seems to think that local wishes will prevail and that it
will all turn out right in the end, but the examples that I have
outlined would tend to contradict that optimistic view.</p><p><a name="06102037000453">The hon. Member for Shipley
(Philip Davies) and others accused me of wanting central Government to
impose more on local people and on local authorities. I shall go back
and scrutinise the Bill and see where I am seeking to do that, because
that was not my intention at all. As Liberal Democrats, our view is
that all decision making should be as close as possible to the people
who will be affected by it.</p><p><a name="06102037000454">The hon. Member for Beckenham

the promotion of breastfeeding; and for connected
purposes.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06102037000466">The policy
objectives of the Bill are, first, the promotion of public health and,
secondly, the tackling of
discrimination.</p><p><a name="06102037000467">On
public health, detailed research over many years has confirmed the
entirely intuitive proposition that breastfeeding is healthy for
babies, mothers, families and society. Babies who are breastfed are
less likely to develop many illnesses in infancy, childhood and
adulthood. That is why the World Health Organisation, UNICEF and our
Department of Health all recommend that babies should be fed only
breast milk for the first six months of life. Breastfeeding reduces the
risk of babies developing gastroenteritis, for example. The authority
for this is a publication in the name of Howie, P. W. et al. in 1990,
published under the title, &#147;Protective effect of breastfeeding
against infection&#148; in the <i> British Medical Journal</i>, vol.
300, pages 11 to 16.</p><p><a name="06102037000468">Women who breastfeed can
significantly reduce their chances of developing breast cancer. This
link was shown conclusively in a collaborative re-analysis of data from
47 epidemiological studies in 30 countries published in <i> The Lancet,
</i>vol. 360, in July 2002. The study included more than 50,000 women
with breast cancer and more than 96,000 women without the disease. The
authors found that the relative risk of breast cancer decreased by 4.3
per cent. for every 12 months of breastfeeding. The study&#146;s
stated interpretation in <i> The Lancet</i>
is:</p><a name="61020-0002.htmbrev_32"><a name="06102037000635"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;The longer
women breastfeed the more they are protected against breast cancer. The
lack of or short lifetime duration of breastfeeding typical of women in
developed countries makes a major contribution to the high incidence of
breast cancer in these
countries.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06102037000469"><b><a name="61020-0002.htm_spnew167"><a name="06102037000829">Philip

About seven out of 10 women start breastfeeding, but by six

the name of Harder, T. et al. states that one month of breastfeeding is
associated with a 4 per cent. decrease in the risk of becoming
overweight in later life. That was published in the <i> American Journal
of Epidemiology</i> in September 2005. A second benefit is cost savings
for the national health service. An old NHS estimate updated by UNICEF
shows that for every 1 per cent. increase in breastfeeding, more than
&#163;500,000 a year would be saved in the treatment of
gastroenteritis alone. So promoting breastfeeding makes sense as a
public health
objective.</p><p><a name="06102037000472">How well
are we doing in the UK? That is the question that the hon. Member for
Shipley (Philip Davies) asked. That brings me to the second policy
objective&#151;tackling discrimination. In the league table of
breastfeeding rates, the Scandinavian countries are top. In Norway a
starting rate of 97 per cent. of all mothers has been achieved, with 80
per cent. still breastfeeding at six months. The latest survey evidence
for England discloses that about seven out of 10 women start
breastfeeding their babies but fewer than one in 10 are still
breastfeeding at six months, yet most mothers want to breastfeed their
babies for
longer.</p><p><a name="06102037000473">National
surveys find that three quarters of mothers who give up breastfeeding
before six months say that they wanted to continue longer. Why do so
many mothers stop breastfeeding earlier than they say they would wish?
NICE&#151;the National Institute for Health and Clinical
Excellence&#151;looked for the possible answers to the question and
published some conclusions in a draft &#147;Effective action briefing
on the initiation and duration of breastfeeding&#148; in November
2005. Under the heading, &#147;What factors influence participation
in breastfeeding?&#148;, NICE
stated:</p><a name="61020-0002.htmbrev_33"><a name="06102037000636"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;The
reasons for low breastfeeding rates in the UK include the influence of
society and cultural norms, as well as clinical problems, the lack of
continuity of care in the health services and the lack of preparation
by health professionals and others to support breastfeeding
effectively.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06102037000474">It
specifically refers
to</p><a name="61020-0002.htmbrev_34"><a name="06102037000637"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;the experience of

to do in public.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06102037000475">Since
November 2005, NICE has worked on and, in July 2006, published new
guidelines for post-natal care of women. &#147;Routine postnatal care
of women and their babies&#148; is NICE clinical guidance 37, and it
contains an excellent section on support for breastfeeding in all
health settings. It recommends, for example, that all maternity care
providers should implement an externally evaluated, structured
programme that encourages breastfeeding, using UNICEF&#146;s baby
friendly initiative as the minimum standard. The baby friendly
initiative has a proven effectiveness in increasing breastfeeding rates
where it is already in
place.</p><p><a name="06102037000476"><b><a name="61020-0002.htm_spnew169"><a name="06102037000831">Mrs.

hormones, has any work been done of the effect on the breastfed child
of those hormones?</p><br>

Kidney:</b> I do not know whether there has been any research
on that point. Although the thrust of the Bill is to promote
breastfeeding, it is about feeding milk to babies in public places, so
it can include bottle feeding. This is not an attempt to enforce
breastfeeding if at all possible: some women, for medical or physical
reasons, cannot breastfeed at all, and I do not wish to criticise them.
Some women choose, for legitimate reasons, not to breastfeed, and I do
not wish to criticise them either. I am trying to tackle a problem that
stops women who want to breastfeed doing so in public
places.</p><p><a name="06102037000478">Let us assume
for a moment that the NICE guidelines will deal with the reasons
stopping women feeding that are health-care related. How do we combat
the influence of society, cultural norms and the embarrassment about
breastfeeding in public, referred to in the NICE reasons? That is where
the Bill comes in.</p><p><a name="06102037000479">The
purpose of clause 1 is to safeguard the right of a child under the age
of two years to be fed milk in a public place or licensed premises
where the child is otherwise lawfully permitted to be. The Bill does
not change licensing law nor does it prevent a business from excluding
breastfeeding on its premises where the lawful custom or practice is to
exclude children generally. Where a child is lawfully permitted to be
in a public place or on licensed premises, that child may be fed
bottled milk and the child&#146;s mother will be entitled to
breastfeed him or her if she so chooses. Any person who deliberately
prevents or stops, or attempts to prevent or stop a person bottle
feeding or breastfeeding a child in such circumstances will be guilty
of an offence and liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding level 4
on the standard scale, currently
&#163;2,500.</p><p><a name="06102037000480"><b><a name="61020-0002.htm_spnew171"><a name="06102037000833">Mr.
Andrew Dismore (Hendon) (Lab):</b> I agree very much with the
thrust of my hon. Friend&#146;s Bill in terms of promoting
breastfeeding, but I am a little concerned by clause 1, because it
contains no provision for the defence of reasonable excuse. It is an
absolute offence that applies across the board, but I can envisage
circumstances&#151;for example, in a theatre or cinema&#151;in
which one patron may be distracted from watching the performance or
film if the woman sat next to them is breastfeeding. In those
circumstances, the other customer&#146;s rights are being offended.
Does my hon. Friend agree that clause 1 should include some provision
for a defence of reasonable excuse to take account of the impact on
other
people?</p><p><a name="06102037000481"><b><a name="61020-0002.htm_spnew172"><a name="06102037000834">Mr.

serious and genuine point. I do not think that there should be such a
defence, although clause 2, which relates to employers, contains a
specific defence if employers have taken reasonable steps to ensure
that obstruction or prevention would not occur. There is no intention
that the Bill should be some sort of Amazons&#146; charter that
enables women to bare their breasts in public places to offend people.
Most breastfeeding mothers are especially careful to be discreet when
they breastfeed in public places and that is the attitude that I seek
to encourage through the Bill.

Parliament will by no means be alone if we legislate to give support
for breastfeeding. A law exactly like this Bill was skilfully and
successfully steered through the Scottish Parliament by Elaine Smith,
MSP, and it came into force in March 2005. Many state legislatures in
the USA have introduced similar legislation. The Minnesota state
legislature passed a law in April 1998, which provides
that:</p><a name="61020-0002.htmbrev_35"><a name="06102037000638"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;A mother
may breastfeed in any location, public or private, where the mother and
child are otherwise authorised to
be&#148;.</p></ul><p><a name="06102037000485">Other
legislatures have promoted breastfeeding as part of a wider
anti-discrimination strategy. In Australia, the Queensland
Anti-Discrimination Act 1991 prohibits discrimination against women on
the ground of gender, and specifically breastfeeding. The World Health
Organisation &#147;global strategy for infant and young child
feeding&#148;, published in 2003, states that
</p><a name="61020-0002.htmbrev_36"><a name="06102037000639"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;governments should
enact imaginative legislation protecting the breastfeeding rights of
working women and establishing means for its enforcement in accordance
with international labour
standards&#148;.</p></ul><p><a name="06102037000486">I
say that this Bill offers an imaginative approach. I hope that Members
accept that the problem that clause 1 would address truly is serious,
and that it is sufficiently prevalent to justify legislation.</p><p><a name="06102037000487">When I published the Bill, I
was inundated with individual tales of outrageous behaviour endured by
women who were simply trying to breastfeed in everyday locations such
as shops, eating places and leisure facilities. I gave a number of
examples of that in my 10-minute speech when I sought leave to
introduce the Bill on 8 November last year&#151;I refer Members to
column 181 of the relevant volume of <i> Hansard</i>.</p><p><a name="06102037000488">More toe-curlingly embarrassing
stories have kept on coming since then. Margaret Boyle-White was
discreetly breastfeeding on a street in a Norfolk town in 2005, when a
man complained to the police; they sent a uniformed officer in a marked
car to stop her breastfeeding. A woman was asked to stop breastfeeding
in the waiting room of a GP practice, of all places. A woman in a
supermarket cafeteria had to go to the toilets if she wanted to carry
on breastfeeding. A woman in a health and fitness club was escorted
from the family area&#151;of all areas&#151;because she was
breastfeeding. A woman was asked to leave a restaurant for discreetly
feeding her seven-month-old baby at the table, although that did not
prevent the restaurant from charging for the full meals, even though it
sent her out when she had had only the first
course.</p><p><a name="06102037000489">Clauses 2 and
3 are consequential measures. Clause 2 effectively prevents a person or
organisation from avoiding a conviction by getting an employee to do
the outlawed act. Clause 3 makes provision in respect of whom to
prosecute if the offence is committed by a body-corporate or a
partnership.</p><p><a name="06102037000490">Clause 4
would help Health Ministers achieve uniformity in the support and
promotion of breastfeeding. As I have mentioned, the Scottish
Parliament has already introduced such legislation, as health is a
devolved matter. Therefore, the Bill would apply in England and
Wales.</p><br>

the costs of implementing the law that the Bill would establish, I am
helped by having sight of the financial memorandum that the Scottish
Parliament produced when Elaine Smith was piloting her Bill through.
The main costs in respect of clauses 1 to 3 would relate to extra
burdens on the police and the Crown Prosecution Service. However, I
anticipate that they would be modest and would not require the
recruitment of additional staff. Those organisations that might be at
risk of prosecution, such as shops and restaurants, should be expected
to alter their practices to ensure that they are compliant with the
standards that the law would uphold. Consequently, the number of
prosecutions might reasonably be expected to be low.</p><p><a name="06102037000495">We should do all that we can to

Indeed, in the past three years my wife, Debbie, has successfully

do with encouraging breastfeeding. According to the National Childbirth
Trust, 50 per cent. of all women who breastfeed their baby have never
even tried to breastfeed in a public place, so the ability or otherwise
to breastfeed in a particular shop clearly is not a deterrent to
breastfeeding. This has nothing to do with encouraging more

ever been particularly impressed with. There are lots of things that
happen in many other countries that the hon. Member for Stafford would
not like to see happen here. Many countries have capital punishment in
their judicial system, which he doubtless would not support, so the
question whether other countries adopt such an approach to
breastfeeding is neither relevant nor irrelevant. This is more to do
with the culture that exists in many parts of this House, and
particularly among Labour Members. Where there is a problem, they look
for two particular ingredients in tackling it, the first of which is
that they are seen to be doing something. It is the great tendency of
any politician that, if a particular issue arises, they must be seen to
be doing something about it. The second ingredient is that their
proposal does not offend anybody, and this Bill is a prime example of
that culture.</p><p><a name="06102037000501"><b><a name="61020-0002.htm_spnew178"><a name="06102037000840">Mr.

He talks about Labour Members, but would he be interested to know that
such an approach is supported not only by the NCT but by UNICEF, the
Breastfeeding Network, La Leche League Great Britain, the Royal College
of Nursing, the Royal College of Midwives, the Community

things on their own premises that they do not want to do. Businesses

these decisions for themselves; they do not need the nanny state

Andrew Slaughter (Ealing, Acton and Shepherd's Bush)
(Lab):</b> I am grateful for the opportunity to raise a serious
matter than has arisen since the local elections in May, when political
control of the London borough of Hammersmith and Fulham changed from
Labour to Conservative: unacceptable political interference in the
planning process when applications for affordable housing in
Hammersmith and Fulham are being determined, to the detriment of those
in housing need in the borough, but specifically in the part of the
borough that falls within my constituency, Shepherd&#146;s Bush. I
wish to illustrate that by referring to one major scheme in
Shepherd&#146;s Bush, the Prestolite Electric scheme in Larden road.
First, however, I wish to put the matter briefly in context, and to
explain why I feel that it should be drawn to the attention of my hon.
Friend the
Minister.</p><p><a name="06102037000564">There is
agreement on the need for more affordable housing, certainly between
the Government, the Greater London authority and pressure groups such
as Shelter. The evidence is contained in the Barker report, in a recent
report from the Select Committee on Communities and Local Government,
and in other documents. I exempt from that consensus the Liberal
Democrats and Conservatives. I also concede that there is disagreement
on the amount of additional affordable housing needed. There is much
lobbying in relation to the comprehensive spending review that is
taking place, but those who are arguing about absolute numbers are in
danger of losing sight of the other issues that concern those who, like
me, are interested in affordable housing. Those issues are the quality
and environmental standards of housing&#151;raised by the Mayor
recently&#151;tenure, with which I shall deal today, and what
&#147;affordable&#148; really means: affordable to
whom?</p><p><a name="06102037000565">&#147;Affordable
housing&#148; could be registered social landlord rented, shared
ownership, key worker, or other types of intermediate housing. Although
the GLA London plan suggests a 70:30 split in favour of rented housing,
the practice in recent years has been the opposite. The reasons given
are high land values, greedy developers and inept council planning
departments. Those claims may all be true in whole or in part, but
insufficient attention has been paid to a more obvious reason: the
deliberate political policy of Tory and Liberal Democrat councils of
minimising house building per se, affordable housing as a percentage of
new starts, and rented housing as a percentage of affordable
housing.</p><p><a name="06102037000566">If I had
time, I could give almost innumerable examples, anecdotal and
statistical. Given the time that I have, I shall give only one or two.
Within the last few weeks, Westminster council has been offering people
&#163;100,000 to leave the borough&#151;and this is the borough
that gave us Shirley Porter. The number of 14-unit housing schemes,
which are often the result of an agreement between an authority and a
developer, has increased by 60 per cent. in the last four
years&#151;14 
<br>

<meta name="Date" content="20 Oct 2006">

<notus-date day="20" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><b>20 Oct 2006 : Column 1204</b><br>being the key number, as it is one below the number that requires the
inclusion of an element of affordable housing.</p><p><a name="06102037000567">Radio Five Live broadcast an
interesting programme last Sunday called, &#147;Through the
Roof&#148;, which exposed discrepancies in the allocation of
key-worker housing. It missed a trick, however. In ascribing the
problem to the housing association, the Housing Corporation and the
Government, who had let the units, it missed the fact that, as I
confirmed when I spoke to the chief executive of the Housing
Corporation, the &#147;scam&#148;&#151;the allocation of units to
people who did not deserve key-worker housing&#151;involved not the
units funded by the housing association through social housing grant,
but a separate side deal between the London borough of Wandsworth and
the developer. Houses were being sold at 90 per cent. of cost price: in
other words, there was virtually no
reduction.</p><p><a name="06102037000568">If one
looks at the recent statistics on who is building affordable homes, the
allocations show the intent for the current period, 2006 to 2008. I
will give a few examples based on general needs rented units. The
figure in Hackney is 737; in Tower Hamlets, 714; in
Haringey, 463; in Greenwich, 683; and in Hammersmith and Fulham, 448.
All those councils were under Labour control at the time of the
applications. The figure in Redbridge is 47; in Westminster, 93; in
Bromley, 18; in Richmond, 79; in Kingston, 71; in Hillingdon, 18; and
in Wandsworth, 80. All those councils are under Conservative
control.</p><p><a name="06102037000569">Of course,
boroughs have different capacities to build depending on their size. If
one looks at how far they have achieved their ambitions in that
context, Hammersmith and Fulham, which was under Labour control, has
achieved 99.3 per cent., while of the Conservative councils, Hounslow
has achieved 97.8 per cent., Redbridge has achieved 3.8 per cent.,
Bromley has achieved 3.5 per cent., Kingston has achieved 9.8
per cent., Hillingdon has achieved 2.8 per cent, Wandsworth has
achieved 8.8 per cent., and Westminster has achieved 8.4 per
cent.</p><p><a name="06102037000570">One can look at
achievement in terms of the percentage of housing built in a local
authority that is affordable. I shall give some figures from the two
years up to 2005. Hammersmith and Fulham, which was a Labour-controlled
borough at the time, achieved 70 per cent.&#151;the highest in
London. Wandsworth, a neighbouring Tory borough with a similar housing
profile, achieved 7 per cent., while Westminster achieved 11 per cent.
and Islington achieved 13 per cent.</p><p><a name="06102037000571">There are contradictions in
what the Opposition parties say on this issue, but the statistics and
examples speak for themselves as to what priority is given to
affordable housing, particularly affordable rented housing. Why do
authorities such as the newly Conservative Hammersmith and Fulham
council prefer intermediate housing? Because much of it in high-value
areas is completely unaffordable. The Radio Five Live programme showed
that in many cases incomes of &#163;40,000 to &#163;50,000 were
needed to access shared ownership housing. Nobody would deny the need
for intermediate housing to allow people to get on to the housing
ladder, provided that it is genuinely affordable housing. It is
difficult to build in high land

of all starter homes were affordable and more than 50 per cent. of all
affordable homes were RSL rented.</p><p><a name="06102037000572">The new Tory council, like the
Tories nationally, has announced that it intends to switch resources
from rented to intermediate housing. The local press, particularly the
<i> Fulham and Hammersmith Chronicle</i> and the <i> Hammersmith and
Shepherd&#146;s Bush Gazette</i>, has been exemplary in exposing what
is happening. In the summer, the latter reported that 500 affordable
rented units will be lost from the programme, and this in a borough
with 1,700 people in temporary accommodation and 8,400 on the waiting
list. Either directly, or through the powers that the Government intend
to give to the Greater London authority in the upcoming legislation, we
need to ensure that there is sufficient affordable housing and that it
is directed towards
need.</p><p><a name="06102037000573">I want to cite
the example of a large and significant housing development in my
constituency&#151;Prestolite Electric in Larden road. It is a
2.4-hectare industrial site that was given planning consent on 19
August 2005 for a mixed mainly residential development including 499
homes, 75 per cent. of which were to be affordable. Genesis Housing
Group, a large registered social landlord, purchased the site in
October 2005 but was dissatisfied with aspects of the design. It was
told that the new Conservative administration would require a revision
to the tenure balance to move it away from affordable and towards
market if its new application was to be granted. Genesis reluctantly
agreed. Having paid a substantial sum for the site, it was losing money
in every month that the development did not progress. Its new
application was for 453 homes, including 165 market homes&#151;up to
36 per cent. from 25 per cent.&#151;140 shared ownership homes, which
was down to 31 per cent., and 148 rented homes, which constitutes 33
per cent. That is roughly a third for each category. The new scheme
delivered a substantial number of shared ownership and rented homes and
appeared to have almost universal support, including from local
residents groups, which had been involved in the proposals for
approximately two
years.</p><p><a name="06102037000574">The agenda for
the committee at which the application was to be considered was
published and the meeting was due to take place on 10 October. Even
those of us who were sceptical about the scheme found the
officers&#146; report detailed and balanced. It ran to 42 pages and,
as I have come to expect from planning officers at Hammersmith and
Fulham council, it was well written and a good report. As I said, it
had almost universal support.</p><p><a name="06102037000575">Two working days before the
planning committee meeting on Friday 6 October, the Conservative leader
of Hammersmith and Fulham council, Councillor Stephen Greenhalgh, who
is not a member of the planning committee, met Genesis officers with a
senior planning officer from Hammersmith and Fulham. The purpose of the
meeting is a matter for conjecture, at least at present. It was not the
sort of early engagement

not have time to read the letter in full, but it is fascinating. It
goes on to point out the pitfalls ahead, including possible objections
by the Greater London authority, the Housing Corporation and the
Government. Genesis suggests that they might all take exception to the
proposals. Nevertheless, it bowed to the council&#146;s will and the
amount of social rented housing was reduced by more than
half.</p><p><a name="06102037000580">What was the
purpose of the intervention by the leader of the Conservative council,
apart from the obvious one of reducing social rented housing? The
housing that went was clearly highly affordable, whereas it is dubious
whether the housing that will arrive is affordable for any of my
constituents who are in housing need.</p><p><a name="06102037000581">Secondly, it is not the case,
as alleged, that there was no provision for intermediate housing. The
scheme that went to committee, properly researched and written up, was
one third intermediate housing. It is therefore difficult to understand
the justification for reducing social
housing.</p><p><a name="06102037000582">I attended
the meeting. However, I first had to attend another meeting because the
Conservative council was closing one of the main secondary schools in
the borough, so I was a little late. I asked to speak. I thought that
that was not unreasonable but permission was refused. None of the
public ward councillors or opposition councillors had had notice of the
revision to the scheme. One sheet of A4 was handed round, on which
about two lines referred to it. The letter that I cited was not made
public at that stage. A request by the opposition to re-consult on the
substantial revision was refused and consent was granted for the
scheme,

today. I was able to ask one or two questions at that planning meeting,
by whispering them to one of the councillors, who then asked them on my
behalf&#151;which I am sure is the way in which most councils would
wish to see their Members of Parliament treated. The answers that I got
were that it was not admitted that the meeting had taken place, and
that the suggestion had come from Genesis itself, which was clearly
nonsense. This dishonest, obfuscatory process which has taken over in
Hammersmith town hall is not satisfactory.</p><p><a name="06102037000584">It is absolutely clear, and now
a matter of public record, that it is the deliberate policy of
Hammersmith and Fulham council to minimise the housing that is most
needed in the borough. That is a matter of grave concern not only to me
but to the Housing Corporation, which has withdrawn up to &#163;30
million of social housing grant as a result of this decision. It is
also of concern to the Greater London authority, which has not yet had
the matter referred to it, even though it is the superior planning
authority and has the power to override the decision made by the
council. I hope that it will also be a matter of concern to the
Secretary of State, who also has a role to play in the
matter.</p><p><a name="06102037000585">Those matters
are clear, and can all be pursued in the public realm. What is not yet
clear, however, is the process involved. That needs further
investigation, which I intend to undertake. How could these
last-minute, hole-in-the-corner interventions overtake a tried and
tested planning process that had gone on for two years? The only reason
why I do not yet know whether this is a matter for the Standards Board,
the local government ombudsman or the district auditor is because I
have not yet got all the facts at my disposal. However, I am writing
today to the council and to Genesis to ask for the notes from the
meeting and from any subsequent conversations that took place, so that
we can finally get to the bottom of the matter.</p><p><a name="06102037000586">We need to find out why an

act in the interests of the local community generally, and it is
certainly not the way to act on planning matters. These matters need to
be taken to a higher level, and I intend to do that. Meanwhile, I

<notus-date day="20" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><b>20 Oct 2006 : Column 1208</b><br>the House this afternoon raises serious concerns, which the Minister for
Housing and Planning and I will need to consider. Any implication of
social engineering will, of course, be very controversial
indeed.</p><p><a name="06102037000588">It is now
increasingly recognised that this country needs to build more homes
across the board to meet the needs of our ageing, growing population.
As Kate Barker made clear in her report two years ago, we have not been
building enough homes for a generation. Over the last three decades of
the 20th century, there was a 30 per cent. increase in the number of
households, but a 50 per cent. drop in the level of house building.
That is unsustainable and is now having the predicted, and predictable,
consequences. Measured against the bedroom standard, about 500,000
households in Britain are now living in overcrowded conditions. Housing
supply declined from a peak of 250,000 in the 1960s to about 130,000 in
2001. By 2005, this had increased to 168,000, and we have pledged to
raise this to 200,000 by 2016. I will try to say something later about
the action that we are taking to support this growth in
numbers.</p><p><a name="06102037000589">The London
context is obviously what concerns my hon. Friend the most, however.
London has a highly successful and productive economy, which makes a
substantial contribution to the United Kingdom. However, as
London&#146;s success continues to attract people to the capital,
sustained high demand for housing has driven up house prices. Over the
past 20 years, London&#146;s population has grown rapidly from 6.8
million people in 1983 to 7.3 million in 2003, and that growth is
projected to continue to about 8.1 million people in 2016. Furthermore,
the number of households in London has grown at an even faster rate,
while the size of the average household continues to fall across the
UK.</p><p><a name="06102037000590">The rate of house
building in London has increased in recent years, and although there
has been some fluctuation recently, the rate is broadly holding up. The
problem of market housing affordability in London is now
acute&#151;the average price of a home in London is &#163;286,000.
The London borough of Hammersmith and Fulham has to deal with many of
those issues. There are extremes of prosperity and deprivation in the
borough; 15 per cent. of households have an income of more than
&#163;60,000 per annum, but a third have incomes of less than
&#163;10,000. The borough is ranked the 65th most deprived in 354
English local authorities, and two of its wards are in the 10 per cent.
most deprived wards nationally.</p><p><a name="06102037000591">Some 1,667 households live in
temporary accommodation, and it is estimated that 3,000 households live
in overcrowded conditions, which puts Hammersmith and Fulham in the top
20 boroughs for overcrowding. There are 8,300 households on the
council&#146;s housing waiting list. The borough&#146;s 2004
housing needs survey showed that there is a shortfall in the number of
affordable homes needed to meet its target of providing more than 3,600
homes each year for the next five
years.</p><p><a name="06102037000592">The Government
are making progress nationally with the affordable housing strategy.
Since the sustainable communities plan was published, house building
has increased, and in 2005 it hit its highest rate since 1990. The
Government believe that the challenge of London&#146;s housing needs
can best be met by giving

Mayor will produce a statutory London housing strategy and a strategic
housing investment plan, and he will set the broad allocation of the
affordable part of the regional housing pot. That will give the Mayor
the power to meet London&#146;s housing needs, and our measures will
put his housing functions on an equal footing with his other statutory
functions, thus ensuring strong links between them&#151;especially
between the housing strategy, the London plan and his transport and
economic development
strategies.</p><p><a name="06102037000593">The
housing target for London in the Mayor&#146;s plan is a minimum of
23,000 homes a year, 50 per cent. of which should be affordable.
Hammersmith and Fulham&#146;s current London plan target is a minimum
400 homes a year, but I am concerned about whether its recent actions
will allow it to meet that target. In the Mayor&#146;s early
alterations to his London plan, he proposed a minimum target of 450
homes a year in Hammersmith and Fulham from 2007-08. The proposed
target reflects the likely future availability of sites in the borough
until
2016-17.</p><p><a name="06102037000594">We
should be building more and more mixed-tenure communities that attract
people and families from all walks of life. We should be able to walk
down a street and not know whether a home is rented or privately owned.
We are investing about &#163;1.7 billion of taxpayers&#146; money
in affordable housing in London through the Housing
Corporation&#146;s affordable housing programme in 2006-08. Between
April 2006 and March 2008, the corporation aims to provide more than
28,000 affordable homes in London. Since 2003-04, it has allocated the
majority of its funding to new, affordable housing in London
on a sub-regional basis. In 2006-08, some &#163;323 million will be
invested in the west London sub-region through the Housing
Corporation&#146;s affordable housing programme. Hammersmith and
Fulham will have a share in the 4,599 homes that that funding will
deliver. Almost 1,000 of those will be social rented homes in
Hammersmith and

associations offering new build homebuy with grant funding are expected
to produce shared ownership properties that are affordable for the
intended client group, and to apply a financial test to ensure that the
monthly rent, service charges and mortgage payments are within
applicants&#146; means. Rents are capped at 3 per cent. of the value
of the landlord&#146;s retained equity, with a target of 2.75 per
cent.</p><p><a name="06102037000597">Housing
associations are also required to satisfy themselves that applicants
for shared ownership schemes can sustain the long-term commitment of
owner occupation&#151;that is, mortgage or rent payments as well as
future maintenance. Where no grant is provided, it is for the local
authority to ensure that those matters are dealt with&#151;for
example, through the section 106
agreements.</p><p><a name="06102037000598">We have
set the challenging aim to halve the number of households living in
temporary accommodation by 2010. Hammersmith and Fulham has committed
to ensuring success in meeting the 2010 target in the borough. It has
been making progress, having reduced the number of people in temporary
accommodation from 1,825 in March 2005 to 1,667 in March 2006. We have
