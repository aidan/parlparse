<p><a name="st_o0"><a name="60502-01_spmin0"><b>The Minister of State, Department for Transport  (Dr.   Stephen Ladyman): </b> 
 The Department&#039;s handbook of rules and guidance for the national safety camera programme for England and Wales sets out strict rules and criteria for the deployment of safety cameras. The criteria ensure that cameras are deployed where there is a strong road safety need and where they can make a difference.
</p>





<p><a name="st_o1"><a name="60502-01_spnew0"><b> Michael Fabricant: </b> 
 But is that really the case? In 2003, prosecutions went up by 44 per cent., yet fatalities fell by only 2 per cent. The Minister says that so-called safety cameras&#151;let us at least call them speed cameras&#151;are placed in order to stop fatalities, yet often, where they are sited at the scenes of car crashes, those car crashes had nothing to do with speed. Will the Minister review where these cameras are sited?
</p>





<p><a name="st_o2"><a name="60502-01_spnew1"><b> Dr. Ladyman: </b> 
 The hon. Gentleman needs to keep up with events. We have just had a study of the first four years of the road camera partnerships, which shows a 70 per cent. reduction in vehicles breaking the speed limits at fixed sites and a 42 per cent. reduction in people killed and seriously injured at camera sites. No published work anywhere in the world suggests other than that cameras work in making roads safer. They are put where there is a history of speeding and of people being killed and seriously injured.
</p>





<p><a name="st_o3"><a name="60502-01_spnew2"><b> Mr. Scott: </b> 
 I thank the Minister for his letter to me of 24 April regarding the speed camera at the bottom of the M11 in my constituency. While noting the contents, may I ask whether that camera will at least be repositioned in an area where it may help safety rather than hinder it, because it seems that accidents have continued to rise there?

<br>&nbsp;<br></p>





<p><a name="st_o4"><a name="60502-01_spnew3"><b> Dr. Ladyman: </b> 
 Of course, the positioning of all cameras is kept under review. The camera that the hon. Gentleman mentions was put there to enforce a permanent speed limit on that particular part of motorway, where drivers were continuing to ignore the speed limit. The number of people being seriously injured on that stretch of road was not coming down, so a camera was necessary to enforce the speed limit. If it proves unsuccessful in reducing the rate of casualties, of course I would expect its position to be reviewed.

 (Lab): In Staffordshire, there are no plans for any new safety cameras in the coming year, yet residents continue to come to me with requests for new speed cameras because of the dangers of speeding traffic.

</p>





<p><a name="st_o6"><a name="60502-01_spnew5"><b> Dr. Ladyman: </b> 
 I can give my hon. Friend that assurance. He will recollect that, in December, my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State announced that, from next year, we would have new rules governing how cameras were sited, with local partnerships having greater flexibility in being able to site cameras where they perceived there to be a threat instead of having to wait until people are killed or seriously injured before they do so. My hon. Friend is right to say that there is very strong public support for speed cameras, especially in towns and near to where children are at risk.

 (Lab): At the weekend, an eight-year-old girl was killed in north Wales as a result of a road traffic accident. Does my hon. Friend agree that a strong message should go out from both sides of the House that speed and traffic kill and is it not unfortunate that that seems to be becoming an issue on which opposing sides of the House do not agree?
</p>





<p><a name="st_o8"><a name="60502-01_spnew7"><b> Dr. Ladyman: </b> 
 First, let me express my sadness at the news of the little girl being killed in Wales. I am sure that the sympathy of the whole House goes out to her family.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60502-01_para0">
<a name="stpa_o0">It is very important that we recognise that all the evidence suggests that speed kills and that it is necessary to have strict enforcement at certain dangerous places to ensure that people are obeying the speed limits. If we do that, we will continue to drive down deaths and serious injuries on our roads, as we have over recent years.

<p><a name="st_o9"><a name="60502-01_spnew8"><b> Mr. Alistair Carmichael  (Orkney and Shetland)</b> 
 (LD): The Department&#039;s research, to which the Minister referred, established that, in some 245 cases, there had been no reduction in casualties following the siting of road safety cameras. What has happened on those sites? In how many cases have the cameras been removed and nothing put in their place and in how many have they been replaced with other safety measures?
</p>





<p><a name="st_o10"><a name="60502-01_spnew9"><b> Dr. Ladyman: </b> 
 If the hon. Gentleman has specific examples about which he would like information, I shall attempt to get it for him. The Department&#039;s study 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>2 May 2006 : Column 817</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>showed significant improvements in the rate of casualties across most camera sites. The Department has requested the safety camera partnerships to review the siting of all cameras and ensure that they are in the best place, where they can be most effective.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60502-01_para1">

 (Lab/Co-op): The Minister referred to community safety partnerships&#039; ability to urge the placing of cameras when the strict criteria are not necessarily in place. Is not it true that, on several roads the high speed and the amount of traffic travelling at excess speed discourage pedestrians and cyclists, and that it would, therefore, be reasonable to locate a safety and speed camera on such a road?
</p>





<p><a name="st_o12"><a name="60502-01_spnew11"><b> Dr. Ladyman: </b> 
 My hon. Friend is correct. Even under existing rules, road safety camera partnerships are entitled to 15 per cent. flexibility. They have some local flexibility to decide where to site cameras. Under the new rules that the Secretary of State announced in December, they will have much greater flexibility from next year, but they will also have to be accountable to local people for where they have decided to site cameras. They are entitled to do that to encourage pedestrians and cyclists if they wish but they must explain to local people exactly what they hope to achieve and their targets for the site.

 As part of the package that the Secretary of State announced in December, we are publishing new guidance to all the safety camera partnerships, making it clear how we wish signage to be improved. It is vital that motorists can see a speed limit sign in the same field of view as a camera. For legal reasons, it is not always possible to put the speed limit on the camera. The notification of, for example, a 30 mph speed limit is done not by repeater signs but by a road sign when one enters the speed limit area and the presence of lamp posts in a built-up area. We therefore have to be careful about exactly how we proceed but the Department is issuing clear and good guidance about how it should make the signs available.

<p><a name="st_o34"><a name="60502-02_spnew13"><b> Mr. Darling: </b> 
 Yes, work is going on. Specifically, following the tragic accident and derailment in Berkshire in 2004, the Rail Safety and Standards Board is considering the lessons to be learned. Trains in general are much safer and better constructed than they were in the past. There is a lot of evidence to show that, provided that people remain within the train at a time of rapid deceleration or derailment, they have a better chance of not being injured than if, for one reason or another, they are flung out of the train. In addition to that work, we constantly do everything that we can to use all the modern techniques available to make trains as safe as possible. Self-evidently, trains are different from cars. The right hon. Gentleman has previously raised with me the question of seatbelts, and that is still to be investigated, but I assure him that we are considering that.

<p><a name="st_o36"><a name="60502-02_spnew15"><b> Mr. Darling: </b> 
 My hon. Friend has done a great deal to highlight the issue of safety in her constituency and in London generally. The rail companies are acutely aware that, if we continue to see more and more people using trains, we must ensure that stations are safe. That is why we have increased significantly the funding available to British Transport police, both to increase numbers of staff, including special constables, and to make capital expenditure available to improve the safety of stations. Train operating companies must also play their role. As I mentioned earlier, closed circuit television is being used on stations and nearly a third of rolling stock has been replaced over the past seven or eight years, much of which has CCTV on board. The mainstream police forces also have their role to play. Nobody in London, particularly after the <i>Evening Standard</i> campaign over the past few weeks, can be in any doubt that safety is important. Different approaches must be applied at different stations, but we are right to keep the issue at the front of our minds.

<p><a name="st_o38"><a name="60502-02_spnew17"><b> Mr. Darling: </b> 
 As I have said during the past few Question Times, there is no doubt that, as more and more people use the railways, we must increase capacity on the lines, not just in the hon. Gentleman&#039;s area but elsewhere. We have significantly increased capacity on the west coast main line, but there are plans to increase it in other areas as well. The objective must be to make rail travel as safe, and as comfortable, as possible, but if we are to increase capacity significantly we must all sign up to increased investment, because the railways cost money to run. Unfortunately, so far the Conservative party has failed to join us in that.

Our key task, however&#151;especially in the north-west, where the hon. Lady&#039;s constituency is&#151;is to make sure that we spend the money that is needed.

The problem is that, according to the Office of Rail Regulation, between now and 2014 no new trains will be travelling on our railways&#151;there will be no additional passenger train kilometres&#151;and the Government forecast a jump in the number of passengers of some 30 per cent.

 We are spending very substantial sums on improving the network to get more capacity out of it and we are making improvements in terms of the amount of money spent on rolling stock.

For example, the British Transport police and others co-operate to ensure better throughput of people, so that they can travel safely.

 Does the Secretary of State agree that a factor that puts people off switching from travelling by car to travelling by train is the very high fares? In some places, fares are nearly 10 times higher than those for comparable journeys on mainland Europe. Moreover, in some parts of Britain, people pay four times as much to travel with one company as others pay to travel the same distance with another company. Will the Secretary of State take a serious look at the issues of cost and confusion and try to establish a proper fare structure that provides an incentive to travel by train, rather than a disincentive?

 We need to keep fares under constant review, but given that more and more people are choosing to use the railways, that tends to suggest that they want to use them, are using them and can afford to do so. Indeed, if he compares the prices charged in this country with the rate charged per mile in continental Europe, he will see that many of our fares compare very favourably, and that many are in fact better. He should avoid simply concentrating on the walk-on first-class and standard fares, because many other fares are a lot cheaper than that. When zonal charging is introduced in London, which will affect his constituents, people travelling from one London zone to another will pay the same rate, no matter which part of London they are travelling in.

 I agree that Hull Trains does operate some good services and offer fares that are cheaper than the alternatives. However, I repeat that we must also have regard to the effect that the recent decision in respect of Grand Central Trains will have on Great North Eastern Railway&#039;s ability to provide its services, especially the half-hourly service that it wants to provide to Leeds. That is being looked at, and it may be possible to reach an agreement that allows Grand Central Trains to operate and also allows GNER to fulfil its obligations in providing that service to Leeds. It is important to remember that the network has to work as a whole and that it is not possible to look at one service in isolation, although most people using Hull Trains greatly appreciate the services that it provides.

 No, that is not right. As I said earlier, the range of prices offered on different routes across the network is quite wide. Some first-class, walk-on fares are expensive and have gone up, but other fares are much cheaper in real terms than they were, say, 10 years ago. Then, passenger revenue&#151;the money coming from passengers expressed as a percentage of spending&#151;was at 85 per cent. Today it is 57 per cent., which shows that the taxpayer is paying more now than under the previous Conservative Government.

It is true that first-class or walk-on fares are higher, but we are trying to strike a reasonable balance between what fare payers must pay and what the general taxpayer must pay. The most important thing is to ensure that we continue to spend the money needed to have more trains and so increase capacity on the track. We will set out our plans in the 2007 spending review.

 I agree with my hon. Friend and I know how interested she is in these issues. More can be done, but there has been progress over recent years, as I am sure that she would be first to acknowledge. Among the initiatives being undertaken are a summer development programme for black and minority ethnic citizens and a summer placement scheme for those who are disabled. In particular, we can do more to reach out to those networks of people who lack a formal education the first-time round&#151;those who are seeking a second chance in life&#151;and to try to make the civil service an attractive career option for people who lack the formal and informal networks that she speaks of.

Does he think that female recruitment and progression will be helped or hindered by the recent revelations from the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister?

 The fact is that we waited 148 years for even a draft civil service Bill. We now have that Bill. The hon. Gentleman will just have to be a little more patient when it comes to the Government&#039;s specific consideration of a civil service Act. There is, of course, a consultation on the civil service code. Many thousands of people have participated in that and it has been very helpful. Just to reassure him&#151;because I know how genuinely interested he is in these matters&#151;when his party was last in power, 17 per cent. of the civil service were women, but the figure is now up to 29 per cent. That is remarkable progress, but we accept that much more needs to be done.

 I thank the Minister for that response and I welcome the transformational work that has been done, but does he not agree that there is not much point in people being able to sort out their tax and benefits online, if they cannot afford a computer?

 My hon. Friend has raised these matters before and she is right to do so. Partly in the social exclusion unit and also in the Cabinet Office, we are working to ensure access to wireless broadband, in particular. Many of the households concerned do not have a fixed telephone line, so wireless broadband access is really important for many of our constituents across the country. I have seen projects around the country, such as Eastserve in east Manchester, which serves the type of community that she mentions. In addition, there are about 6,000 UK online centres, which enable low-cost access to the internet for those who do not have the opportunity, as yet, to have computers and broadband access at home.

Does the Prison Service computer talk to the immigration and nationality directorate computer? Does either communicate with the police national computer or the Courts Service computer?

 On a point of order, Mr. Speaker. Last week, the Home Secretary made a statement regarding the removal and deportation of foreign nationals. I asked the right hon.

<p>
<a name="60502-07_para0">
<a name="stpa_4">The aim of the new clause is to ensure that husbands and wives continue to be free of the burden of inheritance tax when they transfer property to each other; to ensure that nothing in the Bill narrows the operation of the long-established spouse exemption from inheritance tax in section 18 of the Inheritance Tax Act 1984; and to ensure that all transfers covered by section 18 before Budget day will continue to be covered, regardless of other provisions in the Bill, including schedule 20. I am not sure that the Government are minded to accept new clause 1, but if they do so, my hon. Friend the Member for South-West Hertfordshire (Mr. Gauke) will wish to move amendment (c). The Opposition are happy to support that amendment, and hope to press the matter to the vote, as it has the same general goal as new clause 1, but has more watertight drafting. In the unlikely event that new clause 1 and amendment (c) are accepted there would still be a number of significant problems with schedule 20, to which the Opposition propose to return in Committee.

</p>





<p><a name="st_16"><a name="60502-07_spnew2"><b> Mrs. Villiers: </b> 
 The hon. Gentleman makes a very good point, which I have already taken on board. In my view, section 103 of the Finance Act 2005 means that new clause 1 covers civil partners as well. Essentially, section 103 and the related delegated legislation give civil partners in this context the same rights as spouses. If we solve the problem for spouses, we automatically solve it for civil partners, too.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60502-07_para1">
<a name="stpa_5">The Opposition believe that it is vital to save the spouse exemption for husbands, wives and civil partners for the reasons that it was introduced in its present form by the Callaghan Government in 1975&#151;to reflect society&#039;s concern for the welfare of bereaved spouses, and to mitigate severe hardship when matrimonial homes had to be sold to pay the tax bill. There are two new modern reasons to reinforce the need to retain the exemption. The first has already been raised by the hon. Member for Rhondda (Chris Bryant). It is important to preserve the spouse exemption for civil partners, to whom it has only just been granted. As I said, if we are successful today in protecting spouses, section 103 of the Finance Act 2005 will protect civil partners. Secondly, rising house prices, particularly in London and the south-east mean that many more middle-income families are caught by inheritance tax, and could therefore be hit by the changes in the Bill.

<a name="stpa_8">However, trusts seldom give rise to any tax advantages whatever; they are generally tax neutral. As the impressive coalition of professionals campaigning against these measures has pointed out, the trusts penalised by the Bill are generally motivated by unobjectionable non-tax objectives: family and social objectives, which will become prohibitively expensive as a result of the proposed measures.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60502-07_para5">
<a name="stpa_9">Since estate duty was introduced in 1894, trusts have received broadly the same tax treatment as outright gifts. For example, under current rules, a gift on a flexible trust to a spouse, with the remainder going to children at the age of 25, is taxed in the same way as an outright gift of the property to the spouse, which is then passed on to her children on her death. Thus, the tax exemption means that no tax is charged on the first death, but the capital is charged at the full rate when the surviving spouse dies and the property passes to the children.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60502-07_para6">
<a name="stpa_10">Far from removing some sort of privileged status, as the Paymaster General claimed on Second Reading, the Government are effectively proposing to introduce additional new and penal tax charges on trusts, treating them more harshly than an outright gift. The Chancellor is actually tearing up a 100-year consensus, repeated only recently by the Revenue in its attempt to maintain a tax system for trusts that does not provide artificial incentives to set up a trust, but equally avoids artificial obstacles to using trusts where they would bring significant non-tax benefits.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60502-07_para7">
<a name="stpa_11">Before Budget day, section 18 of the Inheritance Tax Act 1984 exempted gifts on trusts to spouses in exactly the same way as the system operated for outright gifts and transfers. Unless the Bill is amended, it will become almost impossible to set up a trust for a spouse without losing the exemption, as it will incur an immediate inheritance tax charge on the death of the first spouse. The spousal exemption will survive only in cases falling under the definition of an immediate post-death interest, complying with six very narrow and restrictive conditions set out in the new section 49A of the 1984 Act, as proposed in schedule 20.

<a name="stpa_12">No one has yet been able to say with certainty how the six opaquely drafted conditions will apply in practice. It seems clear that severe problems will be caused by conditions 1, 3 and 4. Condition 1 states that the gift must take effect by will or intestacy. That means that spouses will no longer be able to set up trusts for one another during their life time without incurring the new charges. A particular concern is that it is not clear that condition 1 will be satisfied where a trust has been established not under a will, but under a pension policy or death in service arrangements, leaving the threat of the new charges applying in those circumstances.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60502-07_para9">
<a name="stpa_13">Condition 3 requires that the power to terminate the surviving spouse&#039;s life interest is exercised only by the spouse or with the spouse&#039;s permission. That sounds technically innocuous, but the net result is that a significant number of trusts created on divorce would fall outside the provisions of condition 3, with the risk of the new charges applying.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60502-07_para10">
<a name="stpa_14">Condition 4 provides that the life interest for a surviving spouse will qualify for the exemption only if, following its termination, assets pass absolutely to the beneficiaries. With very limited exceptions, if the property remains in trust after the death of the live tenant, the spouse exemption will not apply. The net effect of those conditions is that, if there is any flexibility in the trust, the spousal exemption is lost and a bereaved spouse or civil partner will face an immediate inheritance tax bill.

Until Budget day, a lawyer who drafted a trust without flexibility might easily find herself on the end of a negligence suit. Indeed, flexibility in trusts has been considered so important that Parliament specifically inserted flexibility into trusts via section 32 of the Trustee Act 1925. The Government&#039;s response is to say that if people want to keep their spouse exemption, they can change their wills or vary existing trusts and opt for outright gifts or the restrictive trusts that comply with the conditions that I have just outlined in the new section 49A, but this is not an adequate answer.

<a name="60502-08_para0">
<a name="stpa_17">Flexibility is built into modern trusts to help people deal with the complexity of family life in modern Britain and provide responsibly for the future of their families. The Law Society survey to which I referred earlier reported one of its members as saying:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_8">&quot;I prepare at least one will every week of my working life&#151;the majority of my clients who have set up life interest trusts in their will do so to protect children from a first marriage whilst looking after the second spouse or as protection for the children of the same marriage&#151;all this talk of tax evasion is nonsense. The traditional family set-up is no more&#151;trusts have evolved in line with this&#151;it is a shame that the Government has sought to undermine this.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="60502-08_para1">
<a name="stpa_18">Typical everyday instances where people set up flexible trusts include, as the quote suggests, the need to provide both for a spouse from a second marriage and for the children of a first marriage. A trust can be an invaluable aid in achieving the difficult task of mediating between the interests of step-parents and stepchildren. Trusts are also used to provide for children when a surviving spouse is young and likely to remarry and possibly have children from a subsequent marriage, or to enable trustees to continue to look after the interests of a spouse when old age may mean that mental capacity is affected, or when people are not confident enough that they can foretell all the family circumstances that will apply in a few years. One must remember that wills may be made well in advance of death and in the expectation that they will hold good and provide the right answer for many years to come.
</p>





<p><a name="st_23"><a name="60502-08_spnew2"><b> Helen Goodman: </b> 
 Can the hon. Lady explain why a person would want to set up a trust, rather than changing their will if, for example, they got married again or had more children? I do not see the need for a complicated trust device with special rules.
</p>





<p><a name="st_24"><a name="60502-08_spnew3"><b> Mrs. Villiers: </b> 
 The trust allows the testator to split the property between his second spouse and his children in a way that he believes is sensible and balances their interests. The typical arrangement is for the second spouse to be given access to the income from the property and the right to live in a property, but for the capital to be preserved and passed on to the children on death.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60502-08_para2">
<a name="stpa_19">The legislation ignores the realities of modern family life. Trusts provide an invaluable prop for those who are juggling the competing and sometimes conflicting interests of different family members&#151;a prop that the Government wish to kick away. As Stephen Pallister of solicitors Charles Russell pointed out:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_9">&quot;Thinking of the numerous and obvious reasons why a spouse might leave their estate for the other on death&#151;health, financial difficulties, unstable personality, second marriage and wanting to preserve the capital for the children of a first marriage, etc.&#151;this is a gross mistake by the Government.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="60502-08_para3">
<a name="stpa_20">Even if people are prepared to sacrifice the flexibility that I have mentioned to avoid the new charges, there are further flaws in the Government&#039;s argument that there is no problem with their proposal because people can change their wills or trusts to prevent the new charges from applying. The first problem is that the power to vary the trust is exactly the type of flexibility that the Government seek to outlaw through the restrictive conditions on receiving the spousal exemption, so it seems odd that they are defending their actions by encouraging people to use the system that they propose effectively to outlaw.

<a name="60502-08_para4">
<a name="stpa_21">Secondly, many variations can be carried out only by going to court&#151;for example, where children are involved&#151;which may not give people permission to vary the trust. The costs of a High Court hearing in the chancery division are prohibitive and will not be justifiable in most of the cases covered by the new rules. Furthermore, there must be a question mark over how well the courts will cope with the significant burden of hearing so many cases.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60502-08_para5">
<a name="stpa_22">Frankly, it is not easy to see exactly what tax problem the Revenue is targeting with its proposals. It has indicated informally that its concern is a situation in which the surviving spouse gives up their life interest and distributes all assets to the trust for the next generation. If that is the Revenue&#039;s concern, then it is attacking the wrong target. It is not the flexibility in the trusts that allows people to reduce their tax bill in the situation that I have outlined, but the use of the potentially exempt transfer system, which exempts the transfer of the life interest from inheritance tax, if the spouse survives for seven years after they have given up the life interest.
</p>





<p><a name="st_25"><a name="60502-08_spnew4"><b> Mrs. Sharon Hodgson  (Gateshead, East and Washington, West) (Lab):</b>

</p>





<p><a name="st_26"><a name="60502-08_spnew5"><b> Mrs. Villiers: </b> 
 As I have said, setting up a trust does not provide inheritance tax advantages. People set up trusts in order to look after their families.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60502-08_para6">
<a name="stpa_23">Rather than clobbering all flexible trusts, why not retain the current, long-established rules for trust taxation, which have worked well, but provide that if a spouse&#039;s life interest terminates during their lifetime and the assets pass to a continuing flexible trust, then it automatically gives rise to a chargeable transfer, in which case the potentially exempt transfer regime does not apply? That would achieve the result that the Revenue wants more effectively, and it would do so without inflicting the collateral damage of infringing on people&#039;s freedom to provide prudently for the future of their families in the way in which they want to and of requiring 1 million wills to be rewritten. We are prepared to work with the Government and expert groups to draft a targeted amendment along those lines.
</p>





<p><a name="st_27"><a name="60502-08_spmin0"><b>The Paymaster General  (Dawn Primarolo): </b>

 The problem in relation to the creation of lifetime trusts is not nearly as serious as the problem in relation to the creation of trusts on death, because the creation of lifetime trusts is much more unusual.

 The Paymaster General is right that there is no change to the rules on making outright transfers to the spouse. The Government propose to change the rules where trusts are set up for spouses, which is a significant restriction of the spousal exemption.

 Trusts protect a wide range of some of the most vulnerable people in our community. If Members do not believe me, they should think back to my quotations from the Law Society&#151;from people who are working on the ground managing people&#039;s arrangements for their wills. It is probably in the interests of lawyers for the proposals to go through, because everyone will have to go to them to get their wills changed, yet they care so passionately about the ordinary, middle-income, hardworking, prudent people whom they represent that they are campaigning against the changes in order to enable them to continue to be able to set up the trusts they wish.

 I am sure that my hon.

Moreover, given that average house prices are approaching the point whereby several years hence the majority of estates are likely to fall within the inheritance tax net, we are talking not about the rich but about householders.

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_10">&quot;The Revenue has confirmed to us that the Finance Bill does indeed contain nothing on this. There is no specific exclusion for life policy trusts as has been widely claimed. Millions of wills and life policy trusts may be caught.&quot;</p>

</p>

<p>
<a name="60502-08_para9">
<a name="stpa_26">The Revenue&#039;s assurances on life policies seem to be based on the view that premium payments are not additions to the trust because they are made pursuant to the terms of the policy contract. That contested view of the legal position is scant comfort for the policyholders who could be hit with the new IHT charges. Skandia Life has said that as many as 4.5 million people could be    affected. In any event, life policies settled on accumulation and maintenance trusts would still be affected. The problem has not been solved, and I hope that the Government will consider taking appropriate measures to tackle it in the Bill.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60502-08_para10">
<a name="stpa_27">I urge the Government to accept new clause 1 and amendment (c) and reverse their decision to impose new inheritance tax charges on trusts for spouses and civil partners. I urge them to scrap all the penal new inheritance tax charges that they are proposing. First, no proper consultation has taken place on these new taxes. The Chancellor left them out of his Budget speech and the Revenue failed to mention them in the entirety of a detailed two-year consultation process that it carried out on the taxation of trusts. Secondly, these taxes are retrospective. They apply to existing wills and trusts, many of which will be expensive, difficult and in some cases impossible to amend. Thirdly, no effective assessment has been made of their impact. Upwards of 1 million wills of ordinary working people may need to be reviewed and rewritten, with all the huge costs that that would entail. Finally, they would amount to a tax on prudent families and impact harshly on thousands of ordinary, hardworking people whose only crime is to provide responsibly for their families and to plan for an uncertain future.

</p>

<p>
<a name="60502-09_para0">
<a name="stpa_29">First, although the hon. Member for Chipping Barnet (Mrs. Villiers) sounded reasonable, she exaggerated the need for any changes to the Government&#039;s proposals. Indeed, the hon. Member for Ludlow (Mr. Dunne), who perhaps owns property that far exceeds the expectations of any of my constituents, gave the game away when he said that half of all properties in Britain will soon&#151;in a matter of a few years&#151;go over the threshold. Not a single property in the Rhondda sells at &#163;300,000. The idea that 50 per cent. of estates in the next few years will reach &#163;325,000 is extraordinary. The hon. Gentleman&#039;s mathematics need to be better because between 94 and 96 per cent. of estates do not reach that threshold today and will not do so with the increases in the threshold that the Bill proposes.
</p>





<p><a name="st_36"><a name="60502-09_spnew1"><b> Mr. Dunne: </b> 
 Clearly, I am not familiar with property values in the Rhondda, but I know those in my

<p><a name="st_37"><a name="60502-09_spnew2"><b> Chris Bryant: </b> 
 The hon. Gentleman can speak for his constituency, but I dare to suggest that if he considers the whole country, his statement that 50 per cent. of estates will be valued at more than &#163;325,000 in the next few years is a gross exaggeration.

Consequently, her comments constitute a bit of scaremongering, which is an inappropriate approach to the Bill.

<p>
<a name="60502-09_para2">
<a name="stpa_31">Secondly, the reason for my opposition to new clause    1 and my wholehearted support for the Government&#039;s proposals is that there are two alternative directions of travel in which we can move on inheritance tax. One is to undermine inheritance tax&#151;not necessarily by pledging to abolish it, but by suggesting that one disagrees with it and would like to abolish it even if one does not have the gumption to say so. On the other hand&#151;I may be about to step into old-fashioned shoes&#151;some of us believe in inheritance tax for the simple reason that the greatest source of inequality and inequity in British society is inherited wealth. If we do nothing, especially when the wealthiest in our society are doing extremely well, to undermine the progress towards greater inequality, we undermine the fabric of the society in which I want and choose to live.

 No. This is another area in which the hon. Member for Chipping Barnet exaggerated earlier.

However, the Paymaster General might want to clarify the one genuine point that the hon.

<p><a name="st_44"><a name="60502-09_spnew9"><b> Julia Goldsworthy  (Falmouth and Camborne) (LD):</b> 
 As we have heard, there is a divergence of opinion on what the Bill means. The Red Book suggests that only &#163;15 million would be raised by the changes to inheritance tax and trusts, and that the new regulations would affect only a small number of people. However, the evidence given to the Treasury Committee by John Whiting suggested that the changes would affect a lot of everyday arrangements and a huge number of individuals. <i>The Times</i> suggested that they would affect 100,000 families, and the Society of Trust and Estate Practitioners went further, estimating that at least 1 million wills would be affected. The society also estimated that the average cost of rewriting a will was &#163;250. If we multiply that by 1 million, we see that the cost to individuals of rewriting their wills would stand at &#163;250 million, while the benefit to the Treasury of the changes would be &#163;15 million. It is easy to see the disparity between the number of people likely to be affected and the amount of money raised.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60502-09_para6">
<a name="stpa_35">Skandia estimated that up to 4.5 million life insurance policies could be affected by the changes, because so many families have life insurance policies written into trusts. Given that the nil rate band does not stay in line with inflation, more and more families will be drawn into the lower end of the system. Therefore, it is not only those who presently fall into the inheritance tax band who will be going back to their solicitors to change their life insurance policies. This will also affect people who are unsure at what point in the future their estate might fall into the inheritance tax band.

 As I said, the system will be fairer and simpler. The hon. Members for Rhondda (Chris Bryant) and for Chipping Barnet (Mrs. Villiers) do, in fact, agree on something. Fundamentally, the issue raised by new clause 1 is that of spouse exemption and whether that is changed by the Bill. There is a real lack of clarity, and all the new clauses and the amendments to them are intended to make the situation clearer. Even if the Paymaster General argues that it is already clear, members of the public and professionals have a different interpretation of what the regulations mean.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60502-09_para7">
<a name="stpa_36">I can see the good intentions of new clause 1, but its argument is slightly circular&#151;that anything exempt under the new Act will continue to be exempt&#151;and does not make sense. The amendment tabled by the hon. Member for South-West Hertfordshire (Mr. Gauke) improves his Front-Bench team&#039;s phrasing and overcomes that tautology. New clause 2, tabled by Liberal Democrat Members, extends that and calls for a further period of time to be elapsed so that the implications of the legislation can be made absolutely clear, not least for individuals who have died since the Budget either intestate or with their will written into trust. At the moment, the cases of those individuals are subject to considerable uncertainty. I am glad that the hon. Member for Rhondda approves of amendment (b), which, for the avoidance of any doubt whatever, makes it clear that civil partners will also fall under the spousal exemption.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60502-09_para8">
<a name="stpa_37">New clause 2 seeks a delay in the implementation of the Act until its impact is fully assessed and understood. Debate in the House and outside shows continuing disagreement about the extent of that impact. Making it explicit that a full consultation will take place would be appreciated, as that did not happen before the proposals in the Bill were put forward. I understand that a partial regulatory impact assessment has been undertaken, but the new clause would ensure that there would be a full regulatory impact. Would the Paymaster General be prepared to publish that partial regulatory impact assessment before the relevant clauses are considered in Committee?

Currently, their estates are in limbo, and it is not clear how the new regime will apply to them.

It also sorts out what happens in relation to people who die in the intervening period.

<a name="stpa_39">Surely the fundamental anomaly is that, under the existing regulations, someone can still make a lifetime gift free of inheritance tax if they do not die within seven years. That has not been redressed by the Bill. The changes proposed by the Bill impact on people who are not cash-rich, cannot make cash gifts in kind and thereby avoid inheritance tax, and have houses that have increased greatly in value in the many years that they have lived in them. In my constituency, for example, average house prices are increasing so rapidly, and the gap between house prices and incomes is so great, that more and more households are falling into inheritance tax.

Will they do that before clause 57 and schedule 20 are considered in Committee?

Can they specify where that is explicit in the Bill, and can they clearly demonstrate why the new clauses and the amendments to new clause 1 are not necessary? Along with the professionals and many members of the public, I would welcome more clarity, certainty and evidence-based policy-making in this regard.

<a name="stpa_42">I do not expect to be a beneficiary of any trust of this kind. I have created no such family trusts in my own family.

Now they seem to be blowing the whistle. I consider that the Government are legislating retrospectively, in practice if not technically, when they say that they do not like the arrangements that people have made to deal with future events and force them to change those arrangements&#151;arrangements that were made on the basis of good advice and were legal and sensible under the law of the time, which happens to have been approved and supported by this Government over the past nine years.

I hope that he is proud to represent his constituency and that he expects some of his constituents to use the opportunities provided under even a Labour Government to build businesses and buy properties, for example, in order to become more prosperous, thereby coming into the tax regime that this Government have so carefully designed to entrap them.

If that money trickles down through the generations, it very often does far more good than if it trickles into the sticky hands of the Chancellor of the Exchequer, which seems the only alternative on offer in today&#039;s debate.

<a name="60502-10_para5">
<a name="stpa_47">It would be much better if the inheritance tax system recognised that a person is not very rich just because they have a flat or house that might now be worth a lot of money. There are a number of elderly residents in Kensington and Chelsea living in two or three-bedroom flats that are perhaps worth the best part of &#163;1 million who might be on quite low incomes. Is the Labour party saying that those people must move to realise their asset and to show that they have some wealth? I want to live in a country where, if such people want to carry on living in their two-bedroom flats, they can do so. They should not be treated as rich because, even though they are low incomes and have no other assets to pay all the taxes that Labour now wants to impose on them, they happen to live in a part of the country that has rather high flat and house prices.

 I had hoped that we might find a few areas of consensus on this issue. There is clearly a range of views on inheritance tax, but I disagree with the hon.

Not all my colleagues will agree, but I think that there is a role for inheritance tax in our system. It may not apply to many people in the Rhondda, but it does to a lot of people in South-West Hertfordshire. The rate may also be open to question, but I do not disagree with the basic idea of inheritance tax.

<p>
<a name="60502-11_para2">
<a name="stpa_54">I see nothing wrong with that. Since 1894, when estate duty was introduced, certain types of trust have been equated with outright ownership, and taxed accordingly.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60502-11_para3">
<a name="stpa_55">Perhaps the Paymaster General will correct me if I am wrong, but I believe that there is a consensus about the value of the spousal exemption. As my hon. Friend the Member for Chipping Barnet said, it was introduced in its current form in 1975, but in some form or other it dates back to 1896. The need for the exemption is easy to understand; in most cases, an inheritance leads to a windfall, but a death usually results in a fall in income and an element of hardship for the surviving spouse.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60502-11_para4">
<a name="stpa_56">In addition, there is usually a shared family home. Given the emotional concerns that follow a loss, it would be unduly harsh for a spouse to have to sell a house to pay an inheritance tax bill. Clearly, the particular circumstances of spouses need to be considered, and the Civil Partnership Act 2004 has extended the number of people in that category. We need to ask a couple of questions about the Bill. Does it continue to apply to tax trusts in the same way as to outright gifts, and does the spousal exemption continue to apply?
</p>

<p>
<a name="60502-11_para5">
<a name="stpa_57">The Government might argue that the spousal exemption will apply in respect of immediate post-death interests, but the professional advice that I have seen maintains that that will not work because, in practice, it is almost impossible to meet the conditions. Moreover, it is held to be
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_12">&quot;nigh on impossible for one spouse to leave their estate in trust for the other and obtain the spouse exemption.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="60502-11_para6">
<a name="stpa_58">As my hon. Friend the Member for Chipping Barnet pointed out, there are specific conditions in the draft proposals in respect of inheritance tax that make it very difficult for most trusts to work and still obtain the spousal exemption under the immediate post-death interest definition. Condition 3 requires that the surviving spouse interest can be ended only during her lifetime with her consent. Consequently, a will that states that the surviving spouse has a right to live in a house until remarriage, when the assets pass to the children&#151;the experts say that that is fairly common&#151;will breach that condition and will not be able to benefit from the spousal exemption.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60502-11_para7">
<a name="stpa_59">Condition 4 states that, on termination of a surviving spouse&#039;s interest, a person will become entitled to the capital outright. However, if the trustees have the right to defer a child&#039;s absolute entitlement&#151;again, that is fairly common&#151;then that condition is breached and the spousal exemption is not available.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60502-11_para8">
<a name="stpa_60">The immediate post-death interest conditions prohibit flexibility, the need for which was questioned earlier. Again, my hon. Friend the Member for Chipping Barnet dealt with that very well. Complex family arrangements are best dealt with through flexibility. We have heard about the case of a widowed second wife, where there are children from the first marriage, which even the hon. Member for Rhondda acknowledged was an issue. There also cases such as that of a young widow who is expected to remarry and have more children; a widow and children with special

<br>&nbsp;<br>needs; a childless marriage where both spouses want their assets to go to their respective nephews and nieces; where a property is complex and may impose management demands best performed by trustees rather than the widow; or where a testator has less than full confidence about the distribution of the property.

Friend the Member for Chipping Barnet rightly pointed out, the Government&#039;s proposals are an ineffective way of addressing their concern. Better ways could be found by looking at the potentially exempt transfer route, which would address the matter much better than using such an over-sized sledge hammer to hit that particular nut.

<br>&nbsp;<br>flexibility, which is clearly not something that the Government want to encourage in trusts, although it would be useful in those circumstances. Variation could also be achieved with the consent of the beneficiaries, but that would not be possible if they were minors. In that case, it would be necessary to go to the court, with all the expense that would incur. If the Government chose to use that argument, it would not be persuasive.

<a name="60502-11_para12">
<a name="stpa_64">The Government say that the provision will affect only a few people and several Labour Members have suggested that it would apply only to a tiny minority of the wealthy. However, over the past few days, I have been bombarded with documents produced by professionals pointing out that they regularly advise the inclusion of a trust in fairly normal wills, and that it is a common, run-of-the-mill device used to protect a family and to address particular family circumstances. As a matter of course, trusts are involved in wills, not for taxation reasons, but because they provide flexibility. The Government appear not to know that, and the fact that they fail to do so suggests a lack of consultation, which has marked the process throughout.
</p>

<a name="stpa_65">Why have the Government done this? Perhaps saloon bar wisdom and the lack of consultation means that they were not aware of the problems that they have caused, but I wonder whether another element is involved, so I want to offer one or two friendly words of warning to the Labour party. The whole approach smacks of a good old go at the toffs, and we have heard one or two comments along the lines this afternoon that just the wealthy and rich are affected, that the policy does not really matter and that it will play quite well perhaps back in the Rhondda.

I fear that the Government and the Chancellor have done exactly the same thing with this policy. They think that they have made an attack on the very wealthy and the privileged few, when the reality is that large numbers of ordinary people, not the wealthy, will be affected by this policy.

 This has been a very interesting debate so far, and I want to make three points and to ask a question. Sir Alan, you have allowed the debate to range over the philosophy of inheritance tax&#151;very judiciously, if I may say so&#151;because it is important for the public that we have the opportunity to discuss such matters in the Chamber and this is the obvious opportunity to do so.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60502-12_para0">
<a name="stpa_67">Perhaps I can start by saying that my personal view of inheritance tax&#151;a view for which I argued, with no success whatsoever, when I was shadow Paymaster General in the shadow Administration in the 1997 Parliament&#151;is that we should reduce the rate of 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>2 May 2006 : Column 854</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>inheritance tax to 10 per cent. That would put out of business the whole industry of providing ways to avoid inheritance tax by structuring and persuading people to give away their property, they hope, more than seven years before they die and would stop people leaving the country to shelter their assets from inheritance tax. Instead, we would make this country something of a haven for people with assets to shelter from inheritance tax or estate duty, or whatever may exist in their own countries. There would be a major Laffer curve effect, and we would reduce the marginal rate from 40 to 10 per cent. We certainly would not reduce the revenue by anything like that amount; the revenue might even increase. That is my own view of how to deal with the problem, but I have so far failed to persuade my hon. Friends, let alone anyone else, that that is the way forward. Perhaps, one day, we shall make progress along those lines.
</p>





<p><a name="st_66"><a name="60502-12_spnew1"><b> Helen Goodman: </b> 
 Can the hon. Gentleman explain how the Laffer curve could possibly affect the revenue from inheritance tax? One can understand how it could affect work incentives and the take from income tax, but how could it possibly affect the revenue from inheritance tax?
</p>





<p><a name="st_67"><a name="60502-12_spnew2"><b> Mr. Davies: </b> 
 I do not think that the hon. Lady was listening because I tried to explain how that would happen. First, to avoid inheritance tax quite honourably, sensibly and rationally, a considerable number of people try to give their money away to their children more than seven years before they expect that they might be in danger of dying. Clearly, that is a loss to the Revenue. Clearly, there is an element of gambling about it, but I do not think that people would do that if the rate were only 10 per cent., because of the considerable disadvantages and considerable risks; not least that their children may marry the wrong person, so half the money would go to someone else. There are all sorts of risk of that kind, so people would not go in for those schemes as much as they do currently.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60502-12_para1">
<a name="stpa_68">Secondly, people are sometimes influenced in their choice of country of residence by the inheritance tax regime. If we have a 40 per cent. regime in this country, people will not come here with large assets and those with substantial assets will tend to move away. I am explaining this at some length because the hon. Lady obviously did not follow the argument when I presented it in slightly more summarised form a few minutes ago, but it is a serious argument and I suggest that she think about it.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60502-12_para2">
<a name="stpa_69">The Laffer curve effect means that one reduces the rate of a tax and, as a result, induces behavioural changes. As a result of that, the revenue from the tax rises. That is what I was arguing&#151;I think reasonably&#151;we could achieve through reducing the rate of inheritance tax. I make that point today because I have tried to make it before in private conversation and got nowhere. Perhaps someone who is listening will pick the idea up and it will eventually get somewhere.

That is irrespective of the connection between the two things; there may be good arguments, which have nothing whatever to do with inheritance tax, for setting up trusts.

That is a general point of principle.

<a name="stpa_73">My third point is that the Government owe us some explanation of their agenda. We have not heard one so far in the debate. They clearly have an agenda&#151;reflected in the Bill&#151;to have a go at trusts. There was an interesting discussion between the Paymaster General and my hon. Friend the Member for South-West Hertfordshire (Mr. Gauke) about the extent to which the proposals in the Bill would remove the exemption from inheritance tax, which the right hon. Lady tells us the Government intend to maintain, in the case of inter-spouse transfers on death&#151;that is to say, inheritance by one spouse from another&#151;in the event that that transfer or inheritance takes places by means of a trust. I cannot see any rational reason at all for saying, &quot;Well, we think that it is a good idea to have an exemption from inheritance tax for spouses, but not if the spouses, for whatever reason, have arranged their affairs so that transfer takes place on death by means of a trust or so that the assets pass into a trust on death.&quot; We need to know why the Government want to make such a change and if it is a change that they intend to make, as opposed to an effect that they did not anticipate when they drafted the Bill.

<p>
<a name="60502-12_para7">
<a name="stpa_74">Irrespective of that point, which is a matter for debate between my hon. Friend the Member for Chipping Barnet and the Paymaster General, there are many other areas where the Bill indisputably, and without any apparent reason, attacks trusts in one way or another, or makes the result of people setting up a trust a damaging and perverse one, which it otherwise would not be. For example, the Bill would ensure that the beneficiaries of accumulation and maintenance trusts would have to come into full title of the assets, and could dispose of them without any restriction, when they were 18 years old. It is amazing to me that anybody in this Chamber, irrespective of their political party, thinks that it is a frightfully good idea to give a large amount of capital, in relation to that family&#039;s total assets, to a young person of 18 to dispose of quite freely.

<a name="60502-12_para8">
<a name="stpa_75">Equally, the Government are changing the law to ensure that the only beneficiaries of accumulation and maintenance trusts can be either those who are benefiting from a criminal injuries order, or the beneficiaries of trusts set out by parents. However, let us consider trusts set up by grandparents, people who wish to set up a trust for the benefit of their own children and the children of a dead sister or brother who have been left in difficulty, or, indeed, people with no children who wish to leave money in a trust for the benefit of the children of their dead brother or sister. Why should we penalise such trusts as against trusts set up by parents? What is the Government&#039;s agenda?

<a name="60502-12_para9">
<a name="stpa_76">I am mystified by why the Government have suddenly got it into their head to have a run at trusts. Was it, as has been suggested, a purely emotional and symbolic thing? Did the Paymaster General suddenly think that trusts are nasty because they are associated with richer people? I am sure that that is not the explanation because I know her too well to think that she would suddenly have such a rush of blood to the head and thus decide to draw up such legislation.
</p>

<a name="60502-12_para10">
<a name="stpa_77">Was a rational calculation made of the amount of money that could be squeezed out of the public by changing the rules on trusts? The hon. Member for Falmouth and Camborne (Julia Goldsworthy), who speaks for the Liberal party&#151;she has also left the Chamber&#151;disposed of that one. She said that on the Government&#039;s figures, the provisions will result in a net increase in revenue of &#163;15 million. She gave us an estimate of the cost of rewriting trusts and of taxpayers rearranging their affairs that ran to hundreds of millions.

<a name="stpa_78">However, even if the hon.

On the test of proportionality to which, I think, the Paymaster General and her Government are committed, the provisions thus fail because the incremental revenue bears no relation to the cost to taxpayers, which is basically a cost to the economy. Although the change might be a good thing for the accountancy and legal professions, it will mean that people will incur large costs that are gratuitously imposed by a piece of legislation with a motive that none of us really understands.

<a name="stpa_79">Before we go any further, it would be extremely helpful if the Paymaster General gave the Committee an explanation. Perhaps I have, naively, missed an obvious point, but, if so, I am reassured that no hon. Member on either side of the Chamber appears to have grasped it. What was the objective behind targeting trusts? Why have trusts been scheduled for punishment in such a way? What is the rationale behind the approach? We must have rational government in a sophisticated democracy. If the Government bring forward new measures and want to change the law, the burden must

Member for Rhondda (Chris Bryant) would have us believe, to avoid inheritance tax completely. The spousal exemption exists to prevent punitive double taxation of an estate. That is a sound proposition, founded on an inoffensive principle. It has, as my hon. Friend the Member for Chipping Barnet (Mrs. Villiers) said, been the subject of consensus since capital transfer tax was introduced by the Labour Government in 1975. The Chief Secretary echoed the need for just such a principle when he spoke on Second Reading about the need to ensure that people pay their fair share of tax. I know from my brief experience in consideration of the National Insurance Contributions Bill that that particular Labour mantra is very much in vogue. The Paymaster General used it four times in one speech. I am glad that she has taught it to colleagues on the Treasury Bench, but the mantra is as nebulous now as it was then.

<a name="60502-13_para5">
<a name="stpa_85">The use of trusts as a vehicle for asset protection has made them the target of another Dawn raid because they are perceived as being unfair. The fact that trusts exist to protect assets from more than the taxman does not seem to concern the Government overmuch. It is true that the caveat for those suffering from a disability has been preserved, but only for a very limited class of beneficiaries in which no one can be thought of as vulnerable if they are not first found incapable under the Mental Health Act 1983 or are claiming disability benefits. That is a sop to fairness, but in reality it is deeply regressive and inflexible. It takes care of the mad, but not the bad or the sad. It also fails to draw the sting of schedule 20 because fairness has always been at the heart of trusts.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60502-13_para6">
<a name="stpa_86">Most often the very reason why trusts exist is to allow for flexible and equitable distribution of assets in the face of changing and unforeseen circumstances. The Government have been keen to acknowledge that trusts have a positive role to play in assisting people to manage their tax affairs, and in particular in holding assets on behalf of vulnerable people. However, vulnerability is not linked, and never has been, exclusively to disability.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60502-13_para7">
<a name="stpa_87">Members of the legal profession made a number of representations to me on the many beneficial effects that trusts may have in restraining a Rake&#039;s Progress or in keeping a fool and his gold well acquainted. Many sound arguments that relate to the age at which the interests of younger beneficiaries should vest regrettably go beyond the scope of new clause 1. No doubt, the issue will be revisited in Standing Committee. However, I regard beneficiaries under a trust as vulnerable if their interests would not be adequately protected without that trust.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60502-13_para8">
<a name="stpa_88">That point becomes germane in the context of new clause 1 if we consider the number of trusts created at present to protect the interests of children in the event that a parent should remarry. That is a common situation, and it is merely one item on the exhaustive list given by my hon. Friend the Member for Chipping Barnet. As a result of the proposal, many older testators may begin to favour outright gifts to their surviving spouse, rather than risk settling assets on trust, which may fall foul of the spousal exemption and be liable to inheritance tax. Such outright gifts do not allow any measure of flexibility. Furthermore, they do not allow testators to be sure that their children will be provided for if the surviving spouse should decide to favour the other&#039;s interests over theirs. Children in that position are undoubtedly vulnerable, so we must ensure that they are protected as before.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60502-13_para9">
<a name="stpa_89">Sadly, that state of affairs is not unforeseeable, and it is a nightmare scenario for anyone trying to provide responsibly for a family. Modern matrimonial arrangements are complex, but there should be no doubt about whether people with multiple families will continue to benefit from the existing spousal exemption. We would not want to be responsible for encouraging an epidemic of wicked stepmothers if the provisions encourage the use of outright gifts to the detriment of the prudent protection of children. New clause 1 clarifies interference with the taxation of trusts, which is invidious in principle and may prove unworkable in practice.

<a name="stpa_90">Trusts and their taxation are not a subject on which I profess expertise, yet I can readily understand the implication for the average prudent family of any interference with the spousal exemption. The objective of new clause 1 is to offer simple peace of mind to the many people who may be affected by the proposals. Even the legal profession is uncertain about the runaway scope of the changes, and I am more worried about the uncertainty than I am about mere outrage, although we have seen evidence of both. The Law Society, the Chartered Institute of Taxation, the Society of Trust and Estate Practitioners and many other professional bodies have pleaded for clarity. New clause 1 would achieve it by including in the Bill an assurance that surviving spouses will not be subject to inheritance tax if their affairs are structured to maintain flexibility and protection for others.

 I should like now to deal with the deficiencies of the regime, which I am afraid that the Paymaster missed out of her speech. The first has been mentioned&#151;the retrospective nature of the legislation. I intervened in that regard earlier but would like some definition of the numbers of people involved. It is difficult to secure accurate figures, but my understanding is that approximately 70 per cent. of people in this country die without making a will. Out of 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>2 May 2006 : Column 861</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>a population of 60 million, about 18 million make a will. The Law Society believes that about 15 million people have a will, so the legislation will affect all those who currently have an estate worth more than the inheritance tax threshold of &#163;285,000. It will affect all who anticipate that, during the balance of their lifetime, their estate might fall within the inheritance tax net and all who set up a trust within their will. I pointed out earlier that that applies to virtually everyone who has made a will in the last six or seven years and who has children or a previous wife. It will also affect anybody who wishes to leave assets to their children or to grandchildren under the age of 25. Trusts would arise by virtue of the age of the potential beneficiaries.

<a name="stpa_98">The estimate by the Society of Trust and Estate Practitioners is of the order of 1 million people. I have examined the basis for that calculation.

I am sure that other organisations are willing to offer a cheaper service, but the review charge calculated by the Society of Trust and Estate Practitioners is &#163;341 rather than &#163;347, so anyone who wants to take professional advice must incur a significant fee, which, because it is subject to VAT, will generate substantial revenue to the Chancellor. Some 1 million to 1.5 million such arrangements may need reviewing, which would generate roughly three times the revenue for the Treasury that the Paymaster General has indicated.

<a name="stpa_104">The retrospective nature of the legislation raises a more fundamental issue, which is the credibility of the UK as an appropriate place for people with assets to invest or to seek to conduct their business. For many years, it has been an important tenet of tax legislation that retrospective legislation is not encouraged. Because this provision has been introduced with no consultation whatsoever with the industry, it fundamentally undermines this country&#039;s long-established reputation for fairness in its taxation dealings. I urge the Paymaster General to consider whether it is worth putting at risk this country&#039;s reputation among the wealthy and, in particular, the wealthy from overseas who might want to live here and do business here, by leading such people to think that long-established provisions on tax can be changed without consultation at the drop of a hat on a retrospective basis.

<br>&nbsp;<br>people of our generation took out mortgages in 1984, we got mortgage interest relief at source, which was later phased out. Our expectation as purchasers was that we would get MIRAS for the 25-year life of the mortgage, but there was no contract with the Government to that effect. The Government changed the position, but the change was not retrospective, although it changed our expectations, and the same is true of this legislation.

<p><a name="st_84"><a name="60502-14_spnew12"><b> Mr. Dunne: </b> 
 I accept that this legislation includes a transitional period over the next two years, but I still argue that many trusts that have existed for decades&#151;centuries in some cases&#151;will be significantly penalised. <i>[Interruption.]</i> The hon. Member for Rhondda (Chris Bryant) is laughing at the notion that trusts have existed for centuries. I have received representations from the Historic Houses Association&#151;I am sure that other hon. Members have received such representations, too&#151;pointing out that one of the reasons why this country has such a strong built cultural heritage, unlike many continental countries where different forms of taxation have existed and trusts, in particular, have not been involved in tax planning, is that trusts have been able to protect assets from one generation to another. That is not, as the hon. Member for Rhondda may think, a tax avoidance measure, but a measure to preserve assets as a whole, so that they continue to be viable, economically efficient assets rather than being split up among a family.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60502-14_para8">
<a name="stpa_105">That takes me to my next point: what is the purpose of such trusts? There is a perception among Members on the Government Benches that they are set up purely to evade tax. As I illustrated with my own case, trusts are usually set up to protect assets from individuals who cannot be trusted, or for valid planning reasons, particularly in relation to the increasingly acute problems arising from multiple families as society, sadly, evolves into individuals having more and more multiple families during their lifetime. If the Bill goes through, it will fetter the choices of spouses who are in a position to do so to allocate assets to provide maintenance for children, especially in the case of a second family where there are also children from the first family. I do not think that that is Government&#039;s intention. I assume that they have not thought this through, and I urge them to do so.

Let me refer to a couple of quotes. On 12 April, the <i>Daily Mail,</i> that well-known Labour paper, reported:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_20">&quot;A trust allows you to pass money to your heirs while protecting it from tax and keeping control over how the money is used . . . Why set up one? First and foremost, to ensure your heirs receive the maximum amount of money free from inheritance tax.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="60502-15_para3">
<a name="stpa_110">If that is not sufficient, let us consider <i>The Sunday Telegraph</i> of 16 April.

<p><a name="st_95"><a name="60502-15_spnew9"><b> Mrs. Villiers: </b> 
 Does the Paymaster General prefer the view of the <i>Daily Mail</i> or that of the Law Society, the Chartered Institute of Taxation, the Society of Trust and Estate Practitioners, the Low Incomes Tax Reform Group, the Law Society of Scotland, the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Scotland, the Association of Chartered Certified Accountants and the Association of Private Client Investment Managers and Stockbrokers, which say that the trusts under attack from the proposals have nothing to do with tax and everything to do with providing responsibly for one&#039;s family?

 I find it best to answer one question at a time, and I shall come to those organisations and the hon. Lady&#039;s opening remarks shortly. To suggest that the way in which the Government prevent the trusts from being misused somehow damages women&#039;s rights is breathtaking, and I shall deal with that shortly.

<a name="stpa_111">The hon. Member for Ludlow need only read <i>The Sunday Telegraph</i> of 16 April or <i>The Sunday Times</i> of 23 April, which make it clear that those trusts were being used to avoid inheritance tax by retaining control. The hon. Member for Chipping Barnet (Mrs. Villiers) mentioned transfer to the spouse. What could be more damaging to a spouse than to be told that a trust had been created that transferred the interest to her, only for her to find that she had no access to the capital and that, in three months, her interest was terminated and had passed on to somebody else, when she had been used as the shield to establish the trust, with the very purpose of avoiding inheritance tax? Even to suggest that using spouse relief in that way strikes a blow for women&#039;s independence is rather odd.

<p><a name="st_97"><a name="60502-15_spnew11"><b> Julia Goldsworthy: </b>

<p><a name="st_102"><a name="60502-16_spnew0"><b> Dawn Primarolo: </b> 
 I answered that question on Second Reading. The point is that 18 is the age of majority. People can get married or serve their country at that age; they can do all the things that adults can do. People might want to write trusts in which the beneficiaries do not get control of the assets until they are 25, 35, 45 or even 52&#151;that seems a good age today&#151;but this is not about when the individuals get control of the assets, it is about when they come into tax. That is the point that is being made. The hon. Gentleman also knows that, with 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>2 May 2006 : Column 867</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>certain trusts, the beneficiary never materialises. The trusts go on in perpetuity. This relates to situations in which a spouse has the use of a property, for example, and on their death, the property transfers to the children of the first marriage. We need to discuss that matter further. We are not talking about when trusts end but when they never end, control remains and the beneficiary does not have access. That is the problem with which we are trying to deal.

 The Opposition new clauses would completely negate the Government&#039;s legislation, so everything scored in the Red Book would be lost. The right hon. Member for Wokingham understands&#151;I was going to say &quot;needs to appreciate&quot;, but that would be totally unfair, as I know that he does&#151;that tax law is about making sure that a situation holds now and does not continue, as well as making sure that no other person is encouraged, and that large numbers of people are not encouraged, to use tax avoidance in that way. Surely, if inheritance tax is raised under certain circumstances with those exemptions&#151;whether a gift and the seven-year rule or the spouse exemption on transfer&#151;the Committee should expect the regime to operate in such a way. There is always a consequence, and if a tax regime is used in a way that it should not be and left unchallenged, the problem will get greater and greater&#151;a point that hon. Members often make to me, saying, &quot;Why are you acting now? Why didn&#039;t you act last year? How do you work the balance?&quot; That is the clear answer to the right hon.

<a name="stpa_115">The right hon. Gentleman also spoke about retrospection, but I completely reject the idea that there is any retrospection. The Government have provided for a two-year transition.

Let us have some rational debate, and hear what the Opposition say about why their new clauses are better. When we discuss that in Standing Committee&#151;the Opposition chose to discuss it in Committee and not on the Floor of the House&#151;we can go through all those issues.

<p><a name="st_105"><a name="60502-16_spnew3"><b> Mrs. Villiers: </b> 
 The point about retrospectivity is that many trusts cannot be varied. One would have to go to court and spend a large amount of money on it, and even if a court hearing were to take place, not all courts will allow the trust to be varied. Therefore, the provisions are retrospective, because not everyone will be able to adapt the existing arrangements to comply with the new rules.

 If I can explain what the provision does, it might help in dealing with the misunderstandings. In respect of money put in trust during a person&#039;s lifetime, charges apply on assets over the IHT threshold&#151;currently &#163;285,000&#151;at 20 per cent. on entry. So assets over the value of the threshold get charged at 20 per cent. on entry, and 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>2 May 2006 : Column 870</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>at 6 per cent. every 10 years after that. The only exemption for trusts created during life is that applying to trusts for disabled people, an issue to which we will return.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60502-17_para0">
<a name="stpa_122">Where money is put into trust on a person&#039;s death, the IHT is due on the estate, as is normal, unless spouse relief or some other exemption applies. If a trust is then set up, it is exempt from charges if it is for a disabled person; if it is an accumulation and maintenance trust set up by a partner for their bereaved child, who will take the assets outright at the age of 18; or if it is an interest in possession trust for the benefit of one person with outright ownership of the assets, passing to another person when the trust ends. That is a very straightforward arrangement and it is in line with existing trust arrangements.
</p>





<p><a name="st_122"><a name="60502-17_spnew2"><b> Mr. Gauke: </b> 
 Will the Paymaster General give way?
</p>





<p><a name="st_123"><a name="60502-17_spnew3"><b> Dawn Primarolo: </b> 
 Perhaps the hon. Gentleman will allow me to make at least some headway on the reasons why the new clauses and amendments, including his own, are unacceptable. Having done so, I will of course give way to him.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60502-17_para1">
<a name="stpa_123">All the new clauses and amendments before us are unnecessary, because what is asserted will happen will not, in fact. Ever since Budget day, when the Government announced that we planned to change the IHT rules for trusts, there has been enormous misunderstanding, which has continued today. Bearing that in mind, let me remind the Committee what spouse relief is about and what impact our proposals in clause 157 and schedule 20 will have on such relief.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60502-17_para2">
<a name="stpa_124">Spouse relief is an inheritance tax exemption on transfers from one spouse to another. So if property starts in the ownership of one spouse and ends up in the ownership&#151;I stress, ownership&#151;of the other, the situation is straightforward: the transfer is exempt from IHT. That means that the bequest rules apply if a gift from one spouse to another is made when both spouses are still living, so let us be clear: our proposals in clause 157 and schedule 20 have no relevance at all to such cases. For the vast majority of people with straightforward affairs, all that they need to know about the IHT proposals is that spouse relief exists and that a transfer can be made to their spouse. The potential overlap between spouse relief and our proposals only arises, therefore, in cases where partners want to use trusts on or after Budget day to make a less than straightforward gift or bequest.
</p>





<p><a name="st_124"><a name="60502-17_spnew4"><b> Mr. Gauke: </b> 
 Will the Paymaster General give way on that point?
</p>





<p><a name="st_125"><a name="60502-17_spnew5"><b> Dawn Primarolo: </b> 
 No; please let me make some progress on these points.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60502-17_para3">
<a name="stpa_125">Transferring assets into trusts is very different from making an outright gift; some people have tried to argue that they amount to the same thing, but they do not. The recipient of an outright gift can do with it as they please, with or without the consent of the person who made the gift&#151;they are the absolute owner. However, if a person places money in a trust, it must be used by the trustees in accordance with that person&#039;s wishes. It is the fact that control can continue long after the settlor&#039;s death that makes the difference.


<br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>

<p>
<a name="60502-17_para4">
<a name="stpa_126">Inheritance tax rules for interest in possession trusts have conferred the same exemptions that would apply if putting assets into trusts were identical to making an outright gift. The result has been that interest in possession trusts can be&#151;and regularly are&#151;used as a highly flexible money box and a long-term shelter from inheritance tax liabilities. That usually requires the settlor to get rid of assets in his lifetime but, where the spouse relief is available, it is possible for the settlor to hold on to his assets until death and completely wipe out any inheritance tax liability, in both the present and the future&#151;all without giving the surviving spouse or civil partner any influence whatsoever over the assets in their name.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60502-17_para5">
<a name="stpa_127">Of course, some cases are not avoidance driven, and a number of exemptions provide appropriate protection for the people involved. First, spouse relief will continue where an interest in possession trust is set up in a person&#039;s will to give a life interest to a bereaved spouse or civil partner provided that, when such interest ends, the assets are taken outright by someone else. No further flexible power is necessary in the trust, because it has delivered its objective.
</p>





<p><a name="st_126"><a name="60502-17_spnew6"><b> Mr. Gauke: </b> 
 Will the Paymaster General give way on that point?
</p>





<p><a name="st_127"><a name="60502-17_spnew7"><b> Dawn Primarolo: </b> 
 I want to make three points. Opposition Members continually claim that various eventualities will not be covered or that different outcomes will arise. When I tell them that they are wrong, they want to ask other questions. Let us deal first with what is on the table.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60502-17_para6">
<a name="stpa_128">Secondly, spouse relief will continue if a person dies without a will and their assets are passed to a bereaved spouse or civil partner, whether or not a trust is created under the intestacy rules. Thirdly, the rules will continue to provide for post-death changes where people die with an out-of-date will. If that will provides for a trust that would not qualify for spouse relief under our new rules, the interested parties will have the opportunity that they have always had to put things right. That is another answer to the question about retrospection.
</p>





<p><a name="st_128"><a name="60502-17_spnew8"><b> Mr. Gauke: </b> 
 I have two questions. First, will not the possibility of variation allow people to get around the tax avoidance that the Paymaster General mentioned earlier, and so make these provisions ineffective? Secondly, the right hon. Lady described the conditions under which an immediate post-death interest will apply and inheritance tax is not payable. Does she accept that, in the vast majority of cases, trusts contained in wills will not meet those conditions?
</p>





<p><a name="st_129"><a name="60502-17_spnew9"><b> Dawn Primarolo: </b> 
 I accept that people who transfer assets under the spouse exemption provisions do not need a trust to safeguard that exemption. I also accept that the gift provisions do not require a trust to be imposed between donor and recipient, and that assets should be transferred to a recipient when that is the donor&#039;s clear intention. Assets should not be held in a halfway house that means that the recipient does not get control and that the state does not get the inheritance tax to which it is entitled. Ending that possibility is precisely what the proposed changes are designed to achieve.


<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>2 May 2006 : Column 872</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>

<p>
<a name="60502-17_para7">
<a name="stpa_129">The new clause and the other amendments would once again make it possible for the wealthy few to use inheritance tax exemptions and rules to get reliefs beyond their entitlement. By the targeted use of changes to the particular types of trust being used in such cases, the Government propose to preserve the rules and make sure that they are used as they were always intended. For that reason, if the hon. Member for Chipping Barnet and her hon. Friends push the new clause to a vote, I shall ask my hon. Friends to oppose it and I look forward to debating the provision in detail in the Standing Committee.
</p>





<p><a name="st_130"><a name="60502-17_spnew10"><b> Mrs. Villiers: </b> 
 I shall review briefly some of the comments that have been made. We began with the hon. Member for Rhondda (Chris Bryant) who expressed with passion his support for inheritance tax and his criticism of the exemptions.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60502-17_para8">
<a name="stpa_130">We then heard from the hon. Member for Falmouth and Camborne (Julia Goldsworthy) who drew on a theme mentioned by many Opposition Members. She pointed out that the proposed changes could affect as many as a million wills and referred to the 4.5 million people who would probably have to review their life assurance policies. She also mentioned the problems in relation to people who have died since the Budget.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60502-17_para9">
<a name="stpa_131">My right hon. Friend the Member for Wokingham (Mr. Redwood) referred to the fact that many people of modest means will be affected by the proposed changes. He pointed out that they are retrospective. I agree with him wholeheartedly, especially because it may not be possible to vary existing trusts. They are affected by the provisions and the courts may refuse variations. It may also be difficult to vary wills, especially when the person who made the will has lost capacity. There will be retrospective effects.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60502-17_para10">
<a name="stpa_132">My hon. Friend the Member for South-West Hertfordshire (Mr. Gauke) said that the current rules generally deem trusts to be tax-neutral, so they are treated similarly to outright gifts. He pointed out that the Government&#039;s proposals would impose penalties on trusts that do not apply to outright gifts. He referred to the long history of the spouse exemption and to the practical difficulties of meeting the six exacting conditions of the draft proposals. Most tellingly, he drew attention to the suspicion that prejudice must be motivating the Government&#039;s approach to trusts and argued for a more targeted solution, rather than taking a sledgehammer to crack a nut.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60502-17_para11">
<a name="stpa_133">My hon. Friend the Member for Grantham and Stamford (Mr. Davies) said that it was important to improve the rationality of the proposals. He, too, pointed out that the Bill seems to attack trusts for no good reason. My hon. Friend the Member for Braintree (Mr. Newmark) noted that the provisions would hit the vulnerable. He sought clarity and emphasised the importance of retaining the spousal exemption to prevent double taxation of the single estate of a husband and wife.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60502-17_para12">
<a name="stpa_134">The hon. Member for Dundee, East (Stewart Hosie) talked about the impact of the proposals in Scotland, where thousands of people could be affected. He made the good point that the Government have not held proper consultations. My hon. Friend the Member for Ludlow (Mr. Dunne) emphasised the point about 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>2 May 2006 : Column 873</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>retrospectivity and said that the proposed changes would affect a wide range of people, giving instances of their impact on divorce.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60502-17_para13">
<a name="stpa_135">The proposals on spousal exemption will have a significant impact on a wide range of ordinary, hard-working people. If the Paymaster General is not prepared to take our word for that, she should take the word of the professional organisations to which I referred earlier. They say:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_21">&quot;The Government&#039;s proposed changes to inheritance tax on trusts amount to a tax on prudent families. They will affect millions of ordinary families and not, as the Government has suggested, only the super-rich.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="60502-17_para14">
<a name="stpa_136">Unless the proposals are amended, in line with our new clause and the many more amendments that we shall table in the Standing Committee, they could leave a million people having to redraft their wills, facing a legal bill of about &#163;275 million. The measure will hit the vulnerable, the young and the bereaved, so I intend to press the new clause to a Division.

<p><a name="st_133"><a name="60502-19_spnew0"><b> Dawn Primarolo: </b> 
 Prior to 6 April 2006, employers who made computer equipment available for private use by their employees could do so tax free, providing that the annual amount of the benefit in kind was &#163;500 or less&#151;that is the equivalent of &#163;2,500 of computer equipment, inclusive of VAT. The clause removes that tax exemption. With effect from 6 April 2006, a tax charge will arise on the benefit in kind that arises in those circumstances. However, the clause does not change the position when an employer provides the use of computer equipment solely for work purposes and private use by the employee is not significant.

<p>
<a name="60502-19_para0">
<a name="stpa_139">The question that everybody has been asking is: why are the Government doing this? It is perfectly true that many employees have benefited from the tax exemption, but the home computer initiative has been used extensively by groups that we would not generally expect to have difficulty accessing information technology. For example, 25 per cent. of those participating in the home computer initiative are higher rate taxpayers&#151;more than twice the proportion among taxpayers as a whole. Furthermore, nearly one third of HCI participants are from white-collar industries&#151;often defined as industries with a greater proportion of higher-than-average earners.
</p>





<p><a name="st_134"><a name="60502-19_spnew1"><b> Peter Luff  (Mid-Worcestershire) (Con):</b> 
 What the Paymaster General is saying is news to the industry, which was not consulted about the problems that the Treasury suddenly discovered at the eleventh hour, just as the ink was drying on the Budget. On the specific point that she just raised, would she say the same thing to the 15,000 nurses who have benefited from the HCI scheme or the 21,000 Tesco employees, who are probably not at the top end of the earning schedule? The evidence was that that level of employee was benefiting more and more from the scheme.
</p>





<p><a name="st_135"><a name="60502-19_spnew2"><b> Dawn Primarolo: </b> 
 The information comes from the industry. The hon. Gentleman interrupted me rather early on in my remarks. I was certainly not saying that nobody had benefited from the HCI scheme. The case that the Government are putting is that the benefits have slowed down to a point at which the growth is very small. In particular, it is not targeted on the remaining groups that we need to assist&#151;those on low pay. I was just about to turn to that point.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60502-19_para1">
<a name="stpa_140">Last month, the Low Pay Commission published the findings of its review of benefits in kind, salary sacrifice schemes and the accommodation offset. It found that take-up rates were often quite low and many part-time low-paid workers would gain no advantage from salary sacrifice schemes for home computers and other benefits in kind. Her Majesty&#039;s Revenue and Customs has evidence that, unfortunately, the tax exemption was being used beyond the scope of its original intention.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60502-19_para2">
<a name="stpa_141">On the one hand, the initiative has reached a number of people and has increased usage. On the other hand, however, it is not targeted particularly at the low paid and its effectiveness has been slowing down, and, in addition, it is being used beyond its original intention. For example, the HCI packages included items such as game consoles and MP3 players and allowed employees to buy equipment out of their gross pay, rather than borrow it. Furthermore, the cost of computer equipment has fallen markedly since 1999 when&#151;

 I wonder whether the hon. Gentleman will let me make some progress. I, too, have read the brief from the industry that he has and that has been circulated. If he listens to all my remarks and then contributes to the debate, I will be happy to return to any outstanding matters.

<a name="60502-19_para3">
<a name="stpa_142">The cost of computer equipment has fallen markedly since 1999 when the exemption was introduced. Figures produced by the Office for National Statistics show that an equivalent computer that cost &#163;2,500 in 1999 would have cost under &#163;700 in 2005. The Government have therefore concluded that the time has come to remove the exemption and to focus Government support in a better way to improve access to technology for groups with the poorest existing access, such as the unemployed, the elderly and the low paid.

</p>





<p><a name="st_140"><a name="60502-19_spnew7"><b> Peter Luff: </b> 
 This is a debate in which it would be good to have answers to questions. I asked the right hon. Lady&#039;s Department questions a month ago, but I have not had answers, so I have to ask those questions now, in this format&#151;otherwise I might have been able to accelerate her speech. Will she please do the Committee the courtesy of producing the evidence that she has about the so-called abuse of the scheme? It does not exist. The industry specifically asked for MP3 players not to be included in the scope of the scheme, but the Treasury insisted that they should be. The industry would be happy to see them excluded. The other equipment to which she referred was not being offered under the terms of the scheme; it was being offered as part of marketing brochures alongside it. The full price was paid. If she has that evidence, please will she produce it? It is important that we see it.

<p><a name="st_141"><a name="60502-19_spnew8"><b> Dawn Primarolo: </b> 
 I am happy to produce that evidence. Indeed, I am happy to produce it to the hon. Gentleman for the company in his constituency for which he has been making the case. The evidence comes from its marketing websites. I think that he will be somewhat shocked when he sees the extent to which packages were being put together involving items that were not supposed to be included in the HCI. That is in addition to the difficulty with take-up. I cannot say that I will put the information in the post to him tonight, but I will certainly do so tomorrow morning and he can look at the evidence. Alternatively, I can give him the website addresses and he can look at them himself&#151;he does not have to take my word for it.

<p><a name="st_142"><a name="60502-19_spnew9"><b> Mr. Mark Francois  (Rayleigh) (Con):</b> 
 The evidence of one or two websites is not enough to damn a whole scheme. If the Government have such compelling evidence of abuse, will the Paymaster General explain why so little hard evidence was produced in the regulatory impact assessment that they rushed out last week?

</p>

<p>
<a name="60502-19_para4">
<a name="stpa_143">Following the publication of the digital strategy in April 2005, the Government have continued to acquire an evidence base to enable them to consider focusing their support. In November 2005, the Government published their &quot;Inclusion through Innovation&quot; report. It examined where information and communication technology might deliver the most benefit to excluded groups and considered how that might be achieved. The report found that barriers to using ICT included a lack of relevant content, poor awareness of where to access ICT and a lack of preliminary skills, such as literacy or English language skills. The report also noted that digital inclusion does not mean simply

<a name="60502-19_para5">
<a name="stpa_144">Community ICT access and intermediaries all form part of a multi-channelled approach that will deliver for the targeted groups. The Government are making the case that it is necessary to use those resources to target the groups in greatest need and in which take-up is lowest.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60502-19_para6">
<a name="stpa_145">To ensure the best use of ICT in tackling this type of social exclusion, I am announcing today that the Government are setting up a dedicated digital inclusion team&#151;[Hon. Members: &quot;Oh.&quot;] The industry does not mind being represented on the team, so it does not think that the team is to be ridiculed. The team will champion examples of excellence in using highly effective and efficient ICT to tackle the key drivers of exclusion. It will also promote local and national leadership and understanding of the considerable potential of ICT to make a significant improvement to the life chances of excluded people and areas.

<p>
<a name="60502-19_para7">
<a name="stpa_146">Furthermore, I can today announce that we are changing the aims and objectives of the digital strategy to focus on digital inclusion, which reflects the shift in the Government&#039;s focus towards a more targeted approach. The strategy is a genuinely cross-government programme that recognises that only concerted action across Government Departments will realise our objectives. As I have said, access to ICT is about more than access to computers. Other technologies, such as digital television, give disadvantaged groups the opportunity to engage with ICT. The UK has a world-leading position in digital television, with more than 70 per cent. of households now accessing that technology.

<a name="stpa_147">The Treasury will work collaboratively with industry as we look towards meeting the goals of the digital strategy. We will keep the focus on targeted interventions to help those with specific difficulties. We will build on the success of more than 6,000 UK online centres, more than half of which are located in the 2,000 most deprived wards in England, so that 95 per cent. of the population live within 5 km of such a centre.

The announcements make substantial inroads into achieving our objectives, but we will conduct a review in 2008 to explore whether further action is necessary to close any residual digital divide.

<a name="60502-19_para9">
<a name="stpa_148">I have written to representatives from industry to invite suggestions on the most effective way to focus our support on targeted groups.

<a name="stpa_149">I would like to provide the reassurance for which I know that some have already asked&#151;the hon. Member for Mid-Worcestershire (Peter Luff) has done so&#151;on computer equipment provided for business purposes. Clause 61 does not change the position for computer equipment provided solely for work purposes when any private use by the employee is not significant. We acknowledge employers&#039; concerns in this area and I    know that HMRC has been approached by representative groups to work through the issues. I have asked HMRC to work with those representative bodies to ensure that clear practical guidance is produced to help to keep employers&#039; compliance costs to a minimum.

<a name="60502-19_para11">
<a name="stpa_150">The Government&#039;s policies of liberalisation and competition have led to the strong take-up and use of ICT. The creation of new and innovative services and falling prices have all contributed to that. The HCI has played its part in the strong take-up, but it is not appropriate for the Government to keep the scheme going beyond its useful lifespan. The announcements that I have made today will ensure that all can benefit from technology in a cost-effective manner. I commend the clause to the Committee.

<p><a name="st_146"><a name="60502-20_spnew0"><b> Mr. Francois: </b> 
 I want clause 61 to be deleted from the Bill for the chief purpose of saving the popular home computing initiative from abolition by the Government. As we are asking the Government to relent, even at the eleventh hour, I will begin by wishing the Paymaster General a happy birthday. I congratulate her on reaching the age of 29&#151;on a seasonally adjusted basis.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60502-20_para0">
<a name="stpa_151">The genesis of the home computing initiative was section 45 of the Finance Act 1999, which said that employers could provide computer equipment including
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_23">&quot;printers, scanners, modems, discs and other peripheral devices designed to be used by being connected to or inserted in a computer&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="60502-20_para1">
<a name="stpa_152">for the use of employees and their families at home without the employee incurring a benefit in kind for the purposes of income tax. The measure was designed to help to spread computer literacy among the population. In March 1999, the Chancellor himself proudly told the <i>Daily Record</i>:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_24">&quot;Britain can no longer afford to lag behind America. Inequality in computer learning today will mean inequality in earning power tomorrow&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="60502-20_para2">
<a name="stpa_153">Between 1999 and 2003, however, relatively few companies took advantage of the tax exemption, largely because it was not widely known or appreciated. In 2003, a working group was formed under the office of the e-envoy to examine how a specific scheme to loan computers to employees, including for private use, 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>2 May 2006 : Column 881</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>might be implemented. Partly as a result of that, the Income Tax (Earning and Pensions) Act 2003 included, in section 320, additional tax incentives specifically to encourage companies to loan computer equipment to their employees up to a maximum tax-free value of &#163;500 a year. It is that section of the ITEPA 2003 that clause 61 would delete. That would have the consequence of effectively sounding the death knell of the scheme, which is why I am asking the Committee to reject the measure.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60502-20_para3">
<a name="stpa_154">The home computing initiative, as we have come to understand it, was effectively launched in January 2004 by the Department of Trade and Industry, which, by that time, had taken on board departmental sponsorship of the project. The DTI published specific guidelines for employers and employees on the home computing initiative, thus effectively popularising the scheme. The DTI press release at the time, which contained supporting endorsements from Sir Digby Jones of the CBI and Brendan Barber of the TUC, promoted the scheme in the following terms:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_25">&quot;For employers HCI schemes are about maximising potential in the work place. Basic computer and technology skills are now regarded as essential for the majority of jobs. With home computer access IT confident employees have greater capacity to contribute to an organisation&#039;s overall performance and adapt more easily to new roles and opportunities. HCI schemes can also generate employer National Insurance savings.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="60502-20_para4">
<a name="stpa_155">In practice, the scheme has usually been financed by so-called salary sacrifice, in which employees accept a small decrease in pay in return for being loaned computer equipment by their employer. The employer in turn benefits by paying a reduced rate of national insurance contributions to the Treasury.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60502-20_para5">
<a name="stpa_156">We believe that it is ultimately for financial reasons that the Treasury wishes to abandon the scheme. That was effectively confirmed by the Prime Minister last Wednesday when, in reply to a question asked by my hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Worcestershire (Peter Luff), the Chairman of the Trade and Industry Committee, he said:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_26">&quot;we have to ensure that in any such initiative we obviously balance the revenue that is coming in with the support that is being given.&quot;&#151;[<i>Official Report</i>, 26 April 2006; Vol. 445, c. 570.]</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="60502-20_para6">
<a name="stpa_157">The decision is thus ultimately financial, as I shall go on to emphasise.

<p><a name="st_147"><a name="60502-20_spnew1"><b> Mr. Michael Wills  (North Swindon) (Lab):</b> 
 As far as I understand the case that the hon. Gentleman makes, he seems to agree with the objectives of the initiative. I am sure that he would agree that in such a fast-moving world, it is important to keep reassessing the effectiveness of initiatives. If the digital inclusion team that my right hon. Friend the Paymaster General announced came up with a scheme that would better meet Labour Members&#039; objectives, which I understand he shares, would he support that, or is the home computing initiative the only possible scheme that he can imagine supporting?

<br>&nbsp;<br>current scheme. I shall outline, as I have said, how we believe that the scheme could be modified both to save money for the Treasury and to improve its operation. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will be patient.

<p><a name="st_149"><a name="60502-20_spnew3"><b> Peter Luff </b> 
: Does my hon. Friend agree that there are two separate points, the first of which is how best to achieve the objectives that are shared across the House? It is difficult to disagree with a word about the objectives in what the Paymaster General said. Secondly, there is the issue of how we move from the one scheme to the other. Would it not have been much better if the Government had signalled now that they want to change the method, if they do&#151;I do not think that they need to do so&#151;and give the industry a year to adjust to a new method, rather than writing a P45 directly from the office of the Chancellor of the Exchequer for the workers in the HCI industry?
</p>





<p><a name="st_150"><a name="60502-20_spnew4"><b> Mr. Francois: </b> 
 I agree with my hon. Friend. We are looking to the Government this evening for some indication, when the Paymaster General replies, that they intend to retain the scheme, even in a modified form. We are not saying that there can be no change. However, we want an indication from the Minister that if the Government believe that there is abuse, they will modify the scheme to respond to that while maintaining its inherently positive characteristics. I shall press the Paymaster General on exactly that point in a moment.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60502-20_para7">
<a name="stpa_158">The scheme has proved popular, with about half a million people taking advantage of it effectively to hire a computer from their employer to help to improve their IT skills as part of a modern knowledge-based economy. This is especially important when we are seeking to improve IT skills to allow the UK to continue to compete with economies such as China and India in the 21st century. According to a recent analysis carried out by Hewlett-Packard, China and India between them now produce more than 120,000 IT graduates each year. How are we to compete effectively with that if we are bringing in measures to reduce the spread of IT literacy among our population, which is what the proposed change threatens to do?
</p>

<p>
<a name="60502-20_para8">
<a name="stpa_159">A Cabinet Office press release was timed to coincide with the launch of the new initiative in January 2004. It highlighted survey findings that employees with a PC at home had better IT skills and were more familiar with the internet. The DTI guidelines on HCI were entitled, &quot;Maximising Potential in the Workplace&quot;. Along with advice on implementing the scheme, numerous references were made to skills. For example, in the CBI&#039;s booklet, Sir Digby Jones was quoted as follows:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_27">&quot;Of all the workforce skills required today, there&#039;s no question that basic IT literacy is one of the most important . . .

 I accept, with the hon. Gentleman&#039;s background in accounting, that some other measures have helped in that regard.

<a name="60502-20_para9">
<a name="stpa_160">In 2005, the Minister of Communities and Local Government, the right hon. Member for South Shields (Mr. Miliband), told his regional press the following about the scheme:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_28">&quot;As technology and IT-based business becomes an even bigger part of our regional economy, it is vital that the workforce develops the skills that will keep us competitive. That process should begin in the home so that everyone has the opportunity to become comfortable and competent with computers. That is why the Government is offering tax breaks which reduce the cost of computers to employees while saving money for their employers.&quot;</p>

<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_29">&quot;Experience has shown that when a business implements an HCI scheme, demand for learning services and training rises significantly.&quot;</p>

<a name="stpa_162">In short, the HCI scheme has been hailed as an important part of the drive to improve the nation&#039;s IT skills, by the Government, in the form of the DTI, and the umbrella bodies of both British industry and the trade union movement combined.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60502-20_para12">
<a name="stpa_163">The scheme has enabled almost half a million people to obtain a computer through HCI. Equipment is not only more affordable, but it usually comes with added peace of mind because of features such as warranty cover for the length of the hire agreement and technical support. So, for many who would not ordinarily have had a PC at home, whether because of lack of access to credit, affordability or simple technophobia, HCI has provided a low-risk, cut-price option which allows them to access the world of information technology, to the benefit of themselves, their families, their employer and, ultimately, the wider economy as a whole.

<a name="stpa_164">The Government have sought to argue that they are looking for a scheme that is of more benefit to retired people and jobseekers.

 I get confused these days about what the Conservative party is. Is the hon.

Are we now getting a call from the Conservative Benches in support of the initiatives that have been introduced by the Government that have helped many workers in workplaces in my region, but which they opposed last year?

 I can tell the hon. Gentleman that the trade union movement, from the general secretary of the TUC downwards, are opposed to the abolition of the scheme, not least because at a local level many trade union officials have put a lot of work into persuading employers to adopt it. The hon. Gentleman must understand, irrespective of the learning fund, that the scheme is one that the trade union movement wants the Government to retain. I have a few quotes to drum that point home in case the hon. Gentleman did not get it the first time around.

<p>
<a name="60502-21_para0">
<a name="stpa_165">Scrapping a scheme that was already working for those in employment will not solve the Government&#039;s problem in respect of others. According to the HCI Alliance, 60 per cent. of the scheme&#039;s participants are in blue-collar industries and 75 per cent. of them pay the standard rate of tax, or lower. Moreover, as Intel, the computer supplier, argued in a recent letter to me:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_30">&quot;As this scheme is run through the employer even the most financially excluded are able to join. The fact that blue collar workers in the future will be denied such an incentive is genuine cause for concern.

: I thank my hon. Friend for giving way after being so generous in giving way earlier, unlike the Paymaster General. It was clear that the right hon.

It seems to me that if there is a better way of approaching the provision of information technology to workers at home, surely that better approach should be described and implemented before the existing scheme is removed. It seems that we are in a bizarre situation when a scheme is being removed that has clearly been successful, but there is nothing to replace it.

<p><a name="st_158"><a name="60502-21_spnew5"><b> Mr. Francois: </b>

<a name="60502-21_para3">
<a name="stpa_168">Let no one argue that the home computing initiative does not benefit people on modest incomes. The Trades Union Congress, companies such as Intel and others have clearly demonstrated that it does. As for the take-up of the scheme, it has taken off in the past year or so and has proved particularly popular in the national health service, with more than 100 trusts and hospitals across the country promoting the scheme to their work forces, including King&#039;s College hospital, the Norfolk, Suffolk and Cambridgeshire strategic health authority, the West Midlands ambulance service and even the Sedgefield primary care trust&#151;I hope that that is not the reason why the Chancellor wants to get rid of it. A number of charities have adopted the scheme, including St. John Ambulance, the Institute of Cancer Research, the Royal London Society for the Blind and the Motivation charitable trust, which works with people with a mobility disability and is based in Bristol, not far from the constituency of the Paymaster General.

In total, according to the HCI Alliance, more than 1,000 public and private sector organisations have adopted the HCI scheme to date, often with local trade union support, to help to improve their employees&#039; IT skills.

 If the Paymaster General had done me the courtesy of listening, she would know that I explained that between 1999 and 2003 the scheme was relatively unpopular, so the Department of Trade and Industry effectively rebooted and relaunched it in 2004, with clearer and better publicised guidelines. The scheme has now begun to take off, and 0.5 million users around the country are dependent on the scheme. It is rather worrying that the Paymaster General&#151;a Treasury Minister&#151;will not listen to basic statistics.

 What I have heard from the Paymaster General confirms my worst suspicions.

 As I shall argue, the ultimate reason for the scrapping of the scheme by the Government is its cost. My hon.

If take-up is not good, why does the Treasury expect it to cost more? The Paymaster General must dig herself out of that hole.

<a name="stpa_170">The initial decision to scrap the home computing initiative, once it was discovered hidden in the Budget of 22 March, was greeted with incredulity, not least by the HCI Alliance, which only a few days before had discussed with the Treasury ways in which it could be updated. Moreover, it is evident that the Brownite Treasury hardly bothered to tell the Blairite DTI&#151;the scheme&#039;s sponsoring Department. Even on Budget day, the DTI promoted the scheme on its website:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_32">&quot;The real beauty of HCI schemes is that they have the potential to improve performance in almost every area of the organisation.

<p>
<a name="60502-21_para6">
<a name="stpa_171">Even more embarrassingly for the Government, the DTI was in the process of rolling out an HCI scheme for its own staff, as was the Department for Work and Pensions, which has far more staff than the DTI. In addition, the CBI, which actively advocated the scheme for two years at the Government&#039;s behest, reacted to the change with consternation. On 30 March, Sir Digby Jones commented:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_33">&quot;This flies in the face of everything the country is trying to achieve on skills.

 I thank the hon. Gentleman for giving way before I was tempted to intervene on him. He is trying to play games with the statistics. He said that the scheme had only a 4 per cent. take-up, but that is nonsense. I have already provided one example of an organisation that saw take-up of 16 per cent. and it has been at that level or higher for a number of organisations. The take-up among employers pushing the scheme has been very healthy and I have already argued that the scheme was about to take off with other    organisations&#151;<i>[Interruption.]</i> I have to ask Government Members who are intervening from sedentary positions why, if the scheme was so bad, both the Department of Trade and Industry and the Department for Work and Pensions were about to roll it

<a name="stpa_184">Perhaps the greatest problem in the whole sorry saga is the effect on individuals who have benefited from the scheme. I have already explained how even their benefit will be time-limited. In order to understand how they will be affected, I cite the example of one HCI provider, the company Futuremedia, which established a website to allow subscribers to provide feedback on the scheme. Here are some examples from respondents outlining the benefits that they believe the scheme confers. I have taken four representative examples. One respondent said:

<a name="stpa_188">Those are just a few of the numerous examples of how HCI was benefiting people in exactly the way intended, allowing them to gain both IT skills and the chance to learn about other subjects online and giving access to a PC to those who could probably not otherwise afford it. All that could be lost if we do not delete clause 61.

<p>
<a name="60502-23_para5">
<a name="stpa_189">For all those reasons, we believe that the scheme needs to be retained not only for the UK IT industry, which could quite conceivably be harmed by the clause, or the 2,000 or so whose jobs could be lost, but for the many employees in the country who would have taken advantage of HCI in the future to help maintain Britain&#039;s competitiveness.

 The Paymaster General is muttering from a sedentary position something about it being for work. My hon.

A DTI document published in January 2004 lists among the benefits for employees&#039; education for their children, entertainment, e-mail and purchasing goods and services; it was clearly intended for home use.

On Second Reading the Paymaster General appeared to have no other defence of the Chancellor&#039;s ill thought-out decision than to make noises about iPods from a sedentary position. It is true that a loophole existed. A number of products that are entertainment rather than educational, and so are not exactly in the spirit of the scheme, such as MP3 players, game consoles and digital cameras, were ordered in some cases and qualified for the tax exemption because the HCI guidelines from 2004 gave only broad definitions.

<p>
<a name="60502-23_para11">
<a name="stpa_195">There is a precedent. In Sweden, the Government have for some time operated a scheme similar to the HCI. There were similar concerns there about people seeking to exploit the tax advantages to purchase equipment outside the original spirit of spreading IT skills. However, in 2004, instead of scrapping the scheme, the Swedish Government found a workable solution, by tightening up the rules on qualifying equipment.

<a name="stpa_196">For example, the rules stipulated that in future only one personal computer would be allowed per employee; some had attempted to order more than one.

 I am extremely grateful to the hon. Gentleman for finally giving way. He has moved on from the point on which I wanted to ask him to clarify his intentions. However, I will take advantage of his generosity and ask him to be a little more specific about how he intends to define the scope of the reformed HCI, as he would regard it. Does he accept that the technology is moving so fast that it is difficult to draw the parameters? When the scheme was originally defined, it was appropriate for the technology. He acknowledges that abuses take place, although there is some disagreement about the extent. Those have come about partly as a result of changes in technology that were not conceivable. Although he has tried to provide a constructive alternative, two or three years down the line the technologies may well have moved on again. Is it not right to try and address abuse in the light of the rapid changes in technology?
</p>





<p><a name="st_201"><a name="60502-24_spnew5"><b> Mr. Francois: </b> 
 I thank the hon. Gentleman for conceding that we have tried to be constructive about the matter. I welcome the fact that as a former Minister in the Department of Trade and Industry, he has put that on the record. Those canny Swedes thought of that possibility, too. They realised that as technology moved on, particularly in such areas, the list would need to be reviewed regularly to make sure that the definitions remained current. It should be perfectly possible for us to do that too. We come up with an inclusive list and an exclusive list and we review them periodically&#151;say, once a year&#151;to make sure that the definitions remain current. That seems, to coin a phrase, not to be beyond the wit of man, or indeed woman.

<a name="stpa_206">To summarise, the HCI scheme has been important in spreading computer literacy among our population, including the lower paid, in order to help our country compete in the 21st century. As such, the scheme should be retained and not effectively wound up, as the Government propose. It should be possible to devise a revised version of the home computer initiative that allows the scheme to survive for its intended purpose, while introducing safeguards to combat the alleged fraud. If the Scandinavians are able to do that, I see no reason why we could not do it as well. The situation is a good example of the old maxim, &quot;Where there&#039;s a will, there&#039;s a way&quot;.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60502-24_para9">
<a name="stpa_207">The key question is whether there is a will on the part of the Government to save the scheme, or whether the Chancellor is so desperate for the &#163;300 million in revenue which the Treasury&#039;s Red Book estimates would be raised by scrapping the HCI scheme from 2006&#150;07 to 2008&#150;09. Will avarice take over, and will the scheme be cancelled regardless of its obvious merits? Option 2 in the Treasury&#039;s regulatory impact assessment would allow the scheme to survive on a honed-down basis.

For example, the educational maintenance allowance was piloted in my constituency, and, although I cannot prove it, I posit as cause and effect the fact that staying on rates at 16 greatly increased. That measure involved investing a lot of money in a long-term process of upskilling our economy, which is the context in which we need to understand the HCI.

It is surprising that the hon.

The further education White Paper was produced at the beginning of March, and adult learning grants allow people to upskill to level 2 and under-25s to upskill to level 3.

In round terms, higher-rate taxpayers make up about 10 per cent. of taxpayers, but they made up 25 per cent. of those who benefited from the scheme. That is not to say that we should abolish the scheme just because higher-rate taxpayers benefited disproportionately, but it is worth bearing that point in mind against the backdrop of where the Government want to go on skills provision. We must consider the HCI in that context.

 I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman, who is a colleague on the Trade and Industry Committee. On the abolition of the scheme, I would not be so angry if a year&#039;s notice had been given on the intention to ban the scheme, which would have been the right way to proceed. The Paymaster General must address why the change is so sudden, because the matter could have been handled much more elegantly and effectively and with less serious consequences for the employees who risk losing their jobs.

 I am sure that the Paymaster General will address that issue later, if she catches your eye, Mrs. Heal. I believe that the hon. Gentleman has a constituency interest in the matter, for which he is rightly fighting. In terms of the economy as a whole, however, we must consider whether, for example, fewer computers will be purchased because of the abolition of the initiative. I do not know the answer to that, but I suspect that many fewer computers will be bought. While, sadly, there may be the P45s to which the hon. Gentleman referred in his constituency, in terms of the economy as a whole more people may be employed in outlets such as Dixon&#039;s, which is going to call itself Curry&#039;s, or wherever, selling computers to people direct instead of their being refracted through their employers. I do not know the research on that, and I do not know whether the Treasury does.

<a name="stpa_218">The hon. Member for Rayleigh mentioned what was said in <i>The Times,</i> and probably in other newspapers, about the idea, which I am sure that the Government do not have, of taxing personal e-mails. I would draw an analogy with company cars. I am sure that the House has spent a lot of time over the years discussing the taxation of company cars. The matter has come to rest in the past few years because, as a House and as a society, we have reached a modus vivendi and a balance as to how much company cars should be taxed. In most cases, company cars are used for business purposes as well as domestically. A car is an expensive piece of kit. Why have a car that one uses at work, and that one then has to park at work, or, if one can prove that there is no secure parking at work, drive home and leave there? When one then went to the supermarket, one had to go in a different car that one had bought oneself. We all recognised that that was a bit silly.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60502-25_para2">
<a name="stpa_219">The taxation of part of the value of company cars is done on a fairly rough and ready basis. People do not go round saying, &quot;How many miles have you driven?&quot; There used to be banding. I think that there still is&#151;I do not have a company car any more&#151;but they are pretty broad bands. One does not have to clock every mile as regards whether it is business and personal. There is a contradistinction between the cost of enforcing something and simply getting in some tax while not spending too much on enforcement.

Otherwise, we could go on and on, ad infinitum, with the taxpayer subsidising computers at home for people&#039;s private use, which was a measure to kick-start IT literacy and competency in 1999.

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_53">&quot;There is also evidence to suggest that the exemption has been applied beyond the scope of its original intention.

</p>

<p>
<a name="60502-25_para9">
<a name="stpa_226">The first problem is that of the definition of a computer, which in the original regulation is defined as &quot;computer and peripheral equipment&quot;. There is a precedent in terms of how that has been resolved in other countries. Sweden tightened up its definitions of &quot;eligible equipment&quot; and &quot;ineligible equipment&quot;, and made it clear that only one computer per household would be eligible. It might be worth paying attention to another Scandinavian precedent&#151;that of Denmark, which cancelled the scheme but brought it back a year later. The Government might be forced to eat their words in future. There are ways of coming up with a series of workable definitions that continue to bring benefits to employees and their families. It should not merely be a case of robbing Peter to pay Paul in order to improve inclusion in other deprived groups.

<br>&nbsp;<br>through the scheme, so that if a claim fell outside the terms of the scheme, it would not qualify for the exemption. If the Government were able to provide evidence of such abuse, that would help clarify the situation. Certainly, the HCI Alliance has no evidence that it was being abused in that way or beyond the definitions of the regulation.

<a name="60502-25_para11">
<a name="stpa_228">Withdrawal of the scheme will create a massive compliance problem for employees and employers. The regulatory impact assessment is very helpful. It explains that if the exemption is removed, all employees are technically required to log the time that they spend at home on their work computer using it for leisure purposes, such as checking e-mails or playing computer games, because it will be taxable. The removal of the scheme will create further confusion, not remove it.

 How does the hon. Lady understand the following example? If an employee has a computer for business use and learns to use a new computer package or software development tool that is not directly related to the work that they do but is in line with what the company does, does that count as personal or business use?

 I can help the hon. Lady on this point. It may be confused in her mind, but it is not confused in employers&#039; minds. The interpretation of what is significant use was in operation before 1999, when the exemption came in, and employers managed to operate it perfectly well. I have said to the Committee that I am happy to ensure that that is restated in that way. Employers have used it before and knew what it meant, and it will not be an intellectual challenge for them.

<a name="60502-26_para1">
<a name="stpa_233">On a smaller scale, I was contacted by a business called BizApp, which is based in Cheltenham and was expressly set up to help smaller businesses access the scheme. It now faces the loss of six jobs. It established its business because it identified precisely the same problem about which the Government are now talking: it is difficult for smaller businesses to access the scheme. It found a solution, by automating the process and providing the three-year warranty and support package that so many people found attractive and that small businesses could manage to administer. It wrote:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_56">&quot;We became involved in HCI in 2004 and realised very quickly it was impossible for the industry to bring HCI to the Small to Medium Business Sector because the process was still too complex . . .

<a name="stpa_235">It is disturbing that the Government have taken so long to provide any indication of the mechanisms on which they will focus their resources. It is interesting that option 2 was rejected because it did not help people from deprived backgrounds. Option 3 announces all the savings and gives no idea of how the Government would target support. That is important because many businesses have invested in and built up infrastructure to provide the HCI. They could use their expertise and investment to provide the scheme to people from more deprived backgrounds, yet all elements of certainty for their business have been taken away. That will have an impact on their confidence to invest in any future scheme and future Government proposals.

: I welcome today&#039;s announcement by the Government of the digital inclusion team. It is welcome not least because it focuses on the overriding objective of ensuring that all those who are potentially excluded from the benefits of access&#151;everyone who has spoken said that such access was essential&#151;to fast-changing new technologies remain the priority. The emphasis will be on them, not some specific scheme, which, I accept, was relevant when it was introduced and was, incidentally, opposed by Opposition parties at the time. We should focus on the ends, not the means. I therefore greatly welcome the digital inclusion team but I want to ask for reassurance about two matters.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60502-26_para4">
<a name="stpa_236">First, my right hon. Friend the Paymaster General spoke generally about those who are potentially excluded from the new technologies. I should be grateful for an assurance that one of the key focuses of the new digital inclusion team will be lower paid workers, especially those on the national minimum wage for whom access to new technologies could be crucial to help them upskill and move up the employment ladder, as my hon. Friend the Member for Wolverhampton, South-West (Rob Marris) rightly stressed.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60502-26_para5">
<a name="stpa_237">The second point is more technical. My right hon. Friend referred to digital television. Of course, that could be enormously important. We are about to move to a switchover from analogue to digital television and that will clearly be important in many different ways. However, I hope that she will reassure me that she will not ask the digital inclusion team to rely on digital television as the main passport to literacy in the new technologies. It is important to bear in mind that there will be a plethora of ways in which to access the new technologies and that the computer is likely to remain important for most people, if not everybody, in that regard. I should therefore be grateful for some reassurance on those points.

 I am not going to speculate on the tax policies drawn up by my Front-Bench colleagues. I do not have any knowledge whatever of them.

However, they did not, and they have abolished the scheme in the worst possible way. That is the problem. If only they had taken a bit more time and care over its abolition, we might not be having this debate tonight.

It was still encouraging its staff to take up the scheme even on the very day of the Budget. It came as a total surprise to the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry that it was to be abolished. That is a matter of public record.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60502-27_para12">
<a name="stpa_254">The most extraordinary quote of all comes from the Chancellor of the Exchequer in his 1999 Budget:

<a name="stpa_256">The reasons that the Paymaster General gave earlier for abolishing the scheme do not bear even the most cursory critical examination. The job has not been done. She made derisory comments about a 4 per cent. increase in the number of people taking up that initiative, but that is 1 million households by my reckoning. If we are to be internationally competitive, we have a long way to go to increase the penetration of computers in households.

<a name="stpa_257">I was particularly disturbed by the Paymaster General&#039;s comments on the abuse of the scheme. Of course, everything that we do is abused. The VAT system is abused, and I expect that many hon. Members would love to see it abolished, but I doubt that that   would be the response to its abuse. Instead, the response would be to close the loopholes and to police the system more effectively. That should have been the Government&#039;s response to abuse of the HCI scheme. If there was significant abuse&#151;which I genuinely doubt&#151;the response should have been to close the loopholes. Indeed, the industry is bursting with ideas on how to close every possible loophole.

<a name="60502-27_para16">
<a name="stpa_258">As I said earlier, I take particular exception to the Paymaster General&#039;s suggestion that Evesham Technology was abusing the scheme by marketing other products. Some of those products were specifically allowed under the scheme. Her Majesty&#039;s Revenue and Customs kept the terms vague because it said that it wanted to allow room for emerging technology. Actually, the industry would have liked the terms to be tighter, to avoid any possible abuse. Also, as good entrepreneurs, representatives of the industry offered other products outside the scheme at full market cost in 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>2 May 2006 : Column 906</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>their brochures. They were trying to sell more kit. That is a natural reaction for enterprise. HMRC made the fatal error&#151;a tragic misunderstanding that further undermines my confidence in it&#151;of thinking that those products were being offered as part of the scheme. They were not; they were add-ons that were not included in the scheme&#039;s terms. I accept that there is bound to be a modest amount of abuse, but I fear that the abuse that the Paymaster General has referred to will turn out either to have been very modest indeed or to have involved a complete misunderstanding of what was actually going on.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60502-27_para17">
<a name="stpa_259">I completely reject the idea that the scheme was not properly focused, because 375,000 lower-paid workers have already benefited from it. All the signs were that, as the scheme extended down into the small and medium-sized businesses, more and more lower-paid workers would benefit. It is no good the Paymaster General shaking her head in disbelief: that is what the evidence showed. It is quite clear that that was beginning to happen.

An advantage that the Government were trumpeting then is now suddenly a reason for abolishing the scheme.

<a name="stpa_264">We all know that the sole reason for the removal of the scheme is that the Chancellor wanted to save some money at the eleventh hour. That is the only explanation for the fact that the proposal was put in the Budget at the last minute, without any of his colleagues in Whitehall even knowing that it was being considered. That is what makes it so sad. Although I was interested to hear what the Paymaster General had to say in her opening speech, she sounded more like the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry than the Paymaster General. We need to know where responsibility for delivering the Government&#039;s digital strategy resides. I wrote to the Prime Minister, following an unsatisfactory exchange in Prime Minister&#039;s questions last week, to ask him whether that responsibility now lies with:

It was a last-minute decision, and I plead with the Paymaster General for it to be reconsidered. At least the scheme should be given an extra year for an orderly phase-down while satisfactory alternatives are put in place.

 I agree with the aspiration of the hon. Member for Rayleigh (Mr. Francois) for wide use of computers in homes across the country. Members on both side of the Committee would agree with that. Part of my constituency is in South Stanley, which is in the top 10 most deprived wards in the country and has one of the lowest uptakes of IT skills, and I doubt whether many of my constituents in that area have benefited from the HCI scheme.

<a name="stpa_268">My hon.

In my constituency, putting money into education is doing more to increase the use of computers and computer skills, and the Chancellor gave extra money to education in the last Budget. In every school that I visit, I see not only laptops being used by teachers but interactive whiteboards and young people using IT skills in a way that could only be imagined a few years ago.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60502-28_para1">
<a name="stpa_269">I referred earlier to the trade union movement, which, I understand, the Conservatives now support. I get confused about their position from day to day. One thing that has led to improved IT skills in many workplaces is the trade union learning fund, which has been consistently opposed by the Conservative party. I look forward to its support in future for that vital initiative, which has brought learning into many workplaces and reached some of the lowest-paid in society. In addition, Durham has a new further education college, with funding for IT from the Government. I reiterate that the Government have not just been tackling lack of IT skills and computer equipment in communities through the HCI scheme but through, as my hon. Friend the Member for Wolverhampton, South-West said, a mosaic of measures.

<a name="stpa_270">That is demonstrated by a good initiative in the South Stanley school of technology run by Janet Bridges, the head teacher. That initiative is not just about enabling students to pay for computers; it is giving computers to 300 children, and is paid for by the Government&#039;s neighbourhood renewal funding. In those communities, that is the only way in which some children would get direct access to computers at home. Rather than spawning a private industry, it has already allowed local people to create infrastructure and support. Although the HCI scheme has been successful in some parts, it will not reach the hard core of people in poor communities, such as those that I represent, who will not get access to computers without such funding. That is why I support funding being directed to those areas.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60502-28_para3">
<a name="stpa_271">I have heard some criticism of the way in which the scheme has been wound up, and the hon. Member for Mid-Worcestershire (Peter Luff) made his points well. I find it strange, however, that the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats are now arguing that this type of scheme, of which the late lamented J. K. Galbraith would have been proud, reflects a kind of Keynesian view that money should be put forward to support the computer industry, which, as we know, is a poor and dying sector of our economy. I am sorry, but that is not what it is meant to do. It is meant to direct resources to and ensure skills in some of the poorest communities. That more targeted approach, which the Government are adopting, will bear fruit. In my constituency, I will support that direct help to low-paid, elderly and unemployed people, who need access to computers and skills not just in the home but in village halls and libraries
</p>





<p><a name="st_229"><a name="60502-28_spnew1"><b> Peter Luff: </b> 
 The hon. Gentleman is making an important point&#151;of course we want lower-paid people to get access to information technology. To make maximum use of that, however, it must be in their homes. There is no point having open access schemes in public places where people will be reluctant to enter private and confidential data. In relation to the success of the Government&#039;s e-initiative, people will not fill out an income tax return online in a public place or do anything confidential where they cannot secure data, and families will not get the benefit. If low-paid people are to benefit most effectively, computers must be in their homes.
</p>





<p><a name="st_230"><a name="60502-28_spnew2"><b> Mr. Jones: </b> 
 I take the hon. Gentleman&#039;s point. Unfortunately, however, I, unlike the hon. Member for Falmouth and Camborne (Julia Goldsworthy) who referred to her elderly or low-paid constituent whose rich relative purchased a computer, do not have many constituents for whom that is the case. In schools, hardware is being given to kids because that is the only way that they will get access to computers in the home. I do not disagree with the hon. Gentleman&#039;s points, but he must recognise that many low-paid workers, unemployed and elderly people will not be able to purchase the equipment. I would be radical and say that in some cases we should give the equipment free to certain user groups, as it will end up certainly saving them money and also saving the Exchequer money in relation to the accessing of certain services. I would welcome support for that initiative from the Conservative Front Bench.

There is a delightful irony here, which I know many of my hon. Friends will appreciate: in the long litany of disasters that have come about because of Government investment in IT projects there is one notable success, and it is being cancelled. Perhaps the Government will consider applying some of the &#163;71 million compensation which has been paid as a result of the tax credits IT fiasco to the continuation of the HCI scheme.

<p><a name="st_232"><a name="60502-29_spnew0"><b> Mr. Gauke: </b> 
 I want to make four brief points about the proposal to abolish the HCI, which is perhaps symptomatic of the Government&#039;s approach to many forms of taxation.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60502-29_para0">
<a name="stpa_296">First, I want to echo the point made forcefully by my hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Worcestershire (Peter Luff), in what I thought was an excellent speech, about the uncertainty created by constant tinkering with 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>2 May 2006 : Column 912</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>taxation regimes. If incentives are introduced, expanded five years later and abolished two years after that, there will always be the difficulty of businesses not being confident that they are working in a stable environment. Such a situation can impact on research and development, for example; indeed, it has had a considerable impact on productivity. This Government, and particularly this Chancellor, have a tendency to meddle and to tinker, and this is an example.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60502-29_para1">
<a name="stpa_297">My next two points relate to the taxation of employees and employers in respect of home computers&#151;an issue raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Rayleigh (Mr. Francois)&#151;which are treated as a benefit in kind. One consequence of abolishing the HCI is that the question again arises of how home computers are treated. They will not be considered as a benefit in kind where their personal use is not significant, and guidance will be provided on this issue. However, businesses will obviously have to police such usage carefully. They will have to issue guidance themselves and monitor employees to ensure that computers are not used for personal purposes. However, most work computers are to some extent used for personal purposes. I suspect that most people occasionally use computers at work for personal matters and for sending personal e-mails&#151;that is what happens in the real world&#151;and the same applies to the use of home computers. Of course, people are supposed to use computers to complete their tax returns, but that, too, is personal use. So the clause will impose a significant bureaucratic burden on business, which is often another consequence of Government policies.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60502-29_para2">
<a name="stpa_298">As I said, the Government are going to introduce guidance, and I suspect that there will be a generous and fairly broad definition of what constitutes insignificant use. I am slightly worried, however, at the prospect of the law saying one thing and the guidance saying another&#151;it is saying that people need not worry. My fear is that, instead of having a tightly defined law that people should obey, we will have a loosely defined law that people will obey only sometimes, depending on the guidance. That would not be an ideal arrangement.
</p>





<p><a name="st_233"><a name="60502-29_spnew1"><b> Rob Marris: </b> 
 Surely it is up to a business to decide whether such use is significant. If it is, class 1 national insurance contributions would have to be paid. If it is not, it is a benefit in kind, on which tax is paid by the employee, not the employer.
</p>





<p><a name="st_234"><a name="60502-29_spnew2"><b> Mr. Gauke: </b> 
 The employer, when providing such a facility to their employees, will be expected to provide some advice. As the hon. Gentleman says, national insurance contributions would have to be paid, and the employer would need to take a view on that point. A degree of monitoring would be required.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60502-29_para3">
<a name="stpa_299">My fourth point relates to one that the hon. Member for Wolverhampton, South-West (Rob Marris) made with characteristic candour: the lack of consultation surrounding this proposal, which was rushed out without regard for the need to examine the various arguments. The Paymaster General says that there is concern about possible abuse, but why do we not look at this proposal closely and carefully? We have heard about how other countries deal with this issue&#151;how one can have an HCI scheme without its being abused. My hon. Friend the Member for Rayleigh and others 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>2 May 2006 : Column 913</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>referred to what I call the &quot;Minnie the Moocher&quot; argument: if the Paymaster General had looked at the scheme in Sweden, it would have given everything that she was needing. That did not happen, which was a great pity.
</p>





<p><a name="st_235"><a name="60502-29_spnew3"><b> Dawn Primarolo: </b> 
 Is the hon. Gentleman aware that the Swedish scheme has been recommended for abolition, and for exactly the same reasons as we have abolished the HCI here?
</p>





<p><a name="st_236"><a name="60502-29_spnew4"><b> Mr. Gauke: </b> 
 My understanding is that that scheme is in place. Indeed, we heard earlier that the Danish scheme was abolished and then brought back, because it was missed.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60502-29_para4">
<a name="stpa_300">We have to ask why the HCI is being abolished. I suspect that the Treasury was looking to save a few hundred million pounds, and that the HCI caught the eye of someone there. That is a great pity, but perhaps there is also another reason. The Chancellor has been associated with various polices, such as the individual learning account. He was criticised for being very slow in identifying fraud and misuse of the ILA, and he resisted getting rid of it. I wonder whether the question of not allowing the HCI to continue was a sensitive issue for the Treasury. None the less, the Government&#039;s scrapping of that scheme was a panicky overreaction. There should have been consultation and we should have addressed the real concerns, but that has not happened.

</p>





<p><a name="st_237"><a name="60502-29_spnew5"><b> Mr. Dunne: </b> 
 I am grateful to you, Mr. O&#039;Hara, for allowing me to contribute to this debate. This is a novel experience for me on two counts. This is the first time since joining this House that I have attended a debate in which the Government are insisting on scrapping a successful measure; in my experience, they usually seek to abandon failed initiatives that they have introduced during their tenure. To witness them abandoning a successful one is surprising, to say the least.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60502-29_para5">
<a name="stpa_301">I am pleased that the Paymaster General has an opportunity today to diffuse criticism of this penny-pinching, revenue-retaining measure by making a positive announcement on digital inclusion. In my experience, the Paymaster General is usually asked to defend the indefensible on the Chancellor&#039;s behalf, but today she is able to announce some good news. However, it is a classic new Labour move: on the one hand, we are debating a measure, the withdrawal of which will save the Treasury &#163;300 million over three years; on the other, Labour is sweetening the pill with a &#163;50 million new initiative, but it is merely a sleight of hand to try and distract attention from the bigger issue.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60502-29_para6">
<a name="stpa_302">Having said that, I welcome the digital inclusion initiative and I should like to comment briefly on it, given that the Paymaster General introduced it into this debate. I hope that the new cross-departmental unit will address the severe shortcomings of the digital TV footprint. It is claimed that digital TV will reach 98.5 per cent. of the population. Given that the Paymaster General has taken an interest in this subject, I will send to her and to whoever is responsible for running the new unit a map that the <i>Shropshire Star</i> helpfully provided. 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>2 May 2006 : Column 914</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>It shows the area along the Welsh marches that would be excluded from digital TV coverage. That area includes most of the western half of my constituency and all the area classified as an area of outstanding natural beauty, which amounts to about 80 per cent. of south Shropshire district. I look forward to hearing about the measures that this magnificent new unit will implement to provide coverage for my constituents.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60502-29_para7">
<a name="stpa_303">I want to speak to amendment No. 2 to clause 61. The home computing initiative has encouraged home-working, and before I illustrate this issue with some comments about my constituents, I want briefly to highlight some of the non-financial benefits that derive from home working of which the Paymaster General may not be aware. BT, one of the largest employers in the country, has undertaken research among its work force. It states:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_83">&quot;People working from home are 7 per cent. happier than their office-based colleagues&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="60502-29_para8">
<a name="stpa_304">So there is a happiness quotient to this issue. The research also noted that there is

<a name="stpa_305">among such people, on account of BT&#039;s home-working policy. These non-financial but none the less important factors are being put at risk by this penny-pinching Government measure. There are 8 million people working from home, who&#151;

<a name="stpa_307">Shropshire was the home of the first industrial revolution, and it is also the home of the current home working revolution.

<p><a name="st_244"><a name="60502-30_spnew1"><b> Dawn Primarolo: </b> 
 What is the relevance of those figures?
</p>





<p><a name="st_245"><a name="60502-30_spnew2"><b> Mr. Dunne: </b>

</p>





<p><a name="st_246"><a name="60502-30_spnew3"><b> Mr. Ivan Lewis: </b> 
 What is the relevance of the whole speech?
</p>





<p><a name="st_247"><a name="60502-30_spnew4"><b> Mr. Dunne: </b> 
 The relevance is that home working is put at risk by the Government&#039;s proposal to scrap the home computing initiative, which has meant that people, especially in rural areas, now have improved access to broadband, for example. It has also improved access to work for those people in deprived rural areas who lack public transport and job opportunities. Even people with their own transport have to travel a long way to work in such areas.
</p>





<p><a name="st_248"><a name="60502-30_spnew5"><b> Rob Marris: </b> 
 At the risk of detaining the House, will the hon. Gentleman say more about his statistics? Labour Members usually understand the term &quot;home working&quot; to mean the gross exploitation of labour, such as paying people piece rates to pack Christmas crackers at home. It is not taken to mean the wonderful world of telecommuting by computer.
</p>





<p><a name="st_249"><a name="60502-30_spnew6"><b> Mr. Dunne: </b> 
 I shall give the House a specific example of the sort of effective and high-tech home working that goes on in my constituency and across the country. A company called Premier Medical processes insurance policy claims, and about half of its staff work from home. The hon. Gentleman is a neighbour of mine and, if he is interested, I should be delighted to take him to meet the magnificent managers who have relocated the business to my area from the south-east.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60502-30_para1">
<a name="stpa_308">I hope that the Paymaster General will explain why the Government want to scrap an initiative that is working so well.

 It falls to me sum up this interesting and sometimes vigorous debate on the future of the home computing initiative and clause 61. A number of contributions were made and I am sorry that time constraints mean that I cannot refer to all of them individually, but I shall attempt at least to genuflect to some where I can.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60502-30_para2">
<a name="stpa_309">I welcome the Paymaster General&#039;s commitment that HMRC, in consultation with industry, will issue guidelines to define what constitutes a &quot;not significant&quot; use of a computer. We have pressed the Government on that quite hard over the past week. We tabled amendments on the subject, and I am pleased that the Government have listened to us and agreed to produce a definition. I hope that it will remove doubt, but I repeat that it would be better to delete clause 61 from the Bill, so that the problem would not arise in the first place.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60502-30_para3">
<a name="stpa_310">First, in her opening speech the Paymaster General did not provide a convincing rationale for abolishing the scheme. She talked vaguely about a few websites that provide examples of inappropriate equipment, but was unable to quantify that or to put clear figures on the extent of the abuse. If the Government&#039;s argument is 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>2 May 2006 : Column 916</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>based on the claim that abuse has been widespread, I should have expected the right hon. Lady to have been able to give firmer examples.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60502-30_para4">
<a name="stpa_311">Secondly, we have argued that the scheme could be saved by being more tightly defined. The abuse that the Government claim is going on could be prevented if they were to produce an inclusive list of the products that would continue to qualify, and an exclusive list of those that would not. We have referred to the other countries that have done exactly that, and I point out to the Paymaster General that although a debate is taking place in Sweden about whether the scheme there should continue, it is still in force and is likely to remain so. It is incorrect to say that the Swedes have decided to scrap it: they are debating what to do.
</p>





<p><a name="st_251"><a name="60502-30_spnew8"><b> Peter Luff: </b> 
 My understanding is exactly the same as my hon. Friend&#039;s. I left the Chamber to check what was happening in Sweden, and was told by a person in that country that the scheme is not going to be scrapped. If the Paymaster General has contradictory information, she should share it with the House.
</p>





<p><a name="st_252"><a name="60502-30_spnew9"><b> Mr. Francois: </b> 
 I agree with my hon. Friend, the Chairman of the Trade and Industry Committee. We have used Sweden as a specific and empirical example of how guidelines could be produced to allow the scheme to survive, were the Government so minded. The problem is not one of definition; it is that the Government wants the money.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60502-30_para5">
<a name="stpa_312">Thirdly, the Treasury&#039;s own regulatory impact assessment confirms that a more tightly defined scheme could be continued at a reduced cost to the taxpayer. Option 2 of the Treasury&#039;s RIA is entitled &quot;Refocus the Exemptions&quot;&#151;exactly what we have argued. The Treasury estimates that a refocused scheme would cost &#163;190 million a year to 2010&#150;11, compared with the &#163;370 million a year that the scheme would cost were it to continue unaltered. I refer the Paymaster General to the table printed below paragraph 76 of the RIA.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60502-30_para6">
<a name="stpa_313">It is therefore possible to refocus the scheme, keep it alive and save all its benefits&#151;and save money for the taxpayer in the process. That has to be a win-win proposition and the House would be wise to adopt it. Arguments in the scheme&#039;s defence have been made by the CBI and the TUC, other Government Departments such as the DTI, employers that have implemented it at the Government&#039;s behest, companies that were set up to support it and the people who are benefiting. However, given the attitude exhibited by the Paymaster General and the other Labour Members who have contributed to the debate, I fear that the Government have closed their ears and minds to them all. To put it bluntly, they are minded to take the money instead.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60502-30_para7">
<a name="stpa_314">This is a poor decision. It will be detrimental to our long-term competitiveness in the 21st century, not least in respect of countries such as China and India. Moreover, as my hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Worcestershire (Mr. Luff) noted, the next time that the Government launch a scheme to promote information technology and look to business and the unions to support it, who on earth will believe them? Effectively, they are canning this scheme after only two years of operation. How will major multinationals looking to invest in IT projects and facilities in this country view that?

<a name="stpa_322">As Members have pointed out, the HCI was modelled on a Swedish scheme introduced to increase home computer ownership. The evidence from Sweden shows that between 1996 and 2001 home computer penetration rose by 29 per cent. to 56 per cent., a compound annual growth rate of about 14 per cent. However, over the same period, UK household penetration increased from 27 per cent. to 44 per cent., a compound annual growth rate equivalent to 12 per cent. So the UK achieved a comparable rate of growth in home computer take-up when the HCI was barely used, demonstrating that the HCI itself has not had a strong impact.

That is a bit rich, as the Conservatives did not manage to get any of their amendments selected, for precisely the reason that we constantly give: it is extremely difficult to draft legislation to cover certain types of equipment while excluding others, because the technology is changing.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60502-31_para2">
<a name="stpa_326">The hon. Member for Rayleigh said, &quot;Well let&#039;s do it once a year.&quot; Once a year, he wants a completely new statement that would be out of date already, excluding equipment that would not otherwise have been included in the system. Opposition Members say that the scheme should be restricted&#151;perhaps to basic rate taxpayers or someone else&#151;while complaining about administrative burdens and the scheme&#039;s complexities. So, the Government had to take a decision. If the scheme is poorly targeted and abused and if we cannot target it sensibly, the Government must determine the best way to proceed, and the best way to proceed is the way that the Government have said: through our digital strategy and the announcements that I have made today.

<a name="60502-31_para3">
<a name="stpa_327">My hon. Friend the Member for Wolverhampton, South-West (Rob Marris) asked, &quot;Why change overnight?&quot; We had problems in the system, which I will come to, and we could not find a way to squeeze them out of the system, and we needed to ensure that we refocused. I cannot see how that could have been done in any other way. When the scheme was introduced in 1999, it was made clear that it would be kept under review. When the digital strategy came out, it was made clear that that review was ongoing, particularly in respect of targeting. There can be no doubt in any

<a name="60502-31_para4">
<a name="stpa_328">It has now been suggested&#151;I can only suggest that it is wilful misinterpretation of the proposed changes&#151;that the removal of the tax exemption in section 320 of the ITEPA 2003 is somehow undermined where an employer provides computer equipment solely for work purposes and that, where any private use is not significant, no tax charge will arise. That was the case before 1999, and it is the case now. Employers need to work under that system; they have worked under it in the past. The idea that the Opposition have wrung a concession out of the Government is preposterous. All the Government have said is that employers must operate under the same rules as applied in 1999, and that if they require guidance and they want to discuss it we are happy to do so&#151;but the idea that this is something new is just ridiculous.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60502-31_para5">
<a name="stpa_329">The hon. Member for Rayleigh referred to the regulatory impact assessment and says that it analysed the impact of removing the tax exemptions, but he should read a bit further because it then refers to mobile phones and computers. It summarised the evidence of misuse, but it also made it clear that that was only one of the reasons on which the decision was based. There was a lack of focus, poor targeting, rising costs and abuse.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60502-31_para6">
<a name="stpa_330">Let us deal with the abuse. I am sorry that I did not take longer in introducing the clause, by going through the types of things that are now being offered. We have got PCs, which will be

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_87">&quot;a delight for intense gamers and the users of high-performance visual application.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="60502-31_para7">
<a name="stpa_331">We have then got option 7&#151;I will not embarrass the taxpayer by saying who is offering such schemes&#151;that says:

</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="60502-31_para8">
<a name="stpa_332">Then, having made it clear that this is about what is on loan to employees&#151;this comes to the point about take-up&#151;one of the websites very helpfully asks:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_89">&quot;What happens at the end of the scheme?&quot;&#151;</p>

<p>
</p>

<a name="60502-31_para10">
<a name="stpa_334">So people who have already got a computer will get another one, but the scheme is supposed to be about take-up by the low paid and the excluded.

<a name="60502-31_para12">
<a name="stpa_336">That is not the purpose of the scheme, but the website goes further. I really do not know how this will be used: apparently, people can have as part of their package a massage ball. I have not figured out, because I do not have one, exactly how that is plugged into the computer and is part of the HCI&#151;and I do not want to hear any rude comments&#151;but I am sure that the hon. Member for Rayleigh might prefer to take up the mug warmer option in the HCI, or perhaps he would like to go further.

<a name="stpa_337">Perhaps the home cinema package is helping the excluded&#151;or iPods, which are great, but are hardly about ensuring the take-up of information and communications technology initiatives by the socially excluded. I freely admit that I made a mistake in being much too kind to the hon. Gentleman. I referred to websites and said that I would let him have details. I should have said that if he looks at the sites, he will see that about 75 per cent. show signs of offering leisure equipment outside of the intended exemption.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60502-31_para14">
<a name="stpa_338">What have the Government done? My hon. Friends the Members for North Swindon (Mr. Wills), for North Durham (Mr. Jones) and for Wolverhampton, South-West referred to that. We have refocused on the low paid and the unemployed, and on making sure that we truly have a strategy that reaches the parts that are excluded from information technology.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60502-31_para15">
<a name="stpa_339">When removing any tax relief, the Government have not only to consider its popularity, but whether it is still meeting its aims and is not imposing an unfair burden on the taxpayer population as a whole. The tax exemption was a popular scheme and has given many employees access to home computers since 1999, but it does nothing to help those groups who are the most technologically excluded&#151;those on the minimum wage, those not in employment and the elderly. That is what the Government are moving to do and that is why they are removing the HCI exemption. I commend the clause to the House.

<p><a name="st_271">The amendment was tabled because of concerns that many small clubs and societies will once again have to pay corporation tax on very small amounts of income as a result of the abolition of the nil rate corporation tax band, which I broadly support. Such income arises from the negligible amount of interest arising from the associated costs of dealing with tax affairs. As many as 64,000 small clubs or associations could be affected, and the compliance costs for taxpayers and HMRC are unlikely to be outweighed by any tax raised. Even if HMRC does not expend any effort in undertaking to pursue small clubs and societies for tax, the clubs themselves are technically required to provide that information, and the most responsible among them will take on that burden. They may even believe that they need to seek new or differently skilled officers, especially given the substantial coverage of the frequent changes to small business tax in the past six years. The amendment would help to prevent such a burden from being imposed once again on many small societies, and I commend it to the House.</p>





<p><a name="st_272"><a name="60502-32_spnew1"><b> Mr. Mark Hoban  (Fareham) (Con):</b> 
 I support the amendment, and I should like to match the hon. Member for Falmouth and Camborne (Julia Goldsworthy) in brevity. Professional bodies have raised their concerns about the matter with Revenue and Customs, which has expressed a willingness to tackle it with a concession. However, there is anxiety that that concession may not have the legal standing that it had had prior to the Wilkinson case. The Opposition would therefore welcome confirmation that the concession stands and has legal weight, thus preventing an undue burden falling on small clubs and associations.
</p>





<p><a name="st_273"><a name="60502-32_spmin0"><b>The Financial Secretary to the Treasury  (John Healey): </b> 
 This has been a useful, well-targeted and focused debate. The amendment is drafted rather widely, but I commend the hon. Members for Falmouth and Camborne (Julia Goldsworthy) and for Fareham (Mr. Hoban) on focusing their contributions tightly on concerns about clubs and societies, thus reflecting representations from the Institute for Chartered Accountants. However, there is no need for an amendment to achieve the result desired by the hon. Member for Falmouth and Camborne.

<p>
<a name="60502-32_para0">
<a name="stpa_343">For many years, the Inland Revenue and, latterly, HMRC have not sought corporation tax returns from clubs and unincorporated associations with very small tax liabilities. That practice was established before the introduction of the starting rate of corporation tax, and it will not be affected by the changes in clause 26. Any club or society that is unclear about its tax position should ask its local HMRC office for advice. Clubs and unincorporated associations with larger profits may wish to consider whether they are eligible for the generous tax reliefs resulting from Government changes

Sensible practices are already in force within HMRC to ensure that the corporation tax regime is applied reasonably in respect of clubs and unincorporated associations. Going further down the path suggested by the amendment, and particularly building it into legislation, would be counter-productive. I hope that the hon.

<p><a name="st_274"><a name="60502-32_spnew2"><b> Julia Goldsworthy: </b> 
 I am slightly reassured by the Minister&#039;s remarks. It would be preferable for HMRC to deal with the problem through concession and, historically, that would be the most appropriate course. However, that might not be possible formally because of the House of Lords decision in the Wilkinson case of 2005, which cast doubt on the extent of HMRC&#039;s discretionary powers not to apply the strict letter of the law in appropriate circumstances.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60502-32_para2">
<a name="stpa_345">Without HMRC being able to put its policy into effect with a public pronouncement about the position of clubs and societies, it will nevertheless have to deal with their inquiries. With its ability to deal with those concessions in doubt, I thought that the best way to bring the matter to the Committee&#039;s attention was through my amendment. I shall not seek to divide the Committee on this occasion, but I would ask the Minister to look into ways of ensuring that small societies are not adversely affected by the extra administrative burden that the reintroduction of the zero rate will impose.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60502-32_para3">
<a name="stpa_346">In conclusion, I request that the Government consult urgently the small clubs and societies affected by the amendment and ensure that they are properly informed of their responsibilities.

<p><a name="st_276"><i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>





<p><a name="st_277"><a name="60502-32_spnew3"><b> John Healey: </b> 
 Clause 26 essentially introduces schedule 14. Together, the effect is to replace the starting rate of corporation tax and the non-corporate distribution rate with a single small companies rate, which is currently set at 19 per cent.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60502-32_para4">
<a name="stpa_347">There are three important aspects of the background to the provisions, which the Committee may wish to consider in deciding whether the clause should stand part of the Bill. First, there are the reasons why the Government introduced the starting rate of corporation tax. Secondly, we had a wide-ranging debate with 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>2 May 2006 : Column 926</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>business and its representatives about the proper form of taxation for small businesses. Thirdly, responses were made to our announcement last December in the pre-Budget report that, as a result of those discussions, we had decided to remove the non-corporate distribution rate and starting rates of corporation tax.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60502-32_para5">
<a name="stpa_348">The Government have consistently supported business and enterprise. We have provided a tax regime with incentives for individuals to invest not just for their own future, but for the wider prosperity of Britain. We have also provided incentives to encourage business to expand and grow. We introduced the starting rate of corporation tax at 10 per cent. in the year 2000 and then reduced it to 0 per cent. in 2002 in order to provide the means for small companies to reinvest their profits in their business.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60502-32_para6">
<a name="stpa_349">As the Committee knows, we always keep the tax system and its operation under close review. We did so in respect of this particular matter, as we undertook to do when we introduced the measure. We saw that the benefits of incorporation and being able to access the starting rate were being used by some small businesses not as a step to growth, but simply as a vehicle to reduce their tax and national insurance contributions liability, while continuing to trade in exactly the same way as before, drawing profits in the form of dividends and not reinvesting them in the business. We therefore introduced the non-corporate distribution rate in 2004 to ensure that the benefits of the starting rate remained focused on companies that were retaining their profits for growth.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60502-32_para7">
<a name="stpa_350">We said at the time that the problem of tax-motivated incorporation was part of a wider issue and that the NCDR was not the end of the matter, but that we would consider the long-term strategic issues raised by these developments, to ensure that the tax system adequately reflects the realities of today&#039;s changing labour market and business environment. In the pre-Budget report in 2004 we published a discussion paper and invited views from, among others, smaller firms and their advisers on these wider issues.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60502-32_para8">
<a name="stpa_351">The responses ranged almost as widely as the organisations. One thing is clear; there is no single fix that will level the field between all small businesses, irrespective of legal form. Although there was no consensus about the specific changes that they wanted, one overriding feature of the responses from all quarters was a strong preference for simplicity over approaches that risked introducing further complexity. Responding directly to the debate and to our own analysis of the situation, we announced in the pre-Budget report in 2005 that we would replace the starting rate and the non-corporate distribution rate with a single small companies rate. That is what clause 26 achieves.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60502-32_para9">
<a name="stpa_352">We wanted to refocus the way that we provide incentives for small firms that invest and grow. We announced that the first year capital allowances for small businesses would be increased for the year beginning April 2006 to 50 per cent., and that the turnover threshold for the VAT annual accounting scheme would be increased to &#163;1.35 million; doubled, in effect. We also announced that we would look to increase the threshold for the VAT cash accounting scheme to a similar threshold, pending state aids clearance from the European Commission. Rather than 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>2 May 2006 : Column 927</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>favouring the incorporated small business, these measures will assist the incorporated as well as the unincorporated small business.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60502-32_para10">
<a name="stpa_353">About 4.2 million businesses are eligible to benefit from the increase in first-year allowances, 1.08 million small businesses are eligible to benefit from the increased threshold of the VAT annual accounting scheme, and about 733,000 businesses are eligible to benefit from the increase in the threshold for the VAT cash accounting scheme, if we can put it in place pending state aids clearance.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60502-32_para11">
<a name="stpa_354">That move in December was welcomed by business. In response to the pre-Budget report, the Federation of Small Businesses commented:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_92">&quot;The replacement of the zero rate of corporation tax by increased capital allowances for small business was welcome. This will reduce differences in the taxation of small business, depending on how they are organised&quot;;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="60502-32_para12">
<a name="stpa_355">precisely the aim of the move. Furthermore, there is a clear ongoing desire and commitment on the part of businesses and their representative organisations to continue to work with us on the longer-term future of taxation for small business.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60502-32_para13">
<a name="stpa_356">In the Budget in March we therefore stated that we continue to believe that all individuals and businesses must pay their fair share of national insurance contributions and tax, irrespective of legal form. We also said that we would continue to review the tax and NI systems to ensure that that was the case, and that we would produce proposals for discussion consistent with a set of principles that include simplicity for compliant businesses, support for businesses in their aspirations to grow, and maintaining the attractiveness of the UK as a business location. These are the principles that underpin the provisions in clause 26. I commend the clause and the principles to the House.

<p><a name="st_278"><a name="60502-33_spnew0"><b> Mr. Hoban: </b> 
 I am grateful for the opportunity to debate clause 26. The Financial Secretary briefly discussed the history of the measure, and I want to spend a little more time on that, because I think it important to understand why we are where we are. The current situation is not a surprise, because there were indications along the way that it would happen. In the Finance Bill, the Government are taking more than &#163;800 million out of small businesses over the next three years with scant compensation for the additional costs that those businesses must bear at a time when small businesses are facing higher burdens through not only tax but regulation.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60502-33_para0">
<a name="stpa_357">The Chancellor introduced the measure to stimulate business but later restricted it with complex legislation around the non-corporate distribution rate, which added to the complexity of the system. He then announced the measure&#039;s abolition, saying that it was a bold move to simplify the system, but he was simplifying his own handiwork and the damage that he had created.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60502-33_para1">
<a name="stpa_358">As the Financial Secretary has said, the corporation tax starting rate was introduced by the Chancellor at 10 per cent. on profits up to &#163;10,000. In his 1999 Budget speech, the Chancellor said:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_93">&quot;I want to create an even lower rate, which will give new incentives for men and women to start their own businesses and work their way up . . . The legislation will ensure that the beneficiaries are genuinely those who take risks. And 85 per cent.

</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="60502-33_para2">
<a name="stpa_359">The measure was clearly targeted to stimulate business. To reinforce its impact, the Chancellor reduced the starting rate from 10 per cent. to 1 per cent. in his 2002 Budget. Hon. Members may remember that that was also the Budget in which he increased national insurance contributions, so perhaps the reduction was seen as compensation for small businesses for the increase in national insurance.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60502-33_para3">
<a name="stpa_360">When we debated those changes in Committee and on the Floor of the House, hon. Members identified some of the risks. In 2002, we supported the introduction of the zero rate, and we oppose its being scrapped in the Finance Bill. We welcomed the relief that it provided for small businesses and object to the burdens that it places on them today. We want to support our small businesses, not attack them when they feel vulnerable because of increased regulation and red tape.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60502-33_para4">
<a name="stpa_361">I want to highlight three issues: the bias towards incorporation created by the measure; the cost of the zero rate against the money that the measure will save; and the economic benefit accruing from the zero rate. It was clear   in 2002 that there would be an incentive for unincorporated businesses to become limited companies. Indeed, I made that point in Standing Committee in 2002, where I pointed out the concern among unincorporated businesses about the fiscal advantage of incorporation:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_94">&quot;Many unincorporated businesses feel that the Government are trying to drive them towards incorporation. They do not wish to incur the additional costs of incorporation, but the tax regime is such that they feel almost obliged to do so because if they did not, they would be significantly worse off.&quot;&#151;[<i>Official Report, Standing Committee F,</i> 16 May 2002; c. 104.]</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="60502-33_para5">
<a name="stpa_362">Both the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton (Mr. Davey), who served on that Committee and the Institute for Fiscal Studies have commented on that matter.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60502-33_para6">
<a name="stpa_363">In Committee, the Paymaster General chose to dismiss the views of not only a new Back Bencher but the Institute for Fiscal Studies. She highlighted incentives for unincorporated businesses and attempted to explain why they should not automatically seek to take up incorporation:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_95">&quot;It is not a question of the Government making companies choose between incorporation or unincorporation . . . but of demonstrating clearly the steps to help businesses&quot;.&#151;[<i>Official Report</i>, 30 April 2002; Vol. 404, c. 912.]</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="60502-33_para7">
<a name="stpa_364">Given the strength of those incentives, it is remarkable that any business embarked on the route that this year&#039;s Red Book described as &quot;tackling tax motivated incorporation&quot;, since the attractions, according to the Paymaster General, of the other support for business were such that they should not feel the need to be incorporated. The Government highlighted the cost of the zero rate of corporation tax. That was the subject of the report that the IFS produced during the consideration of the Finance Bill 2002. The hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton said of that report:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_96">&quot;Through its analysis of the survey on personal incomes 1998&#150;9, it says that 1.2 million self-employed people each stand to gain in excess of &#163;500.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


<br>&nbsp;<br>

<br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>

<p>
<a name="60502-33_para8">
<a name="stpa_365">He said that the IFS calculated that
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_97">&quot;the cost would be &#163;1.2 billion, compared with the highest possible figure from the Government so far of &#163;450 million.&quot;&#151;[<i>Official Report, Standing Committee F,</i> 16 May 2002; c. 108.]</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="60502-33_para9">
<a name="stpa_366">Typically, the Paymaster General was trenchant in her remarks, batting away the IFS, saying:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_98">&quot;Sometimes its figures are nearly right and sometimes they are spectacularly wrong.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="60502-33_para10">
<a name="stpa_367">She went on:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_99">&quot;The Government stand by their estimates in the Red Book of costs rising to &#163;450 million.&quot;&#151;[<i>Official Report, Standing Committee F,</i> 16 May 2002; c. 114&#150;115.]</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="60502-33_para11">
<a name="stpa_368">On that occasion, the Paymaster General was right, as it was spectacularly wrong. The Red Book shows that the saving to Government in 2008&#150;09 through scrapping the zero rate of corporation tax&#151;&#163;530 million&#151;is not that dissimilar from the highest cost that she predicted in those debates back in 2002.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60502-33_para12">
<a name="stpa_369">The other issue that we debated then concerned the economic benefits and what would happen as a consequence of the zero rate being introduced. Again, the Paymaster General mounted a robust defence:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_100">&quot;We believe that cutting corporation tax is an effective way of targeting support at small and growing businesses. It also encourages would-be entrepreneurs to set up new companies.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="60502-33_para13">
<a name="stpa_370">She heralded the measure as
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_101">&quot;a targeted reduction in tax to help small and new companies thrive and grow.&quot;&#151;[<i>Official Report, Standing Committee F,</i> 16 May 2002; c. 114.]</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="60502-33_para14">
<a name="stpa_371">It is rather difficult, four years later, to see why the Paymaster General and the Treasury have deviated from their robust line of defence of the zero rate of corporation tax. The measure went through after detailed and robust scrutiny on both sides of the House. The then Member for Arundel and South Downs tried to make amendments to extend some of the benefits for incorporated companies to unincorporated companies, but the Paymaster General&#039;s remarks show that she vigorously defended of the attractiveness of remaining an unincorporated business.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60502-33_para15">
<a name="stpa_372">The Treasury then started to get cold feet. Having looked again, it introduced the non-corporate distribution rate. By the time of the 2003 pre-Budget report, it was clear that many businesses had incorporated, which was described as &quot;avoidance&quot; by the Revenue. In the PBR speech, the Chancellor talked about the need to ensure that small companies paid the right amount of tax. Following those remarks, in the Finance Bill 2004, we saw the introduction of the non-corporate distribution rate, which was to ensure that where dividends were paid to shareholders, they were taxed at 19 per cent. rather than 0 per cent. But the mechanics of the NCDR impose differential rates of corporation tax between distributed and non-distributed profits. That is complicated to manage and added to the complexity of the tax system.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60502-33_para16">
<a name="stpa_373">Despite all that, the Government threatened further complexity to try to tighten the system. It is no surprise that most respondents to the PBR consultation said that they favoured simplification over options that risked additional complexity. But who created the additional complexity? It was the Chancellor, who is trying to unpick the problems that he himself has created.

 I agree with most of what the hon. Member for Fareham (Mr. Hoban) said. We all agree that small business are our genuine potential for the future. The Government and perhaps previous Governments have gone wrong in not genuinely enabling small business to grow in the way we all want them to. Plenty of new businesses have started up but plenty have regrettably failed relatively early. Tax plays a significant part in that.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60502-34_para0">
<a name="stpa_384">Governments in recent times have attempted to change tax rates and the way in which they support small business. We have all largely tried to support the Government&#039;s intentions. However, although we are creating small businesses, we do not sustain them for a reasonable period so that they can grow into medium-sized businesses. Far too many fail and far too many are swallowed up by larger competitors. The nurture and support that small business needs to provide the strong economy that we want has not happened. Perhaps it is indicative that tax regimes have changed and we have not got the stability for people to plan properly. Anyone who has started a small business will recognise that the first three to five years are the toughest time. The stability of the taxes that they have to pay is extremely important if they are to plan for the growth that they need. While we applaud the simplicity, we must implore the Treasury to provide stability as well.
</p>





<p><a name="st_280"><a name="60502-34_spnew1"><b> Ed Balls  (Normanton) (Lab):</b> 
 The hon. Gentleman makes a good point about the importance of stability supporting the growth of small businesses. Does he agree that the instability in the macro-economy, the rise in interest rates and the recession of the late 1980s did far more to damage small businesses than any changes in taxation that have taken place in the past 10 or 20 years?
</p>





<p><a name="st_281"><a name="60502-34_spnew2"><b> Mr. Breed: </b> 
 The hon. Gentleman is absolutely correct. I was engaged in banking at that time, and it was one of the most difficult periods for any bank to support small businesses&#151;let alone large ones&#151;because of the huge effect of high interest rates. This was not only because of the amount of interest that the businesses were paying to the banks, but because of the effect that that had on underlying security. We therefore had the double whammy of a decrease in security and an increase in borrowing. That was the main contributor to the way in which the economy died. I agree that stability in the economy and stability in the ability to plan are essential.

<a name="60502-34_para1">
<a name="stpa_385">Whatever we now have in this regime, the loss of the zero rate will certainly increase the tax bill of many small businesses. If that is countered by the increase in the first year&#039;s capital allowances, that will make a difference to the growth of those businesses, but they need to be able to rely on that. When they make an investment in plant, machinery or business premises, they need to be able to guarantee that the tax regime will be stable and predictable for the next three to five years. While the Government&#039;s motives were correct, the way in which

<a name="stpa_386">If we really want small businesses to be the engine room of the economy, we must provide a stable tax regime and appropriate planning, as well as more clarification on research and development grants. We must also ensure that not so many businesses fail. Banks play an important part in helping businesses to get over the inevitable difficulties that they face. I regret that far too many banks do not provide adequate support over the longer term, and we see far too many businesses failing. We want to see businesses being set up, and continuing. That requires support and planning not only from the Government but from other bodies.

<a name="stpa_387">I want to consider the use of the term &quot;fair and appropriate&quot;. I do not know what a fair and appropriate contribution to tax is for a business, but it will certainly change over a business&#039;s lifetime. Many businesses will find it easier to sustain a fair and appropriate contribution once they have strength and stability. If we try to tax them too early in their lives or submit them to too high a burden of regulation, they will fail and we will get no revenue from them. We need an appropriate tax regime that recognises the difficulties faced by a small business at different stages of its cycle. That would be fair and appropriate, but I am not certain that this particular small business tax regime will achieve it. However, that is what we must aim for, otherwise we will not get a fair and appropriate tax contribution from businesses. There would be far too many businesses starting and failing.

They advised me that, when the zero per cent. rate was introduced, the number of FSB members that incorporated moved from 27 to 37 per cent., and that it has stayed broadly constant at 38 per cent. since then. Yet in the Red Book, and throughout these debates, this measure has been described as one that tackles tax-motivated incorporation.

Can the Treasury team tell the House how many businesses making a profit of less than &#163;10,000 will be affected and start paying tax at 19 per cent., and how many larger ones will do so? As the provisions are described as tackling tax-motivated incorporation, how many of those businesses, which will now pay but did not do so previously, does the Treasury believe incorporated in the first place to avoid paying tax?

<p><a name="st_289"><a name="60502-35_spnew0"><b> John Healey: </b> 
 We introduced the starting rate of corporation tax at 10 per cent. in 2000 to provide the means for small companies to reinvest their profits in their businesses. The hon. Member for Fareham (Mr. Hoban) quoted my right hon. Friend the Paymaster General at length. I remind him that she said at the time of the introduction of the zero rate that we considered that we had the balance between the incentives to incorporate and the incentives to remain unincorporated correct, but she made clear in the Standing Committee that the Government did not have a closed mind.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60502-35_para0">
<a name="stpa_400">It became plain that the starting rate enabled business to escape tax by retaining profits, but did not reward reinvestment specifically. As we have seen, it left the way open for some to incorporate just to reduce their tax and national insurance contributions burden, and not to take a step towards the growth that we wanted to encourage. In those circumstances, business urged simplicity on us and specialists urged us to deal with the starting rate and with the non-corporate distribution rate.

 Does my hon. Friend agree that in making tax policy, one is always balancing tackling avoidance with providing the right incentives? It would be simpler if we abolished the 20p rate for small companies and had instead just one rate for all businesses, but that would be bad for small companies, just as it would be wrong to abolish the 10p starting rate for capital gains tax and to go back to the single 40p rate that applied in 1997. In the end, it is about striking a balance between avoidance and providing the right incentives.

 My hon. Friend cuts to the very heart of the policy challenges that any Government face, and which we have been trying to tackle since we took office in 1997. As he said, it is a question of getting the right balance between creating incentives for small businesses to start up and grow, and preventing the abuse and avoidance that we tend to see promoted and taken advantage of. In dealing with the situation that we faced, we had to decide whether to box around with further legislation&#151;and thereby prevent&#151;the marketed schemes and practices that we wanted to discourage, or whether to take instead the step   urged on us by businesses, their representative organisations and tax specialist organisations: to create a simpler regime.

 The unfairness at the heart of the system and the challenge that we face is that many companies are incorporating simply to reduce their tax liability, not because their business demands suggest that that is the proper legal form for them.

He said that he was not sure what a fair tax system is. We should remember that as things stand&#151;clause 26 is designed to change this&#151;a self-employed person with profits of &#163;20,000 a year pays some &#163;1,800 more in tax and national insurance than they would pay if they were a company paying corporation tax and taking profits as dividends.

<p><a name="st_307"><a name="60502-37_spnew1"><b> Vera Baird  (Redcar) (Lab):</b> 
 As the gas price spiralled ever upwards last winter and spring, the disadvantages of our future dependence on that fuel became increasingly obvious. They were clear to the ordinary domestic consumer paying a highly inflated bill, obvious to the point of depression in the Government-supported anti-fuel-poverty sector, and painfully transparent to energy-intensive users, such as the petrochemical businesses in my Redcar constituency. Several of the petrochemical firms, which, together, provide a big slice of the north-east&#039;s gross domestic product, had to idle plant and limit output in favour of non-UK locations, and, in one case, temporarily close. The huge hike in those energy costs is likely to have longer-term effects, such as the delay, or even abandonment, of industrial investment in the chemical sector, all of which will be made much worse in the absence of speedy action to guard against a recurrence of the price hike next winter.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60502-37_para4">
<a name="stpa_419">The cause of the problem is at least partly the impact of the early liberalisation of the UK energy market ahead of that of the rest of Europe. However, additionally, we are moving more quickly than anyone could have predicted from supplying our own energy, which we have done for the past 100 years, first from coal and then from North sea oil and gas, to potentially becoming dependent on Russia, Algeria and the middle east for gas.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60502-37_para5">
<a name="stpa_420">The problem of relying on Russia, which was previously regarded by the west as a reliable energy source, became especially clear to Ukrainians on new year&#039;s day when the Russians cut their supplies. However, the ripple effects were felt thousands of miles away. Not only did France lose a third of its gas, but the whole of Europe, which relies on Russia for a quarter of its supply, was forced to realise that there are serious limits to the length of the spoon that can be used when supping with President Putin. Clearly he will readily use his abundance of hydrocarbons for political purposes, in this instance to punish the western-leaning Ukraines for considering joining NATO and the EU and to force them back into Russian hegemony
</p>

<p>
<a name="60502-37_para6">
<a name="stpa_421">Our dependence on Russian gas looks set to grow. Russia has 28 per cent.&#151;the largest share&#151;of the world&#039;s natural gas resources. Given that, should we ask what sort of a country is President Putin&#039;s Russia? According to Amnesty International, Russia has an abysmal human rights record. According to Freedom house, another human rights non-governmental organisation that assesses countries across a range of rights and issues as free, partly free or not free, Russia has declined from partly free to not free in the past two years. It says that Russians cannot change the Government democratically because the state&#039;s far-reaching control of the broadcast media and the growing harassment of Opposition parties make that impossible. There was strong evidence of an undercount in the vote for Opposition parties in the last election that kept them from attaining the 5 per cent. threshold required for parliamentary representation. Corruption is pervasive and libel laws are used to intimidate the independent media. Putin has just taken power to appoint the judges.

Middle eastern countries are, of course, significant gas suppliers. Levels of dependency on a country for energy supplies tend to make purchaser Governments significantly less prepared to challenge the supplier Government&#039;s democracy and human rights record, even though we and other western European countries assert that these values are key ones to be supported in foreign policy.

<a name="stpa_428">President Putin has recently engaged in a fruitful piece of diplomacy in this direction. He signed a contract for Russia to supply missiles and fighter aircraft to Algeria. Payment for these is so arranged that Russian influence is now woven deeply into the Algerian energy sector. At the same time, President Putin has tightened his monopoly of the gas transit route from the Caspian and central Asian regions, building up, therefore, a double or a triple potential stranglehold on European gas supplies.

<a name="stpa_429">It is noteworthy that it was Russia that was free to supply enriched uranium to Iran to limit concerns about nuclear weapons proliferation in that country. Iran has the second highest natural gas reserves in the world, behind only Russia, and there are emerging concords in the energy sector between these two countries.

<a name="stpa_430">Recently, the Kremlin controlled Gazprom indicated a wish to bid for Centrica, the UK&#039;s largest domestic supplier, which sells gas to 40 per cent. of British homes. Success would secure UK demand as well as supply for the Russians, who are not yet big players in the UK. It would be a surprising outcome if, as the UK energy market is liberalised primarily to create competition, it became dominated by a state-owned corporation, and not even a British one.

<p>
<a name="60502-37_para17">
<a name="stpa_432">The fact that we are timid about energy suppliers&#039; human rights obligations should not be a surprise when one considers the temptations. Energy is vital to modern economies, and problems with supply have been the basis of some of the most important events in recent history, including the global recession in the early 1970s after the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries cut supplies and, in the UK, the miners&#039; strike of 1974 that brought down a Tory Government and the strike in the 1980s that did not do so. Ultimately, the 10-year war between Iran and Iraq, and the two more recent wars in Iraq were strongly linked to, if not determined by, reliable energy supplies.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60502-37_para18">
<a name="stpa_433">In addition, energy-rich countries have a great deal of buying power, and can offer lucrative contracts for western know-how effectively to extract resources from the ground or the seabed. Gazprom is keen to secure western technical help further to develop Russian resources. Those countries are often ready to purchase sophisticated arms from the west, which are necessary to shore up their security and protect the status quo. As chair of the all-party group on Burma, I know the power that hydrocarbons can give despotic Governments. European efforts to isolate the despicable Rangoon junta are constantly foiled by the French, whose oil company, Total, is the regime&#039;s largest corporate funder. Incidentally, that has led to the unacceptable belief that the Bush White House operates a more effective sanctions programme against Burma than the EU. The Burmese Yadana gas project, in which Total and the junta are partners, earns the regime up to $450 million a year, which it spends on boosting the military suppression of its citizens and which it uses as an aid to laundering drugs money for the purchase of foreign arms.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60502-37_para19">
<a name="stpa_434">Although we do not buy hydrocarbons from Burma, that country&#039;s history teaches us another truth. Countries with immense natural resources may have lopsided economies. A sudden inflow of dollars as prices rise can lead to an appreciation in domestic currencies, making non-energy sectors uncompetitive in the world and removing incentives to develop other industries, thus confirming the domination of oil and gas. The resource is concentrated so that cash passes through few hands and can easily be misdirected. The inherent instability of commodity prices impacts mostly on the poor, who do not have any way of hedging the risk. Such countries rarely have stabilisation policies to set aside surpluses to cushion the blow when prices fall. Indeed, there are few internal pressures in such countries to govern well at all, because those money flows mean that there is little need to raise revenue through taxes, so there is little need to secure the consent or support of their people, who have little leverage to call their rulers to account.

Countries with strong institutions can benefit from the wealth that great natural resources bring, including Norway, which has about 1 per cent. of world gas reserves, and, historically, Britain. Both countries had a strongly entrenched representative democracy, freedom of speech and association, as well as the rule of law, long before they realised that they had hydrocarbons. None of the countries in the top five for gas reserves are classified by Freedom house as free.

<p>
<a name="60502-37_para21">
<a name="stpa_436">Clearly, relying on such countries for our gas supplies can bolster unacceptable regimes and ensure that their citizens pay a high human rights and democracy price even as we pay a high financial one. Ultimately, the dangers and instability to the world from human rights abuses mean that the price that everyone pays is extremely high. Happily, that understanding appears to be compatible with the direction of Government policy. The energy review was partly initiated as a result of the UK becoming a net gas importer sooner than expected and the newly appreciated risks of an unreliable supply.

<a name="60502-37_para22">
<a name="stpa_437">There are genuine gains to be made from renewable technologies using wind, wave and solar power. Clean-coal technology and carbon sequestration for coal and North sea oil have a future, while efficiency measures to reduce demand for energy are vital too. Campaigners protest that a fully committed Government should push through much stronger action on renewables and energy efficiency, but such measures often involve major changes to people&#039;s lifestyles and are hard to deliver. For example, wind farms are widely opposed because of their impact on the local environment. A proposed offshore wind farm in Redcar is deeply unpopular, because it is less than a mile from the shoreline of our main tourist bay. The proposed onshore wind farm at the steelworks is acceptable to everyone, however, because it is part of the industrial landscape. In a similar way many people resist microgeneration windmills on houses, recently exposed as dangerous and difficult. Wave power may have environmental problems, and the technology for carbon sequestration is only in its early stages.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60502-37_para23">
<a name="stpa_438">The technology that should not be overlooked in establishing what is likely to be a mix of energy supply is nuclear power. At present it contributes about 19 per cent. of our electricity needs, but that could fall to 7 per cent. by 2020. Meanwhile, the Government&#039;s target for renewables, which many consider to be optimistic, is for an increase in renewable power from 3.4 per cent. to 20 per cent. by the same date, 2020. These figures show how the majority of the effort that we put into reducing CO <sub>2</sub>  emissions through renewable energy is in danger of being wasted if old nuclear power stations are not replaced.

<p><a name="st_308"><a name="60502-38_spmin0"><b>The Minister for Energy  (Malcolm Wicks): </b> 
 I thank my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Redcar (Vera Baird) for the opportunity to discuss the important issues of human rights and the current energy review. It seems that only recently she and I were discussing equally important questions about women and pensions.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60502-38_para0">
<a name="stpa_443">The Government take human rights very seriously and I am proud of the work that we undertake. As a      developed country, with a well-established representative democracy, we have a duty to promote good human rights in all interactions that the UK has with other countries.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60502-38_para1">
<a name="stpa_444">Energy policy is a truly international issue, as events every week demonstrate. Even though the UK has a large natural resource in oil and gas reserves in the North sea, imports remain an important element of our energy mix. In the future, our imported energy will come from a wide range of sources&#151;oil from Denmark and Venezuela, and gas from Norway, Qatar and Algeria, for example. Furthermore, some of the world&#039;s leading extraction companies, such as BP, BG Group and Shell, are based in the UK. As such, they share the responsibility for protecting human rights wherever they are operating.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60502-38_para2">
<a name="stpa_445">As my hon. and learned Friend made clear, the way in which countries use their energy resource is an important issue for the whole international community. It was for this reason that in 2000 the UK and US Governments established a set of international voluntary principles on security and human rights. These are designed to help companies to meet the requirements of their international operations, while respecting the human rights and fundamental freedoms of those in the host country.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60502-38_para3">
<a name="stpa_446">We have continued to work with British companies to promote and expand the work of the voluntary principles initiative. I am pleased to see that those principles have formed the cornerstone of those companies&#039; approach to security and human rights in the countries in which they    operate. The initiative is also backed by a number of non-governmental organisations, such as Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60502-38_para4">
<a name="stpa_447">We are also committed to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development guidelines for multinational enterprises. These set out guidelines on responsible business conduct for all companies based 

<br>&nbsp;<br>

<br>&nbsp;<br>in the UK. The guidelines cover areas such as combating bribery, environmental protection and public health and safety. Stable and successful producer countries are crucial for the international community&#039;s long-term energy security. The best way to ensure such long-term security is to ensure that the revenues raised from oil are transparently accounted for and used to benefit the people of those countries.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60502-38_para5">
<a name="stpa_448">Through the extractive industries transparency initiative, we are working with Governments in resource-rich countries to improve such governance through the publication and verification of company payments and Government revenues from oil, gas and mining. Some 20 countries&#151;for example, Azerbaijan and Nigeria, which are significant players in the global liquefied natural gas market&#151;have either endorsed or are now actively implementing that initiative, and other countries that are global suppliers of uranium, such as Niger, have also endorsed the initiative. We are encouraging emerging markets&#151;for example, China, India and Brazil&#151;to support the initiative&#039;s implementation in resource-rich countries and by their companies, whether state owned or otherwise. Russia could play a leadership role with those economies.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60502-38_para6">
<a name="stpa_449">Our indigenous supplies of energy have declined sooner than expected. We are already a net importer of gas and expect to be a net importer of oil by 2010. There is no doubt that whatever is decided by the energy review, to which my hon. and learned Friend has referred, the UK will be importing significantly more oil and gas in coming years from a range of countries around the world, but heightened concern about global energy issues are affecting perceptions of the security of supply from major exporter countries. Reliance on imports is not per se a threat to security of supplies. Indeed, all other G7 countries, with the single exception of Canada, have been in this position for many years.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60502-38_para7">
<a name="stpa_450">Securing our energy supplies from a diversity of countries by a number of different routes is an important factor in our energy policy. We are not putting our eggs all in one basket, because diversity helps us to maintain reliable supplies and mitigates the risks of any interruptions. Oil and gas come to the UK from a variety of countries, but a significant proportion of our current oil and gas imports come from Norway&#151;for example, 72 per cent. of oil imports and 80 per cent. of gas imports. Countries such as Germany, the Netherlands and Belgium are also suppliers.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60502-38_para8">
<a name="stpa_451">The market for liquefied natural gas, which can be shipped like oil, is expanding significantly. The UK expects to receive the first supplies of LNG from Qatar by the end of 2007. As the LNG market becomes more global, it is possible that the UK will receive shipments from other producers such as Nigeria and Egypt. That diversity will help to continue our strong record for the continued physical supply of gas and electricity to end users. We have had fewer unplanned interruptions to electricity than any European country except the Netherlands. The expansion of renewables, to which we still remain committed, is further adding to our diverse generating mix.

First, the objectives of the 2003 White Paper are the right ones, and a review for the long term is the right decision. Secondly, there is a need for greater long-term clarity about the direction of UK energy policy. Thirdly, there is a need for action on both energy demand and energy supply.
