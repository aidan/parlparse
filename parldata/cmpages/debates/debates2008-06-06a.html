 Does the hon. Lady recognise that one of the big challenges is that it is hard enough to get 18 to 21-year-olds to vote, yet they too, at an earlier stage, called for more representation and wanted a say in politics? Surely we should focus our energies on trying to figure out how we are going to motivate them to get voting instead of continually trying to lower the age limit.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman makes an important point that I have considered carefully. However, I believe that by involving young people at a younger age we are more likely to involve those in older age groups as well, because people can get into the habit of voting when they are still in schools and institutions. One of my reasons for introducing the Bill is the hope that it will get all younger age groups voting.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o8"><a name="80606-0001.htm_para8"><a name="080606136000074">The popular assumption is that young people are not interested in politics, and engagement in formal politics is certainly a problem. To follow the hon. Gentleman&#146;s point, in the 2005 election only 37 per cent. of eligible 18 to 24-year-olds voted&#151;a sad indictment of the situation. Nevertheless, young people are politically aware and active. We all know how enthusiastically they join campaigning organisations and pressure groups on many issues.</p>

 Does my hon. Friend accept that part of the reason why turnout among young people has been so low is that it has been low generally, particularly in the last general election? In 1997, the turnout was much higher among 18 to 25-year-olds. Is not the problem essentially that we do not speak the language of young people and therefore fail to engage them in the political process?</p>

 My hon. Friend is absolutely right: we do fail to engage young people. That is why it has been so good being able to campaign on the Bill. I have spoken to many young people and have been so impressed by their enthusiasm. They have attended meetings in the House of Commons and spoken with a passion about their belief that they should have the right to vote, and that has given me great hope for the future. We need to speak the language of young people. Part of my reason for promoting the Bill is to connect with young people, and I have been pleased to be able to do so.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o9"><a name="80606-0001.htm_para9"><a name="080606136000077">According to a Home Office citizenship survey, 81 per cent. of 12 to 16-year-olds believe that there should be a way to get young people involved in politics,. There is a clear and consistent demand from young people for a lowering of the voting age. Research from organisations such as the British Youth Council, the Children&#146;s Society and Save the Children has found a desire among young people for the vote.</p>

<p><a name="st_o14"><a name="080606136000078"><a name="80606-0001.htm_spnew14"><a name="080606136000734"><b>Mr. Nigel Evans (Ribble Valley) (Con):</b>
 I endorse what the hon. Lady says about young people getting involved in politics, as they do at all ages. We are all on the receiving end of letters from youngsters at school who are encouraged to write to their Members of Parliament or who write to us on their own initiative on a range of issues. They join various groups trying to save the whales or to save the environment. We know that they are passionately involved. Does she agree that this is a great apprenticeship whereby they can get involved in politics without going to the next stage, which is to have a vote? There has to be a dividing line somewhere, and one could argue that it could be 17, 16, 15, 14 or 12, but 18 seems to be the appropriate voting age in the vast majority of places in the world.</p>

 I thank the hon. Gentleman for an important contribution to the debate. I accept that many young people are involved in such pressure groups in a very enthusiastic way, and I applaud what they do. However, young people themselves are saying that they want the vote. There is a move towards lowering the voting age in many other countries, and I think that we should be the leader in this and show our respect for young people. They are the hope for the future&#151;let us put some trust in them and give them the vote at 16.</p>

 I follow the argument that there should be voting at 16, because that is in line with other rights that people gain at 16. However, does my hon. Friend agree that the argument that lowering the voting age to 16 would increase turnout does not hold water, because experience in other places where it has been done shows that turnout goes down overall rather than up?</p>

<p><a name="st_o17"><a name="080606136000081"><a name="80606-0001.htm_spnew17"><a name="080606136000737"><b>Julie Morgan:</b>
 I thank my hon. Friend for his contribution. The Electoral Reform Society has calculated that if young people voted at the same rates as 18 to 24-year-olds, the percentage turnout would stand still, and if none of them voted it would go down by about 2 per cent. However, I am not introducing the Bill to try to increase turnout but because it is a good way of recognising young people&#146;s involvement and what they can do.</p>

 Absolutely, and I thank my hon. Friend for her intervention. One of the reasons why I am promoting the Bill is that there is more likelihood that the 16 to 18-year-old group will turn out to vote and will then, we hope, get into the habit of voting, which would boost all turnout rates.</p>

 Does the hon. Lady realise that her Bill is not even supported by members of the United Kingdom Youth Parliament, who, when they met in the other place in May and were asked to vote on what they regarded as the three most important issues to campaign on this year, declined to vote in favour of this proposal because they thought that there were three other issues of greater importance?</p>

 I can tell the hon. Gentleman that in the meeting to promote the Bill earlier this week we had very enthusiastic members of the UK Youth Parliament supporting it very strongly. Certainly, it is one of the top priorities for the Children and Young People&#146;s Assembly for Wales&#151;Funky Dragon&#151;and it is campaigning on it. His point is not particularly valid.</p>

 Does the hon. Lady agree that the UK Youth Parliament does support the Bill, but the fact that it did not necessarily label it as the No. 1 priority just shows the maturity of young people in being interested in a whole range of issues?</p>

<p><a name="st_o23"><a name="080606136000087"><a name="80606-0001.htm_spnew23"><a name="080606136000743"><b>Julie Morgan:</b>
 I thank the hon. Lady for her contribution.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o10"><a name="80606-0001.htm_para10"><a name="080606136000088">In 2004, the Electoral Commission&#146;s public consultation on lowering the voting age found that 72 per cent. of respondents favoured a voting age of 16. That consultation attracted huge levels of participation, including nearly 8,000 young people. More recently, Funky Dragon ran a wide-ranging survey that found that 80 per cent. of young people in Wales wanted votes at 16. Subsequently, the Welsh Assembly passed a motion calling for the voting age to be lowered to 16. This change in the voting system could only be achieved at Westminster, but the support in the Assembly was overwhelming, with 44 Members voting for the motion and only four against, and complete cross-party support. It was quite a surprise that only four Members voted against. That gives a good idea of what cross-party support there is for this measure in Wales.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o11"><a name="80606-0001.htm_para11"><a name="080606136000089">Young people, their youth councils and youth groups throughout the UK are lobbying their representatives for the right to vote, and I am sure that many Members have been lobbied by young people on the issue. My faith in the ability of young people was strengthened by the event at which I helped to launch the Bill earlier in the week, which I referred to earlier. Young people came from all over the country to attend the meeting and spoke eloquently and enthusiastically. Listening to them, I wondered how we could possibly not give them the vote. These young people were impassioned and determined, firmly making their case, and I was pleased that people came from Wales, particularly from Cardiff, where my constituency is. It was great to hear young people speaking for themselves from the platform, and not being spoken for by us&#151;it was a refreshing change.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o12"><a name="80606-0001.htm_para12"><a name="080606136000090">I came away thinking about other fights that we have had, such as women&#146;s fight for suffrage. A lot of people argued against that as well, but when we look back it seems ridiculous that women could not vote. I hope that one day, when 16-year-olds can vote, we will look back and think how ridiculous it was that there was a time when they could not vote. That happens with all changes: when they start, they seem extreme or groundbreaking to some people, but then they become normal. That is what will happen with votes at 16.</p>

 I think that that argument is rather specious. Women, when they were not able to vote, were never going to become men. All being well, 16-year-olds will become 18-year-olds, and will therefore get the vote. Whatever else 16-year-olds are, they are not the heirs to the suffragettes.</p>

 The hon. Lady keeps referring to the UK Youth Parliament. At its meeting in May, that body decided on a list of six issues, but it decided that the issue of votes at 16 should be the fifth priority, which shows that it does not regard it as a really big issue, as she suggests.</p>

 On that point, is not the corollary of what the hon. Lady is saying that we tend to view having a vote to elect Members to the House of Commons as political activity, but overlook the fact that many young people are involved in single-issue groups such as the campaign against ID cards, Greenpeace, Friends of the Earth and others? They are engaged and enthused, but not necessarily in respect of having a vote at the age of 16 or 17. Is it not a bit patronising to assume that young people are only interested in having a vote at the earliest possible age, when they are already campaigning on political issues?</p>

I am sure that there are a lot of things that young people may want that we would not agree with, but in this case, there is a strong argument that people aged 16 and 17 have a right to vote. The phrase &#147;no taxation without representation&#148; has been used by many groups struggling for political rights over the years, but it applies no less to 16 and 17-year olds working and paying tax who are denied the vote, because there is no age limit on paying income tax and national insurance. Tax is taken on full or part-time work including tips and bonuses, and the most up-to-date figures show that 548,000 16 and 17-year-olds are in some form or employment.</p>

However, even then, many 16 and 17-year-olds will continue to work as tax-paying members of society. Even those studying part-time will be able to work more than 20 hours per week and be taxed on that income. Young people should have some say on how that tax is spent. I have been to schools to speak to young people and hear their views&#151;I know that many hon. Members have done this&#151;and I found that they have a range of views about what provision there should be in the area, and about how their local authorities are run.

 My hon. Friend makes an important point.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o17"><a name="80606-0002.htm_para3"><a name="080606136000109">I come to the issue of young people in the military. On 1 April 2007, there were 4,560 16 and 17-year-olds serving in the armed forces. In the last financial year, 30 per cent. of all new recruits to the military were under 18 years of age. People can apply to join the British Army at 15 years and seven months, and to the Royal Navy and Royal Air Force at 15 years and nine months. While it is Government policy that personnel under the age of 18 should not be deployed on any operations that would see them engaged in hostilities, the normal practice is for recruits to sign up to a four-year contract, meaning that in deciding to join at 16, they are making a decision that could see them deployed in two years&#146; time. If they are old enough to join the armed forces, 16 and 17-year-olds deserve the right to vote for the Government who could decide to send them to war. That is a very important point.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o18"><a name="80606-0002.htm_para4"><a name="080606136000110">Notwithstanding those points, preventing 16 and 17-year-olds from expressing their political views through the ballot box denies them their rights. It gives them and the rest of society the impression that young people&#146;s views are not valid and that they are not real citizens. One of the ways in which we can show young people that we respect them and that their views are valid is by getting them to vote. If the Government gave young people the vote, it would be a huge step in recognising the contribution that they can make.</p>

 Those in favour of lowering the voting age cite selectively the point about the armed forces. A 16-year-old cannot join the Army without parental permission to do so. That shows that we do not trust 16-year-olds to decide by themselves to join the armed forces, yet those in favour of the proposal never cite that fact.</p>

The judgment was based on the principle that voting is a human right and that any restriction on the right to vote must therefore be legitimate and proportionate. One could say that, on 1 May, when the local elections took place, 90,000 16 and 17-year-olds were denied the opportunity to vote. Large groups of people who are capable of voting are excluded from doing so. Lowering the voting age would send a powerful signal that the Government believe that young people are capable of making decisions that affect their lives. We have a historic opportunity to mark the Government&#146;s commitment to young people.</p>

I have already said that we have a problem with engaging young people, and that the turnout statistics for the young, especially at general election time, are worrying.

 It certainly is. Votes at 16 would increase young people&#146;s engagement in politics because it would also increase the engagement that politicians are obliged to have with young people. It stands to reason that those in the political system will be more interested in the opinions of those who can vote and have influence. Our political system is currently skewed too far in favour of those who are older, for simple reasons&#151;there are more of them, they have more power and they tend to vote more. Of course, it is tremendously important to pay regard to, and do all we can for older people, but I believe that we pay less attention to young people&#146;s views because they cannot vote. It is inevitable in such a system that they do not have the power of older people.</p>

Today&#146;s 16-year-olds have had the benefit of systematically studying our democracy and electoral system, and the importance of voting, through compulsory citizenship education, which became part of the national curriculum in 2002.

16 would allow for a seamless transition from learning about voting, elections and democracy to putting such knowledge into practice.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o26"><a name="80606-0002.htm_para12"><a name="080606136000130">Importantly, most 16 and 17-year-olds are in education settings and have the opportunity to discuss issues and to get into the habit of voting. If young people air their views and discuss the process with other members of their class or college, there is much more chance that they will vote. In Wales, the equivalent of citizenship education is the personal and social education framework, which provides an opportunity to learn about active citizenship as part of the curriculum. All that is happening in schools today, so now would seem an ideal time to move towards a younger voting age.</p>

 My hon. Friend has made the point that 16 and 17-year-olds, perhaps because they are in education settings, would be in a better position to discuss voting and might be better motivated to vote than some older young people. Is it not also likely that those young people will be living at their home addresses, near the polling station at which they are registered, and will therefore probably be more likely to exercise their vote than many 18 to 21-year-olds, who usually live away from home at the time elections take place?</p>

 I was coming to that point. As we all know, 18 to 21-year-olds are difficult to canvass during elections. Often, when we get to a house with lots of different names, we know that student voters are living there, and we do not know whether they are voting in our constituencies or in their home areas. It is quite difficult to engage them and there are limited opportunities to make contact.</p>

If 16 and 17-year-olds had the vote, we would have the opportunity to reach them in school&#151;as my hon. Friend said, while they are still at home, they have a stable address and it is easy to reach them&#151;and get them into the habit of voting.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o28"><a name="80606-0002.htm_para14"><a name="080606136000134">It is a sad fact, but if we do not engage young people early, they rarely pick up the habit of voting later in life. The exclusion of 16 and 17-year-olds is fuelling the disengagement of 18 to 24-year-olds. The longer young people are denied involvement in the formal democratic process, the less chance there is of engaging them ever.</p>

If people cannot be bothered to fill in a form, we are hardly talking about a great campaign or crusade. May I also suggest that the point that she has just made has been made in something of a vacuum? Societal changes mean that young people are probably taking a much more transactional approach to what politics and politicians can do for them. Forty years ago, the No. 1 determinant of whether someone voted and who they voted for was how their father voted.

Research has shown that the closer to a general election a person&#146;s 18th birthday falls, the more likely they are to vote. People who become 18 in the year leading up to a general election are significantly more likely to vote than those who turn 18 in the year after an election and have to wait another five years. Although lowering the voting age cannot get rid of the lottery of birthdays, it would ensure that a person&#146;s first engagement with parliamentary democracy would happen by the time they were 21.</p>

It would allow us to catch young people at a time in their lives when voter education could be provided for them. Votes at 16 would give young people the experience of voting by 21. Once familiar with the process, they would be much more likely to continue voting for life. Lowering the voting age would not only be good for young people, but would be good for UK democracy as a whole. It would redress the balance of power towards younger people and would be an investment in the health of democracy and the future, by engaging young people in voting for life.</p>

As one of the oldest and most respected Parliaments in the world, we have set the pace in the delivery of democracy. When the UK lowered the voting age to 18 in 1969, France, Italy, Canada, Australia and the USA quickly followed. Although we would certainly been seen as progressive if we lowered the voting age to 16, we would not be the first country to do it. Last year, Austria became the first EU state to reduce the voting age to 16 for all elections, and that also applies in five of the 16 German Länder.</p>

Green Paper, &#147;The Governance of Britain&#148;, set the tone of the debate this year. It spoke of the need to reinvigorate democracy, to put power in the hands of Parliament and the people, and to make a commitment to consider lowering the voting age.

When the Minister responds to the debate, I hope that he will give us more details about the youth citizens commission, how young people are involved in it, whether it has begun its consultation and what the timetable for reporting will be. This is therefore a timely debate, because a body has been set up to look into the very issue that we are discussing.

<p><a name="stpa_o38"><a name="80606-0003.htm_para4"><a name="080606136000151">Parliament has already had the opportunity to consider this matter. On 29 November 2005, the hon. Member for Bristol, West (Stephen Williams)&#151;he is in his place today and I am sure he will seek to catch your eye, Mr. Deputy Speaker&#151;introduced his ten-minute Bill, the Representation of the People (Reduction of Voting Age) Bill. He obviously had less time to make his points, but his case was similar to that put forward today by the hon. Member for Cardiff, North. He mentioned the fact that, at 16, people could join the armed forces, leave school and pay taxes. He also mentioned cigarette manufacturing and addictive habits. He said that the manufacturers believed that if they could get people to take up smoking at 16, those people would be addicted for many years. The hon. Lady seems to be advancing a similar argument, in saying that if we can get people hooked on voting at 16, they will carry on doing it. The reason that I mention that is that the Government have decided that 16-year-olds are not old enough to make a decision about buying cigarettes, and that they need to be 18 before they can do so.</p>

 Perhaps the hon. Gentleman needs to distinguish between a good habit and a bad habit. That is the point that I was making on 29 November 2005, which was also the day on which we had the Second Reading of the Health Bill that went on to ban smoking in public places and subsequently to raise from 16 to 18 the age at which a person can purchase cigarettes.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman is absolutely right. Voting is indeed a very good habit, and smoking is a very bad one. The point that I was making was that if the Government&#151;and, I suspect, the hon. Member for Cardiff, North&#151;do not believe that a 16-year-old is capable of deciding whether or not to purchase a packet of cigarettes, I do not see how they can simultaneously believe that such a person is able to make a decision about who should govern their country.</p>

She spoke of the pain of those who are unable to vote until they are 23 because a general election has not come along. Does my hon.

 I am sort of grateful to the hon. Gentleman for that intervention. If he listens to my remarks a little later, he will hear me set out the reasons why I do not believe that we should do so. I listen carefully to the views of 16 and 17-year-olds&#151;and, indeed, of much younger children&#151;when I visit schools in my constituency, as I am sure all hon. Members do.

 The hon. Gentleman is absolutely right. The turnout argument is a very weak one; it is not at all convincing. Furthermore, it is not the right argument. The decision to reduce the voting age should be taken on its merits, and arguments in favour of doing it to increase turnout are rather specious. As the hon. Member for Edmonton (Mr. Love) said earlier, if we followed that argument to its logical conclusion, we could go around the electorate picking off groups of people who did not use their vote and taking it away from them. That would clearly be nonsensical. Similarly, the turnout argument is not a powerful one.</p>

One of his arguments concerned the case being made in the 19th and 20th centuries for the right of women to vote. The hon. Member for Cardiff, North also made that point. I think that I demonstrated in my intervention that that argument was nonsense. It was clearly right to give the vote to women, but that was because, if we had not done so, they would never have had an opportunity to vote. The whole point about children and young people is that, even though they do not have the right to vote now, they will have that right later.</p>

 That is absolutely true. I would have been very relaxed about reducing the voting age to the age of majority; however, in the past the argument was not merely about the voting age but about the age at which people could do a number of other things. It is broadly accepted, although there are discrepancies, which I shall mention later, that people stop being children and become adults at the age of 18, and I think we should stick to that line, otherwise there will be no logical reason for setting the voting age at 16. Once it ceased to be associated with becoming an adult, there would be no logical argument against giving the vote to 14-year-olds, 12-year-olds or 10-year-olds.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o40"><a name="80606-0003.htm_para6"><a name="080606136000169">I am sure that if we were to reduce the voting age to 16, the age that has been chosen on this occasion, a campaign would be launched by politically aware 14-year-olds, and there would be no logical reason to say no to them. At present, however, it is clear that we connect voting with becoming an adult, and I think that that is how things should stay.</p>

 Does my hon. Friend accept that a cogent argument for allowing 16-year-olds to vote is that that is the school leaving age? Does he also accept that most 16-year-olds have the mental capacity to vote? The problem lies in the fact that many of them have not been educated at school about our democratic system. It is a problem of education, rather than of the mental incapacity or immaturity of a 16-year-old.</p>

Those 111 Members expressed the belief that this was an important matter and that lowering the voting age could play a huge role in helping young people to feel more connected, and they explicitly supported the Bill, but I see precious few of them here today. According to my hon. Friend the Member for Christchurch (Mr. Chope), the Youth Parliament rated the issue as fifth out of six in terms of importance. Of the 111 Members who supported the hon.

 Surely the hon. Gentleman accepts that many 16 to 18-year-olds, like the rest of the population, are at various times cynical or disillusioned about politics and politicians. What if there were a close general election in this country, like the last two elections in the United States? Does he not think that 16 to 18-year-olds would be keen to participate in such circumstances, and perhaps to tilt the government of the country? Far from being disillusioned, would they not feel cheated if they were not able to take part?</p>

 I certainly think that the next general election will be very competitive and interesting, and will stir people on all sides of the argument to take part. The turnout in this year&#146;s mayoral election was significantly higher than last time&#151;it was, of course, won by my former hon.

that is not my experience. I find that young people are very hopeful about the future and keen to convey their points of view, and that they campaign in a range of ways. What they require from us is that we listen to them. I shall expand a little later on the point that my hon.

Such a person has clearly failed to reach the relevant age, but they will feel cheated because with another four days they would have been able to vote. The reality is that we need to have a cut-off time. If we used 16 as that point, someone who was one day short of being 16 would rightly feel cheated too.

 The hon. Lady tries to put words into my mouth, and I am not going to allow them to remain there. Her making that comment gives me a good opportunity to dwell for a moment on the language. As I have mentioned once or twice, when we talk about those who are younger than 18 we are actually talking about children; we are not talking about young people. Everyone has been in favour of that approach, apart from on occasion. I think that the hon. Member for Cardiff, North used the words &#147;young people&#148;. We are actually talking about the difference between being a child and being an adult. Clearly there is a gradation in people&#146;s experience, maturity and ability to make decisions, but the law must set a point. There has to be a point at which we decide that people who are able to take certain decisions will not take those decisions. The law in this country broadly says that someone becomes an adult when they are 18, and with that comes a range of responsibilities. Other age limits are set for things, and I shall go through them later in remarks&#151;if I am ever allowed to get there.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o45"><a name="80606-0004.htm_para2"><a name="080606136000196">By saying that someone becomes an adult at 18 and someone below that age is a child, we are not, in any sense, disparaging children; we are simply saying that a line has to be drawn. Let us follow the hon. Lady&#146;s argument to its logical conclusion. If we were to move the line for voting to 16, would we not implicitly be saying that there was something not worthy or not appropriate about 14 and 15-year-olds voting? There would be no logical reason not just to drop the voting age all the way down to zero. The fact is that there must be a line somewhere, and wherever it is drawn there will be people on the wrong side of it who have the maturity to take such a decision. The right place for that line to stay is at 18.</p>

 Does the hon. Gentleman accept that despite the age of majority being 18, a range of things are permitted and possible at 16? All hon. Members have rehearsed the arguments about marriage, sexuality, taxation and so on, so it is specious to say that 18 is finite and that below that age young people are not capable of a certain range of things. Those that are harmful we have a responsibility to prohibit for longer, but those that are non-harmful, such as voting, should be allowed.</p>

 That intervention raises two points. Voting, in itself, is a good thing for people to do, but the consequences of the choices that they make could be good or bad. The whole point about setting a voting age is that we want people to be sufficiently confident to take those decisions, so that they are fully aware of the consequences.

that leads to a bad outcome&#151;could be worrying; someone could vote for a Government who made some very bad decisions, as I would argue is the case with this Government.

The argument is not a strong one, because we allow people to do some things at much younger ages; indeed, the age of criminal responsibility&#151;the age at which we say people are able to be held criminally responsible for their actions&#151;is 10.

One of the core arguments of their case is that one can do a load of other things at 16, so one should be allowed to vote too. I think that the hon.

A reflection of that is the increasing responsibilities, several of which have already been mentioned, that we give them.

 I am not sure that I agree. Hon. Members who engage in argument with young people in schools, as I do, would agree that many of them take an interest in the world around them, and tools such as the internet help them to find out easily what is happening. However, it is not so long ago that most young people left school at 16 or, going further back, 15. Now young people stay on in education and do not have the responsibility of going out and getting a job, or running their own household. Indeed, the age at which young people leave home is rising, not falling, so I do not agree that the age at which they take responsibility for themselves is moving in the direction that the hon.

 I submit that the reason why young people are urged to stay on in education is not related to their ability to be responsible or their maturity, but to their needs as individuals and society&#146;s need for a better educated work force.

The nub of the argument is whether society is placing greater responsibilities on young people because of their earlier maturity and whether that should be extended to the voting age.</p>

 That is not a very powerful argument. If we are to say to young people that we do not think that they are sufficiently responsible or competent to take a decision about driving a motor car, using a firearm, consuming alcohol or buying cigarettes, it would be extraordinary to say at the same time that we think that they are mature enough to make a decision about the future of our country and about people who might deploy our armed forces. We know how the Liberal Democrats feel about the decisions made by the Government about committing our armed forces. Those are important and serious decisions, and I cannot see how it would be wise to say that a young person under 18 could not consume alcohol but could vote for a Government who could authorise the use of force in an armed conflict.

The accumulated wisdom, knowledge and experience of those people is disregarded after the age of 70. Those people wish to exercise that civic duty, but they cannot do so. I am sure that my hon. Friend will agree that, at some stage, we must take an arbitrary decision&#151;a value judgment&#151;on the suitability of those of certain ages to participate in civic duties. In this case, the hon. Lady is disregarding that factor.</p>

 I do not want to interrupt the flow of the hon. Gentleman&#146;s argument, but does he agree that the very nature of our representative democracy lies at the heart of the debate. I wonder whether those hon. Members who talk about the Lisbon treaty and a referendum in a rather blithe and loose way would agree that it is at least an important matter of principle that the referendum mechanism is used extremely sparingly. We have a system of representative democracy in this country, so we should use the referendum mechanism sparingly, and the precise times when it should be applied are very important. Perhaps instead of making such references lightly, I wonder whether he would agree that he should be much more precise about how the decision on the referendum on the Lisbon treaty was actually taken.</p>

The Minister would be right, except of course for the fact that the Government promised such a referendum in our parliamentary democracy. Of course, if they had not promised one, it would have been perfectly in order for the House to have taken the decision. However, following your injunction, Mr. Deputy Speaker, I will move on.</p>

 On the point about at which age people can start to do new things, one of the reasons why I support the Bill is that 16 to 18-year-olds are naturally interested in trying out new things. Once they do, they often get into the habit of engaging in those things. Voting is a very commendable habit to get into, whereas perhaps smoking and drinking to excess are not such commendable habits.</p>

Bristol, West&#151;to pick up the point made by the hon. Member for Cardiff, North about the younger people&#146;s views&#151;I drew attention to the fact that, at Speech house in my constituency, which is the home of debate in Forest of Dean, we had a debate in 2005, during democracy week, when a number of local sixth-formers met in the Verderer&#146;s court, which is an historic home of debate in the forest. The Royal Forest of Dean college, Wyedean school and Newent community schools sent students to debate exactly this issue. It was interesting that, when they took a vote afterwards, even in audience made up entirely of 16 to 18-year-olds, there was a 50:50 split. So even among the target age group, there is not a clear view that they want such a change. Indeed, powerful arguments were advanced by those students to explain that they did not want that change for some of the reasons that have been adduced so far this morning and for those that I am sure will be referred to later. It is interesting that even those who would benefit from the proposal do not think it right that the voting age should be changed.</p>

 That may or may not be the point, but it is not really the crux of my argument, which is that voting should be tied to becoming an adult. That age should be set at 18. As soon as that link is shifted and broken, there is no logical age on which to settle. The age of 16 would then just be a staging post. Certainly, the opinion polling evidence that I will quote later shows that most people in this country think that the voting age should stay at 18.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o48"><a name="80606-0005.htm_para1"><a name="080606136000238">To conclude the first part of my remarks about the debate on the ten-minute Bill, it is worth reminding the House of the decision that Parliament took when that matter was pressed to a Division by the late Eric Forth and me. The House divided Ayes 128, and Noes 136. The House therefore made a decision, albeit not an overwhelming one, but it was a decision reached when rather more Members were present than are today, to make it clear that it did not want to make the change.</p>

Most of the arguments made in support of that point have been covered briefly this morning; they are about being able to join the armed forces, get married, legally have sex, leave education and pay tax. It was argued that because 16-year-olds could do all those things legally, they were capable of making rational, responsible choices and should therefore be able to vote. A little later, I will consider some of those arguments in detail and demonstrate why those rights, which people gain at 16, are qualified, and why the case is not as the proponents have argued.</p>

 We have made it very clear that in our system, although under-18s can join the armed forces, we will not deploy them in armed conflict until they are 18. We have drawn that distinction, and I think that the Government got that policy right; I support it. As the hon. Member for North Durham (Mr. Jones) said, it is seems extraordinary that the Liberal Democrats think that a 16-year-old should not be able to join the armed forces, but should be able to vote for people who can authorise the use of armed force around the world. That seems incredibly inconsistent. If one is to allow people to vote&#151;to make the decision to use armed force&#151;surely one should let them join the armed forces. Liberal Democrat policy on that is hopelessly inconsistent.</p>

 On the hon. Gentleman&#146;s last remark, young people can take the decision to join the armed forces at 16. Young people who do so today will be aware, at the age of 16, that they may be sent to Afghanistan or Iraq as a consequence of that decision taken at the age of 16, although their going may be delayed until they are 18. I want to come back to the issue of the UN convention that he quoted. Of course, that was written in 1989, and I am the first to accept that the consensus at the time is reflected in that convention, but we have moved on. I come back to the nub of the argument, which I hope that he will address: we must look at those things that only happen at the age of 18 and over, and those that happen at the age of 16. I submit to him that more responsibility is being placed on young people at the age of 16. If that is the way in which society is moving, we have to recognise it, regardless of whether he wishes society to move in that direction or not. The consequence of that is the Bill.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman has quoted the UN convention, which says that everyone under 18 is a child. He is aware that some people use that argument to suggest that the age of criminal responsibility should be raised to 18. In the debate on whether to have a Bill of Rights in Northern Ireland, many people have made that point. I do not believe that that age should be raised to 18, and I do not think that he does, either, so why is he relying, in such absolute terms, on that argument?</p>

 I am not; I was simply using the UN convention to demonstrate that when I refer to people under 18 as children, I am not in any sense using a pejorative term. I am simply citing a matter of fact.

I am sure that I am typical of Members of Parliament, in that I visit primary and secondary schools in my constituency, and a number of youth projects and other organisations that work with children and young people. I am sure that all Members of the House do that in the course of their work.

House take very seriously our responsibility as Members of Parliament to engage with young people, and with people of all ages, and to encourage civic responsibility and participation in elections. We also try to conduct ourselves in ways that encourage turnout and participation rather than the opposite.

If I have a constituent who I know will not vote in an election, I will still do my damnedest to help them in whatever casework they bring to me and with whatever problem they have.

 I thank the hon. Gentleman for reading out the words of the former Prime Minister. My question relates to the commission that is being set up by the Government to consider the matter, to take a comprehensive view, to ask young people what they think and to resolve some of the differences of opinion between not parties but different Members. Does he see that as a positive move and will he contribute to it? Most importantly, will he accept the recommendations that it makes?</p>

 I am perfectly content with the Government&#146;s proposals to set up a commission, although I would be interested to know how much it will cost the taxpayers, hard-pressed as they are at the moment. I am perfectly content if the commission wants to carry out some investigations and I am content to look at its recommendations. I never say that I will take people&#146;s recommendations in advance of their being made. One thing that voters of all ages expect MPs to do is to use their judgment and consider the merits of the case and the arguments and evidence from all sources. To say in advance that one will listen to the views of a certain group and follow them regardless is not very wise. The idea of the commission is perfectly sensible, and I am sure that the Minister will outline the remit of the commission and how it will conduct its work. I know that the chairman has been announced, and it will interesting to see what conclusions it comes up with after consulting widely.</p>

 Is the hon. Gentleman, like me, sometimes cynical about reviews? We had the Electoral Commission review in 2003, which said in the conclusion that another review should be carried out within five to seven years. However, a lot of things that come out of the Electoral Commission do not make a great deal of common sense to anyone who is involved in democratic policies. Does the hon.

 My hon. Friend&#146;s comment is probably right. I deliberately referred at the beginning of my speech to the ten-minute Bill. The House has already had the chance to consider the issue during this Parliament and has made a decision. It will be interesting to see what decision the House makes today, but I do not think that people can keep revisiting things until they get the answer they want. It would be sensible if the House considered the arguments, as they are worth looking at. However, the arguments in favour of the Bill are rather threadbare. The arguments made against change and for sticking with the status quo are, I think, much more compelling.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o68"><a name="80606-0006.htm_para3"><a name="080606136000283">Clearly, there are strong views on either side of the argument for reducing the voting age to 16, as there were in 1969 when the Representation of the People Act reduced the age from 21 to 18. One could say that that heralded the change. I do not come at the subject with strong views either way. I feel that if we reduced the age to 16&#151;this point has already been made&#151;we might have another attempt to reduce it to 15 or even lower.

 I have heard that argument repeated several times today. Surely a debate on the essential issue of who has the right to vote and who does not, and the reasons for those decisions, are a critical part of our democracy.

 I am not scared of any debates. I think that it is an issue that we should discuss in each Parliament. It should be reviewed. The problem I have is that, if we reduce the age to 16, will we then not settle on 16, but go further down? I agree with my hon. Friend: I would not oppose the debate taking place.

example, as some have suggested, the age of criminal responsibility, which is 10? I do not think that that would be very favourable either.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o69"><a name="80606-0006.htm_para4"><a name="080606136000286">I am not opposed to debate, but the weakest of the arguments being made is the one about turnout. The idea is that, if we are to engage young people in the electoral process, reducing the age to 16 would mean that they all flocked to the ballot boxes and started voting in local elections. I will refer later to the wider problem, which is not necessarily down to young people. Different sections of society are not voting. We should take certain steps to make it easier for people to vote, irrespective of their age, but I do not think for one minute that age is an issue that will increase turnout. I refer to the example of the Isle of Man that was cited earlier. Young people there were given the opportunity to register, but most of them did not. However, to make voting easier, we must look at systems such as postal voting and others.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o70"><a name="80606-0006.htm_para5"><a name="080606136000287">Like the hon. Member for Forest of Dean, I visit many schools and enjoy engaging and talking with young people, in both primary and secondary schools. In the seven years I have been in the House, this issue has never come up during one of the school visits that I have taken part in. I have had a host of issues raised about local issues that affect young people in the county of Durham, and those people are quite engaged with some national topics. As I said in an intervention on the hon. Gentleman, I think we all keep a tally of the main issues that affect our constituents. As I said, saving the whale was the top issue that people wrote to me about. Then came the campaign against bearskins being used by the Grenadier Guards. As for the third issue, may I put it on the record that I was not suggesting that people write to me to support the clubbing to death of seals? People were voting to oppose the clubbing to death of Canadian seals. However, voting age has never been raised with me by young people in my constituency, either directly or in writing, and most right hon. and hon. Members get not only a daily postbag now but an e-mail box full of our constituents&#146; opinions.</p>

 I agree with the hon. Gentleman. From recollection, I have not received one letter on the subject in 16 years. Perhaps there was one; let us play on the safe side. I find it interesting that, when young people met in the House of Lords the other day&#151;it was a great initiative and I would like to see it extended; I do not even see why we cannot use this Chamber for that kind of thing&#151;one of the issues that came above giving the vote to 16-year-olds was the abolition of tuition fees. The interesting thing is that those aged 16 to 18 would be the next cohort to go into full-time education and would be liable to pay the tuition fees, so there would be a lot of unintended consequences if we went down that road.</p>

UK Youth Parliament is doing, because it raises awareness of not only the activities of this House but local government and other things.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o71"><a name="80606-0006.htm_para6"><a name="080606136000290">One argument for reducing the voting age to 16 is about consistency: people can do other things at 16 so we should reduce the voting age to 16. Some of those other things have been mentioned: the right to leave home, to join the armed forces or receive social security benefits. However, I should like to clarify the issue about the armed forces. I have been a member of the Select Committee on Defence for seven years. In the previous Parliament, our Committee held an inquiry on the duty of care for 16 and 17-year-olds in the Army. People may be able to join the Army at 16, but their rights and abilities to do things are, rightly, quite tightly controlled. The parental responsibility is with the parent or, for those people who have left care to join the armed forces, with the armed forces. I do not think that it is a strong enough argument to say, &#147;Because you can do these things, you should reduce the voting age to 16.&#148;</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o72"><a name="80606-0006.htm_para7"><a name="080606136000291">We are getting a little schizophrenic in our approach to age. Earlier I mentioned the fact that we are increasing the age at which people can do things. I represent a rural constituency, and I take the point that the hon. Member for Forest of Dean made about raising the driving age, which would create a lot of difficulties in rural communities, although I support not only making provisional licences tougher, but, once people get their licences, imposing more restrictions on them. Therefore, we cannot have it both ways. We cannot argue for a reduction in the age at which people can vote for people to come to this House and then argue that they are not responsible enough to drive, use air weapons and everything else.</p>

 One welcome change relatively recently is the move to equalise the age at which one can vote and the age at which one can stand as a candidate for the House. I support that change: it is sensible for those two things to be drawn together. One danger of this move is that, if we were to reduce the voting age, we would again set up that disconnect where we said that people were old enough to choose Members of the House, but not old enough to be Members of the House. We would end up with either that disconnect or pressure building for 16-year-olds to be elected to the House. That would not be welcome, although I support equalising the age at 18.</p>

 I agree. I did support, and would again, the reducing of the age at which one can stand for the House to make it the same as the age at which one can vote, because otherwise there would be a disconnect, although I have not noticed a great groundswell of people standing for local office at 18. Having said that, if I remember rightly, the Conservative party now has a couple of 18-year-olds in Durham. I think that an 18-year-old, a very young lady, was elected in Willington. She was certainly under 21, although strangely, her leaflets did not mention the word &#147;Conservative&#148; at all. I do not know whether she got elected as a Conservative or an individual, but credit to her for standing as part of the democratic process.</p>

Furthermore, people thought that the Crewe and Nantwich by-election&#151;I should not mention that, but I will&#151;would be a tight-fought contest, and they turned out to vote.

Like the rest of the population, 16-year-olds have different views on different issues.

I come across such young people all the time who see their role, in arguing and making their presence felt to Government on issues such as climate change, not necessarily in terms of the voting system but of getting involved in campaigning groups and activities, where they think that they can make a bigger contribution.

I have to say that I do not hold the Electoral Commission in high esteem; I think that it was one of the mistakes that we have made as a Government. The intention was right&#151;to have an independent body to scrutinise elections&#151;but it has lost its focus on what it should be doing. Given that it spends &#163;30 million a year, I am not sure that the taxpayer gets good value for money. In 2003, the commission conducted a review of voting age. The consultation, which took place that summer, was addressed to a whole host of groups, and the questions that it asked were very relevant. For example:</p>
<a name="80606-0007.htm_brev1"><a name="080606136000656"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Do you think that lowering the voting age, or allowing young candidates to stand for election, might encourage people to take part in elections?&#148;</p>

</ul>

<p><a name="stpa_o89"><a name="80606-0007.htm_para6"><a name="080606136000322">There is a legitimate debate to be had. Today&#146;s debate is about whether to reduce the age to 16 and there are some international comparisons. For instance, people can vote aged 15 in Iran, and if we are to carry out a consultation, as the Electoral Commission did, we need to take into account the views of people who argue that the age should be lower than 16. The survey asked whether people would advocate the same minimum age for all levels of elections in the UK. That review engaged the views of not just young people but a whole host of organisations and groups. The commission&#146;s findings were published in April 2004. The Government have now embarked on another consultation, and I shall come to that in a minute, but it is worth looking at the conclusions of the Electoral Commission&#146;s report.</p>

It qualified further its recommendation, clearly wanting to sit on the fence and not upset individuals, by saying:</p>

improve the social awareness and responsibility of young people. There may also (perhaps partly in response to this) be a wider debate about the general age of majority that would better inform consideration of the individual&#146;s age-based rights. We propose further research on social and political awareness of those around 18 with a view to undertaking a further review of the minimum age for electoral participation in future.&#148;</p>

The only reason it gives as evidence for that is the fact that the teaching of citizenship would somehow change the perception that young people in schools have. That process has been going on for quite a long time. I do not know why it went out of fashion in schools&#151;most used to teach issues of citizenship in general studies, and I first learned about this place in such lessons. The commission&#146;s argument, in stating that the arbitrary five to seven years should be the reason for having a review, is pretty weak.</p>

 There is powerful evidence to support the hon. Gentleman&#146;s case. Civics has been a compulsory lesson in the United States for generations and there is no evidence that it increases political literacy and turnout. Many books have been written about that. The US education system takes civics and citizenship rather more seriously than we do, and has done so for years. If there is no evidence there to show that that has an effect, it is unlikely to be effective here.</p>

 I agree. The United States should be a beacon to us on the matter. As the hon. Gentleman rightly says, citizenship lessons begin from the pledge of allegiance to the flag in school in the United States. I do not know whether people were asleep during their civics lessons, but, from my experience, the position is the same in the United States as it is here. There is a huge difference between those who have had a formal education and understand the system and people, for example, in rural parts of the United States, where education is perhaps not as good as it should be. Civics lessons have not led to great turnout, which is poor in presidential elections and even worse in state elections. That also applies to registration.</p>

advantage that it gives them&#151;but I understand that although it is not officially part of the United Kingdom, it recognises the Queen as the Head of State and its citizens are classed as British. I understand from my research that a month before the general election of November 2006, fewer than half of the 1,800 young people who were eligible to register to vote had done so. Although the Isle of Man became the first country in the EU to reduce its voting age to 16, the measure has not proven popular, in terms of young people rushing to vote.</p>

Like the Isle of Man, it is not officially part of the United Kingdom, although its citizens are classed as British. The change added some 2,000 names to the electoral register, and anyone over the age of 16 will be able to vote in the elections later this year for the Senate and the Deputy. It will be interesting to see what proportion of the 16 to 18-year-olds who are eligible to vote will take part in the elections. No doubt the Electoral Commission will have to pay a fact-finding visit to Guernsey to find out what actually happened. One of those examples certainly proves that, even if we did reduce the voting age to 16, there would not be a great clamour among people of that age to vote.</p>

 I take a consistent interest in electoral registration because at least 10 per cent. of my constituents are not registered to vote, for a whole variety of very complex reasons. As my hon. Friend will know, in this country&#151;and, I assume, in the Isle of Man and Guernsey&#151;it is the head of household who fills in the electoral registration form. The fact that young people are not registering could have more to do with the internal dynamics of family life in these communities, or with the heads of household, either through ignorance or unwillingness, not putting their 16 to 18-year-old children on a voting form, than with the young people themselves not wanting to register.</p>

 I am grateful to my hon. Friend for giving way. He has shown his characteristic generosity in so doing, which I hope he will not regret. The Government have in fact introduced individual voter registration, and it has been in operation for several years in one part of the United Kingdom. Would it not be sensible for us to study the experience of Northern Ireland, to see how the system has worked there? It seems to have cured the problem of personation, although it has had no impact whatever on increasing the number of people voting.</p>

 Perhaps the reason why personation in Northern Ireland is not the issue that it used to be has less to do with individual registration than with the change in politics and the peace process. The hon. Member for Foyle (Mark Durkan) was here earlier, and he has told stories of people in the 1970s and 1980s changing their clothes in order to go into the polling station to vote several times. He described it as &#147;binge voting&#148;.</p>

Indeed, older people of both sexes work hard to ensure that they cast their votes, and feel robbed if they cannot go out to do so. Many younger people, however&#151;not just the 18 to 25-year-olds who were mentioned earlier, but those in their mid-30s&#151;are not voting at all.</p>

I think that part of the challenge for us all as parliamentarians, and also for democracy as a whole, is to make politics relevant. It is not just a case of convincing people that they can change things and make things happen; we must also resist, and keep resisting, the tendency to push decisions away from the democratically elected sphere of influence, whether it involves this place or local councils.</p>

That is why I have always opposed the nonsense that our Government introduced&#151;the Conservatives never fell for it&#151;of an independent Appointments Commission to put people forward for membership of boards of hospitals and other trusts. Young people who want to know how their health service is delivered locally cannot find out who is making the key decisions, and ultimately those decisions cannot be changed. Such developments have led to the cynicism that we see not only among members of the older generation, but among young people.</p>

I have no problem with people standing as independents, because they have had the guts to do so. That is very much different from what we have now: the quangocracy that the previous Government started and we continued, whereby those representing local people make huge decisions on their lives without any connection to, or in many cases involvement with, their day-to-day lives. Local people cannot change those decisions, and all parties need to recognise that fundamental issue. We need to ensure that local people can not only affect decisions, but if they are ultimately unhappy with those decisions, vote people out of office, as can happen here. That should be possible on a range of issues, and we need to examine that matter.</p>

Friend the Member for Buckingham (John Bercow), who was indeed a leading member of the Federation of Conservative Students. However, he most definitely emerged as one of the most responsible members of that body. When it was disbanded by the then chairman of the Conservative party, he was elected the leader of the new Conservative youth wing. It is important to separate his reputation from that of the part of the Federation of Conservative Students that was disbanded. I apologise for that long explanation, Mr. Deputy Speaker, but we cannot have defamatory remarks made.</p>

are. Many 16-year-olds are writing essays, doing exams, and taking part in discussions on historical, political or moral issues to a very high intellectual standard, and they have a real understanding of democracy, the political process and issues that matter in our country and in our world today. I take as one example the Epping Forest schools debating competition, which I organise, and which we hold every year in my constituency. Every year, without exception, young people aged 14 to 18 take part in those debates, and every single one of them is well-informed and well able to engage in the political process. However, that does not mean that they ought to have the right to vote before they reach the age of majority.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o121"><a name="80606-0008.htm_para15"><a name="080606136000395">Out of sheer respect for the democratic system, it is right that young people should serve a sort of apprenticeship before they can become a full citizen and have a vote. As my hon. Friend the Member for Forest of Dean (Mr. Harper) said during his excellent, wide-ranging speech, the point about 16 and 17-year-olds is that, barring any tragedy that might occur, they become 18-year-olds in a fairly short time.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o122"><a name="80606-0008.htm_para16"><a name="080606136000396">The debate does not have parallels with other issues about rights, such as the campaign of the suffragettes or of anyone else for voting rights, despite some Liberal Democrats&#146; earlier attempts to suggest that it does. The issue is not at all similar&#151;it is quite different. I strongly supported the Equality Act 2006, and spoke from the Front Bench in support of it on many an occasion when it was before the House. I strongly believe in equality in every aspect of our lives in the UK today, but we cannot make people&#146;s age equal. Sadly, by the forward movement of nature and time people become a year older every year. Time flows relentlessly, and so 16 and 17-year-olds become 18-year-olds, who become 25-year-olds, who become 40-year-olds and so it goes on. We cannot hold back time, nor can we equalise people&#146;s ages for the sake of some political gimmick.</p>

 I am intrigued by the hon. Lady&#146;s comments. Given that she supported the Equality Bill, does she think that we should have legislation to prohibit ageism? By that I mean, even though we cannot make everybody&#146;s ages equal, people should not be discriminated against on the basis of age, as they are in the minimum wage.</p>

 I do. The minimum wage is different&#151;<i> [</i><i> Laughter.</i><i> ]</i> No, it is not funny. The hon. Lady was making a very good point about ageism before she put in that little party political thing about the minimum wage. This is not the place to debate the minimum wage&#151;and, by the way, my party is in favour of it. Many lies have been told about our being against the minimum wage, but we are in favour of it, as I have said from the Front Bench many times. As far as ageism is concerned, of course I agree with her. I argued that during the passage of the Equality Bill before it was an Act. One of the six strands of equality that comprise the Equality Act is age.</p>

That is rather an insulting thing for anybody to say. Of course we pay attention to 16 and 17-year-olds. It is quite disgusting to suggest that because somebody does not have the right to vote in a constituency, the MP might not take up their case or argue their point. If someone who had come from abroad and was not a citizen of this country, and therefore did not have the right to vote, were urgently to need help on some welfare matter, any of us as good MPs would take up that case and deal with it.</p>

To suggest that politicians do not listen to 16 or 17-year-olds because they do not have the right to vote is nonsense. It is also illogical, because 16 and 17-year-olds very soon become 18-year-olds. I find that many of the people in my constituency whom I knew through the debating competition are now becoming councillors and so on. They are very involved in the political process.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman is, not for the first time this morning, absolutely correct. If a 16 or 17-year-old person came to my office to ask for my advice, my first thought would be: where is that person's mother and father or guardian, who should be guiding them through life at the age of 16 and 17? I would first get in touch with the parent; I would not say, &#147;You should be able to vote, so get on with life on your own.&#148; It is precisely because the adults have a responsibility and a duty to nurture the young people in our society until they are at a stage when they can completely stand on their own two feet, that we treat 16 and 17-year-olds and children differently from the way in which we treat adults and those over the age of 18.</p>

It was probably right in previous generations when there was a much larger generation gap&#151;I remember my father frequently referring to students as long-haired louts, and that included my friends when I was a student. There was a big generation gap between those born in the &#146;20s, &#146;30s and &#146;40s and those born in the &#146;60s and &#146;70s. I do not think that there is such an enormous generation gap between those born in the &#146;60s and &#146;70s and those born in the &#146;80s and &#146;90s.

18, but perhaps we are not a representative example of the population. I take as an example a young lady, Francesca Whiteoak, now aged 17, who is coming here next week to work in my office for what her school calls &#147;work experience&#148; before going to university. She is a brilliant politics student. In recent exams, she has undertaken an analysis of the democratic system and many of the big political and moral issues that face us in the world and the country today, but she and her friends are not calling for the right to vote because they know that they are on a journey and the next staging post in that journey is when they become 18 and can exercise the right to vote. At the moment, they are learning and gaining wisdom and experience on the way to having that right to vote.</p>

 I did not hear the hon. Gentleman but perhaps he has not heard me for the past five minutes. I have been giving the positive message that it is insulting to suggest that 16 and 17-year-olds are too ignorant to vote or are not able to vote. I have been explaining about people who take part in the debating competitions in my constituency, and about how Francesca Whiteoak, who will be here next week to observe the democratic process at first hand in the Chamber, and her friends are studying politics and economics at school. They are extremely well informed, extremely intelligent and intellectually very well placed. I have to repeat&#151;I am sorry to take up the time of the House but the hon.

14-year-olds, and perhaps even of 12-year-olds, who are intellectually capable of voting. There is no logical place to stop once one separates being an adult and being able to vote. That is a simple concept, and advancing straw man arguments that no one on this side of the argument has made does not help the debate.</p>

 As I am sure that you will warn me in a moment, Mr. Deputy Speaker, we must concentrate on the subject of the debate. Nobody has suggested that 16 and 17-year-olds are too ignorant to vote. Voting is a right, a duty and a privilege. Many people do not bother to exercise that right, and I suggest that they display a degree of ignorance, because they do not bother to engage with the democratic process. Sixteen and 17-year-olds who are waiting until they are 18 and who are getting ready for full citizenship are certainly not too ignorant to vote.</p>

 If my hon. Friend will forgive me, I must make progress, because many hon. Members want to speak and time is getting on.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o128"><a name="80606-0009.htm_para5"><a name="080606136000416">As we teach our children when they are young, and as we suggest to young people as they approach majority, there are many things in life that we value all the more because they are worth waiting for, and exercising one&#146;s vote is one of those things. In response to the points raised by the hon. Member for Leyton and Wanstead (Harry Cohen), I have mentioned a young councillor, Rebecca Cohen, who is 19 and who was elected to Epping Forest district council just a few weeks ago. At 19, she is well able to take on that position, which she is doing extremely well. However, I do not think that she could have done it properly at 16 or 17. Having reached the maturity of 18, and having taken a little longer to gain some experience of the world, she is fulfilling that post very well at 19. None of us is trying to stop young people from becoming fully engaged, which we want to encourage at all times. Earlier, a Liberal Democrat Member suggested that if we do not change the law, we are saying that 16-year-olds and 17-year-olds are incapable or unworthy. Just as I have argued with the hon. Member for Leyton and Wanstead that they are certainly not too ignorant, they are not incapable or unworthy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o129"><a name="80606-0009.htm_para6"><a name="080606136000417">My main argument against the Bill concerns the question of rights. Correctly, we often discuss rights in this House, but whenever we create a right, there must be a corresponding responsibility. If there is no responsibility, then there is no right, because rights without responsibilities are meaningless. By giving people the right to vote, we are also conferring on them the burden of the responsibility to vote. I argue that 16 and 17-year-olds are gradually given plenty of responsibilities as they move on through life and grow up. It is not right to pile on all those responsibilities at once. Children of younger age groups have to be protected and 16 and 17-year-olds still have to be nurtured and helped along the way while they gradually make the transition from childhood to adulthood.</p>

 On the subject of evidence, I have just been perusing some details that might interest the hon. Member for Cardiff, North (Julie Morgan). In March 2003, a GfK NOP poll of electors in Wales for HTV, the local ITV station, found that when asked directly whether the age for first-time voters should be reduced from 18 to 16, 77 per cent. of people were opposed. Among 18 to 24-year-olds, the figure was 66 per cent.; it rose to 88 per cent. among older voters. The Electoral Commission&#146;s report found similar levels of opposition, as well as indifference among younger voters. The evidence is clear.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o132"><a name="80606-0009.htm_para9"><a name="080606136000426">In conclusion, I should say that getting the right to vote is one of the rites of passage from childhood to adulthood. It is one of the issues that marks a change from a restricted lifestyle to total freedom&#151;from childhood along the gradual path to full citizenship. Eighteen is the right age for that, and therefore 18 is the right age at which people should be given the vote. We will not encourage young people to become more involved and exercise their votes once they have them by changing the system, but by giving them something to believe in and a political system that they can trust.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o133"><a name="80606-0009.htm_para10"><a name="080606136000427">We need to show, through the example of how we deal with matters in this place, that young people can have confidence in our democratic process and may wish to become part of it in due course. We need to let them know that casting a vote will make a difference. I say to those who are 16 and 17 now that if the next general election comes when we expect it&#151;sadly, that is two years away&#151;they will then have the right to vote. I sincerely hope that they will have a real choice on how to make a change for a better Britain; my hon. Friends and I will do all we can to bring that about.</p>

Is it the bit of the cross that goes from left to right or the bit that goes from right to left? That is what a vote is&#151;it is a pretty simple act. <i> [</i><i> Interruption.</i><i> ]</i> It is an important act&#151;of course it is&#151;but it is not difficult; people of all ages make decisions on their feelings about what is important to them.

 The hon. Gentleman clearly thinks that 16 is the right age to be able to vote, but no lower, so I hope that he will explain why a 15-year-old does not have the necessary qualities. Are they too ignorant? That is the logic of what he has been throwing at me and my hon. Friends. We have all met people of younger than 16 who have opinions and are very articulate, but that does not mean that they should all have the vote.</p>

 That is not the logic of what I am saying. I agree that there should be a cut-off point, which in my opinion is clearly 16. I agree with the hon.

 In a democracy, there is nothing to stop people arguing for what they want, but there are some clear indicators that 16 is the cut-off point where the vote should be granted&#151;leaving school, for example.</p>

 Unfortunately, as we have seen, particularly in the past 10 years, many people leave school at the age of 16 who still do not even understand the basics of reading, writing and arithmetic. The fact that they leave school at 16 should be no basis for the hon. Gentleman&#146;s argument. My 14-year-old daughter Lily is a particularly sophisticated person when it comes to politics. Under his argument, why should she not have the vote? I still do not understand his argument.</p>

 Leaving school is one of the factors in my argument, but I point out to the hon. Gentleman the young lad whom I saw yesterday in the Select Committee on Work and Pensions. We were holding an inquiry into carers, and this young man was a carer who had cared for his parent, a very ill woman. He is not as bright as the girl whom the hon. Member for Epping Forest is going to employ&#151;he will not have the same academic qualifications&#151;but he will have grown up through that role. He has now left school and is going on to college, and I think that he was mature enough to have the vote at 16. Leaving school is just one of the indicators, but it is an important one because it leads us to the next one. People can start work at that age, and the point about no taxation without representation comes into play.</p>

 Again, my hon. Friend has just shot down his argument in flames. Are we not as a Government trying to legislate to keep people in education until the age of 18? He is arbitrarily using the leaving age of 16, but increasing the age to 18 justifies the voting age remaining at 18.</p>

 I do not think that my hon. Friend has understood what the Government are proposing. The Government are not proposing to keep all children in school until they are 18, but to give them other training courses at colleges and the like. My point is that we often put work and skills, or work and full-time education together. Once we get into that area&#151;and it comes into play at 16&#151;there should be an eligibility to vote.</p>

 The point made by the hon. Member for North Durham (Mr. Jones) is important. Only 5 per cent. of 16-year-olds and 17 per cent. of 17-year-olds are employed and paying income tax, while 89 per cent. of 16-year-olds and 68 per cent. of 17-year-olds are still in education. The idea that everyone leaves school at 16 and should get the vote just does not hold water.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o136"><a name="80606-0010.htm_para0"><a name="080606136000445">The question is whether society is yet ready, and there are two factors involved in answering that question. The first is whether young people are agitating for such a change. I would have to admit that the Opposition are right in saying that there is not enough agitation among 16 and 17-year-olds for this change. The other factor is the role of Parliament. Many people have said today that we should take a lead. As a minimum, we have to have the debate, but as it continues, I think that attitudes will change and we will become much more supportive of that change.</p>

 Before the hon. Gentleman leaves the point about a change occurring at the age of 16, let me point out that a positive effort is made to change the nature of teaching for those who continue in education or training after 16. It is not the same as learning by rote. Another leap occurs when young people go on to university. There is acknowledgement of the change that occurs at 16.</p>

 When is somebody an adult? If the hon. Gentleman thinks that 16 is the right age, should not people be able to drink and smoke at that age? When I refer to &#147;Pulp Fiction&#148;, I do not mean the next Labour manifesto, and when I mention &#147;Reservoir Dogs&#148;, I do not mean Government Back Benchers; the reference is to two movies that 16-year-olds would not be allowed to see.

 I have said that there are many inconsistencies. People are not allowed to take drugs at any age. Does that mean that one is never an adult and can never have the vote? The inconsistencies need to be tackled. A good point was made earlier about what is best for public health.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o137"><a name="80606-0010.htm_para1"><a name="080606136000451">A general indicator of adulthood should be the age at which people have the vote. People can leave school, go to work, pay taxes, join the armed forces, get married and have sex the age of 16. I was worried by the implications of the argument that the hon. Member for Forest of Dean presented and I intervened on him. We rightly have strong laws about sex with children, who could be taken into care if they have sex. However, according to the principle that he enunciated, if one is a child at 16 and 17, people could get married and be done for child sex.</p>

 Although the Sexual Offences Act 2003 provides a general right of consent to have sex for those aged between 16 and 18, sex is not allowed with someone who is in a position of trust over them.

Some systems are quite corrupt there. Our citizenship education should encourage youngsters to take part. The best way of doing that is to give them a vote to make participating realistic.</p>

We always used to say, &#147;If they know they&#146;re going to work and they&#146;ve got a future, they&#146;ll do better at school.&#148; The same applies with citizenship education. If young people know that they have a vote and can take part at an early age, they will do well in that subject and schools will be incentivised to ensure that citizenship and civics education reaches a higher standard.</p>

If youngsters had had the vote and we had been forced to listen to them, we would have legislated and put the money into that approach much sooner than we have done. It is important that youngsters can put forward what they want and what they think is right.

 The hon. Gentleman has made that point a number of times today. However, everyone on the other side of the argument has said that 16 seems to be a reasonable point at which to be able to choose to do some of the things that are not harmful, and potentially beneficial, for 16-year-olds to do, as opposed to some of the more harmful things, which are left until the age of 18.</p>

We have heard about some of the responsibilities, burdens and freedoms of adulthood that are conferred at the age of 16. These arguments have been well rehearsed, but they do not lose impact through repetition. Some of the greatest adventures in life begin at 16, if young people can wait that long; not all do. We judge people of that age to be mature enough to make big choices. This is not just about getting married and having babies, although I can think of no greater responsibility than bringing a child into this world. It is also about safer sex and about young people&#146;s own sexuality. With their parents&#146; consent, they can select a partner for life, get married or enter into a civil partnership. We want them to lay the foundations for their future at that age. They can choose their A-level and AS-level subjects, or their professional qualifications.</p>

We can truly represent the people only when the people whom we represent elect us and, for that to happen, I would argue that we should be elected by the widest possible group. However, we must also consider the issue of legitimacy. As I said earlier, 16-year-olds pay income tax. Is it really right for us to tax a group of people whom we exclude from voting? Our Parliament learned the hard way the consequences of taxation without representation. Not allowing 16 and 17-year-olds to have their say is a complete abrogation of that principle, and seriously undermines our authority to govern. I have not heard a single person who has argued against lowering the voting age argue simultaneously that we should raise the age at which income tax is taken. As we have heard from all quarters, if a young person is mature enough to pay tax, he or she is mature enough to vote.</p>

This year we celebrate the 90th anniversary of votes for women, and I looked through the record of debates in the House to see if I could find any parallels with today&#146;s discussion. I was taken with Sir Frederick Banbury&#146;s comments on why women should not be allowed to vote. He said:</p>

 The hon. Lady is making a completely fallacious comparison. Women were imprisoned, and, in some cases, they were tortured and they died.

 There is a direct parallel, because the main reason cited for not giving women the vote was that they were dependent, and nearly all the arguments that we have heard today for not giving the vote to 16-year-olds, as opposed to 18-year-olds, have been that between young people between the ages of 16 and 18 are still, in some way, dependent.

 I thank my hon. Friend for making such an important contribution. Young people lack experience, but I am not sure that that is the right bar to voting; quite a lot of older people lack experience. Political opinion evolves as we get older, and a significant proportion of people in their 40s vote differently from how they did when they were in their 20s. That might be because of changes in their family situation or personal circumstances. We accept that sort of evolution&#151;unless it starts at 16.</p>

There is a chronic disconnection between Westminster and young people, and in some ways we need them and their input, in a democratic way, more than they need us. A voting system based on patronising paternalism does nothing to build desperately needed bridges with our youth, and it is arguable that if we continue to treat young people as children, they will continue to act like children.</p>

I had the privilege some years ago to welcome the first new youth member of my party in my constituency, which was not known for the number of young people who take an interest, but we now have an effective youth section.

 I agree, and I mentioned earlier my experience when I am interviewed by young people at school. One of the clear themes is their concern about international development issues, and the environment also plays a big role in young people&#146;s attitudes. Whether that happens at the age of 16 or 18 is what we are here to judge. My experience is that young people, from a very early age&#151;much earlier than 16&#151;begin to comprehend the seriousness of these issues, and we have to judge when they are capable, as a group, to exercise some influence over the decisions taken by those who are elected to Parliament.</p>

 I will not take up all those issues, but let me take up the issue of smoking. As our understanding of the impact of smoking on health has developed and improved, society&#146;s attitudes towards smoking have changed. For example, in all those wonderful 1930s Hollywood film noir movies, the detective or lead lady would smoke a cigarette. The reality is that smoking was much more socially acceptable then. That is mainly to do with the medical evidence available to us about the consequences, rather than with any decision about the age at which things should be allowed.</p>

 I am sorry, but the argument cannot be put in that way, unfortunately. The hon.

 I could go into that. I could take the libertarian position, and say, &#147;If you want to kill yourself, please go ahead, but do not spoil things for everyone else.&#148; I do not take that view. I think that we have responsibilities to society. We have to send signals, and sometimes those signals can erect reasonably substantial barriers; that is right and proper in circumstances on which we can justify the position to the electorate.</p>

 Is not the answer to the hon. Member for North Durham (Mr. Jones) that becoming an adult starts at 16 and ends at 18? The question before us is where to place the right to vote in that process; do we place it at the start or the end of it? Placing it at one point rather than another does not have any implications for any of the other questions involved in the process.</p>

 That is the nub of the issue for us. I do not think that we will resolve it today. Clearly, there are differences in views. I accept that other people take a different view from mine and I understand that they can justify that view in various ways. That is part of the debate. It is critical that we are having the debate. As we move on, and as the debate develops and becomes more sophisticated, I hope that we will move towards the lower end of that spectrum rather than the upper end. I remain an optimist.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o169"><a name="80606-0011.htm_para13"><a name="080606136000521">Another issue that I wanted to raise was joining the forces and being sent to conflict situations. Although I accept and support the idea of the need for some guidance for 16 and 17-year-olds in the armed forces, I have two points to make in response. First, I had a cousin many years ago who was determined at the age of 16 to join the Navy. He was born and brought up in the Isle of Wight, which is right opposite Portsmouth, which has a long historic tradition of support for the Royal Navy. He was determined, against all the advice that he received from his parents. His parents gave in and allowed him to join on his 16th birthday. Within three weeks, he hated it, but he was in for four years and he had to suffer the consequences. At the age of 18, if there had been a conflict situation, he would have needed to enter into that conflict. The idea that parents will somehow prevent their children from taking decisions that go against their good advice and their wishes is not entirely accurate.</p>

 That is not the case. Just a few weeks ago I visited HMS Raleigh, the training headquarters for the Royal Navy, as part of the Defence Committee&#146;s inquiry into recruitment and retention. People can drop out throughout the 10 weeks after they join, so it is not the case now that his cousin would be there for four years.</p>

 I thank my hon. Friend. My example was a slight metaphor, if I can put it that way. I am not talking about today; I did not know what the rules were. The incident happened more than 20 years ago. I was using it only to confirm that when the decisions for 16-year-olds are taken, on almost every occasion that 16-year-old will prevail even against the advice of their parents.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o170"><a name="80606-0011.htm_para14"><a name="080606136000524">The other issue I wanted to mention is what happens when people join the Army or go into a conflict situation.

have to say to themselves, &#147;I am 16 at the moment. When I get to 18, I will be a soldier still, because you sign up for that period. If they want to send me to a conflict situation and I get wounded or killed, that is the responsibility I take on at the age of 16.&#148; That is an important issue that we cannot avoid in the attempt to suggest that those people are not taking critical decisions about their lives.</p>

 For clarity, it is not the case that if a 16-year-old joins the armed forces with their parent&#146;s consent they are then tied in. In the first six months of service, they have a statutory right to discharge, and after six months all under-18-year-olds can be discharged if they are unhappy with their service. What the hon. Gentleman is saying is not factually correct. There are some clear protections for those under 18 who join the armed forces. Clear and significant guidelines are provided to commanding officers about the level of care that they have to provide for those under 18 to recognise the special position that they are in.</p>

 I thank the hon. Gentleman. I accept that the Army and the other forces take seriously their duty of care. I would not want to question that at all. I would also not want to question those people&#146;s right over a period to leave the Army. I am suggesting that when people decide to join at 16, one assumes that, unlike my cousin, they are generally happy with their Army, Navy or Air Force experience and therefore they do not leave. They have to make a judgment at 16, and if they are happy and stay until they are 18 they might end up in a conflict situation. They do not get asked at the age of 18 to sign to say that they are happy to go into a conflict situation. That is automatic.</p>

 I am sorry to intervene again on my hon. Friend, for whom I have a lot of respect, but he is just wrong. The hon. Member for Forest of Dean (Mr. Harper) is correct. I have sat on the Defence Committee for the past seven years and spent a year on the inquiry on the duty of care for young servicemen, covering issues such as Deepcut. Our armed forces now have a duty of care that is second to none in terms of parental responsibility. Not only do they ensure that parents are involved in the training, but those leaving care and going into the armed forces must have a guardian, who has a duty of care in the two years until they pass their 18th birthday.</p>

 I defer to the superior knowledge of my two colleagues in the House, and I support the changes that have been made as a result of the events at Deepcut barracks, which had to be addressed. I fully support what has happened. I do not think that that gets away from my essential point: those people are taking essential decisions for their life at the age of 16.</p>

 It is a pleasure to follow the hon. Member for Edmonton (Mr. Love). On 23 February, I was privileged to attend as a key speaker the national conference of the United Kingdom branch of the Movement for Democratic Change in Zimbabwe, which was held at the Gladstone Park centre in the Peterborough constituency. I was among people who were crying out for democracy&#151;people who are denied democracy and the right to vote for the candidates they want to vote for. That concentrated my mind when I prepared for this debate.</p>

There seemed to be a gulf between those two meetings, because she talked not about votes for 16-year-olds, but about more prosaic but important issues for 16 year-olds in my constituency: bus services for young people, the cost of travelling by bus, the impact of school uniform grants being withdrawn, particularly on poorer families in my constituency, and the topical issue of the mosquito&#151;not the insect that buzzes around and bites, but the audible equipment that is used to scare off teenagers in city and town centres. They were the big issues; we did not talk about a desperate desire to seek the franchise and to elect Members of Parliament and local councillors at the age of 16.</p>

Does the fact that the Youth Parliament member was able to explain her concerns to my hon. Friend, who has taken those concerns to this House and explained them to other hon.

If a party states in its manifesto that it will implement a policy&#151;the Liberal Democrats are as guilty of this as anyone else&#151;such as not introducing tuition fees or holding a referendum on the significant constitutional change introduced by the Nice treaty, but does not introduce that policy once it is in power, people of all ages will be concerned. <i> [</i><i> Interruption.</i><i> ]</i> The hon.

We fulfilled our obligations as Members of this House to act for all people&#151;whether they vote for us or not, and whatever their sex, religion, race or creed. That is the key point.

 I want to take my hon. Friend back to the thrust of his argument. He drew attention to whether there was any evidence that the change proposed by the hon.

Having listened carefully to her speech and all the other contributions, and having been here since the beginning of the debate, I have not heard any evidence that the change would lead to the results that the proponents of the Bill have put forward.

Member for Cardiff, North said that in proposing the Bill, she was not in the business of driving up turnout. It seems a little disingenuous to take that view. It is all very well having warm words and buzzwords about engaging young people and involving people in the process, but there is no point in having all those aspirations if there is no demonstrable way to measure that involvement. As the academic David Denver, among many others, has made clear, the involvement of young people&#151;it is certainly the experience of those between 18 and 24&#151;is that they register and do not vote. There is no evidence that there would not be a commensurate decrease in turnout if 16 and 17-year-olds were allowed to vote. It is important that we realise that. Historically, when young people were not permitted to vote until they were 21, there were very high turnouts&#151;84 per cent. in the 1950 election, for instance.</p>

It is a sign of a healthy and mature democracy if people choose not to vote in an election. We have the ability to vote or otherwise. We should concede that people live with mass media and with other pressures of time, work and leisure apart from politics and voting, which we think so important. Do not get me wrong&#151;it is enormously important: I think of all those people throughout the world who have been imprisoned, tortured and died for the right to vote. Only last year we celebrated the abolition of slavery, and there are many liberation campaigns that we would all support. However, it is a sign of a healthy society that people can choose not to vote. It is not appropriate that we should corral to vote at the age of 16 people who are frankly not interested. That is not to say that they will not be interested in future.</p>

However, it does not necessarily follow that they assume that they must have a right to vote as a result of that activity. It is a rite of passage. My hon. Friend the Member for Forest of Dean made an important point about having a sense of pride. In 1983, when I first got my vote in the safe Conservative seat, as it then was, of South Thanet&#151;the candidate went on to do other things and took a close interest in penal affairs&#151;I went out and voted and had a sense of great pride in doing so. I was never taught civics or about civic engagement. It comes from family, from background, and from a sense that one can make a contribution.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o182"><a name="80606-0012.htm_para10"><a name="080606136000559">Low turnout among young people is about the structural changes that need to take place. Basically, they feel disconnected and that people are not listening to them. They do not feel that the system can benefit them or that it is interested in their lives, whether their gas bill, their transport or their granny&#146;s hip operation. That is the real reason&#151;it is not because they feel that they are being deliberately, institutionally disenfranchised by not having the vote at 16.</p>

<p><a name="st_o322"><a name="080606136000560"><a name="80606-0012.htm_spnew19"><a name="080606136001042"><b>Mr. Kevan Jones:</b>
 Does the hon. Gentleman agree that the mistake that we sometimes make as politicians is to refer to young people as a group as though they are all the same. Does he agree that they are as diverse and different in their opinions and interests as any other section of the population and that reducing the age to 16 would not mean that they would all vote the same way on a certain issue?</p>

<p><a name="st_o323"><a name="080606136000561"><a name="80606-0012.htm_spnew20"><a name="080606136001043"><b>Mr. Jackson:</b>
 I entirely agree. The issues that young people will be enthused and energised enough about to come to a surgery, take part in a demonstration or write a letter to their local Member of Parliament will be completely different in County Durham, in Dunbartonshire, or in the Forest of Dean. That plurality of interest is what makes our democracy strong and we have a duty to recognise that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o183"><a name="80606-0012.htm_para11"><a name="080606136000562">The tenor of the debate has shown that the case for radical change has not been made. I was expecting to hear opinion poll evidence from across the country from 16-year-olds and older voters, and indeed my hon. Friend the Member for Forest of Dean made it clear in his remarks that older voters are significantly against such a change. I think that I know why: it is because they feel that the capacity to vote and choose a Parliament of the people, which has been established since mediaeval times through the enfranchisement of the people, is a precious commodity. To give it away as lightly as a right without a responsibility devalues that precious commodity.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o184"><a name="80606-0012.htm_para12"><a name="080606136000563">The hon. Member for North Durham is absolutely correct; in my experience, as in his, older women are the most passionate and evangelical about exercising their franchise. I may not think that that is a good thing in North Durham, because they tend to vote for a party other than mine, but it is their right to vote and they understand the value of it. I am unconvinced that a young person between the age of 16 and 18 would necessarily give the right to vote the same value as an older person. That is not to say that they are ignorant or stupid, or that their views should be disregarded, but I am saying that incremental increases in knowledge, experience and wisdom come with age.</p>

 My hon. Friend makes an interesting point. I attended a good debate on this subject in my constituency among those aged between 16 and 18. They had a vote at the end of the debate, and in an audience entirely made up of under-18s, the results were split almost 50:50. Many of them did not think it appropriate that they should get the vote, even though they were taking part in a debate and were engaged in political argument. That point has been made clearly in the House today.</p>

<p><a name="st_o325"><a name="080606136000565"><a name="80606-0012.htm_spnew22"><a name="080606136001045"><b>Mr. Jackson:</b>
 My hon. Friend makes a valid point, and he leads me to a similar point. We do young people a disservice if we assume that the only way in which they can make their views known is to have the vote at 16. After a long and detailed debate, we can see that that flies in the face of evidence&#151;the age at which people can drink alcohol, view pornographic material or obtain credit, among other examples. Society makes a judgment, and then this House makes a judgment through legislation on what is appropriate for young people and children.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o185"><a name="80606-0012.htm_para13"><a name="080606136000566">I have a great deal of time for the hon. Member for Leyton and Wanstead (Harry Cohen)&#151;I would even say that he is an institution, given that he has been in the House for 25 years, but he had a slip of the tongue. In the course of his comments, he described the particular cohort that he was herding towards the ballot box as &#147;children&#148;. Sometimes we have to make a decision about children. They are not all young people, but they are children, and I think that he let the cat out of the bag.</p>

 My hon. Friend referred to the fact that the House makes a decision on this matter, and as I said in my opening remarks&#151;I was not allowed to proceed much further on the point&#151;the House has already considered the question during this Parliament. Indeed, in 2005, when the hon. Member for Bristol, West (Stephen Williams), who is no longer in his place, introduced his ten-minute Bill, the House had an opportunity to vote on the matter. The House made a decision and said that it did not think that such a change was right. This is the second time this Parliament has had such an opportunity, and I do not see it making a different decision.</p>

 That is a valid point for my hon. Friend to make; if the issue is one of such huge gravity that primary legislation is needed to alter the age of franchise, surely the Government should take it up. It is not churlish to say that if the issue is important enough to be compared to the cause of the suffragettes, it stands in poor comparison with the debates we had just a few weeks ago on abortion and stem cell research, when we had some of the best debates to take place in this House&#151;and it was a packed House. We do not have a packed House today and I suspect that that is because the Bill is a politically correct gimmick, which has no substantial evidence to support it. I am disappointed by the amount of evidence that has been presented, although I cast no aspersions on the sincerity of hon. Members who promoted and sponsored the Bill.</p>

 I am pleased to have the opportunity to deal with a matter of considerable importance to a large part of my constituency, namely the application by the doctors&#146; practice in Newick to dispense medicines from their Chailey surgery. The proposal may seem innocuous, but it has led to enormous objections in my constituency. There has been a huge furore and genuine and understandable concern about the implications of the application, were it to be approved.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o214"><a name="80606-0013.htm_para25"><a name="080606136000599">I welcome the presence of the Minister and I am sorry that she has been either pulled back to or held in London on a Friday. I am pleased to see her, given her background knowledge.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o215"><a name="80606-0013.htm_para26"><a name="080606136000600">Local parish councils, none of which were consulted about the proposals, have set out the concerns. That applies especially to Newick parish council, but Chailey and Fletching parish councils, as well as those in Barcombe, have also expressed concern. There is also a petition, which approximately 2,000 people have signed. That equates roughly to the entire population of Newick&#151;I hope that that demonstrates to the House the seriousness of the matter. If I may, I will hand the petition to the Minister when we have concluded the debate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o216"><a name="80606-0013.htm_para27"><a name="080606136000601">There are two reasons for the major anxieties about the proposal. The first is a genuine concern that the move will drive out of business the existing Lloyds pharmacy in Newick, which is well respected, performs a useful public function, is well liked and is used by people not just in Newick but in nearby villages. The view in the village, which I share, is that if the proposal goes ahead, it will fatally undermine the viability of the chemist. Not only would the village then lose the chemist, but there would be a knock-on effect on the remaining nearby shops, thereby potentially removing all retail outlets from the village, as people use the other outlets when they use the chemist. That is a genuine concern, which perhaps explains why there is such opposition to the proposals in Newick.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o217"><a name="80606-0013.htm_para28"><a name="080606136000602">The second reason is a medical reason. In the view of many people&#151;again, I share their view&#151;there will be a diminution of service if the chemist closes. The proposal for the doctor&#146;s surgery to be able to dispense medicines from Chailey in no way compensates for the extremely good service currently provided by the chemist both onsite in Newick and remotely, through the free delivery service to nearby villages.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o218"><a name="80606-0013.htm_para29"><a name="080606136000603">Let me turn to the comments that have been sent to me by residents, including Chailey parish council. I refer to Chailey in particular because the proposal, ostensibly to improve services, is to have the dispensing of pharmaceuticals at Chailey. One might therefore think, superficially, that people in Chailey would be in favour of it. However, they are totally opposed to the proposal, just as people in Newick are. It is not just those who have a chemist&#146;s shop who are opposed, but those who value the remote service provided by Lloyds.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o219"><a name="80606-0013.htm_para30"><a name="080606136000604">In Chailey parish alone, there is a residential home for disabled adults, a residential school for disabled children and a development of 24 warden-controlled  <br>

flats for older people. All those organisations are currently served by the Newick community pharmacy home delivery service. If that service were removed, the burden of arranging the collection of prescription drugs and appliances would fall on carers and wardens. That would obviously be highly regrettable, and in some cases not even possible, given the strains and stresses on those organisations.</p>

The Leyden trust, also in Chailey, operates a residential home for six disabled adults and relies on the delivery service for the supply of pharmaceuticals. The trust says that it would be difficult to release a member of staff to go on regular trips to a pharmacy to collect prescription items, in view of the intensive level of care required by the residents.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o224"><a name="80606-0013.htm_para35"><a name="080606136000609">I would suggest that those are good medical reasons why the proposal causes such grave concern in my constituency and beyond. Indeed, a member of Fletching parish council, which is in the constituency of the hon. Member for Wealden (Charles Hendry), has also contacted me, writing:</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o226"><a name="80606-0013.htm_para37"><a name="080606136000611">Chailey parish council has written to me to say that if the Newick community pharmacy were to close, residents would have to visit pharmacies in the surrounding towns, all of which are seven miles from the centre of Chailey. Interestingly, the council also notes that the Government&#146;s 2008 White Paper on pharmacies emphasises&#151;rightly, I believe&#151;the importance of the development of a wide range of community services in the local pharmacy. If this decision were to be allowed, it would seem to run contrary to the Government&#146;s direction of travel, which most people support because they want to see greater use of pharmacies in their locality.</p>

<a name="80606-0013.htm_brev3"><a name="080606136000671"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;shall refuse an application to the extent that it is of the opinion that to grant it would prejudice the proper provision of general medical services or pharmaceutical services in any locality&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o228"><a name="80606-0013.htm_para39"><a name="080606136000613">That seems to be a fair criterion to apply to these applications.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o229"><a name="80606-0013.htm_para40"><a name="080606136000614">Department of Health annexes are also referred to. The title, in gobbledegook, is HSG(92)13.FPN560. Paragraph 6 on page 37 states:</p>
<a name="80606-0013.htm_brev4"><a name="080606136000672"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;The fact that the granting of an application could lead to a reduction in the level or standard of general medical or pharmaceutical service does not, of itself, constitute prejudice to proper provision&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o230"><a name="80606-0013.htm_para41"><a name="080606136000615">That is an important paragraph, because it seems to imply that, even if there is a diminution in service, that is not a reason in itself for rejection. That is from the 1992 regulations; it might well be that the 2005 regulations have overtaken those provisions. It would be helpful to learn from the Minister whether that is the case. However, if the regulations say that a facility for local people can be reduced from its present level if, for example, a doctor&#146;s surgery applies to dispense medicines, that cannot be consistent with the Government&#146;s direction of travel. It would be useful to get an update on that point.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o231"><a name="80606-0013.htm_para42"><a name="080606136000616">There is also uncertainty&#151;perhaps it is welcome&#151;as a result of responses that were received this week in another place. My constituent, Baroness Cumberledge, raised the matter with the Health Minister, Lord Darzi. The baroness is a doughty campaigner on these matters, and has a long history of activity in the health service. However, given her political allegiance, it is probably just as well that she does not have a vote at the general election. She asked Lord Darzi about these matters, and on 2 June he replied:</p>
<a name="80606-0013.htm_brev5"><a name="080606136000673"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;If a new pharmacy opens in a controlled locality, or if an area is no longer considered rural by the PCT, GPs are required to reduce their dispensing.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o232"><a name="80606-0013.htm_para43"><a name="080606136000617">In other words, the hierarchy that the Government appear to support&#151;which I think is absolutely right&#151;seems to place the GP dispensing process in a secondary position to pharmacies. The GP process seems to have been designed to fill gaps rather than to be a rival to the pharmacies. If that is the hierarchy that the Government support, I entirely agree with it, but it seems inconsistent with the regulations that I have just quoted.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o233"><a name="80606-0013.htm_para44"><a name="080606136000618">In a second answer to Baroness Cumberledge, Lord Darzi said:</p>
<a name="80606-0013.htm_brev6"><a name="080606136000674"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;The principle of GPs dispensing has historically been seen as an exceptional measure, normally where there may not be a convenient community pharmacy and patients have no choice but to travel a considerable distance to the nearest pharmacy.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o234"><a name="80606-0013.htm_para45"><a name="080606136000619">Again, I have no objection to that. No one wants to prevent patients from having access to pharmaceuticals if there are no chemists nearby. However, that is not the situation in Newick, where there is a chemist nearby that is well supported and provides a service that is second to none. Anything that threatens that provision cannot be in the interests of patients or of the health service generally.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o235"><a name="80606-0013.htm_para46"><a name="080606136000620">Lord Darzi went on to say that, in the</p>

WA13.]</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o236"><a name="80606-0013.htm_para47"><a name="080606136000621">It would be helpful if the Minister could clarify how that fits in, although I understand that this is not part of her portfolio at the Department of Health. I am trying to understand the Government&#146;s direction of travel. Do they see GPs as a back-up to the pharmacies, as I think they should, or as potential rivals who should&#151;according to the 1992 regulations&#151;be allowed to damage the interests of pharmacies? That important point needs to be clarified, but if the Minister cannot deal with it or with any of my other points on this occasion, it would be useful if she could help me to arrange a meeting with the relevant health Minister.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o237"><a name="80606-0013.htm_para48"><a name="080606136000622">I wrote to the family health service appeal unit in Harrogate on the basis of the narrow grounds on which I understand that the regulations allow appeals to be made. Some of the points that I have made to the Minister are fairly wide, but while I feel that account should be taken of those wider points, I see a case for rejecting the application even on the narrow grounds specified in the regulations.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o238"><a name="80606-0013.htm_para49"><a name="080606136000623">In my letter I said that the proposal, if enacted, would prejudice the proper provision of pharmaceutical services for people in the Newick locality, including nearby communities such as Chailey. I noted that consideration was given to the viability of the chemist&#146;s shop on the occasion of the Robertsbridge appeal. It was obvious to me that if that were taken into account, the case for allowing this application would disappear entirely. I hoped that the appeal committee would agree to undertake a proper economic assessment to establish whether the Newick chemist would be affected before making any irreversible decision on whether to allow the application.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o239"><a name="80606-0013.htm_para50"><a name="080606136000624">The decision was flawed in another respect. No consultation whatever was conducted with the parish councils, with the district council or with me. Indeed, I was not even notified. The process appears to have taken place behind closed doors, with no reference to the local community. That is contrary to the Government&#146;s stated views on public participation, which I am happy to support. Although the regulations may not have been formally overridden, I think that, in the spirit of the regulations, consultation should have taken place. Indeed, a specific power to allow such consultation has not been used, and for that reason alone I feel that the matter deserves further consideration. If the appeal committee does consider the issue further, as I imagine it will have to, I think that&#151;particularly given the lack of consultation so far&#151;it should do so by means of an oral hearing either in Newick or in Lewes, the county town, so that local people can have their say.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o240"><a name="80606-0013.htm_para51"><a name="080606136000625">Finally, let me return briefly to the issue of GPs&#146; dispensing of pharmaceutical medicines. I understand that it was originally intended to benefit patients in areas where it was economically unfeasible for a chemist to operate. However, it seems to me&#151;and I say this advisedly&#151;to have become a money-spinner for some practices. I fear there is a danger that the narrow financial benefits to be gained by general practices will override the health benefits to the population at large. That is a wider problem, which the Government must try to straighten out.</p>

 I congratulate the hon. Member for Lewes (Norman Baker) on securing the debate. I know that this matter is causing great concern to him, to other Members and to his constituents, and he has put his case exceptionally well. He mentioned my former position in the health service. As a district nurse, I greatly valued the pharmacy and delivery services.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o241"><a name="80606-0014.htm_para0"><a name="080606136000627">Let me briefly outline the law on this matter before dealing with the position in Newick. First, the current regulations governing NHS pharmaceutical services have been in place since April 2005, and replace NHS regulatory systems that had existed in one form or another since 1948. Indeed, I understand that regulations relating to the provision of dispensing services in rural areas can be traced back as far as 1936, or possibly even earlier. The 2005 regulations implement a series of measures that were agreed between pharmacy and medical representative bodies in 2001. It is important to bear in mind that the regulations that gave rise to the PCT decision about which the hon. Gentleman is concerned are based on that accord between doctors&#146; and pharmacists&#146; representatives.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o242"><a name="80606-0014.htm_para1"><a name="080606136000628">Secondly, it is a long-established general precept, endorsed by all Governments since the NHS came into being, that doctors prescribe medicines and pharmacists dispense them. In that way, patients receive the benefit of both professions&#146; expert advice, intervention and care.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o243"><a name="80606-0014.htm_para2"><a name="080606136000629">I use the term &#147;general precept&#148; carefully. I am sure we can all agree that both medical and pharmaceutical services have developed greatly since 1948. Our White Paper &#147;Pharmacy in England: building on strengths&#151;delivering the future&#148;, which we launched in April, set out the ways in which we want pharmaceutical services to grow in the future. But it can be that a community pharmacy is simply not a viable proposition in every part of the country, especially in very rural areas. Patients need to receive their NHS-prescribed medicines promptly and efficiently, which is where the services of dispensing doctors can play a vital role. In that way, patients can pick up their medicines from the surgery&#146;s dispensary without having a possibly lengthy journey to their nearest preferred pharmacy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o244"><a name="80606-0014.htm_para3"><a name="080606136000630">In the vast majority of cases, if a patient wishes to receive dispensing doctor services, they need to live in a designated &#147;controlled&#148; locality, by which I mean that the area in which they live is rural in character and more than 1.6 km as the crow flies from their nearest pharmacy. The minimum distance of 1.6 km&#151;about one mile, as we used to say&#151;between the patient&#146;s address and pharmacy is set out in regulations, and the PCT has no discretion in this matter. I understand that the residents of South Chailey live further than that from the pharmacy in Newick.</p>

<p><a name="st_o331"><a name="080606136000631"><a name="80606-0014.htm_spnew0"><a name="080606136001051"><b>Norman Baker:</b>
 Let us be clear that the residents live further than that from the pharmacy in Newick, but, obviously, not further from the proposed dispensing point, which is the one to which they are objecting.</p>

<p><a name="st_o332"><a name="080606136000632"><a name="80606-0014.htm_spnew1"><a name="080606136001052"><b>Ann Keen:</b>

approval from the PCT, which is known as outline consent. Where a PCT receives such an application, it invites views from interested parties locally, including medical and pharmacy contractors and their representative bodies, and the local patient and public involvement forum, as was. Such bodies have now been replaced by the local involvement network. The PCT can also seek views from other interested public, consumer and community groups, but whether it does so is for it to decide. The minimum notice period within which representations need to be made to the PCT is 45 days, after which it reaches a decision on the application.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o245"><a name="80606-0014.htm_para4"><a name="080606136000633">Any such decision can be appealed to an independent body&#151;the NHS Litigation Authority&#151;by those who are statutorily entitled to make an appeal. In this instance, an appeal can be made by interested local contractors who made representations to the PCT. The right of appeal does not extend to the general public. I want to emphasise that the NHS Litigation Authority is independent; it is independent of the PCT, local contractors and local interests.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o246"><a name="80606-0014.htm_para5"><a name="080606136000634">Let me turn now to the situation in Newick. I am advised by my officials that the local GP practice applied to provide dispensing pharmaceutical services at its branch surgery in South Chailey. Details of the application were circulated to interested parties locally, but I understand that that did not include the local patient and public involvement forum. I feel for the hon. Gentleman, because he was not consulted, and sympathise with the points he raised. The decision is ultimately made by the PCT, but I accept that the provision of new dispensing facilities is a change that the PCT should consider in relation to its obligations to consult. I understand that this was a genuine mistake on the part of East Sussex Downs and Weald PCT which, in the circumstances, is to be regretted. However, that is what happened, and apologies should be made.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o247"><a name="80606-0014.htm_para6"><a name="080606136000635">The hon. Gentleman will be pleased to hear that I have received assurance that the PCT has amended its process to ensure that the local involvement network and the local parish council will, in future, be notified about such applications as a matter of course. I understand that the PCT subsequently approved the application, and that details of the approval were notified to interested parties on 30 April.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o248"><a name="80606-0014.htm_para7"><a name="080606136000636">I understand that details of that approval have caused widespread local concern about the future effect on the existing pharmacy in Newick; indeed, Baroness Cumberlege raised the issue recently in the other place and she has tabled a question about it this week. Her championing of such issues is well known in the health service.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o249"><a name="80606-0014.htm_para8"><a name="080606136000637">I understand that an appeal against the PCT decision was last week lodged with the appeal unit of the NHS Litigation Authority. The appeal unit has yet to decide whether to hold an oral hearing, as the hon. Gentleman is seeking today. It would be inappropriate for me to comment on the actual details of this case, but I would like to outline the usual procedure that is followed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o250"><a name="80606-0014.htm_para9"><a name="">The first stage in all appeals is for the appeal unit to invite written views from those entitled to make representations. I understand that it will do so as soon as possible. The appeal unit will then decide whether to hold an oral hearing. If it does, it will convene an expert appeal panel. This will afford the opportunity to those contractors who have made representations to put their case across at the hearing.</p>

In light of that, I hope that the House will agree that it would be wholly inappropriate for me to give an opinion on this matter.
