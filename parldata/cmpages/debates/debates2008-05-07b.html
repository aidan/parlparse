 In Budget 2008, the Government committed to a transitional gift aid rate of 22 per cent. for three years, worth &#163;300 million to the sector, which was widely welcomed.

 My hon. Friend is right. The Government have a good record on gift aid. Gift  aid receipts were &#163;385 million in 1996-97 and were  &#163;830 million in the latest year for which figures are available. The transitional relief that we have been able to provide has been widely welcomed by the charitable sector. My hon.

EU legislation also poses barriers, although I will look into the point that she makes. My feeling, from talking to people in the charitable sector, is that the argument has moved on.

fact that we can do much more to promote payroll giving. Outside work is being done on how payroll giving can be reformed to make it more attractive for people to take up, because there is nothing like having people committed to giving to a charity through their payroll. It means that the charity has some certainty about the income that it will receive. I would welcome any suggestions that my hon.

 Relate is a fantastic charity that offers a valuable service in many of our constituencies.

 I am struck by the thought that some intergenerational volunteering might not be amiss for the hon. Gentleman. &#147;V&#148; is short for volunteering. He will be glad to know that young people are getting cash to support their projects through v cashpoint, are getting involved in local projects through v involved, and are having a great time contributing to building their communities through v teams. Perhaps he might like to go down to his v volunteer centre and offer to educate himself about the contribution that young people are making through those very innovative schemes.</p>

The changes that we announced in the Budget&#151;not just the transitional relief for gift aid but changes to rules on auditing and record-keeping&#151;are specifically designed to help small charities, which often get small donations and find that there is a lot of complication and bureaucracy involved in claiming gift aid.

In fact, the Labour Government&#146;s achievement in developing council housing post-1945 was perhaps our greatest contribution to public health. The House will welcome the millions and billions that are to be spent on housing, but a great proportion of that money should go directly to local authorities, where it will be well spent helping to reduce the historic waiting lists.</p>

There is anecdotal evidence of some confusion, which means that potential volunteers and, indeed, young volunteers are being checked unnecessarily, and that acts as a barrier to participation. I am therefore pleased to be able to tell the House that we will produce clearer guidance to voluntary organisations about volunteering, about when, and when not, to recheck individuals and about alternatives to checking such as seeking references, which, I hope, will reduce the barriers that my hon.

 With permission, Mr. Speaker, I would like to make a statement on the classification of cannabis. In July 2007, my right hon. Friend the Prime Minster announced that we would seek the advice of the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs, as we are obliged to do by statute, on the classification of cannabis. I am grateful to the council for its work, and I have placed a copy of its report in the Library of the House. In reaching my decision, I have also taken into account the views of others, particularly those responsible for enforcing the law, and the public&#151;58 per cent. of whom, according to a survey carried out for the council, favour upgrading cannabis from class C.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o16"><a name="80507-0004.htm_para0"><a name="08050765000178">Cannabis use is falling significantly across all age ranges, and this is a testament to the success of the Government&#146;s drug strategy. However, I am concerned to ensure that the classification of cannabis reflects the alarming fact that a much stronger drug, known as skunk, now dominates the cannabis market. I want it to be clearly understood that this powerful form of cannabis is an illegal and harmful drug.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o17"><a name="80507-0004.htm_para1"><a name="08050765000179">Today I am publishing the results of a study undertaken with 23 police forces across England and Wales. This provides clear evidence that skunk now makes up 80 per cent. of street-seized cannabis, compared with 30 per cent. in 2002. Furthermore, its potency has increased nearly threefold since 1995. The advisory council&#146;s report confirms that cannabis use poses a real threat to health. The council is concerned about its use among young people, and points to growing evidence of a causal link, albeit a weak one, between cannabis use and psychotic illness.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o18"><a name="80507-0004.htm_para2"><a name="08050765000180">The council acknowledges that use of stronger cannabis may increase the harm to mental health. Young people may be more at risk if they first use it at an early age, and the council refers to the average age of first use being 13. It suggests that some young people might &#147;binge smoke&#148; to achieve the maximum possible intoxication, in the same way as some treat alcohol, and it concludes that if they do, the consequences</p>
<a name="80507-0004.htm_brev0"><a name="08050765001793"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;may be very serious to their mental health&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o19"><a name="80507-0004.htm_para3"><a name="08050765000181">The council also believes that the evidence of the impact of stronger cannabis may not be clear for some years to come. It has recommended that cannabis remain a class C drug.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o20"><a name="80507-0004.htm_para4"><a name="08050765000182">I have given the council&#146;s report careful consideration. Of its 21 recommendations, I accept all bar those relating to classification. I have decided to reclassify cannabis, subject to parliamentary approval, as a class B drug. My decision takes into account issues such as public perception and the needs and consequences for policing priorities. There is a compelling case for us to act now rather than risk the future health of young people. Where there is a clear and serious problem, but doubt about the potential harm that will be caused, we must err on the side of caution and protect the public. I make no apology for that. I am not prepared to wait and see.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o21"><a name="80507-0004.htm_para5"><a name="08050765000183">To reflect the more serious status of cannabis as class B, I am clear that a strengthened enforcement approach for possession is required. As the Association of Chief Police Officers said last week:</p>
<a name="80507-0004.htm_brev1"><a name="08050765001794"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Should the decision be taken to reclassify cannabis, we would expect to see increased robust enforcement activity particularly in cases involving repeat offenders or where there are aggravating circumstances.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o22"><a name="80507-0004.htm_para6"><a name="08050765000184">I firmly believe that while our response must remain proportionate and offer discretion to police officers, a system of escalation is necessary. I have therefore written to ACPO today, seeking its views on a clear and workable system of escalation that is consistent with reducing police bureaucracy and maintaining discretion. That will include considering cannabis warnings, which were introduced by ACPO in 2004 to ensure that action was taken when someone was found in possession of cannabis. Prior to that, the police had to choose whether to make an arrest or to take no action. I am not against cannabis warnings, but I believe that it is unacceptable for someone to receive more than one warning and for that warning not to be properly recorded.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o23"><a name="80507-0004.htm_para7"><a name="08050765000185">I am fully aware that the system we adopt will be delivered by those on the front line, and I have asked ACPO to involve other police organisations and criminal justice partners in developing its proposals. The new approach to enforcement will not, of course, preclude officers from immediately effecting arrest. For those under 18 caught in possession, I am content that the current procedure, which uses a reprimand, a final warning and then charge, provides an appropriate escalation mechanism.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o24"><a name="80507-0004.htm_para8"><a name="08050765000186">In the last few years we have seen a massive growth in the commercial cultivation of cannabis in the UK. This cannot be tolerated. We know that the &#147;cannabis farms&#148; are controlled by organised criminals who stand to make large profits and who, as the Child Exploitation and Online Protection Centre has found, will stoop to using trafficked children on such premises. Reclassifying cannabis will help to drive enforcement priorities in shutting those farms down.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o25"><a name="80507-0004.htm_para9"><a name="08050765000187">ACPO and the Serious Organised Crime Agency are responding to this threat. There is a dedicated ACPO lead on cannabis cultivation and it is working with SOCA on a co-ordinated, targeted and robust approach to cannabis farms. That involves building a national profile of these criminal activities, using forensic and other intelligence to make the links between individual farms and organised criminal gangs. We must also focus on other ways to combat the problem. Energy suppliers are currently losing significant revenue through abstraction by organised gangs running cannabis farms. I have today written to the chief executives of the six largest energy suppliers, asking them to work with us to identify abuse and target those groups.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o26"><a name="80507-0004.htm_para10"><a name="08050765000188">We have already introduced statutory aggravating factors where supply is made on, or in the vicinity of, school premises, and where a courier under the age of 18 is used. I accept the advisory council&#146;s recommendation for additional aggravating factors to be introduced concerning the supply of drugs in the vicinity of colleges and universities, mental health institutions and prisons.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o27"><a name="80507-0004.htm_para11"><a name="08050765000189">I also accept the council&#146;s recommendation for  more effective regulation of the trade in cannabis paraphernalia. It is unacceptable for cannabis use to be  <br>

glamorised in any way. We will work with ACPO to look at how existing legislation and powers can be used by the police, local authorities and other partners to curtail the sale and promotion of such items.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o28"><a name="80507-0004.htm_para12"><a name="08050765000190">As the council makes clear, this is an important public health issue, and one that a change in classification alone will not resolve. Through campaigns such as the &#147;Frank&#148; campaign, we will continue to make the public aware of the health harms associated with cannabis use. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Health will also ensure the following: that we update our messages on the harms caused by cannabis; that we look into providing more advice on the health risks and where to get help through NHS Direct, NHS Choices, the Smoking Helpline, Drinkline and other public information points; that we publish a report on the health risks associated with smoking cannabis and tobacco, and, where appropriate, include advice on cannabis misuse in NHS smoking cessation services; and that we seek the advice of the four UK chief medical officers on what more needs to be done to reduce the risks to public health.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o29"><a name="80507-0004.htm_para13"><a name="08050765000191">My decision to reclassify cannabis is part of the relentless drive to tackle drugs and the harm they bring to families and communities, and I will seek to do that by the end of the year. This is the right action to protect the public, particularly the future health of young people and the most vulnerable, and I commend this statement to the House.</p>

<p><a name="st_o110"><a name="08050765000192"><a name="80507-0004.htm_spnew1"><a name="08050765002004"><b>David Davis (Haltemprice and Howden) (Con):</b>
 I thank the Home Secretary for giving me advance sight of her statement. First, may I say that I fully support the Government&#146;s decision to upgrade the classification of cannabis to class B, even if their decision to do so has come rather late? The Government&#146;s historically lax approach to drugs has been a hallmark of our broken society under Labour. The UK has the worst level of overall drug abuse in Europe. Drug crimes have increased by almost a half under this Government, and Britain has the highest rate of teenage cannabis abuse in the European Union. We all hope that today&#146;s statement means that the Government now recognise that cannabis is a very dangerous drug&#151;that it wrecks lives, is a gateway to harder drug abuse and fuels crime. </p>

<p><a name="stpa_o30"><a name="80507-0004.htm_para14"><a name="08050765000193">Let us examine the hard facts. As the Home Secretary intimated, since the 1970s the strongest psychiatrically damaging component of cannabis&#151;THC&#151;has increased by about four or five times in skunk cannabis, and the other chemical composition of the cannabis may have altered in a way to exacerbate the psychiatric harm. A survey of 35 studies published in <i> The Lancet </i>medical journal concluded that modern cannabis users are 40 per cent. more likely to develop psychotic illness. Certainly the number of anti-psychotic drugs prescribed to young people has doubled in the last decade.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o31"><a name="80507-0004.htm_para15"><a name="08050765000194">Much of this information has been known for years, so does the Home Secretary accept that, on the grounds of psychiatric damage alone, the 2004 decision was an utterly avoidable mistake? The Government&#146;s decision in January 2004 to downgrade cannabis sent out precisely the wrong message, by encouraging the public and impressionable young people to believe that cannabis did not cause serious harm and would not be taken seriously by the police.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o32"><a name="80507-0004.htm_para16"><a name="08050765000195">Last week, the Prime Minister&#151;I am glad to see that he is still present&#151;said about cannabis-taking that</p>
<a name="80507-0004.htm_brev2"><a name="08050765001795"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;we really have got to send out a message to young people&#151;this is not acceptable.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o33"><a name="80507-0004.htm_para17"><a name="08050765000196">Does the Home Secretary accept that the downgrading of cannabis by her predecessor in 2004 sent entirely the wrong message both to young people and to the police force? Does she recognise that since that reckless decision, the number of cannabis factories, to which she referred, has more than doubled? Furthermore, the number of adults treated for cannabis abuse has increased by 51 per cent.; hospital admissions for mental illness connected with cannabis have risen by nearly a quarter; and cannabis has served as a gateway to even more harmful drugs, with class A drug abuse increasing by 43 per cent. in the past year alone. Does she accept that the effect of the policy change has been to increase the size of the cannabis market and to damage, if not destroy, many more young lives?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o34"><a name="80507-0004.htm_para18"><a name="08050765000197">This long-awaited U-turn has followed delay, dithering and indecision, when the country cries out for leadership. As the Prime Minister is sitting here, I have a question for him. He announced his intentions on this policy a year ago, but in the meantime, he wasted a year by handing it to an advisory body, which he has now ignored. The Home Secretary told us in her statement that that was required by statute&#151;but I am unaware of any statute that required them to take a year to consider evidence that has been around for half a decade. On the Home Secretary&#146;s own figures, 2,000 new cannabis factories will have started up during that delay, and thousands of young people will have become addicted to cannabis unnecessarily. In due course, many will end up on hard drugs or in hospital unnecessarily, all because this Government could not make up their mind.</p>

 I welcome the right hon. Gentleman&#146;s support for my statement. However, I must take issue with his suggestion that, somehow or other, we have taken a lax approach to drugs in this country over the past 10 years: we have not. That is why drug use is falling; that is why we have doubled the number of people able to get drug treatment; and that is why, as a result, the acquisitive crime most closely linked to drug use has fallen by 20 per cent. All that is due to the decisions and the success not only of the Government&#146;s drugs strategy, but of many people working in both law enforcement and drug treatment services. They should be recognised for their efforts in supporting that strategy,</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o35"><a name="80507-0004.htm_para19"><a name="08050765000199">I agree with the right hon. Gentleman about the links to mental health. It is precisely the relationship between the increased strength of cannabis, particularly skunk, and, as the advisory council points out, the potential future danger of young people, in particular, binge smoking it, and the uncertainty, at least, about the resulting impact on their mental health that have driven today&#146;s decision.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o36"><a name="80507-0004.htm_para20"><a name="08050765000200">However, the right hon. Gentleman then accuses the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs of delaying the decision. That body was set up under the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971, and when considering the reclassification of a drug, it is a statutory requirement to take advice from it. As I said in my statement, I thank the advisory council not only for the 21 recommendations that it has made today, the vast majority of which I support and  <br>

What steps is she taking with her Cabinet colleague the Secretary of State for Children, Schools and Families to ensure that his Department works with the Home Office to get the message across to young people about the need to discourage cannabis use? What new resources will she allocate for that purpose?</p>

 My right hon. Friend makes an important point, especially about young people. We are allocating more than &#163;6 million this year, partly to the &#147;Frank&#148; campaign, which has proven very successful, with a high rate of recognition among young people, and in increasing by 12 percentage points the number of young people who now recognise that cannabis impacts on mental health. The drugs strategy, published at the end of February, made it clear that, together with my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Children, Schools and Families, we will work closely with parents through a new coalition of family charities; improve the information and guidance available to all parents; and continue to provide important drug advice through &#147;Frank&#148;, and also through improving universal education and information for children and young people about drugs, alcohol and other volatile substance misuse. That drugs strategy, together with the proposals that I have set out today, forms a coherent approach that sees reclassification as the start of the process, not the end. It also takes seriously the responsibility to ensure that the public health messages sent to young people and others are communicated clearly.</p>

 The right hon. Gentleman has taken a clear evidence-based approach to this issue. He is right to say that we need to ensure that when people are sent to prison we emphasise the need to help them to get off drugs. That is why we have brought about a tenfold increase in investment in and provision of drug treatment in prison. It is also why it is already the case that when young people are stopped and found to be in possession of drugs, they are referred to the youth offending team and assessed for the support that they need to get off drugs. It is also why, in the drugs strategy published at the end of February, we were clear that abstinence should be the aim of drug treatment&#151;but that with many serious drugs the addiction is a chronic illness, from which it may take between five and eight years to recover. Abstinence should of course be the aim, and the additional investment that we have put into drug treatment has ensured that it is now far more successful.</p>

 This will be hailed as another tough policy&#151;but, sadly, tough policies have never worked. We have the worst drug problem in Europe, alongside the harshest penalties. I urge my right hon. Friend to look at the new convention on drugs accepted by the Council of Europe, which seeks to move the emphasis away from the criminal justice system and locking people up for using drugs, towards systems that work&#151;the health outcomes. We have a good record in recent years in concentrating on the health outcomes, but we have had 37 years of tough policies. When can we have an intelligent policy?</p>

 My hon. Friend, too, has taken a consistent position on this issue. My only disagreement with him is that I do not think that we need to make a choice between enforcement and the emphasis on treatment that he advocates. Both the previous drugs strategy&#151;over the past 10 years&#151;and the newly published strategy enable us to send out a tough message on enforcement and to invest in prevention and treatment.

 On the right hon. Lady&#146;s first point, I must point out that notwithstanding the decision to reclassify in 2004, cannabis use has continued to fall, because of other actions that we took.

ACPO has suggested those as a possible way to escalate the enforcement response to possession, and I hope that it will hear her words, and what I have said about the issue.</p>

A lot of good work has been done across the country by police forces and others. I accept what my hon.

I dispute the suggestion that the decision is not based on evidence. As I have outlined, the decision is based not inconsiderably on the evidence that I have produced today from the survey that we commissioned of police forces about the strength of skunk, linked to what the advisory council has identified as a potential and serious threat arising from the relationship between young people binge smoking and much more potent and stronger cannabis. Of course, in making my decision I needed to bear in mind the impact on police priorities. A reclassification from class C to B will be likely to drive police priorities and sentencing when it comes to drug dealing and cultivation. I also needed to bear in mind the impact on public perception. Neither police priorities nor public perception are part of the remit of the advisory council.</p>

 First, we have long known that the classification of cannabis arouses both controversy and differing views. The hon. Gentleman and his colleagues seem to be suggesting that there is a single, simple and objective scientific view on the matter, but there is not and their approach undermines the knowledge that he usually displays about scientific matters. In addition to the evidence in the advisory council report, it is perfectly reasonable to take into consideration evidence and views about police priorities and public perception. That is what I have done, and I believe that it will provide a route for the police to prioritise&#151;as they should&#151;action against serious organised crime based on dealing. With respect to possession, I have asked the police to find ways that will help to provide the escalation that I have talked about in a way that is workable and reduces bureaucracy. I believe that it will be possible to do that.</p>

 When a Minister says that a policy is designed to send out a signal, that is a sure symptom that it contains no substance, as the Home Secretary should be aware. She will know that I take a view that is very unpopular on both sides of the House&#151;that the key substantive goal is to break the link between the supply of cannabis and the supply of hard drugs, and to stop driving soft drug users into the arms of hard drug pushers. Is there anything in her statement that addresses that issue? Has she considered the evidence from Holland, where far fewer people move from cannabis to hard drugs, because they get cannabis from people who do not push hard drugs?</p>

 In Holland, of course, the policy is being reviewed, because of a lack of success. I did identify the point made by the advisory council about whether cannabis was a gateway drug. The council&#146;s view, and that of others, tends to be that it is not a significant gateway drug, so the decisions that I have announced today are based largely on the certain danger to health from the use of cannabis, on the very considerable risks extending into the future attached to the relationship between cannabis use and mental health problems, and on the certain link to serious organised crime. Given those considerations, I believe that the reclassification of cannabis is right. I do not feel that I have to apologise for wanting to send a clear message or signal about the danger of cannabis&#151;although, as I have spelled out today, that will of course be backed up by extremely practical actions to maintain our commitment to keeping cannabis use in this country on a downward trend.</p>

 Now that the Home Secretary has taken this important decision, may I urge her to consult the Secretary of State for Children, Schools and Families and leading campaigners against the illegal use of drugs among children? They should look carefully at how drugs education in schools can be improved, so that young people get real warnings about the consequences of drug use. Will she also take a fresh look at the website &#147;Frank&#148;? Sometimes it can trivialise the subject, and make it look like a bit of a joke.</p>

 I have already discussed the matter with my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Children, Schools and Families. The hon.

However, I disagree with her about &#147;Frank&#148;: the site has had considerable success in getting traction with young people, and in increasing the proportion of young people who recognise that there is a link between cannabis and mental health problems.

 As a parent and someone who had not been elected to this House in 2004, may I say that I greeted the downgrading of cannabis with some bemusement? The Government downgraded cannabis but kept its possession a criminal offence. Does the Home Secretary accept that allowing criminals to control the strength of the substance being supplied to young people meant that it was inevitable that they would get a bad lot? I am pleased by the regrading, but will she elaborate on what she said in her statement about what she called the glamorisation of cannabis paraphernalia? Is she seriously suggesting that we should criminalise people for wearing t-shirts or pendants decorated with leaves? What will happen to the people who provide that merchandise?</p>

 No, I am not suggesting that but, as a parent, I do not want head shops on my high street. They have cannabis leaves in the window and flog the stuff that people use to consume cannabis. In my book, I do not want them in my neighbourhood. I do not think that anyone else should. The advisory council was clear about that, and that is why I want to work with local authorities and the police to close such shops down. I am sure that the hon.

 I welcome the statement made by the Home Secretary today. May I invite her to recognise that the period of time when cannabis has been a class C drug has persuaded many young people to believe that it is neither as harmful nor as illegal as it once was? I want her to focus on two things. First, in the education programme that she has mentioned, will she focus on the strength of cannabis now, so that people are persuaded that it is not the same drug that they perceived it to be during its period of lower classification? Secondly, will she have a word with the Crown Prosecution Service to ensure that, in prosecuting offences where class B drugs such as cannabis appear on the same indictment as class A drugs, it will not quietly forget about the cannabis offences?

 On a point of order, Mr. Speaker. In Prime Minister&#146;s questions, the Prime Minister said that the Scottish Government were seeking to &#147;postpone a referendum until 2010-11&#148; and that the Scottish Government were acting &#147;against its...manifesto&#148;. That manifesto explicitly set out the timetable for the referendum in 2010. In misrepresenting that fact, I fear that the Prime Minister has inadvertently misled the House. It is far from the case that the referendum is being delayed or that the manifesto promise is being broken; it is a promise that the Scottish Government intend to keep.

</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o41"><a name="80507-0006.htm_para0"><a name="08050765000254">The Gurkhas have a unique place in the history of our country and in the hearts of the British people. For around 200 years they, the bravest of the brave, have served Britain with outstanding courage and loyalty. They continue to play a vital role in today&#146;s Army, both at home and overseas. Indeed, only a few weeks ago Prince Harry paid tribute to their role in Afghanistan. Today, about 3,000 Gurkhas serve in Her Majesty&#146;s armed forces. That represents more than 3 per cent. of the British Army. Our under-strength, overstretched forces would be in a more difficult situation if it were not for the Gurkhas, yet despite their astonishing service, many former Gurkhas are treated disgracefully. To the shame of this country, Gurkhas who left  the Army before 1997 are not allowed to stay in the United Kingdom.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o42"><a name="80507-0006.htm_para1"><a name="08050765000255">My Bill seeks to amend the Immigration Act 1971 to enable Gurkhas to be granted indefinite leave to enter and remain in the UK under the category of &#147;Gurkha discharged from the British Army&#148;. It is a small, simple Bill, but one that would speak volumes. It has support in all parts of the House. To their credit, in 2004 the Government introduced changes that benefit today&#146;s Gurkhas; that is appreciated. Those who retire from the Army can now stay in the UK should they so wish, but the changes do not apply to those who left prior to 1997, because it is claimed that before that date they were based in Hong Kong and therefore were not fully part of the UK forces. That is outrageous nonsense and an insult to men who served in Her Majesty&#146;s&#151;in some cases, His Majesty&#146;s&#151;armed forces, serving the UK&#146;s interests in many parts of the world.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o43"><a name="80507-0006.htm_para2"><a name="08050765000256">It is argued, somewhat insultingly, that Gurkhas who retired before 1997 could not generally show strong enough links to the UK. The hollowness and callousness of that arbitrary cut-off date was illustrated in the most powerful way when Victoria Cross winner Tul Bahadur Pun was initially denied entry to this country, although he is a man whose loyalty and service to the UK was recognised with the award of the VC for his action in single-handedly storming a Japanese machine-gun post during the second world war, in the face of intense machine-gun fire. That act of bravery was not unique. There are countless other stories of the bravery of Gurkha soldiers who never served in Hong Kong.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o44"><a name="80507-0006.htm_para3"><a name="08050765000257">Most of our constituents have great affection for the Gurkhas.

following example. Mr. Madam Gurung served in the British Army for 24 years. He retired in 1993 and applied for the right to live in the UK, but his application was refused by the Home Office. All that he wants to do is to work as a bus driver or security guard here in the UK. He currently lives in one-bedroom accommodation in Tonbridge, where he is awaiting news of his appeal. He is prevented by law from working, and subsists on handouts from concerned friends. Is that how a man who served in the British Army for 24 years should be treated? Many other former Gurkhas are going through the same tortuous process of immigration appeals. They are destitute, in limbo, never sure of their future. Forbidden from working, they are not even second-class citizens in the country that they served so loyally for many years. They are relying on the charity of friends, comrades and neighbours. It is a disgrace that some of our former soldiers have been condemned to such a life.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o46"><a name="80507-0006.htm_para5"><a name="08050765000259">In any survey or poll, the massively overwhelming majority of citizens want the right to British citizenship extended to the pre-1997 retirees. The retired Gurkha community in this country is hard-working and entrepreneurial. The Government need have no fears about them in any way being a drain on the public purse. The reverse is the case&#151;they would be net contributors. Experience in areas where they have settled clearly shows that their hard work and high standards of citizenship add positively to our economy and our culture. The numbers involved are small given the number of people who annually migrate to the UK. It is estimated that there are about 1,000 retired Gurkhas in the UK awaiting results of appeals. Back in Nepal, it is considered that most elderly retired Gurkhas would wish to remain living there. According to best estimates, the maximum number of retired Gurkhas who may possibly want to come here is  under 10,000.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o47"><a name="80507-0006.htm_para6"><a name="08050765000260">British people are frustrated and angered by the unfairness. They do not understand why the Government will not allow a relatively small number of people, all of whom have served in the British Army for a number of years, to live here. The sentiments and provisions of the Bill transcend party politics. The Gurkhas enjoy wide support across the House and the nation. The situation is becoming more urgent by  the day. A few weeks ago, outside Parliament, I and some other Members witnessed 50 retired Gurkhas handing in their long service and good conduct medals in protest at the way in which they are being treated. There was extensive coverage of the event in newspapers and on television. The sight of such loyal, brave and dignified people being pushed to such a desperate act filled me with shame.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o53"><a name="80507-0006.htm_para12"><a name="08050765000268">The Tony Blair era of government became synonymous with spin. At the very outset of that Government back in 1997, there were huge increases in the number of special advisers; the figure more than doubled. Two special advisers in Downing street were given, completely without precedent, powers to give orders to conventional civil servants. In addition, a large number of departmental press secretaries who were already in place, and departmental heads of the information service who were permanent civil servants in the Government Information and Communication Service, were replaced with appointees who were more or less partisan.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o54"><a name="80507-0006.htm_para13"><a name="08050765000269">At the time, eyebrows were raised and mildly controversial concerns were expressed, but after all, the Government were elected with a substantial majority and nothing that was done could be said to be illegal. However, it was nakedly a sharp turn away from the conventional approach of reliance on an impartial and professional civil service. That became the hallmark of the Blair era of government&#151;the subordination of all considerations to the partisan political interests of the Labour party. In no Department was there a greater dedication to the cult of spin than in Her Majesty&#146;s Treasury. We all remember&#151;I do so vividly, as I was shadow Chancellor: one of many holders of that post&#151;the notorious double-counted spending increases in the pre-Budget report of autumn 1998, in which spending increases for the whole comprehensive spending review period were conveniently added together to give a sum much greater than that which was being spent. That was the first indication  <br>

<p><a name="stpa_o55"><a name="80507-0006.htm_para14"><a name="08050765000270">Despite that history, it is fair to say that when the Prime Minister took office in the middle of last year, there was a sigh of relief that the first announcement of the age of change was that the era of spin was definitively over. Parliament, we were told, was to be told about things before the press and the media. Spin was consigned to history&#151;a relic of the Blairite-Mandelsonist era of the past. The right hon. Gentleman said that</p>

We have worked out that on average, the media have been briefed about two announcements a week before they are made to Parliament. Often, announcements are not made to Parliament at all, even after the event. </p>

<p><a name="stpa_o58"><a name="80507-0006.htm_para17"><a name="08050765000273">What of the pledge to cut back on spin, and put the era of spin in the past? The simple truth is that there has been no reduction in the number of spin doctors and special advisers from the Blair era, or perhaps only a tiny one. The age of change turns out to be the age of no change. The publication of the White Book by the Central Office of Information, which was delayed until September last year to take account of the changes since the Prime Minister took over from Tony Blair, effectively shows that there has been no reduction at all. In fact, it took some time for the document to be published, and a number of questions from my right hon. Friends and me to elicit that information. Indeed, the Government&#146;s answers, to specific questions, Department by Department, on the scale of the spin machine are a master-class in the spinning of information to give a false impression. They exclude, for example, the majority of communications personnel, limiting the numbers to the narrowest possible definition of &#147;press officer&#148;.</p>

Advertising costs have also spiralled. The Government have spent over &#163;800 million on advertising in the past five years alone. The annual spend has quadrupled since Labour came to power. No doubt under the rigorous financial stewardship of the Prime Minister, assisted by the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster as his adviser for much of the time, it was spent immensely prudently. Is the advertising spend simply the overhang of the reckless Blairite era? No, because the figures clearly show that since the Prime Minister took over, the advertising spend has increased still further by four times the rate of inflation.</p>

Fourteen months after slipping abolition into the fine print of the Budget paperwork, the Government still cannot say what the effects of the package will be. We are told&#151;off the record, of course&#151;that the Chancellor has given a categoric pledge, but there is still, amazingly for such a supposedly substance-obsessed Government, no actual package in sight. Hence the pitiful sight of the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government on &#147;Newsnight&#148; last night fending off the most basic questions&#151;will the changes be backdated, will all the losers be compensated&#151;</p>

 Those units are meant to be accountable to the Prime Minister, but the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster may want to comment on that when he speaks. The creation of all those central departments with hundreds of personnel in them was the result of the warfare going on between the Treasury and Downing street. Because the Chancellor, as he then was, was constantly building up the Treasury&#146;s own resource to stamp his authority over the whole of domestic policy, Tony Blair was constantly trying to counter that by creating countervailing units at the centre of government. The result was that the whole thing spiralled out of control, and there are thousands at the centre of government who were not there before.</p>

It did not need delivery units or huge numbers&#151;<i> [Interruption.]</i> I hear the Secretary, Cabinet Office, the hon. Member for Corby (Phil Hope), talking about substance. We constantly hear complaints from the Government that we are not engaging on substance. I am concerned with exactly the issues of substance.

 Madam Deputy Speaker, I am simply attempting to illustrate the problems that have arisen and the complaint that we make about the Government&#146;s approach&#151;the way in which, on substantial issue after issue, spin trumps substance. They get the substance wrong. They are so obsessed with trying to get the spin and the presentation right, and doing it incompetently, that they get not only the substance wrong, but the presentation desperately wrong.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o69"><a name="80507-0007.htm_para3"><a name="08050765000292">On so many issues, decisions have been taken not with a view to the substantive merits of the argument, but on 42 days, on the income tax changes, on non-doms, on capital gains tax, ineffectively to try to wrong-foot the Opposition, rather than get the answer right. Far too much time is spent badly on presentation, and not enough time is spent on getting the substance right. The Government press on, claiming that they are slaving away solving people&#146;s problems, as the Prime Minister puts it, but that has nothing to do with the substantive need.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o70"><a name="80507-0007.htm_para4"><a name="08050765000293">Instead of the sober, steady focus on solving problems, we have seen a Prime Minister in a panic, hiring ever more spin and PR advisers to join the Downing street spin cycle. The rate of recruitment makes Tony Blair look like Gandhi. Hot on the heels of Stephen Carter from Brunswick, we saw David Muir from WPP&#151;to direct political strategy, we are told. A few days later Nick Stace was appointed to beef up, we were told, the communications team. Mark Flanagan was named the head of digital communications at  No. 10. Nicola Burdett was brought in to avoid visual gaffes&#151;definitely a full-time job. There is effectively a weekly column in <i> PRWeek</i> charting the weekly appointment of new recruits to Downing street.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o71"><a name="80507-0007.htm_para5"><a name="08050765000294">Our contention is that in the face of the relentless focus on the spin machine, the morale of the civil service is at an all-time low.

As I said, its morale is at an all-time low. Its independence has been sapped. We see a series of terrible disasters, with people&#146;s personal data being lost, the result of a civil service relentlessly exploited by Ministers for partisan advantage, at the cost of focus on the basics of good, sound administration. We see the failure to legislate, despite all the promises, to put the civil service on a proper legal basis. Despite the publication four years ago of a draft Civil Service Bill, we are now told that no legislation is likely until next year.</p>

It should always be sought, even when challenging. It should be respected, even when it is not taken. However, that, of course, would require Ministers who had a real sense of direction and purpose and who were competent and capable. At this stage, I can do no better than quote the hon.

The Bill will also incorporate the rule, set out for the first time in June 2006 in the new civil service code, that the civil service commissioners can take a complaint or concern directly from a civil servant about an issue under the code.

 Given that large numbers of civil servants are supposed to be told what to do by very small numbers of Ministers, a simple comparison between the number of special advisers and the number of civil servants does not take us very far. What matters is the amount of influence that those special advisers have. Will the Minister accept the fact&#151;and it is a fact&#151;that during the final years of the Conservative Administration most Ministries had only two special advisers; a few of the lesser Ministries, if I dare describe them in that way, had only one; and only one Ministry, namely the Treasury, had three?

 I think that we do understand how it works. I am not sure what putting it on a statutory footing would mean. The hon. Gentleman may be proposing a Prime Minister&#146;s Department; I do not think that that would be the right thing to do.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o90"><a name="80507-0008.htm_para3"><a name="08050765000343">Let me deal with some of the other allegations made by the right hon. Member for Horsham. He has this figure of 3,000 spin doctors in Whitehall, which he trots out every so often when he has nothing better to do. The true number of press officers is less than a fifth of that number. The rest, listed in what has become the infamous White Book, include those providing information to the public through publications, websites and campaigns to do with issues such as road safety, public health and smoking.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o91"><a name="80507-0008.htm_para4"><a name="08050765000344">The right hon. Gentleman did not raise the issue of quangos, which was sensible of him, because&#151;I do not want to rub salt into the wound&#151;after he lost his seat in 1992 he was appointed to a quango in 1994&#151;<i> [</i><i> Interruption.</i><i> ]</i> Unpaid, he says. Presumably, if he is worried about the accountability of quangos, he was worried about his own appointment. However, it will interest him to know that there are fewer quangos than there were in 1997.</p>

Gentleman&#146;s failure to talk about what we are doing as regards the civil service Bill and other aspects of constitutional reform. The other disappointing aspect of his remarks was that he seemed to subscribe to what I would call a &#147;golden age&#148; view of the civil service. His remarks implied that we need only preserve the civil service in aspic&#151;somewhere around the 1960s or 1970s, I guess&#151;and all will be okay. I must be honest with him about this. I do not hold to that view, not because I think we should breach the impartiality of the civil service&#151;quite the opposite; that is why we are legislating for an impartial civil service&#151;but because the challenges faced by a modern Government and civil service are enormous, and that is why the civil service needs to evolve.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o94"><a name="80507-0008.htm_para7"><a name="08050765000351">In a way, that illustrates one of the challenges for the civil service, which is to have greater awareness of delivery. A 2004 survey found that 60 per cent. of senior civil servants described their background as policy making, compared with just 25 per cent. in delivery. The current Cabinet Secretary, Gus O&#146;Donnell, is trying to put more of an emphasis on delivery among senior, and indeed junior, civil servants so that they do not spend time just on policy in Whitehall but go out to see what is happening on the ground. That is incredibly important. The first challenge that the civil service needs to rise to is that of civil servants having experience of delivery.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o95"><a name="80507-0008.htm_para8"><a name="08050765000352">The second challenge is to do more to reflect the face of Britain. There has been progress in recent years on the number of women and ethnic minorities in the civil service, but it is still not good enough&#151;the numbers are still too low. The proportion of senior civil servants who are from minority ethnic backgrounds has doubled since 1997, but it is still too low. The proportion of women has doubled, but it is still too low. I gather that the proportion of new permanent secretaries who went to state schools has doubled, but that is probably still too low as well. Labour Members think that there is further to go and that this is an important challenge for the civil service if it is to recruit the most talented, regardless of background.</p>

 I have always been amazed by the French system, where sometimes quite senior fast-track civil servants go into business, then back into the civil service, and then back out into business again.

 I completely agree with the hon. Gentleman, who makes an important point. That should apply not only to business but to the voluntary sector&#151;the third sector. I am struck by the number of civil servants who work with me and my hon. Friend the hon. Member for Corby (Phil Hope), who is the Minister for the Third Sector, with backgrounds not just in government. Some of them come from the Big Lottery Fund, some from the third sector itself, and some have experience in the private sector.

 The French situation, in which civil servants who see themselves as part of the state go into business, get some experience and come back to serve the state better, is very different from one in which people whose basic loyalty is to business come to the state sector to help business to make more money. That is much more like the situation in Britain, particularly under the recent Blair Government.</p>

really like to run a business or to be in the voluntary sector. There are many different ways in which that can be done. Senior civil servants can spend more time on the ground, gaining direct experience of different organisations, or people may come into the civil service with knowledge of those sectors.</p>

 One of the reasons there is great value in bringing private and voluntary sector people into the civil service, and in giving civil servants an opportunity to go out and come back in, is that the private and voluntary sectors tend to move much faster. They can be much more responsive to local conditions and situations and not so hidebound in their approach. Sometimes I feel that civil servants, as much as they might want to be helpful, can put roadblocks in the way of progress.</p>

 I could never possibly suggest that, but I take my hon. Friend&#146;s point. Innovation and an ability to take risks are the big challenges facing the civil service. I borrow something once said by the leader of the Conservative party about an end to Punch and Judy politics. If we are honest, part of the barrier to civil servants, Ministers and others taking risks is the sort of political and media climate in which we live. That is not to blame the media, but we need a more risk-taking culture throughout the public sector. Some things will go wrong as a result, but we would have more innovation and more things that went right and we would make a real difference to people&#146;s lives. I do not have a holy grail solution to that problem, but it is a challenge for all of us.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o97"><a name="80507-0008.htm_para10"><a name="08050765000362">We have further to go.

I am not romanticising that idea or saying that everyone who comes from the private sector or elsewhere will be better than current permanent civil servants&#151;absolutely not&#151;but it is a healthy thing that the proportion of the senior civil service recruited from outside has increased by a quarter over the past four years, from 18 to 23 per cent. That is one of the three big challenges for the civil service.</p>

It is right to introduce those reviews because they will help to improve the quality of administration in our country. The process will always give ammunition for an irresponsible Opposition, but that is just one of those things.

of with regard to what we are doing on constitutional renewal. The Constitutional Renewal Bill will make a difference to the way we are governed. For example, the innovation of pre-appointment scrutiny is a major departure for this House. A significant number of public appointments&#151;I am in discussion with the Liaison Committee about the precise number&#151;where a Minister decides on an individual will go before a Select Committee before they are confirmed so that testimony can be given, and the House will be able to report on that process. I hope that the House will use that responsibility wisely, because it is a big departure for our system of government to have the Executive held to account in this way, but it is the right thing to do. Many of the people we are talking about, from the Information Commissioner to the commissioner for public appointments play a significant role in holding the Executive to account on a whole range of appointments and in acting on behalf of the public.</p>

I suspect, however, that is not because of a lack of interest in the topic, but because the issue has been ongoing for so long that resilience concerning the hope of a civil service Bill has been worn down by repeated false pregnancies. All three major parties included a promise of a civil service Bill in their 1997 manifestos. Extensive discussions took place in 2001 and 2002, and there were two forms of draft Bill in 2004.

<p><a name="stpa_o104"><a name="80507-0008.htm_para17"><a name="08050765000370">I have to say, however, that it must be a good Bill. My hon. Friend the Member for Cambridge (David Howarth), when looking at the early drafts, used the phrase &#147;nibbling at the edges&#148;. There is an awful lot of work left to do on the Bill, and I congratulate the Public Administration Committee on taking on much of the challenge of scrutinising, questioning, monitoring and improving the quality of what we hope will be legislation in the not-too-distant future. We are left with a number of questions, which the House would like the Secretary of State to answer. I am struggling to understand why the Civil Service Commission should not be appointed and removable by Parliament, instead of being appointed by the Government. I believe that the Public Administration Committee has made a similar recommendation, and such a change would be the best guarantor of political neutrality. It would also be significant in stemming the constant tipping away of power from Parliament to Government. It would be an important step towards an appropriate rebalance.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o105"><a name="80507-0008.htm_para18"><a name="08050765000371">There are all sorts of lesser questions. Why should the commission not be able to initiate its own inquiries into breaches of the code of conduct? It strikes me as most peculiar that one should need the Government&#146;s permission to undertake an investigation of the Government. The issue of recruitment on the basis of merit was mentioned. That is obviously crucial, but should not the same standards apply to promotion or movement within the civil service? It is beyond me why that was not included. We heard quite a discussion on the issue of seconded staff a few moments ago, and on the various ways in which such secondment takes place.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o106"><a name="80507-0008.htm_para19"><a name="08050765000372">I think that the hon. Member for Luton, North (Kelvin Hopkins) touched on the general issue, especially with short-term secondments, of what mechanisms are in place to ensure that the public service ethos remains dominant when people are brought in from a business culture, which is very different. I am not saying that one cannot learn from the other, or that exchange is not beneficial. However, on 10 November 2005, Lord Butler of Brockwell told the Public Administration Committee that that sort of transfer of people</p>

 The hon. Lady mentioned ethics. I would not call myself a Platonist, but I refer to Plato from time to time. He clearly perceived a hierarchy of ethics, from those in government to those in the civil service to those in business. Does she agree that the ethics of public service should be seen to be above those of business, even though they can learn from each other?</p>

However, having been part of both worlds, I am conscious of the differences in culture. It is not necessarily an easy transition from one to the other. I believe that the business community can be tempted to perceive the process of secondment not as a strategy to help public service perform better but as an easier route to influencing and shaping. That might apply not to the individuals but to the companies from which they are seconded. I do not claim that that necessarily happens, but we should consider the possibility when we manage the process.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o108"><a name="80507-0009.htm_para0"><a name="08050765000376">Earlier, I mentioned promotion and movement in the civil service through merit and open competition. I struggle to understand why that should not form the basis of every appointment that is not of a special adviser, instead of excluding several posts. I hope that the Minister for the Cabinet Office will tackle that. Seventy is the figure that constantly floats around for the number of special advisers. That venerable journal <i> PRWeek</i>, which has dominated the debate, reported on 24 April that hordes of senior Labour special advisers were said to be passing their CVs to head-hunters and recruitment consultants amid concern that their stock was falling. Perhaps the number will fall below 70. However, that number of people, with a great deal of influence and power, can have an impact on the behaviour of several thousand. It is silly to suggest that 70 people cannot overwhelm the civil service.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o109"><a name="80507-0009.htm_para1"><a name="08050765000377">What limit should we set? Why is not there a cap or some negotiated mechanism for limiting the number? If 70 is fine, is 700 fine, or is that ridiculous? Should the number be 100? Whatever it should be, having some sort of cap would give Parliament and the public confidence that special advisers were used on an &#147;as needed&#148; basis to execute the Government&#146;s mission, and were limited to such roles.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o110"><a name="80507-0009.htm_para2"><a name="08050765000378">Although the Minister for the Cabinet Office implied that special advisers had no line management responsibility, the draft Bill does not specify that. It would therefore be good to include the prohibition of line management on the face of the Bill. Of course special advisers can commission work, and many people perceive that, if it is misused, as a form of line management. I fully accept that the Government do not intend to include a provision to repeat the Order in Council that enabled Alastair Campbell and Jonathan Powell to be appointed with special executive powers. However, taking that a stage further to ensure that there is no loophole for commissioning to spill over would be useful.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o111"><a name="80507-0009.htm_para3"><a name="08050765000379">So far, I have considered the civil service largely in the abstract. However, those of us who have been involved in the battle over Heathrow are worried about the creeping loss of neutrality in the civil service. The hon. Member for Putney (Justine Greening), through her diligent pursuit of freedom of information requests, has exposed an incredible amount of integration and co-operation between BAA and the Department for Transport in presenting what is supposedly an impartial consultation to the people of south-west London on an issue about which people care enormously. There is a genuine sense that, in its determination to pursue a Government objective, the civil service suspended its independent judgment and allowed itself to be overridden by BAA&#146;s preferences and biases.</p>

However, having lived for many years in the United States, I think that those people have completely missed the checks and balances that are an inherent part of the US system between the judiciary, the Executive and the legislature, which mean that an entirely different set of issues are confronted.

One was that it was inefficient&#151;we should not forget that the drive to make the state service more efficient was at the heart of the Northcote-Trevelyan agenda&#151;and the other was that it was corrupt and run by patronage.

The arrival of Mrs. Thatcher saw the retirement of a raft of permanent secretaries, who were replaced by people who were thought to be &#147;one of us&#148;. Because that Government were in power for a long time, the assumption was that if someone wanted to progress inside the service, being &#147;one of us&#148; was a considerable advantage.

 I tried to put the matter as fairly as I could, rather than in a partisan way. I was trying to explain that there has been a standing temptation on the part of Governments who feel a desire to shake up the system to get people in place who will enable them to do so. That was true of the Thatcher period and it was true of the Blair period, too. It is interesting that similar charges were levied in each period about the consequences of that. If we scrape away those charges and go beyond the political exchanges in those periods, the question is: was something happening to make the civil service politicised? Are politicians behaving in relation to the civil service in ways that are improper and disturbing its tradition of neutrality, independence and impartiality?</p>

 I want to follow up on the two interventions made by the hon. Member for New Forest, East (Dr. Lewis). During the Thatcher era, there was a serious philosophical, ideological change; was it not possible for someone in government to determine which side of that ideological divide a civil servant might reside? Could not they make sure, with a wink and a nod, that people on the Thatcherite side of that divide would be promoted and that those who had lingering attachments to social democracy would be marginalised?</p>

 That is an interesting observation. I was trying to argue that although such charges are made for political reasons in each period of government, they do not stand up when tested against the question whether the character of the civil service is being fundamentally altered by what is happening.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o130"><a name="80507-0009.htm_para22"><a name="08050765000404">The Select Committee on Public Administration, which I have the honour to chair, considered this issue in some detail just a year ago. We produced a report called &#147;Politics and Administration: Ministers and Civil Servants&#148;, which examined the politicisation charges made over the years. It is worth quoting a paragraph that sums up the evidence that we received. We said that:</p>
<a name="80507-0009.htm_brev6"><a name="08050765001815"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;despite the regular accusations of politicisation, Britain clearly remains singularly unpoliticised. External appointments to the senior civil service are regulated by the Civil Service Commissioners, and no witnesses suggested ministers were able to exercise significant powers of patronage. Although ministers are able to make political appointments to special adviser posts, there was broad agreement that the scale of political appointments was so small, in relation to the size of the civil service, that it did not undermine principles set out by the 1854 Northcote Trevelyan Report and, in significant respects, protected them. Moreover, in relation to appointments to public bodies, the role of ministers has actually been reduced by recent changes.&#148;</p>

It is worth having that discussion here and in any comparable political system, and there would be different answers for the different systems, all of which claim to uphold the principles of democratic politics. I remember being introduced to the Australian Cabinet Secretary, some years ago, and discovering that he was a political appointee. In Canada&#151;another Commonwealth country&#151;the permanent secretaries, whom they call deputy ministers, are all political appointees.</p>

That question can be answered in a variety of ways, and is always open to dispute. Internationally, we are at an extreme end of that spectrum, with our small element of political appointment within government. Given the arguments about this issue that we have had in this country over the years, one would think that we were right at the other end of the spectrum. Extraordinary attention has been paid to the appointment of special advisers over the years, but there is minute political involvement in government here.</p>

That argument was put forward by Sir John Hoskyns, who ran Mrs. Thatcher&#146;s policy unit for the first three years of her Conservative Government. He was an interesting man&#151;one of Mrs. Thatcher&#146;s business men and can-do people whom she brought in. He spent a year working out exactly how Britain was governed and what the problems were with that method, and put his findings in a diagram.

We want a move from a rule by prerogative to one of Parliament and statute. That is what we want to do, and it is has been quite a job getting such a Bill. It has been much promised, but not delivered, and we have been frustrated by that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o140"><a name="80507-0010.htm_para1"><a name="08050765000414">In 2004, to mark the 150th anniversary of the Northcote-Trevelyan report, we published our own Bill. I think that it was the first time in modern parliamentary history that a Select Committee had published its own Bill to show what could be done. That approach has borne fruit, because the Government then produced a draft Bill and have now produced a serious proposal to legislate with the draft Constitutional Renewal Bill.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o141"><a name="80507-0010.htm_para2"><a name="08050765000415">There will be reasons to ask the Government to strengthen the Bill in a variety of ways&#151;the hon. Member for Richmond Park helpfully mentioned some of them. I think that our Committee and the Joint Committee on the Constitutional Renewal Bill, which is going to consider the Bill, will say that the Government are on the right lines. Indeed, they are doing the right thing and are on the right lines.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o142"><a name="80507-0010.htm_para3"><a name="08050765000416">I shall end with one observation on the process. I have been considering this matter over the years to see why it has taken so long to get to this point. It is easy to attack previous Governments for inertia, but I particularly wanted to explore why the last Conservative Government decided not to legislate, despite the recommendation of the former Treasury and Civil Service Committee that they should. Discussions in that period show that the people inside the Government who were responsible for the matter were anxious, and for good reason. They did not want to disturb the essential constitutional position of the civil service and did not want to legislate in a way that would ossify the service. However, there was also a political consideration. They did not want to start down that path if it meant that the proposal simply became a matter for political dispute. It was thought that if the civil service were brought into the political arena and if agreement could not be reached, that would do more harm than good.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o143"><a name="80507-0010.htm_para4"><a name="08050765000417">David Hunt, now Lord Hunt, who was leading for the Conservative Government at the time, said, in evidence to the Treasury and Civil Service Committee on 14 June 1995:</p>

If not, they felt that it would be better not to do anything at all. That is a profound consideration.</p>

We know that we would like to put the civil service into statute and to draw some constitutional lines in the sand. The question is whether we can collectively do that without it becoming a political football.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o148"><a name="80507-0010.htm_para9"><a name="08050765000422">The motion today refers, as such things always do, to restoring trust in the political system. Our record on that could make one quite pessimistic. The truth is that, for the past 15 years, we have had an auction on trust and distrust in this country. In a sense, we started it. We quickly realised that making allegations against the Major Government brought huge political dividends. If we look at the figures, we see that it was then&#151;in the 1990s&#151;that trust really started to go down, and it has never recovered since. We piled in making all kinds of allegations about the sleazy character of Conservative politicians; then, after 1997, the Conservatives decided that, in order to equalise the balance, they had to make similar charges against us. The effect has been to pull us all down. The reputation in which we are all held has declined immeasurably during that period. In the short term, such activity might seem like good politics, but I can assure the House that it is really bad for the reputation of public life in this country.</p>

 It is a great privilege to follow the hon. Member for Cannock Chase (Dr. Wright) in addressing these matters. He interestingly went back into history and paid tribute to the Northcote-Trevelyan reforms. In many ways that might be right, as far as the integrity of the civil service is concerned, but I would advise him to read a forthcoming work on the subject that puts a wholly different complexion on whether those reforms were beneficial for the efficiency of the civil service. It is written by a civil servant&#151;a gentleman called Mike Coolican&#151;who advised me when I was at the then Department of Social Security and, no doubt, my Labour successors in due course. I urge the hon. Gentleman to put that on his reading list.</p>

That was not my experience. I remember when I first got my foot on the lowest rung of the ladder and became a Parliamentary Private Secretary to the Minister responsible for local government&#151;indeed, the Minister responsible for the abolition of Ken Livingstone, the Inner London Education Authority and all that sort of thing.</p>

absolutely clear to Ministers that he thought that it was a barmy idea, that it was wrong in principle, and that it would be damaging in practice. None the less, it was his job as a civil servant to tell us how to achieve our aims in the least damaging and most effective way. As a result, he caught the attention of Ministers, who found him all the more effective because they knew that, rather than soft-soaping them, he was telling them how a bad Bill could be made less bad. He rapidly became permanent secretary, over the heads of his rivals in the then Department of the Environment. That was how it worked. Mrs. Thatcher liked people who answered back and who told her the truth. I suspect that there might be a difference between that attitude and those that pertain nowadays. There was certainly no party political import at that time.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o152"><a name="80507-0010.htm_para13"><a name="08050765000427">I congratulate my right hon. Friend the Member for Horsham (Mr. Maude) on raising this extremely important issue. The integrity of the civil service is a pearl of great price, and anyone who has lived or worked in a country that does not have an impartial civil service will recognise just how valuable it is. The possession of an information service within the civil service that is dedicated to honesty and integrity is also of immense importance to the operation of democracy. The accountability of Ministers to Parliament, and of civil servants to Ministers, is central to the working of parliamentary democracy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o153"><a name="80507-0010.htm_para14"><a name="08050765000428">All those things are now under threat&#151;or have been threatened&#151;under this new Labour Government. Even the fact that the Government are introducing this legislation is a recognition of the fact that there is grave concern about these issues, and that the Government are trying to respond to that, perhaps in good faith, and trying to reverse those things that have been put under threat over the past 10 years. This is unique to new Labour. Historically, the Labour party and Labour Governments have been respectful of the conventions and traditions that uphold the civil service and the integrity of its management.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o154"><a name="80507-0010.htm_para15"><a name="08050765000429">The other night, I was browsing through Roy Hattersley&#146;s admirable autobiography, &#147;Who Goes Home?&#148; in which he refers to his experience ahead of, I think, the 1979 election. He had discovered that the retail prices index figures, which were coming out a day after the election, were going to be very good. He said:</p>
<a name="80507-0010.htm_brev1"><a name="08050765001820"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;So I asked the Prime Minister if I could announce, or at least leak, our success&#148;&#151;</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o156"><a name="80507-0010.htm_para17"><a name="08050765000431">So the attitude of that Labour Prime Minister, Jim Callaghan, was full of integrity and respect for the system. Callaghan in turn explained to Hattersley how a junior Minister called Dugdale, as a young Member of Parliament and Minister in the post-war Labour Government, had questioned Sir Stafford Cripps as to whether it was really necessary to announce a proposal to reduce the already inadequate cheese ration by a further 2 oz, just before a general election. Stafford Cripps replied that he was not sure of the questioner&#146;s identity, but</p>

 I thank the right hon. Gentleman, my political neighbour, for giving way. He is describing a situation that I remember from my youth; it could even be described as a golden age.

 I entirely agree.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o158"><a name="80507-0010.htm_para19"><a name="08050765000435">I want to ask why the new Labour Government have put so much pressure on these features of our civil service. The answer lies in the fact that new Labour is essentially old Labour that has ceased to believe in socialism, or indeed in anything. And those who believe in nothing are prepared to say anything. Those whose agenda is more about gaining power than implementing an idea focus essentially on headlines. That leads to a focus on spin and to &#147;initiativitis&#148;, which embroils the civil service in producing spurious policies that can be announced but never implemented. It also leads to conflict between Ministers and civil servants.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o159"><a name="80507-0010.htm_para20"><a name="08050765000436">Most people who watch &#147;Yes Minister&#148; assume that conflict between the civil service and Ministers is integral to the relationship between them. Traditionally, when asked whether &#147;Yes Minister&#148; is an accurate portrayal of relations, Ministers&#146; response has been, &#147;You think it is a comedy; we know it is a documentary&#148;. Actually, it is a description of the relationship between civil servants and Ministers, focusing on an abrasive attempt by civil servants to get control of the agenda, only if the Minister has no agenda of his own. If a Minister has no agenda and is moved solely by a desire to respond to a bad headline yesterday or to avoid a bad headline tomorrow and get a good one the day after, he will be all over the place all the time, constantly driven by the newspapers. In that case, the civil service steps in. Thank heavens it does; it is better to have consistent government by some body of people who know something about it than inconsistent and incoherent government by a Minister who does not have a clue what he really wants.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o160"><a name="80507-0010.htm_para21"><a name="08050765000437">If Ministers come along with an agenda of their own, a clear idea of what they want to do, and put it to their officials, that is completely different. Even if those officials do not agree with that agenda personally because it goes against their own political views or they do not like it or are worried about it, once they have tested the Minister and noted the agenda that the elected ministerial representative wants to put forward, the British civil service will be second to none in helping to deliver it. Unfortunately, the obsession with spin and headlines rather than substance and a coherent agenda has put the Government in conflict with the information service, particularly with respect to the civil service. Within the first 12 months of the new Labour Government, we saw 24 of the 44 senior posts in the civil service changed and replaced largely by Government appointees or special advisers. That was extremely damaging and extremely unwise.</p>

in the Thatcher years to the much larger number now, many of the new people were appointed precisely to the press officer posts that my right hon. Friend mentions. In the period before that, we should think not only about the numbers involved, but about what people did. They were advisers and confidants, but for the most part they were not press officers. The key change is not just that so many more of these posts now exist, but that so many more are charged on a day-to-day basis with trying to deal with the press. Does my right hon.

 I agree very strongly with that. I would like to draw on my own experience&#151;the best way for me to contribute&#151;rather than provide mere assertion on that and other issues.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o161"><a name="80507-0010.htm_para22"><a name="08050765000440">When I became Secretary of State for Social Security, I was told about all the skeletons in the cupboard. There was one particular skeleton&#151;I forget exactly what it was, but it was a difficult piece of information to handle&#151;and I was told, &#147;Minister, you are going to have to think about how to deal with this&#148;. I got up one morning to find that that piece of information was the headline in <i> The Guardian</i>.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o162"><a name="80507-0010.htm_para23"><a name="08050765000441">It so happened that my first meeting was with my chief press officer, Stephen Reardon, the responsible official in the Department. I asked him how that newspaper had acquired that piece of information and he told me, &#147;I gave it to them&#148;. I will not repeat to the House exactly what I said, but I was intemperate&#151;wrongly intemperate, as I should not have been intemperate with a civil servant, but I was for a moment. When I asked him how he had come to do that, he replied that the newspaper had asked him a question to which that information was the answer. It was not confidential information, he told me, and he said: &#147;My job, Minister, is not to work for you, but for the public. My job is to tell the truth and to give to the public the information that is theirs by right, which cannot be withheld as confidential&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o163"><a name="80507-0010.htm_para24"><a name="08050765000442">When I had calmed down, I began to think that this man was rather valuable. He would stand up and tell the truth to all and sundry, including to me; I found him to be an invaluable civil servant throughout my period in office. If I asked him how a particular announcement would be seen by the media, he would give me an honest and accurate prescription. Within just a few weeks of the appointment of the new Labour Government, he was out&#151;he lost his job; he was sacked&#151;because they could not put up with that sort of integrity. I think that they damaged themselves, as I believe that it strengthens the Government to have people who can be trusted to tell the truth and provide a reliable conduit of information between Departments and the media.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o164"><a name="80507-0010.htm_para25"><a name="08050765000443">Secondly, I want to deal with the importance of officials telling the truth directly to Ministers in confidence, helping them to speak truthfully when they are operating in Parliament and correcting errors if Ministers accidentally make them.

I talk about many things, but towards the end I include the point that when we Ministers make a mistake, it is  <br>

the job of civil servants to present us with a little note saying, &#147;Minister, when you said there was no precedent for x, what you actually meant was that there were seven precedents, which are as follows&#148;. It can happen very occasionally; even I might say something in the heat of debate or without proper thought that turned out to be incorrect. In those circumstances, officials should present the Minister with a statement of the mistake and it would become the Minister&#146;s job to put the record straight immediately, usually in Committee, or perhaps later to the House.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o165"><a name="80507-0010.htm_para26"><a name="08050765000444">When I tell today&#146;s civil servants that that was and should be the practice, they look at me aghast and in amazement! They first ask how it would be possible for them to do that when all the time Ministers say things that are not true; and, secondly, they say that the attitude of the Government and Ministers is not the same any more. It is a very sad and sorry state of affairs when some officials seem to be too cowed to stand up to Ministers. A great many probably retain their robustness, which is essential to proper relations between them and Ministers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o166"><a name="80507-0010.htm_para27"><a name="08050765000445">In my experience, it is important to have officials working for us even if they do not necessarily agree with all our policies. I carried out an analysis of where policy had, in my view, gone wrong in its formulation or implementation in the Department of Social Security&#151;needless to say, before I took over. I looked into the Child Support Agency. Part of the reason it had gone wrong was that everybody was in favour of it: officials, especially women, were in favour of it for feminist reasons; Ministers were in favour of it because it chimed well with dealing with feckless fathers; and no one on the committee preparing for the Bill was against it. No one said, &#147;Hang on a minute; will this work? Is it really so sensible?&#148; That is why I think it desirable to have officials who are robust enough to stand up and criticise Ministers or the policies that they are putting forward by suggesting that they should think again while a policy is going through a process of development. Civil servants need self-confidence and belief in their own integrity in order to do that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o167"><a name="80507-0010.htm_para28"><a name="08050765000446">Thirdly, there is the issue of accountability. Officials are accountable to Ministers; Ministers are accountable to Parliament. It is difficult to get the balance right. We cannot expect Ministers to take responsibility for every little thing that happens in their Department. We cannot expect a Minister for Transport to resign whenever there is a car crash, even though it is his job to reduce their number. None the less, when something major happens in the Department, the first implication should be that the Minister is responsible rather than, as happens all too often nowadays, the naming, shaming and blaming of the civil servants.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o168"><a name="80507-0010.htm_para29"><a name="08050765000447">When I was Financial Secretary to the Treasury, I was responsible for the Inland Revenue. If it had been responsible for losing all the data of every family in the country, I would at least have tentatively offered my resignation to the Prime Minister or Chancellor. I may have hoped that it would be refused, but I would at least have put forward that resignation. <i> [Interruption.] </i>I do not pretend to any great personal valour in these matters, but it is important for Ministers to accept that, at the end of the day, they are responsible and cannot escape blame by blaming officials.</p>

The only way to kill that allegation dead was to publish the details of every single export licence relating to Iraq in those categories in the years preceding the invasion of Kuwait by Saddam Hussein. It took a long time; there were thousands of licences. The officials eventually came back and said, &#147;All clear, Minister; not a single example. Only the export of two hunting guns were possibly against the sanctions regime.&#148; I then summoned in the members of the press one by one, and said to each of them, &#147;Look, there are the 14,000 export licences. You can read them yourself, but I can assure you that you will not find an example of anything out of line.&#148;</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o171"><a name="80507-0011.htm_para2"><a name="08050765000450">As it happened, I wrote an open letter to the Chairman of the Select Committee, and everyone was on holiday, and the Press Association wrote the story up very favourably to me and I got away scot-free. However, Ministers are ultimately responsible for the advice they take, and if they take bad advice on a serious matter on which they have given serious assurances, their heads are on the block.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o172"><a name="80507-0011.htm_para3"><a name="08050765000451">Let me finally make some brief observations about the reforms that are needed. In response to the hon. Member for Cannock Chase, I referred to the Northcote-Trevelyan reforms. They entrenched in the British civil service a belief that generalism, not specialism, is the only way to the top, and in terms of promotion and internal recruitment and recruitment from outside, we need to bring in people with specialist experience. It is my experience in business that someone who knows a lot about repairing motor cars can be made into a good librarian, but someone who knows nothing about anything probably cannot be made into a good manager of anything. So specialist expertise is important. That went out of the civil service with the Northcote-Trevelyan reforms. Before then, the Indian civil service had at least required people to learn Indian languages, but as a result of those reforms Haileybury college&#151;it is nothing to do with the school&#151;where the civil servants were taught was closed down and thereafter they learned Greek and Latin in order to go off and govern India. We have suffered from that ethos ever since.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o173"><a name="80507-0011.htm_para4"><a name="08050765000452">More significant, in my experience, was the paucity of people in the civil service with project management experience and skills. That might explain why so many  <br>

major projects go wrong: to get promotion in the civil service, staff should want to be a policy adviser, not a manager. Normally, staff in the civil service do a job for only a couple of years before moving on to something else, hopefully higher up and away from actually managing anything to advising Ministers. Therefore, very few people in the civil service have had any prolonged experience of managing anything through to completion. I raised that with the head of the civil service, and now there is at least some attempt to provide for the formation of project management skills, but I suspect that it does not go far enough.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o174"><a name="80507-0011.htm_para5"><a name="08050765000453">I congratulate my Front-Bench colleagues on introducing this motion, and on focusing on the importance of bringing back to the centre of our debate integrity, truth in information and accountability in terms of Ministers&#146; policies and the actions of their Departments. Driven by the criticisms that have been made of their stewardship for the past 10 years, I hope that the Government will forge ahead and introduce a Bill that will entrench the integrity of the civil service; that should not be necessary, but alas, it is. I also hope that my Front-Bench colleagues will live up to what  they are saying now when they are in government after May 2010.</p>

 I welcome the opportunity to speak in this important debate on a subject that has interested me greatly for a long time, not least because I am privileged to be a member of the Public Administration Committee. That is the most enjoyable, interesting and worthwhile role I have had during my 11 years in this House. I am particularly pleased that the Committee is chaired by my hon. Friend the Member for Cannock Chase (Dr. Wright). He is not merely a competent Chair but a brilliant one; he leads us superbly in the work we do. However, although I congratulate him on his speech, it must be said that we do from time to time have slight differences of view. That is healthy, however, and the civil service should be like that, too.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o175"><a name="80507-0011.htm_para6"><a name="08050765000456">First, I apologise for not being present for the speech from the Opposition Front Bencher as I was unavoidably detained. I will not be too critical of the motion, even though I shall, obviously, vote with the Government when we divide. I hope that what I say will reflect some of the Opposition&#146;s concerns&#151;I certainly think that that will be the case, as I shall be repeating comments I have made in the Committee on more than one occasion.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o176"><a name="80507-0011.htm_para7"><a name="08050765000457">It is some 150 years since the Northcote-Trevelyan report, so it is not before time that we are talking about putting some of their thoughts into legislation. I am pleased that the Committee put forward a draft civil service Bill, which was highly regarded by Members of all parties, although the previous Prime Minister and his Government were resistant to implementing it. I very much welcome the fact that our new Prime Minister has brought in a new era, one in which we are looking forward positively to a better future.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o177"><a name="80507-0011.htm_para8"><a name="08050765000458">My purpose in speaking in this debate is to say that we are moving in the right direction. I have had a number of private conversations with Ministers, and I have spoken publicly in the Committee, and I want to  <br>

do what I can to give the Government a small shove to move further in the right direction.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o178"><a name="80507-0011.htm_para9"><a name="08050765000459">I should also say that I appreciate the speech of the right hon. Member for Hitchin and Harpenden (Mr. Lilley), who is a near constituency neighbour. I agree with almost everything he said. He emphasised that there should be a pervasive sense of honour in government in general, and that people were honourable in the past. We have, perhaps, forgotten that a little. This is not just a game of winning and losing; it is about principles, behaving well and setting examples to the rest of the world.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o179"><a name="80507-0011.htm_para10"><a name="08050765000460">Without being too high-flown, I should mention that I was recently interviewed for a television programme for the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, and the programme makers wanted to know how to run a civil service. I have not been a civil servant and I do not know much, but I emphasised the points made today about civil servants having integrity, ability and a strong sense of public service to the state, and not being corrupted. They were very worried about how to keep corruption out of newly created Governments, particularly in relatively poor countries where people can be corrupted. I said, &#147;You should start from the beginning by saying that the first principle is that the civil service must not be tainted by corruption, and you must have people running your state who are not corrupt, and whose objective is to help their politicians govern well and to serve their people to the best of their ability.&#148; We in this country must remind ourselves of that a bit, too, given the events of recent times.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o180"><a name="80507-0011.htm_para11"><a name="08050765000461">I welcome the very clear shift of direction under our new Prime Minister and his Ministers, but we have some way to go to squeeze out the remaining toxins particularly of the Blair era&#151;and to some extent the Thatcher era as well. I make no apology for mentioning the previous Prime Minister, who happened to be in the same party as me. I do not care much for labels. Reference was made to &#147;new Labour&#148;, which no one has ever called me, apart from one of my Conservative opponents. She mistakenly described me as a &#147;Blairite&#148; one day, which caused a great deal of mirth in my constituency, although no one took the comment seriously and she learned better later on. We had a very civilised campaign, we were good friends and so on, but she realised that I was not &#147;new Labour&#148; and that the word &#147;socialist&#148; did apply to me. If a label is to be used, I am happy to have that one applied to me.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o181"><a name="80507-0011.htm_para12"><a name="08050765000462">What we saw during the Blair era was what I have described, in a perhaps extreme phrase, as the &#147;Leninisation&#148; of British politics. The essence of Leninisation was to get absolute central control, to smooth out and destroy all resistance in the regime and to have political checks at every level to ensure that what was decided at the centre was carried out at the base. That was the drift. I am not and have never been a Leninist, but interestingly a number of people of Leninist origins, from Leninist organisations&#151;Conservative Members are not so familiar with those, although some Labour Members are&#151;were in the Blair regime. Some of the special advisers and political advisers, and even some Ministers, had such associations, so they understood the process of Leninisation and of control; I believe  <br>

that Lenin&#146;s first slogan was, &#147;Secure control of the party.&#148; Control was the essence of the approach, and that is what happened.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o182"><a name="80507-0011.htm_para13"><a name="08050765000463">The attempt to strip away the opposition went on at every level, and of course it marginalised and pushed  to one side the principle that underlies British Government: pluralism. All democratic constitutions must contain checks and balances on power, because power is dangerous. People like it when they get it; they do not want to give it away. They want to have more of it, because it is a bit of a drug. The job of constitutions is to restrain those who like power from having too much of it and, sometimes, to take it away from them, by election or by some other means.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o183"><a name="80507-0011.htm_para14"><a name="08050765000464">Most constitutions are set up in a way that restrains power, and they contain checks and balances. The American constitution is a classic example of that: it contains the separation and balance of powers. Other constitutions contain restraints within parties. One of Britain&#146;s constitutional features that restrained power was the fact that the parties contained a democratic structure that restrained even their leaders. Even that restraint has been stripped out to a large extent from my party and possibly from the Conservative party, and that was damaging. Having healthy debate within parties and restraints on power within parties are as important as having such things within the state.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o184"><a name="80507-0011.htm_para15"><a name="08050765000465">Other forms of government exist&#151;for example, federalism. America, as well as other countries, depends on such a system, where there are defined roles for central Government and for other parts of government at a lower level&#151;for example, a regional system could be used, as could some form of states system, as happens in America. Federalism is a way of dividing power so that not all of it resides in the centre. </p>

<p><a name="stpa_o185"><a name="80507-0011.htm_para16"><a name="08050765000466">Britain has relied for a very long time on a balance of power between different parts not of our constitution as such, but of our political society. Our system has embodied pluralism and, for a long time, strong local government, strong trade unions, strong independent parties that were quite different from each other and that acted as a check on each other, and the balance of power between the Executive and the legislature. Even the legislature is divided between two Houses, which act as a check on each other. All those checks were built in.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o186"><a name="80507-0011.htm_para17"><a name="08050765000467">The problem with the recent regime is that it has tried to eliminate all those constraints and checks, so we are examining ways of strengthening them once again. Even within the Executive there were, and I hope that there will be again, strong constraints on power. For example, the Cabinet sometimes acted as a restraining influence on Prime Ministers, but unfortunately that has not been the case in recent times. The papers released after 30 years have told us that back in the days of Jim Callaghan and the 1970s economic crisis, a real debate took place in Cabinet about whether the Government should opt for the International Monetary Fund loan or an alternative economic strategy based on some kind of protectionism. Those on the left wanted the protectionist approach, those on the right wanted the IMF loan and deflation, and there was a balancing group in the middle. A powerful debate went on for some time in Cabinet, but eventually Jim Callaghan got his way because the middle group chose to support the  <br>

IMF loan people. We ended up with the IMF loan, the social contracts and so on, but a real debate did take place in Cabinet.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o187"><a name="80507-0011.htm_para18"><a name="08050765000468">I have heard more recently about a case&#151;I am not talking about under the present Prime Minister, but this certainly applies in respect of the previous one&#151;involving a Minister who had recently joined the Cabinet. He had the temerity to make some kind of critical suggestion in Cabinet, and was taken aside afterwards by a fellow member and told, &#147;That&#146;s not done. I&#146;m afraid we don&#146;t do that in the Cabinet.&#148;</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o188"><a name="80507-0011.htm_para19"><a name="08050765000469">In recent years, Cabinet meetings have been very short. Senior civil servants have told our Committee that back in the Wilson era and before, it was typical for 200 papers a year to be delivered to Cabinet by Ministers, or by civil servants through Ministers, in order to discuss policy. The Cabinet meetings would go on for some time while the papers were discussed. I understand that in a particular year during the Blair era just two papers were put to the Cabinet, so something has gone seriously wrong between that earlier time and now. The suggestion is that Cabinet became a cipher and was not the power that it used to be.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o189"><a name="80507-0011.htm_para20"><a name="08050765000470">Within our constitution, the civil service was always a rock, although perhaps one did not always agree with it; its independence, impartiality, ability and sense of commitment to the public interest were unquestioned. From time to time, one might disagree with it, but we were certainly aware of it. The idea that civil servants might be corrupt or on the take, or that they might take big jobs in industry later so they might be serving the interests of the companies they were later to work for while they were in government, was unthinkable. There were rules about that, but more important than those were the inner constraints: people had a sense of what was right and what was wrong. It was not the job of a servant of the state&#151;a servant of the citizens&#151;in the civil service to think about lining their pockets as a result of what they did in government. Some doubtless would have done that, but it was not the view held.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o190"><a name="80507-0011.htm_para21"><a name="08050765000471">Such values have perhaps declined, partly as a result of the interface between the civil service and business outside becoming so much more porous. There is a difference in values between serving the public, the state and the citizen as a public servant, and making money. I am not saying that either is not necessary, but they are different. I would emphasise that serving the public is a superior value to making money. I know people, even some within my own family, who say that they do not want to work in the private sector, that it is fine for those who do and who want to make money, but they want to serve society through public service. That is a noble thing to say, to feel and to do. Many people in the civil service do that today. We should not make light of that, play it down or try to control it; we should respect it. Re-establishing that attitude in our civil service would be a very good thing.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o191"><a name="80507-0011.htm_para22"><a name="08050765000472">To an extent, I am a golden age-ist and I watched &#147;Yes Minister&#148; and &#147;Yes Prime Minister&#148; with great interest. Although the civil service is portrayed as a rule unto itself and Ministers as doing what they are told by those clever civil servants, that was a better model than we have now. In the end, Ministers make the decisions, but the civil service is there to ensure that things do not go wrong&#151;to speak truth unto power, as the phrase has it. When Ministers have a notion to do something,  <br>

the civil servants say, &#147;Actually, Minister, that will not work, for these reasons. You may want to spend lots of money and cut taxes, but the sums don&#146;t add up. You have to have some kind of fiscal balance.&#148;</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o192"><a name="80507-0011.htm_para23"><a name="08050765000473">We have to have civil servants who know what they are talking about because, with great respect to my hon. Friend the Minister, not all Ministers are brilliant, even when it comes to their own portfolios. They have to depend on civil servants&#151;<i> [</i><i> Interruption.</i><i> ]</i> The Minister is obviously a star in his own right. The civil service has to be preserved and reinforced, and its values have to be restored, if they have been damaged.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o193"><a name="80507-0011.htm_para24"><a name="08050765000474">We have to reconstruct the civil service, if it is not damaged too badly, with the values that the right hon. Member for Hitchin and Harpenden mentioned. It should also contain a range of views. If we comb out opposition to a particular ideology or philosophy, it is bad for government. When I was a student, I knew a lecturer who became a civil servant in the Treasury. He told me that at the time of the Callaghan devaluation in 1967, some civil servants believed in retaining the high value of the pound, but some of those in the back office were considering the possibility of devaluation and had prepared for it. So when the decision was made, someone in the back office could say, &#147;Here&#146;s one I prepared earlier.&#148; The policy could thus be implemented. What we do not want is civil servants who all believe in a strong currency and would have no idea how to go about devaluation, or its implications, and so would be at a loss.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o194"><a name="80507-0011.htm_para25"><a name="08050765000475">Many Conservative Members probably now regret the rash and mistaken decision to join the exchange rate mechanism in 1990, as it led directly to their defeat in 1997. That decision was supported by many Labour Members, although I was not among them. I was an economist in the trade union movement at the time and I wrote time and again that it was a mistake. I predicted in 1990 that it would fail in just the way that it did. Everyone thought that I was a bit off the wall, but later I got a lot of credit. I was not alone, as some other economists thought the same way. In any event, I understand that Nigel Lawson wanted people who agreed with him in his private office. He did not want people who would say, &#147;Sorry, Chancellor, but this idea of pinning our currency to other European currencies will not work, the pound will devalue and it will cause a lot of political trouble.&#148; It did go badly wrong, but had Nigel Lawson had people around him who warned of the possible consequences, it might not have been quite the tragedy that it was for the economy, the people and, especially, the Conservative party. We might have had a healthier economy later as well.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o196"><a name="80507-0011.htm_para27"><a name="08050765000478">The civil service is very important, and my experience of local government as opposed to national is that local government is far better at discussing money, terms and conditions, motivation, promotion and how people actually do things. The civil service, however, almost seems to be in a different pot to us, and the only time we ever see civil servants&#151;who are all fairly good&#151;is when we are serving for hours on a Committee.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o197"><a name="80507-0011.htm_para28"><a name="08050765000479">As a country, we can be proud of our civil servants. The benefits of having a system that is not corrupt have been mentioned today. One of my observations on the European Union is the cultural difference between northern Europe&#151;the Finns, the Swedes and the Britons&#151;and southern Europe, where the sun shines and people are a little more cavalier. We can be very grateful that we have a system that is honest. If other countries have a problem&#151;I am thinking of Russia and Turkey, for example&#151;it is the corruption in their systems that holds them back.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o198"><a name="80507-0011.htm_para29"><a name="08050765000480">We should debate our civil service a lot more. If we have a problem, it is probably that we do not recycle people out of the civil service into other careers. I always look to the French system, in which senior civil servants go to work in a bank or for a major institution. As the Minister pointed out, the third sector also offers good examples of people who go out and get experience in the outside world and then come back and work for the public benefit. I know that there are problems with pensions and rewards when people go in and out of the system, but I do not think it would be beyond our wit in this modern age to work out a system whereby those at the top of the civil service would not only be experienced civil servants but would have a much more direct experience of the outside world, on which they so often give advice. That would be an important reform.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o199"><a name="80507-0011.htm_para30"><a name="08050765000481">I broadly welcome what the Government are doing through legislation. The problem is that we have moved over recent years to a more presidential system as Downing street becomes ever more important. In the years of my youth, Governments changed fairly regularly. In a way, that helped balance within the system. We had Wilson for six years, Heath for just under four, and then the Labour party under Wilson and Callaghan for five years. The Thatcher Government served a record-breaking 18 years and this Government will, I suspect, certainly manage 13 years. Whether they will get beyond that point remains to be seen. It changes the nature and character of the system, because people suddenly realise that the person at the top, who is the one person who can break through for decision making in Whitehall, is very important for posts and patronage. That has an impact on the way government operates.</p>

If we keep impugning each others&#146; motives in politics, it is no wonder that the great British public start questioning our motives on issues from expenses to everything else. That downgrades the political process, so we have to be extremely careful. Trust is a commodity. Part of the Government&#146;s problem is that if one promises a referendum and does not deliver on it, people might impugn their motives on other issues. Trust is very important in terms of what the Government do.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o202"><a name="80507-0012.htm_para2"><a name="08050765000484">The public see a Government who are spending an awful lot on advertising. No doubt, as the Minister says, some very worthy things are advertised, such as road safety, but there is a question mark over whether there is a political objective for all these things&#151;but perhaps that is because of the sceptical times in which  we live.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o203"><a name="80507-0012.htm_para3"><a name="08050765000485">We have heard that there are 70 advisers. I do not have too much of a problem with advisers, and if we look at most other systems&#151;particularly the American one&#151;we see that we have very few advisers compared with most Governments. They play an important role that allows civil servants to be totally neutral. A lot of the political advisory roles allow links with party political organisations and so on. It depends on their role and whether it involves developing policy or spinning.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o204"><a name="80507-0012.htm_para4"><a name="08050765000486">Our concern in the Conservative party, after the history of the past few years, is that rather too many people deal with the media and rather too few deal with blue-skies thinking, policy issues and those important matters to do with delivering a particular governmental agenda. The special adviser budget has gone up from just under &#163;2 million to at least  &#163;6 million. The number of press officers in some Departments has gone up tremendously, too.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o205"><a name="80507-0012.htm_para5"><a name="08050765000487">I have the privilege of serving on the Health Committee. I note that the number of press officers in the Department of Health has gone up from 15 to 26. Why are so many needed? Occasionally, nasty bugs come along and kill people, so somebody might be needed to put out information then, but the Government have been lauding the amount spent on the NHS and one wonders whether increasing the number of press officers is necessarily the best use of resources.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o206"><a name="80507-0012.htm_para6"><a name="08050765000488">I believe that the US and some other Parliaments have better systems than ours. I am not concerned about the number of advisers, but there should be parliamentary scrutiny of who they are, what their role is and whether they are qualified to fulfil it. Parliament should assert itself so that it can see who is being appointed to the various Ministries. There ought to be much more scrutiny by the House.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o207"><a name="80507-0012.htm_para7"><a name="08050765000489">The change of Prime Minister gives us an opportunity to revisit some of those matters. The Government have made a number of announcements, and I hope that they continue in the direction that they are going. Given the history, we are a little sceptical. A  <br>

 I am pleased to be called to speak in this interesting and wide-ranging debate. I have an admission to make, because I hankered after being a special adviser when I was a researcher here 15 or 16 years ago. The daily grind of casework was not for the special adviser: I imagined leaping into the ministerial Jaguar and jetting off to some exotic and exciting meeting. Given the transport that Ministers now get, I have to admit that the notion of leaping into the Toyota Prius does not generate quite the same excitement.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o208"><a name="80507-0012.htm_para8"><a name="08050765000491">I accept that special advisers do a very important job but, like my hon. Friend the Member for Poole (Mr. Syms), I am slightly concerned&#151;not overly so, as there are much bigger things to worry about&#151;by the fact that at departmental level their numbers have doubled over the past 12 years from about 34 to 68. They all do much better financially now, as the budget has risen from &#163;1.4 million in 1994-95 to nearly &#163;6 million now.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o209"><a name="80507-0012.htm_para9"><a name="08050765000492">However, my problem with special advisers is that I think that the House already has some fairly special advisers: they are known as Members of Parliament. Too often, we are bypassed by our political masters in their smart limousines and ivory towers, who tend to seek advice from outside experts and gurus. The Executive are increasingly powerful, with many highly paid supporters and hangers on&#151;I do not want to sound pejorative, as many do an excellent job&#151;while Parliament is seen as a rather tedious nuisance that needs to be managed but not listened to. To some degree, the growth in the numbers of special advisers has paralleled the erosion of Parliament in our society, and the strengthening of the Executive.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o210"><a name="80507-0012.htm_para10"><a name="08050765000493">I have some questions about special advisers. Are they very special? Who are they? We may have some idea of who they are, but often we do not know where they come from or what they have done to qualify them for their important and highly paid positions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o211"><a name="80507-0012.htm_para11"><a name="08050765000494">How do members of Parliament get to know these special advisers? After all, they are paid for out of the public purse. We are told that they have hugely important and influential jobs, and that they have the ear of Ministers, Prime Ministers, Cabinet Ministers and all sorts of powerful people, yet we in the House of Commons very rarely get to meet them. Indeed, the closest I get to those special advisers is when we on the Public Administration Committee are interviewing Ministers. Behind them sit shadowy figures who pass notes to the Ministers and whisper in their ears.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o212"><a name="80507-0012.htm_para12"><a name="08050765000495">I say to the Minister&#151;and to my party&#146;s Front Benchers, as I am sure that we will be in power very soon&#151;that I, as a Back Bencher, would like to meet these special advisers and get to know them. Perhaps there could be a system whereby they came before a Select Committee. We do not want to be hostile to those fine young men and women&#151;or some of them might even be middle-aged. We would just like to  <br>

introduce ourselves and give them the chance to introduce themselves to us, so that we can have a more fruitful and open relationship.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o213"><a name="80507-0012.htm_para13"><a name="08050765000496">I have one more important question about special advisers. When they leave Government, where do they go? We need to know. Do they go off into the private sector, never to be heard of again, and do wonderful things and create large profits for shareholders, much though my friend the hon. Member for Luton, North (Kelvin Hopkins) might dislike that? I am pulling his leg gently. Or are they parachuted into quangos, where they do their former masters&#146; bidding?</p>

<p><a name="st_o230"><a name="08050765000497"><a name="80507-0012.htm_spnew1"><a name="08050765002124"><b>Kelvin Hopkins:</b>
 As the hon. Gentleman may be aware, a number of former special advisers are parachuted on to our Front Bench.</p>

 The question is whether they do a useful job there. I will leave my colleague to answer that question in his own good time. We parliamentarians have a right to know what influence special advisers wield after they leave Government and cease serving Ministers. Of course they have every right to earn a fruitful living in whatever field they choose, but we should keep a close eye on them to ensure that they are not wielding undue influence in an area directly connected with Government.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o214"><a name="80507-0012.htm_para14"><a name="08050765000499">Moving on to the civil service, I do not want Members in this place to be too po-faced about the idea that promotion is based on merit. Could we honestly look our constituents in the face and say that promotion of a Member of Parliament to the Front Bench is based on merit in all circumstances and cases? Of course in many circumstances and cases it is, but other factors come into play, too. It is the same in political parties, in business and, I am sure, in the civil service. However, we have to be sure that recruitment is based on merit, and that we are getting the very best people into our civil service, regardless of their race, creed, colour or sex. We must make sure that the civil service remains an attractive place in which to build a fruitful and constructive career in public service. Like the hon. Member for Luton, North, I think that public service is a noble thing; that is why we in this place are in public service.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o215"><a name="80507-0012.htm_para15"><a name="08050765000500">Civil servants must be free to engage constructively with, and to criticise, the politicians for whom they work. I listened closely to the &#147;Yes Minister&#148; stories told by my right hon. Friend the Member for Hitchin and Harpenden (Mr. Lilley). I found it rather refreshing that he could have that sort of engagement with civil servants, and that they could look him in the eye&#151;he is quite a fearsome chap&#151;and say, &#147;I&#146;m sorry, Secretary of State; you&#146;re wrong on this, and I&#146;m right, and I&#146;m executing my duty to the public by providing this information.&#148; It is hugely refreshing that that happened 15 years ago; I hope that it still happens today, and if it does not, we must make sure that it does. We want strong, self-confident, robust civil servants who put public duty before all else, and who do not fear for their jobs or careers if they disagree with a Minister or point out the error of his ways.</p>

 There should of course be a range of views within our civil service. The hon. Gentleman brings me on to my closing point. I do not want to rake up the issue of the 22p, the 20p and the 10p tax rates, but it was interesting to hear the Secretary of State for Justice say on the radio that the best brains had got it wrong. That was an intriguing statement, because I do not think that the best brains in our civil service did get it wrong.</p>

 My hon. Friend may be interested to know that the permanent secretary to the Treasury, Nick Macpherson, said as much to the Public Accounts Committee. He said a thorough analysis had been conducted, including what he called a distributional analysis of all the effects before the decision was made.</p>

<p><a name="st_o235"><a name="08050765000504"><a name="80507-0012.htm_spnew6"><a name="08050765002129"><b>Mr. Walker:</b>
 Absolutely. The Secretary of State for Justice chose his words carefully when he said that the best brains had got it wrong, because civil servants clearly explained the ramifications, and the fact that about 5.3 million people would be worse off. However, a political decision was made to go ahead and change the tax rates. We as politicians must be careful to stand up and accept responsibility when we get it wrong. We must make it clear to the public that the decision was ours as politicians alone, and it was a political decision. The Public Accounts Committee must make it clear that civil servants were entirely impartial in their analysis, and that it was a political decision to go ahead and change the tax rates. With those few, rambling thoughts, I will close with a final statement. Civil servants have to be careful how they conduct themselves at every level. I become very nervous when I see Ministers and Prime Ministers being applauded in and out of public office; that does civil servants no favours.</p>

 Because I was elected on 1 May 1997, which could be described as the mirror image for the Conservative party of the significance of 1 May 2008 for the Government, my experience of direct dealings with civil servants is limited to two periods in my life: first, when I was an academic researcher delving into the civil service archives for the period covering the end of the second world war and the start of the cold war; and, secondly, when I was deputy director of the Conservative research department. Happily, my duties included shining a spotlight on Leninists in the Labour party, helpfully acknowledged in the entertaining speech by the hon. Member for Luton, North (Kelvin Hopkins).</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o219"><a name="80507-0012.htm_para19"><a name="08050765000510">From the first experience, I concluded that the civil service has, in fact, always been highly political&#151;but not party political. That is one of the two themes that I wish to develop. From the latter experience, I can throw some light on the questions asked by my exuberant hon. Friend the Member for Broxbourne (Mr. Walker) about where special advisers come from, and, indeed, where they go&#151;or at least, what happened in the closing years of the Thatcher Administration. We are discussing the perpetual problem of the balance between professional expertise and mandated political leadership. Many years ago, long before &#147;Yes Minister&#148; made the notion of Ministers having to be house-trained by their civil servants almost a byword of popular humour, I remember reading an essay by the late Tony Crosland, in which he spelt out why Minister, were often ineffective in government, or at least, why their policies differed so little from those of their predecessors. He explained that even the most intelligent Minister, on taking up a new position, could probably expect to take a year to 18 months before gaining command of their brief. Within another year or 18 months, they might be moved on to another job.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o220"><a name="80507-0012.htm_para20"><a name="08050765000511">The problem that Ministers faced, of not having sufficient expertise, has in large measure been addressed by the appointment of special advisers, and I am going to sing their praises in a moment or two. First, however, I want to refer to the period in which I delved into the archives for the period 1942 to 1947, during which Government Departments were trying to work out what the British empire&#151;as it still just about was at that stage&#151;would have to defend itself against when the second world war was over.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o221"><a name="80507-0012.htm_para21"><a name="08050765000512">Huge arguments erupted between the Foreign Office, which believed that the Anglo-Soviet alliance of 1941 onwards&#151;the treaty was signed in 1942&#151;should be the cornerstone of our post-war foreign policy, and the chiefs of staff and their advisers, who believed that the Soviet Union would probably be the greatest potential military threat facing this country. What struck me at the time was that an argument was raging, effectively, between two Departments of civil servants, and how little the Ministers, let alone the Prime Minister, were involved in the process.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o222"><a name="80507-0012.htm_para22"><a name="08050765000513">The debate was highly political, but it was not party political. It therefore occurred to me that perhaps the real power in the land lay more with the professional civil servant and the professional expert, rather than with the political leader. I do not think anyone under any Government would dispute that a good civil servant is one with strong opinions about the political issues of the day, who will argue those opinions on their merits, provided that they do not allow themselves unduly to be swayed by party political considerations.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o223"><a name="80507-0012.htm_para23"><a name="08050765000514">The reverse of that coin is that if a Minister comes into office without a high degree of preliminary expertise, he or she will be somewhat adrift, because at the point at which the Minister wishes to take party political considerations into account, the civil servant, if he or she is doing the job properly, will rightly turn round to the Minister and say, &#147;I really can&#146;t advise you on that, Minister. I am not party political and this is a party political matter.&#148;</p>

We would have our individual desk officers, as we still do today, shadowing each Department of state. The young people working at those desks would develop considerable expertise. When they had done that for a few years, and because we were in government, they would be able to apply for, and more often than not get, jobs as special advisers. As I said in an earlier intervention, it was felt quite adequate to have two special advisers in most Departments, one sitting more or less at the right hand of the Secretary of State, and the other being available to the middle-ranking and junior Ministers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o225"><a name="80507-0012.htm_para25"><a name="08050765000516">I thought that that was a thoroughly good thing, because it meant that the Minister had someone to whom he or she could turn for advice when party political matters were relevant, and it was a way in which the political party to which the Minister belonged could have a direct channel to the Minister, without being bogged down or prevented from reaching the Minister by the serried ranks of party politically neutral civil servants in between. I thought that that was a good system, and I believe to this day that it is a good system, but we do not require many people to fulfil that role.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o226"><a name="80507-0012.htm_para26"><a name="08050765000517">On the contrary, the fact that there was just one special adviser for each Cabinet Minister and one more for the rest was a very good thing, because it meant that there was no dithering about who to consult, there was a direct channel of communication, and the Minister had someone on whom to rely to consider the political implications&#151;someone whose time was not taken up with numerous other duties such as an elected politician inevitably must perform, and someone who was party political and also an expert in the field. Such special advisers went on, in many cases, to become Conservative MPs, including the present Leader of the Opposition&#151;and a jolly good thing too.</p>

 This has been a debate of light and shade. The hon. Member for Cannock Chase (Dr. Wright) captured some of the crucial aspects of the debate. On the one hand, we are debating the future of the civil service&#151;the successor to the Northcote-Trevelyan reforms of 150-plus years ago. However, as the hon. Gentleman said, at the same time it falls to the Opposition to expose, and hold the Government to account for, some of the excesses that we see in the current arrangement. It is not entirely surprising that the speeches today have covered the different aspects of that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o228"><a name="80507-0012.htm_para28"><a name="08050765000520">It is also not surprising, in a week when Ministers have been called on to the airwaves to give the best possible gloss on the Government&#146;s difficulties&#151;our side have had to do that in the past&#151;that the question of presentation and spin has been applied to the administration of the Government and those charged with carrying that out. <i> [Interruption.]</i> I am pleased that the Minister for the Cabinet Office has come back; he has done great service over the weekend, doing his &#147;Comical Ali&#148; bit and presenting the best possible gloss on the Government&#146;s experiences. Incidentally, I noticed that the Cabinet Office website changed mysteriously on 29 April, two days before the local elections. It said, in bold type, that the No. 1 priority for the Minister was now supporting the Prime Minister. It comes to a pretty pass when the Prime Minister needs to give instructions to his colleagues through their job descriptions.</p>

We would not expect such words as &#147;spin&#148;, &#147;waste&#148; and &#147;incompetence&#148; to be associated with the British civil service, yet this Government have brought the service to such a situation that those words are the subject  of debate.</p>

Contrary to what the Minister for the Cabinet Office said, John Major limited the number of special advisers to 38; there are now 68 across the Government.</p>

Today, however, their role is often to prevent the disclosure of that information.</p>

 The right hon. Gentleman shakes his head, but he should be careful; he himself has experience of withholding information. He and I have been corresponding about whether, would you believe, it is reasonable for me to have sight of the Cabinet Office&#146;s staff magazine. That seems a fairly innocuous proposition: it might be useful for a team shadowing the Cabinet Office to know what is going on there, given the hopeful prospect that we might inherit it in due course. Imagine my astonishment when the Minister answered my parliamentary question by saying that it was not in the public interest for me to be given access to that magazine. I was generous to him and assumed that this was a mistake, so I wrote him a friendly note saying:</p>

In particular, the Government, having set out a course of freedom of information and greater impartiality through the White Paper, are failing to live up to the standards that apply in that document. For example, there is the question of waste. All of us, every day, receive mailbags full of ever-more-glossy, ever-more-expensively produced publications, often from quangos, all with advertising and public relations budgets. I am not saying that all money spent on advertising and public relations is  <br>

wasted, but there is a question of accountability. How are we to know that the vast sums of money being spent, especially by non-statutory bodies, are being spent in people&#146;s best interests? Why, for example, has the Civil Aviation Authority paid in the past five years nearly &#163;500,000 to one single PR company and &#163;700,000 to another? Why has the Meat and Livestock Commission paid out &#163;750,000 to a PR company? The East of England Development Agency has paid one single PR company &#163;500,000. Many businesses instruct PR firms to influence Ministers, but Ministers are instructing PR firms to do their job of communicating with the electorate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o238"><a name="80507-0013.htm_para7"><a name="08050765000532">When it comes to incompetence, where to start? This is a Government who take more and more information from citizens and then proceed to lose it. The personal details of 25 million citizens were lost by Her Majesty&#146;s Revenue and Customs when Ministers, including those present, knew that there was a systemic problem across government because it was reported to them in the July before the incident was reported. One of my constituents brought to my attention the fact that the online delivery team within the Legal Services Commission in the Ministry of Justice had won the 2007 civil service award for technology. The very next day after the prize was awarded, my constituent received an e-mail saying:</p>
<a name="80507-0013.htm_brev5"><a name="08050765001828"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;we are aware that a number of providers have had difficulties being able to sign into the new LSC online and as a result of this we have made the decision to close LSC online from Monday  19 November until further notice.&#148;</p>

He was rather baffled by that, as he is a 65-year-old man. That just shows the degree of chaos and confusion in the way that information is held in the Department of Health. It is important that Ministers are held to account for the incompetent handling of the administration of government.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o240"><a name="80507-0013.htm_para9"><a name="08050765000534">We heard some excellent speeches by right hon. and hon. Members. The Chairman of the Public Administration Committee, who serves with great distinction, made a marvellous speech, with a sweep of history worthy of Melvyn Bragg&#146;s programme, &#147;In Our Time&#148;, looking back to the origins of the current civil service settlement. The commendation of the 22 pages of the Northcote-Trevelyan report is a lesson to the Government and to the prospective Government on the benefits of economy as regards Government publications.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o241"><a name="80507-0013.htm_para10"><a name="08050765000535">The hon. Gentleman said that in the previous Conservative Government, the question, &#147;Is he one of us?&#148; would be asked. I can envisage the same question being asked by the current Prime Minister. Indeed, I know from some of my friends and colleagues who have served in the Government in various Departments with which the Prime Minister has been associated that it is almost exactly one that passes his lips. If not expressed in quite such clear terms, it is certainly an assessment that is made. The hon. Gentleman is to be commended for the fact that we have the prospect of a civil service Bill, and I congratulate the Government on making that progress. It is very much down to the work of the hon. Gentleman&#146;s Committee, supported by the hon. Member for Luton, North (Kelvin Hopkins), and other Committee members over the years. The prospect of that Bill is a great step forward, and it is important that we proceed to scrutinise the legislation on a  <br>

cross-party basis. There is a precedent for that: the Charities Bill proceeded for the most part without political contention getting in the way of proper scrutiny or the achievement of a consensus on what should be a charity, and on how charities should be regulated. I hope that it will be possible to make similar progress on the civil service Bill.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o242"><a name="80507-0013.htm_para11"><a name="08050765000536">The contribution of my right hon. Friend the Member for Hitchin and Harpenden (Mr. Lilley) reminds us of his distinguished career. He quoted with alarm what he regarded as a departure from the high standards that he enjoyed as Secretary of State. When his officials made a mistake on his behalf and caused him to say things that were inaccurate, he said that he was intemperate in his response. I have only ever seen my right hon. Friend in temperate mode; I cannot imagine the hinted fury that he pointed to. He made an important point about getting specialist skills into the civil service. It is important that there is such a contribution. I cannot understand why it is still relatively unusual for people to move backwards and forwards between the public sector, the third sector and government. We should address the question of why people should not regard themselves as doing particular jobs, and of why those sectors are in silos so that it is relatively unusual and remarkable when people move between them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o243"><a name="80507-0013.htm_para12"><a name="08050765000537">The hon. Member for Luton, North made a reasonable contribution. It was not reasonable in terms of its quality because its analysis of some of the drivers of centralisation was quite brilliant. He is right to say that we should avoid making the matter too personal and that we should not ascribe malign motives, but there was a plan. One of the great differences between the parties is that the Government had a deliberate plan to exercise central control over Government&#151;perhaps for the best of intentions. Perhaps it was the case that Ministers thought that by defining a template for how things should be run and making sure that it was implemented without any movement from it, they could achieve high standards. We were always sceptical of that approach. The hon. Gentleman described it as Leninist, and it involved controlling the related information as well as the plans. We were sceptical of that approach, and we can now see that it has not worked and that we should move away from it. The hon. Gentleman&#146;s insight into that process was extremely valuable.</p>

Friend the Member for Poole (Mr. Syms) talked about the longevity of Governments, and he made the point that we should not impugn each other&#146;s motivations because it does decrease the standard of respect for all politicians. My hon. Friend the Member for Broxbourne (Mr. Walker) made a passionate contribution. I know that he is a committed member of the Select Committee, and he will be engaged in the scrutiny of the Bill, ensuring that we take a close interest in the passage of the Bill. My hon. Friend the Member for New Forest, East (Dr. Lewis) pointed out in his contribution some of the history of the use of special advisers. He made a point, on which we  should reflect, about whether it would be useful discipline to restrict special advisers solely to comments on matters of policy rather than allowing them to brief the press.</p>

As the Minister for the Cabinet Office said, one of the ways in which the Government try to manage the civil service is through capability reviews, which they impose on all Whitehall Departments.

My hon. Friend said that we should not make the provisions over-elaborate, but ensure that the civil service is ruled through Parliament, not through the royal prerogative, and that we do the right thing on the right lines. That is exactly what we are doing. The Bill will be taken through a process of pre-legislative scrutiny involving a Joint Committee of both Houses over the next few months. The Bill also provides for a statutory civil service commission tasked with upholding the key principle of recruitment to the civil service on merit, through fair and open competition. The new commission will be established as an Executive non-departmental public body, which will underline its independence as a guardian of that fundamental principle.</p>

I did not recognise his analysis of the Leninisation that he described, but if there has been a revolution since 1997, it has been in our ability to create full employment and in lifting 600,000 children and 1 million pensioners out of poverty.

<p><a name="stpa_o265"><a name="80507-0014.htm_para0"><a name="08050765000563">Special advisers protect the civil service and prevent politicisation, because they do the things that Ministers want to have done, but which would be inappropriate for permanent civil servants to do.</p>

 I was just coming to the hon. Gentleman, who revealed his ambition to be a special adviser. <i> [</i><i> Interruption.</i><i> ]</i> Yes, I could offer him a job, as my right hon. Friend the Minister suggests, but I do not think that the kind of advice that he would give us would be that helpful. The hon. Gentleman said that even if he cannot become a special adviser, he would like to meet one. All that he needs to do is have a word with his leader. The hon. Member for New Forest, East (Dr. Lewis) reminded the House that the Leader of the Opposition used to be a special adviser. Perhaps the Leader of the Opposition would like to remind the hon. Member for Broxbourne (Mr. Walker) of the shadowy role that he played as a special adviser to Norman Lamont, when the Tory debacle of crashing out of the exchange rate mechanism happened in the 1990s. The Opposition have conveniently forgotten that, but believe you me, Mr. Deputy Speaker, we have not.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o266"><a name="80507-0014.htm_para1"><a name="08050765000566">The hon. Gentleman also asked what happens to special advisers when they leave the civil service. He will be pleased to know that the &#147;Code of Conduct for Special Advisers&#148; says:</p>
<a name="80507-0014.htm_brev1"><a name="08050765001836"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;All civil servants, including special advisers, are subject to the Rules on the acceptance of outside appointments by Crown servants...for the first two years after leaving office. They are required, in the circumstances set out in the rules, to obtain prior approval to accept an outside appointment.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o267"><a name="80507-0014.htm_para2"><a name="08050765000567">I hope that that answers his question.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o268"><a name="80507-0014.htm_para3"><a name="08050765000568">Hon. Members made several points about  Government communications. The right hon. Member for Horsham repeated allegations about some kind of impropriety by the Government when they made announcements about neighbourhood policing. I suggest that he should get himself on to the circulation lists of the hon. Member for Brentwood and Ongar (Mr. Pickles) and the right hon. Member for Haltemprice and Howden (David Davis), both of whom have received letters from the permanent secretary that make it clear why the allegations that the right hon. Member for Horsham has seen fit to repeat today are wrong. Such mudslinging will not work, even though he continues to repeat those allegations.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o269"><a name="80507-0014.htm_para4"><a name="08050765000569">Government spending on advertising has increased since 1997, and we are pleased that it has. It has increased from &#163;69 million in 1996-97 to &#163;154 million in 2006-07.  <br>

<notus-date day="7" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>7 May 2008 : Column 770</b><br>
I am pleased to announce those figures because we are saving lives as a result of that Government advertising and marketing. We are on course to meet the 10-year casualty reduction target by 2010, which will mean that there has been a 40 per cent. reduction in the number of people killed or seriously injured.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o270"><a name="80507-0014.htm_para5"><a name="08050765000570">The hon. Member for Poole (Mr. Syms) complained about the increase in press officers in the Department of Health. Successful advertising and marketing by the Department is helping to achieve a number of important health targets on smoking. The target to reduce the prevalence of smoking among the general population to 21 per cent. by 2010 is a key and essential part of achieving a healthier society.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o271"><a name="80507-0014.htm_para6"><a name="08050765000571">The civil service and its world has changed dramatically since 1854. That is why important reforms are now taking place, such as the transformation of the Pension Service. Service customers already benefit from a better service that has been designed around their needs. The Department for Work and Pensions pays more than 98 per cent. of its customers by direct payment. That is not only more convenient, but is saving about &#163;1 billion a year between 2005 and 2010.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o272"><a name="80507-0014.htm_para7"><a name="08050765000572">There have been reductions in the number of civil servants, and more of them have been relocated outside London and the south-east. We are investing heavily in a skills programme for the development of the civil service, and we have a capability review programme that is driving forward the process of change within the civil service.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o273"><a name="80507-0014.htm_para8"><a name="08050765000573">It is unfortunate that the Conservative party has used this debate not to celebrate the success of the civil service and the challenges ahead, but to make cheap and inaccurate party political points. I am glad that Madam Deputy Speaker intervened on the right hon. Member for Horsham, quite rightly, as he drifted well away from his brief.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o274"><a name="80507-0014.htm_para9"><a name="08050765000574">We are committed to legislating for the civil service and to safeguarding its impartiality. We have published measures as part of our draft Constitutional Renewal Bill, and we welcome hon. Members&#146; views on that. We are committed to keeping public expenditure under control while ensuring that civil servants have the skills and tools that they need to deliver better services with less. We will continue to undertake a programme of investment and renewal to ensure that Government Departments are in the best possible shape to meet the challenges and demands of the next 150 years.</p>

 I beg to move, That the Bill be now read the Third time.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o281"><a name="80507-0015.htm_para4"><a name="08050765001657">Before I begin, I want to pay a compliment to the Members who have turned up to discuss the issue this afternoon&#151;particularly my colleagues from Norfolk who have been in the forefront during discussions on the issue, and members of the Select Committee that met to make the Bill much tighter and sharper than it was on Second Reading. I pay an individual compliment to the hon. Member for South Norfolk (Mr. Bacon), who sadly missed Second Reading owing to tragic circumstances. It is grand to see him in the Chamber today, and I hope that he will have the opportunity to extend his interest in the Bill.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o282"><a name="80507-0015.htm_para5"><a name="08050765001658">The prime purpose of the Bill is public safety on the waterways of the broads, not only for people from Norfolk and Suffolk who use the broads but for people from across the world, the UK and Europe. The broads are a popular tourist resort, with many boats dodging about during the summer. We are rather concerned about public safety on the waterways. There has been agreement between the Broads Authority and three national boating organisations on the Bill&#146;s provisions. I shall say more about that later.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o283"><a name="80507-0015.htm_para6"><a name="08050765001659">Two specific issues arose from the Select Committee on the Bill, which was chaired by my hon. Friend the Member for North-West Leicestershire (David Taylor). I thank him for the efforts that were put in. The authority has incorporated as much as possible from the legal agreements with the boating organisations in the Bill. If people have looked at the Bill, they will have seen how it has changed since Second Reading.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o284"><a name="80507-0015.htm_para7"><a name="08050765001660">Following the Committee&#146;s comments on direct elections, I am told that the Broads Authority will consider the principle in its meeting on Friday, after we have heard what the Minister has to say this afternoon. The authority believes that direct elections are a  matter for the Government and are not appropriate  for the Bill.</p>

<p><a name="st_o247"><a name="08050765001661"><a name="80507-0015.htm_spnew1"><a name="08050765003206"><b>David Taylor (North-West Leicestershire) (Lab/Co-op):</b>
 I did indeed chair the Committee, which included the hon. Members for Preseli Pembrokeshire (Mr. Crabb) and for Rochford and Southend, East (James Duddridge) and my hon. Friend the Member for Paisley and Renfrewshire, North (Jim Sheridan). There were not extensive concerns from across the spectrum at all, but the key concern that we heard from the people from whom we took evidence was about the accountability and representative nature of the Broads Authority. It was important that our comments to the House covered the suggestion that that concern should be remedied through direct election, such as that which we see in the national park authorities and elsewhere. I hope that what is proposed and what the Minister  <br>

requires will be adequate to meet the concerns that we heard over the days in which we took evidence. That is very important. I found most of the rest of the Bill to be worth while and understandable.</p>

 I thank my hon. Friend for that intervention. I look forward to hearing what the Minister has to say about taking the issue on and about how it will be handled. It not only reflects on the Broads Authority but has implications for other waterways authorities.</p>

 I thank the hon. Gentleman for raising that question. The matter has been resolved in Scotland, so it seems to me that there are lessons to be learned there. He and I have had discussions with the Broads Authority, and I believe that the door was beginning to open on this issue. We both said in public, and to the local newspaper, that it would be a good idea to try to find ways forward, as direct elections would allow the many people who want to play a part in the broads to go through an electoral process. There is a public mood for that to happen, and I think it should be encouraged. I hope that the Broads Authority will respond positively on Friday, and that the Minister will give the proposal all the backing that he can.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o285"><a name="80507-0015.htm_para8"><a name="08050765001665">Some of the issues that arose on Second Reading have been handled in the appropriate way, through open debate. I think that there is much more to come, but I repeat that the House must understand that no provision for direct elections can be put on the face of the Bill. The Bill has implications for other areas of the country, and new legislation may be needed if we want direct elections in other places. If that is the decision of the individuals concerned, I shall give it my support.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o286"><a name="80507-0015.htm_para9"><a name="08050765001666">Of course, promoting a private Bill was not chosen lightly as a course of action. After many years of discussion with Government officials, it became clear that that was the only route open to the authority if various important matters of safety were to be addressed. With many of the proposals, the authority is following a path already paved by British Waterways and the Environment Agency, and it acknowledges the help and advice that those organisations have given.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o287"><a name="80507-0015.htm_para10"><a name="08050765001667">It is worth putting it on the record that the authority is also grateful to successive Ministers in the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs: my right hon.

has been highlighted by the requirements of the port marine safety code and by specific incidents. The principle underlying them was accepted on Second Reading and in Committee, and I do not intend to repeat the argument here.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o289"><a name="80507-0015.htm_para12"><a name="08050765001669">The agreements with the national boating organisations have also raised some issues. For the past two years the Broads Authority has been working hard with the Royal Yachting Association, the British Marine Federation and the Inland Waterways Association to develop and refine the Bill. It has reached agreements with them over the Bill&#146;s provisions, and they can be seen in schedule 1.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o290"><a name="80507-0015.htm_para13"><a name="08050765001670">My hon. Friend the Member for North-West Leicestershire mentioned two specific issues arising from the Committee stage. Evidence and arguments from the Broads Authority were considered in July 2007, and four petitioners and their agents were heard at that sitting. The Committee also received a report from the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs. A full discussion of the relevant issues was held, and the Committee concluded that the Bill should be allowed to proceed, with some amendments. The Broads Authority put forward a number of amendments to deal with concerns raised during the consultation process, while other amendments were designed to meet recommendations from the Secretary of State that included questions about how membership of the Broads Authority came about.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o291"><a name="80507-0015.htm_para14"><a name="08050765001671">The status of the legal agreements was raised on Second Reading. As is often the case with private Bills, the Broads Authority entered into agreements with interested parties about the operation of certain provisions in the Bill. Following concerns expressed by the Committee, the authority and the national boating bodies gave further consideration to those agreements, with a view to incorporating certain of their provisions in the Bill. In that regard, I invite hon. Members to look at schedule 1, where they will see that words such as &#147;independent&#148;, &#147;scrutiny&#148; and so on have been added.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o292"><a name="80507-0015.htm_para15"><a name="08050765001672">A number of the provisions in the agreements  were already covered in the Bill, either specifically or in general terms.

 As I said, parish councillors are very important, and they should be part of the equation that is considered by the Broads Authority. There are questions to do with parish councils, including whether they cover the whole area of the broads and how much of the broads is in each parish. That is not perhaps as important as having people on the authority who are devoted, enthusiastic, keen, determined, knowledgeable and interested in spending many hours helping to develop the broads.</p>

Of course, we have no idea what climate change will do to them; we cannot greatly control that, but we will make attempts to do so.</p>

We had discussions on the issue, but the advice that we were given was that some other formal regulatory pathway would have to be used to put that into the equation. That is not an excuse to do nothing; I believe that the sincere intention is to try to use a mechanism, as soon as possible, to ensure that that happens in the broads and in other areas, with the Norfolk broads blazing a trail. The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs is well placed to consider those issues with the Broads Authority, and to bring forward the necessary legislation.</p>

Bill is not the place in which to seek to make changes to the membership of the authority, but that is certainly an issue to be considered.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o300"><a name="80507-0015.htm_para23"><a name="08050765001682">I hope that the Bill will successfully complete Third Reading and move on to the other place. Its proposals affect the rights of navigation and would improve safety on the broads, to the benefit of all those who use the waterways. The objective of public safety is a legitimate ground for qualifying what might otherwise be an unhindered public right. Consider, for example, the measures that Parliament introduced for the protection of motorists. It made the wearing of seat belts compulsory&#151;it was predicted that that would be a failure, but it has been an amazing success&#151;and it gave local authorities the ability to regulate the way in which roads are used. So there are parallels setting out how to make effective changes and improve the safety of people who use facilities. Many of the provisions in the Bill are well precedented elsewhere. The authority believes that it has the correct balance, and the Bill incorporates the necessary measure of protection for the private individual. Of course, there will be individuals who do not agree, but in general many people seem to think that the measure should be in place. Like the seat belt regulations, I think that  the measure will become part and parcel of people&#146;s way of life; it will be part of the way in which they use the broads.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o301"><a name="80507-0015.htm_para24"><a name="08050765001684">Before the Bill was deposited, the authority spent a year on preparatory work, and on consultation and discussion with DEFRA, national and local boating organisations and other key stakeholders. Discussions with national boating bodies have continued, and resulted in many of the changes that have been made as the Bill has progressed. If we are honest, we know from experience that things evolve and change: the spirit is there, as long as public safety is foremost in those equations and considerations.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o302"><a name="80507-0015.htm_para25"><a name="08050765001685">There was widespread consultation, and changes were made by the authority to meet the concerns that were raised. No petitions were received from any organisation in the House but, importantly, there were four private petitioners. All the issues pursued by boating organisations have been addressed. The authority has secured agreement with the main boating organisations on the Bill&#146;s provisions. It is important to introduce the Bill&#151;the summer is a-coming, and boats will be scurrying around the broads&#151;and we should push the legislation through, although I expect that it will be held up in another place.</p>

As I said, in a year or two years, other changes and differences may arise in that environment that require extra legislation. Who knows what will happen?

 Yes, I am 100 per cent. for trust, confidence-building and making sure that there is firm representation so that if people have a grudge or gripe, they can go to the Broads Authority with their complaint and have it taken seriously and something can be done about it. The spirit of the Bill, and the way in which it has been talked up and discussed, will allow that to happen. When it was introduced, such measures might not have been quite as up front as they are now, but I hope that if we get the Bill through, and if it completes its passage through the other place in the next few months, we will have a new spirit on the broads, and people will be able to enjoy that lively part of the world. It is in everyone&#146;s interests to make sure that we agree to Third Reading today.</p>

The blocking motion has ensured, too, that the Bill has received another airing in the House, which is a good thing.

It is right, too, that people out there who are concerned about the Bill have their case made. Part of my contribution today will be to highlight some of the continuing concerns. As the hon.

Byelaws may be slower to implement, it is suggested, but they force the unelected and otherwise unaccountable Broads Authority to enter into public consultation. That is the perspective of the people who have raised their concerns with me. On insurance, they say that compulsory insurance does not need to be introduced via a private Bill. Procedures for submission of current insurance at the time of vessel registration should be sufficient.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o307"><a name="80507-0016.htm_para3"><a name="08050765001697">General and special directions are a topic that has engendered a considerable amount of debate. It revolves around the extent to which traditional freedoms are constrained by regulation and executive power. It is argued that the directions in the Bill are onerous and costly to implement. It is likely that the authority will fund the entire additional expenditure from the navigation account or toll income, thus further reducing the amount available for waterways maintenance, particularly of those parts of the system in need of dredging.</p>

 It is incredibly important that we maintain the resources necessary to continue the dredging work. There are real concerns among navigators, not so much about the flooding issue&#151;although I take the hon. Lady&#146;s point&#151;but about the fact that dredging work for navigation purposes could be diminished. The issue comes back to the point that the authority must balance the three interests, but must not neglect any of them. The concern expressed is that navigation could be neglected if we are not careful.</p>

 To take the issue a step further, I should say that I understand that the people who use the broads would supply up to 30 per cent. of the total budget of the Broads Authority. The danger is that if not enough money is spent on keeping the broads clear of silt, there will be fewer navigable broads and therefore probably less income because fewer people would use them in the end. The Broads Authority might well be forced into increasing the amount of silt dredging in certain parts of the broads.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o309"><a name="80507-0016.htm_para5"><a name="08050765001702">I turn now to general directions. There is concern about what consultation means and whether public bodies listen to the outcomes of consultations. The point made to me is that the authority might operate the process properly, but in the end it can ignore the result of the consultation and do exactly what it originally wanted anyway. The issue comes down to trust in the authority and whether the navigators believe that their interests are being properly pursued. It is felt that there is a loss of public freedom because of unnecessarily increased control. Specific reference is made to general direction 4.6, which, it is said, allows revocation of or change to any general direction. I am told that that is an unacceptable and inappropriate additional power.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o310"><a name="80507-0016.htm_para6"><a name="08050765001703">I have been informed that the special directions restrict or prevent the free movement, anchorage or mooring of vessels. That affects the rights of the master of a vessel, the right to navigate the current extent of the navigation area, yacht racing in windy conditions and the rights, granted by the Magna Carta to all common men, to free navigation and fishing on tidal waters. Furthermore, it is said that the Bill allows a navigation officer&#151;it may not be the particular navigation officer, but the one who happens to be on duty on any particular occasion&#151;to &#147;revoke or amend&#148; a special direction at any time for any reason without justification or consultation.

person must hold. There are also concerns about the powers in relation to adjacent waters: to be effective, the Bill must clearly define &#147;adjacent waters&#148;, but that is not attempted. There is no such definition in the Bill; it is down to the interpretation of officers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o312"><a name="80507-0016.htm_para8"><a name="08050765001705">I am told that the Bill sets out to transfer responsibility for Breydon Water to the Broads Authority without provision for additional funds. There is a potential liability for substantial and ongoing maintenance costs, but the authority freely admits that today it does not have the funds for essential maintenance within its existing area.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o313"><a name="80507-0016.htm_para9"><a name="08050765001706">The hon. Member for Norwich, North referred to the agreement, which appears already to be in place and stipulates the circumstances in which and processes by which the navigation committee will be consulted by the authority. People are concerned about that. They say that the Broads Authority should be adhering to it, but at its first opportunity has failed to do so. Under the agreement, the proposal to change the navigation committee appointments system should have been referred to the committee, but it was not. Again, that comes down to the question of trust between the two sides. The navigation committee wants to ensure that there is a clear continuing statutory duty to consult it. During the Bill&#146;s evolution, the original section of the legislation that places a duty to consult the navigation committee has been removed. When the Minister winds up, I want to be absolutely sure that a clear duty to consult remains in the Bill.</p>

People say, with some justification, that that removes transparency of accounting for toll payers&#146; funds and leaves several important points undefined, such as the year-end surplus or deficit in the navigation part of the merged account. Transparency on the use of funds, particularly toll payers&#146; funds, is very important. People also say that changes imposed by DEFRA mean that the additional national park grant funding can no longer be directly applied to maintenance of navigation, which is unacceptable.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o315"><a name="80507-0016.htm_para11"><a name="08050765001708">People say, in summary, that the Bill changes the remit of the Broads Authority from a management role to one of controlling and restricting navigation. They also refer to the Norfolk and Suffolk Broads Act 1988. That is similar to the National Parks Acts, but in addition to their two primary purposes, it includes a third&#151;to protect the interests of navigation without, as with the National Parks Acts&#146; Sandford principle, a mechanism for conflict resolution across all three equal responsibilities. Toll payers object to the Bill because it provides the means for an unscrupulous future Broads Authority&#151;they do not make that charge against the current authority&#151;to resolve conflict by use of general and special directions to the detriment of the right to navigate: in other words, &#147;Sandford by stealth&#148;.</p>

 I think the hon. Gentleman knows the sort of numbers we are talking about following the meeting that we held with the Broads Authority. As I said earlier, there is a range of views on the Bill. There is a body of people he knows of, and they are represented in several of our constituencies, including those of two of the Conservative Members present. A number of people care passionately about this, have ultimately good motives and have the right to have their concerns heard.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o317"><a name="80507-0016.htm_para13"><a name="08050765001712">One assumes that the Bill will become law, and it then becomes a question of the Broads Authority proving that it was wrong in its concerns&#151;that the powers will not be abused, that they will be used properly and proportionately, and that there is an opportunity to rebuild trust between the two sides. That is why I called the meeting, and I was grateful to the chairman and chief executive of the Broads Authority for agreeing to it. It is in everyone&#146;s interests, including the objectors and petitioners, that we get to a point where trust is re-established and they feel, despite the tensions that will always exist, that the Broads Authority is doing its work properly in protecting the interests of the navigation community. One of the things that could go a substantial way to rebuilding trust is the holding of direct elections. That would create a sense of accountability for the organisation, and I shall go on to address that issue.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o318"><a name="80507-0016.htm_para14"><a name="08050765001713">I begin by quoting the Prime Minister. When he became Prime Minister, he said:</p>
<a name="80507-0016.htm_brev0"><a name="08050765001714"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;I want to build a shared national consensus for a programme of constitutional reform that strengthens the accountability of all who hold power&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o319"><a name="80507-0016.htm_para15"><a name="08050765001715">I completely agree with that sentiment, and we could start by addressing the powers of quangos. Those bodies are ultimately not accountable to the public whom they serve. The Bill provides us with the opportunity to promote the idea of establishing greater accountability for organisations that are currently unelected and ultimately not answerable to the people whom they directly serve.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o320"><a name="80507-0016.htm_para16"><a name="08050765001716">That issue was first raised on Second Reading, and reference was made to the Scottish experience. Two national parks were established in Scotland with direct democratic representation from the start. Interestingly, they appear to be working very well. The wheels have not come off, there has not been a revolution and there appears to be a reasonable degree of interest and participation. In a report to the Broads Authority Board, at its meeting on Friday, the chief executive referred to the Scottish experience. He said that the practical arrangements for the elections appear to have worked well. Turnout in one of the two national parks was 60 per cent., and in the other it was 40 per cent., which was still above the turnout in local elections in many parts of the country. In my experience, people do care about the parks that cover their areas, particularly in Norfolk, although we must be clear that the Norfolk broads are not formally a national park.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman&#146;s argument has a number of attractive aspects, although I feel that we need fewer elections in this country rather than more. On the other hand, we will have unitary reorganisation in Norfolk whether we like it or not, and that may well result in fewer local authorities being voted for. Even   <br>

 Although it is laudable to undertake pilots, much democratic representation on national parks is already happening in Scotland.

 I am not sure whether the hon. Gentleman has just arrived, but I had made the point about Scotland. However, I am grateful for the intervention and he is right to say that the experience appears to be positive.

 I am afraid I am not in a position to respond to that. However, I believe that 20 per cent. of the boards of the national parks in Scotland is directly elected. I have an open mind about the exact percentage to be directly elected. I realise that the local communities are just part of the group of interests that should be properly represented in the democratic process. I have suggested that two or three members of the board should be directly elected, but of course that depends on the size of the board.</p>

 Absolutely. We are talking about the same thing&#151;20 per cent. of the board of the two national parks in Scotland is directly elected. I would like something along those lines to be established in the Norfolk broads.</p>

However, I hope that the board will send out a clear signal on Friday that it supports the principle of direct elections, which, above all else, it would be in its own interests to do.

<p><a name="stpa_o328"><a name="80507-0017.htm_para0"><a name="08050765001736">The Minister has an opportunity today to indicate whether he supports the principle. I suspect that we might risk entering into a long-winded consultation with all the other national parks before any decision is taken. I urge the Minister to consider whether it is worth experimenting in England. We have an ideal opportunity to do so through the Broads Authority, which can be distinguished from the national parks, because it is not in fact a national park. We can try the principle of direct democratic representation on the Broads Authority and see what lessons are learned in a few years&#146; time. At that stage it might be appropriate to extend the principle to other national parks. They might choose to proceed earlier than that. If they did so, I would be delighted. However, I do not want inertia on the part of other national parks to delay the opportunity to develop an important principle.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o329"><a name="80507-0017.htm_para1"><a name="08050765001737">How can we achieve that? The first option, which I favour, is to achieve it through the Bill. I am told that it is impossible to amend the Bill at this stage to introduce direct elections. If that is the case, regrettably I must accept that. However, I should also like to ensure that the idea does not disappear into the long grass, never to be seen again. I want the principle  to be pursued.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o330"><a name="80507-0017.htm_para2"><a name="08050765001738">There are two other options that I should like the Minister to consider and respond to. First, is it possible by way of an order, rather than primary legislation, to introduce a principle whereby a proportion of the Secretary of State&#146;s nominees would be elected by local people and would then become the appointees of the Secretary of State? Could we use the existing mechanism to introduce direct elections? The attraction of that option is that it could be done much more speedily than having to wait for primary legislation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o331"><a name="80507-0017.htm_para3"><a name="08050765001739">The other option is that which the hon. Member for North-West Norfolk (Mr. Bellingham) put forward in his intervention, whereby we use the opportunity of local government reorganisation, which we are told is likely to be imposed on Norfolk in a couple of years&#146; time, to introduce direct elections. Local government reorganisation would inevitably result in a change to the make-up of the Broads Authority board, because there will be fewer local authorities, and would therefore be an ideal moment. That would create a massive challenge for the Government, because it would require two Departments to work together, but I am sure that the challenge can be met and the opportunity seized.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o332"><a name="80507-0017.htm_para4"><a name="08050765001740">In summary, the Bill contains important elements that should go on to the statute book. No doubt it will proceed to the House of Lords today, where it should be scrutinised. It is important that those who oppose it have the opportunity to continue their case, but let us use this opportunity to progress the case for direct representation.</p>

The rest of the board could be made up of three representatives from local authorities, three directly  <br>

elected representatives&#151;one of those local representatives should, perhaps, be a direct representative of the parish councils within the area, because they have a stake&#151;and two representatives of the navigation interest. That is one possible model. I do not particularly favour it, but it should be considered. We want a board that is workable and of a reasonable size, but we want the mix to be right.

There is a reason for that, which is clear from looking at the National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act 1949 and Lord Sandford&#146;s review of national parks in the early 1970s. National parks have two basic purposes: conservation of the natural environment and providing the public with access to those areas. If there is a conflict between those aims&#151;or, I should say, if it is not possible by skilful management to reconcile them&#151;conservation should come first. However, the Norfolk and Suffolk Broads Act 1988 makes it clear that there are three purposes for the authority:</p>

Member for North Norfolk mentioned the Royal Yachting Association, the British Marine Federation and the Inland Waterways Association.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o340"><a name="80507-0017.htm_para12"><a name="08050765001751">However, the hon. Gentleman did not mention the Norfolk and Suffolk Boating Association or the Norfolk Broads Yacht Club&#151;and for good reason. Although discussions took place with the Norfolk and Suffolk Boating Association, it has expressed certain fears since the Committee chaired by the hon. Member for North-West Leicestershire met. I should like to quote one of the petitioners, Mr. Philip Ollier, the executive secretary of the Norfolk and Suffolk Boating Association. In an e-mail this year, he wrote:</p>
<a name="80507-0017.htm_brev1"><a name="08050765001845"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;In September 2007, the Broads Authority Chief Executive brought forward proposals to alter the way appointments are made to the Navigation Committee&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o341"><a name="80507-0017.htm_para13"><a name="08050765001752">It is worth noting that that was written in September, after the Committee of the House had considered the Bill. Mr. Ollier goes on to say:</p>
<a name="80507-0017.htm_brev2"><a name="08050765001846"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Previously eight places on the committee were allocated to persons nominated by bodies representing the various navigation interests.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o342"><a name="80507-0017.htm_para14"><a name="08050765001753">The charge made is that</p>
<a name="80507-0017.htm_brev3"><a name="08050765001847"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;The process will be open to manipulation by the BA Executive and follows similar changes that have been implemented to reduce the representation of navigation interests on the Broads Authority itself. Given the changes to the composition of the Navigation Committee, the assurances obtained in the negotiations about the Bill start to look less reliable.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o343"><a name="80507-0017.htm_para15"><a name="08050765001754">A constituent of mine, Mr. Graham Trimmer from Poringland, has expressed his fears in even more colourful terms. Referring to the issue of public safety, he said:</p>
<a name="80507-0017.htm_brev4"><a name="08050765001848"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;the Chairman of the Broads Authority appears to suggest...that the Bill is only about public safety. This is a smokescreen, since adequate byelaws were enacted and came into force in April last year, allowing for the enforcement of a comprehensive boat safety scheme.&#148;</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o345"><a name="80507-0017.htm_para17"><a name="08050765001756">These are examples of people&#146;s concerns about the Bill. I fear that the way in which the authority has conducted itself&#151;even to the extent of supposedly entering into legal agreements with the concerned bodies&#151;has, in the words of the Committee, created a legal ambiguity, and perhaps created more problems than it has solved. When I first heard about the legal agreements that were being entered into, I wondered how it was possible to enter into such an agreement with a third party in relation to a Bill that had not yet been passed. I wondered what possible effect those agreements could have in law, in terms of the subsequent powers of the authority, given that the Bill had not yet been passed. Indeed, the Committee appears to agree about that. Paragraph 9 of its report to the House states:</p>
<a name="80507-0017.htm_brev5"><a name="08050765001849"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;It is our view that such agreements would not have any legal effect as they could not be seen to fetter the discretion given to the Authority in the legislation once the Bill was enacted.&#148;</p>

Where an authority has planning powers, as this one does, it seems quite wrong that there should be no directly elected input if a way can be found to achieve that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o347"><a name="80507-0017.htm_para19"><a name="08050765001758">I fear that the authority&#146;s approach has not enabled the House to give it the warm cross-party endorsement that it might otherwise have had, and serious concerns among our constituents remain. That said, there will be further opportunities in the other place. As the hon. Member for North Norfolk said, the ultimate test will be the behaviour of the authority in interpreting and using its powers in the years ahead. If the fears of the navigators prove justified, we will know soon enough, and we will have the opportunity to do something about it in due course.</p>

 I will try to keep my comments brief. The Bill was blocked last year by my hon. Friend the Member for South Norfolk (Mr. Bacon) and myself&#151;not to destroy it, but to enable the fears of some of our constituents to be aired on the Floor of the House. Many of the issues have already been well presented by the hon. Member for North Norfolk (Norman Lamb), who steered the Bill through the Commons, and by other colleagues. I shall not go over all the detail again.</p>

As a consequence of our previous debates, the first and now the second blocking motion, the work of the Committee and the Bill&#146;s consideration in the other place, it is hoped that the relevant issues will be addressed. I remind you, Mr. Deputy Speaker, that the very nature of the Bill has changed. The original conception was to establish the broads as a national park, but that Bill had to be withdrawn for lots of reasons. One is that the Norfolk and Suffolk Broads Act 1988 was legislation for navigation, so establishing the broads as a national park would cause all kinds of problems, as my hon. Friend the Member for South Norfolk said.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o349"><a name="80507-0017.htm_para21"><a name="08050765001761">The Norfolk and Suffolk broads are a hybrid. That is the key issue; in many respects, they are a one-off. I shall not deal with detailed issues of navigation, as my hon. Friend the Member for South Norfolk has already done so. We aired those issues widely in our debate of a year ago. I want to touch on another issue that was raised then and has been raised again today by the hon. Member for North Norfolk&#151;the whole business of having some directly elected members on the board. I am not going to go into the different permutations of how it might be done. I am almost surprised that an alternative vote system was not proposed, but the key issue is a matter of principle. Ironically, it is more important today than it was when we debated it in April. It is crucial, because local people feel that they should be represented on a board and able to affect their communities, their livelihoods, and the nature of the broads itself, directly.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o350"><a name="80507-0017.htm_para22"><a name="08050765001762">Many of us were in Westminster Hall yesterday morning to participate in a debate that I was fortunate enough to obtain on flood defences in Norfolk. One of the issues raised there was that various Government advisory boards could put forward proposals that would have a direct impact on communities in north and mid-Norfolk. Ultimately, actions over the next 50 years or beyond could change the very nature of the broads, but I am not going to go down that path in any more detail. However, the fact that local communities feel they do not have a say is of fundamental importance, and all Norfolk Members seized upon that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o351"><a name="80507-0017.htm_para23"><a name="08050765001763">Two Members raised another important point. The boundary committee is looking into unitary authority reorganisation in Norfolk. The hon. Member for North Norfolk and my hon. Friends the Members for South Norfolk and for North-West Norfolk (Mr. Bellingham) suggested that as a consequence of the committee&#146;s work there could very well be changes in the make-up of local government in Norfolk. Interestingly, paragraph 3.1 of the proposals that will go before the committee later this week says:</p>
<a name="80507-0017.htm_brev6"><a name="08050765001850"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Although the Broads Authority is not included in the review, clearly the likely reduction in the number of constituent local authorities will lead to a further change&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o352"><a name="80507-0017.htm_para24"><a name="08050765001764">The assumption that this will go through is a big assumption, not least because&#151;this directly relates to the representation on the Broads Authority&#151;there is no way in which the people of Norfolk can make their views clear about any possible reorganisation of local government in Norfolk. Consultations and stakeholders are mentioned, but there is no way in which the people can make their views clear. Whatever line one takes on whether there should be unitary authorities, it is unarguably the case that there has been no test of public opinion. That reinforces the view of many people in Norfolk that there should be directly elected representatives on the Broads Authority. I agree with the hon. Member for North Norfolk that all the advice we receive is that the Bill cannot be amended to provide for that. We know that the Minister will consider this issue, and, given that the Norfolk and Suffolk broads are a hybrid, I urge him to think of a way in which the natural concerns of Members and our constituents can be met.</p>

 I thank the hon. Gentleman for his comment&#151;he, too, has a direct interest in this matter&#151;and he is right.

 Is the hon. Gentleman aware that although it is true that the Norfolk and Suffolk Broads Act 1988 does not allow for direct elections, there are&#151;I am told&#151;provisions within it whereby local authorities can change, which would take away the heat about unitary status?</p>

 Yes; as I have said, there are different permutations for doing that. One of the depressing aspects of the debate on this issue, dating back now over a year, is what appeared to be the reluctance of the Broads Authority to go down this path on the grounds that it would all be too difficult. That is key. The Broads Authority&#151;and politicians in opposition and in government&#151;ought to recognise the following point, in relation not only to this subject but to many others: the public are no longer prepared to have largely unelected bodies telling them what to do in matters that directly affect their local communities. They want direct representation on such bodies. I agree that we can look into how to achieve it, but that is the major point I want to put to the Minister. Although there are slight differences within the Norfolk political community about how to get there, we all agree upon that.</p>

excellent Adjournment debate in order to discuss what an amenity the broads are, and what enjoyment they provide nationally; we are not just talking about the community of Norfolk and Suffolk&#151;predominately Norfolk&#151;but the larger community. Those things could be put at risk.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o355"><a name="80507-0018.htm_para1"><a name="08050765001772">The Bill will update the Norfolk and Suffolk Broads Act 1988, giving the Broads Authority various new powers. The Bill will combine the navigation and general accounts into one. It will enable the authority to do, among other things, the following: to apply effectively the national boat safety scheme to reduce the risk of fire and explosion; to introduce compulsory third-party insurance for boats in its area; to license hire boats; to give the Haddiscoe Cut a public right of navigation; to make possible the transfer of responsibility for the navigation on Breydon Water from the Great Yarmouth port authority; to make a voluntary agreement to manage water skiing and to distinguish between water skiing and wakeboarding so they can be managed separately; to control pollution from boats; to remove the requirement for a separate Norwich navigation officer; and to widen the range of bodies involved in the appointment of members to the authority by the Secretary of State. As the hon. Member for North Norfolk said, real safety issues are involved.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o356"><a name="80507-0018.htm_para2"><a name="08050765001773">Perhaps this is an opportune moment to record my interest in this matter. I always try to attend boat shows whenever possible. Two years ago, I was fortunate enough to go to the Southampton boat show, and over the past year or two I have been fortunate enough to attend the London boat show. It is magnificent to see some of the vessels that ply the broads and the impact that boat building has on the whole of East Anglia. As I represented Essex North East and Essex North and Suffolk South in the European Parliament for 10 years, I regularly visited some of the boat builders, who contribute hugely to the local economy. We should not lose sight of that fact.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o357"><a name="80507-0018.htm_para3"><a name="08050765001774">This is a good opportunity not only to congratulate the sponsor of the Bill, who moved the Third Reading eloquently, but to have regard to a number of the issues that have been raised and were objected to earlier. I pay tribute to colleagues who served on the Committee on the Broads Authority Bill, not only the hon. Member for North-West Leicestershire, whom I mentioned, but my hon. Friend the Member for Preseli Pembrokeshire (Mr. Crabb), my hon. Friend the Member for Rochford and Southend, East (James Duddridge), who has become quite an expert in these matters, and the hon. Member for Paisley and Renfrewshire, North (Jim Sheridan). As a number of hon. Members have said, we should recognise that many of the concerns have been translated into amendments that have been incorporated into the Bill.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o358"><a name="80507-0018.htm_para4"><a name="08050765001775">All hon. Members who have spoken mentioned democratic accountability. I represent only a small section of the North Yorkshire Moors national park, so I am not a great authority on it, but&#151;as the hon. Member for North Norfolk said&#151;on some occasions those who serve in the public interest in that regard plough a lonely furrow.</p>

democratic accountability. In paragraph 10, the Committee concluded forcefully that, in its view</p>
<a name="80507-0018.htm_brev0"><a name="08050765001851"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;the Broads Authority and local people would benefit from the provision for direct elections to the Authority with a view to ensuring that the principle of direct representation of local community interests should be guaranteed. This would ensure that the Authority could be held to account and that there was a democratic means of moderating the powers enacted within the Bill.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o360"><a name="80507-0018.htm_para6"><a name="08050765001777">I listened carefully to what my hon. Friend the Member for South Norfolk said. My hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Norfolk also recorded his view that the public will have no truck with bodies that do not have some form of electoral representation and democratic accountability. We cannot emphasise that forcefully enough.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o361"><a name="80507-0018.htm_para7"><a name="08050765001778">My main question for the Minister, with regard to paragraphs 10 and 11 of the special report and having heard the views expressed so eloquently today, is whether he will give the House an assurance that the Government are minded to table an amendment in the other place at an early stage to address that omission from the Bill. We have heard about that omission from the sponsor and from other hon. Members in this debate. The sponsor&#151;the hon. Member for Norwich, North&#151;said that a compromise appears to have been reached on the model in Scotland. Is that the model that the Minister will follow?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o362"><a name="80507-0018.htm_para8"><a name="08050765001779">We wish to give the Bill a fair wind today, but we respect the caveats that were raised by the Committee. We take heed of those issues that have been raised today, and we should have regard to the fact that the broads have a unique place in the affections of the British, as well as in the local economy. Does the Minister believe that all three functions&#151;the general and special directions to vessels, the insurance questions and the appeals procedure&#151;are all set out clearly in the Bill? Is he satisfied that there is a balance between the three functions I mentioned earlier&#151;to conserve and enhance the natural beauty of the broads, to enhance the enjoyment of the broads, and to protect the interests of navigation?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o363"><a name="80507-0018.htm_para9"><a name="08050765001780">One final issue concerns the licensing of rescue boats. While the Committee was agreeable to that being removed from the Bill, for the reasons of safety that several hon. Members have mentioned, could the Minister put our minds at rest about whether that issue will be considered in the other place?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o364"><a name="80507-0018.htm_para10"><a name="08050765001781">I take great heart from the debate today, having seen in my own area how planning issues work in national parks. It is absolutely right that democracy should be seen to work. People should be seen to have a voice and a say. If they were to elect a proportion of those who serve on the Broads Authority, and if they did not like what they did, they could remove them when they were due for re-election. At the moment, that is not possible. If the Minister could explain to us where he and his Department think that they are going on that, we would make great progress.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o365"><a name="80507-0018.htm_para11"><a name="08050765001782">I have enjoyed listening to the arguments, as I did not participate in previous proceedings. In its own way, the Bill is important. I completely understand the reasons for which my hon. Friends sought to object to the Bill. I understand not only that proceedings have been going on since the original Bill in 1988, but that people have been trying to move proceedings forward on this Bill since 2003.

 I begin by congratulating my hon. Friend the Member for Norwich, North (Dr. Gibson), the sponsor of the Bill, on how he put the arguments and presented the discussions, both in the House and outside it in the various communities in and around the Norfolk and Suffolk broads. I thank all hon. Members from both sides of the House, as it has been a measured debate in which people have expressed concerns on behalf of their constituents, as is right.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o366"><a name="80507-0018.htm_para12"><a name="08050765001784">It is also important for us to appreciate the general nature of the broads and of national parks. The broads are part of the national parks family and every citizen in this nation has a stake in those wonderful areas. The work undertaken by many members of those authorities is appreciated. People work hard in the interest of those authorities, and they take their responsibilities seriously. We are grateful for their efforts.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o367"><a name="80507-0018.htm_para13"><a name="08050765001785">I endorse the comments made by my predecessor on Second Reading. As the Minister responsible for the national parks and the broads, I confirm that the Government remain firmly supportive of the aims of the Broads Authority Bill. Let me emphasise the wider support given to the broads. The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs was able to announce a three-year funding settlement in 2008-09, which gave the Norfolk broads &#163;4.304 million pounds&#151;a cash increase of 115 per cent. over the past 10 years. Our commitment is on the record. That amount will rise to &#163;4.4 million by 2010-11 and further in the future. We will also provide special grants of &#163;500,000 for 2008-09 and &#163;400,000 for 2009-10 and 2010-11, which will specifically enable the authority to implement its sediment restoration strategy and restore the broads&#146; ecosystems. The authority has taken direct control of dredging the rivers and broads, a move that it is anticipated will enable it to achieve 25 per cent. more dredging than last year for the same amount of money. That is good news for toll payers and for taxpayers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o368"><a name="80507-0018.htm_para14"><a name="08050765001786">I am aware that the Bill has already been the subject not only of an earlier debate but of scrutiny by the Select Committee. My hon. Friend the Member for North-West Leicestershire (David Taylor) is no longer in his seat, but all hon. Members have paid tribute to him and to the members of the Committee for the good service that they gave to the House through that process. It is not surprising that any changes to our most protected landscapes will invariably raise concerns, but I am delighted that we are in general agreement on both sides of the House. It is right, is it not, that we should raise concerns about such wonderful landscapes? Hon. Members have said that the Bill should be subject to scrutiny. I endorse those remarks.</p>

improvements to the way in which the Broads Authority operates. The introduction of the boat safety scheme is already ensuring that vessels are properly maintained. British Waterways and the Environment Agency already operate the scheme successfully, and I congratulate the Broads Authority on the measures that it has taken to bring the broads into line with the other major navigation authorities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o370"><a name="80507-0018.htm_para16"><a name="08050765001788">I am aware that some people consider that the Bill&#146;s safety provisions could be dealt with through byelaws, but I do not agree. It would be impossible to use byelaws to introduce compulsory insurance, as it would be too cumbersome to amend them each time there was a change in standards.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o371"><a name="80507-0018.htm_para17"><a name="08050789000011">I turn now to some of the questions raised in the debate, after which I shall deal with the subject of direct elections. The hon. Member for North Norfolk asked various questions about insurance, but I think that I answered them all earlier. The proposal to merge the general and navigation funds is a technical measure, and the Bill ensures that the Broads Authority will give a clear account of what has been spent on navigation and on other purposes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o372"><a name="80507-0018.htm_para18"><a name="08050789000012">The hon. Member for North Norfolk also asked about the duty of the Broads Authority to consult the navigation committee. In its latest form, the Bill does not remove that duty. He also asked about the right of free navigation. That was included in one of the petitions to the Committee, which considered that the powers were necessary. The hon. Gentleman was concerned that protecting the interests of navigation could result in Sandford by stealth, but it will not. The broads&#146; three purposes remain as set out in the 1988 Act, and this Bill does not change that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o373"><a name="80507-0018.htm_para19"><a name="08050789000013">The hon. Member for North Norfolk also asked about the boat safety scheme. As I said, it would be too cumbersome to use byelaws for that purpose, as the Department would have to approve each amendment to them. He asked about changes to the navigation revenue account, which now returns to what it was before 2005-06. Some dredging can be for purposes other than navigation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o374"><a name="80507-0018.htm_para20"><a name="08050789000014">Some concern has been expressed about the relationship between the Broads Authority and communities in the area. The hon. Member for Mid-Norfolk (Mr. Simpson) was especially interested in that and, as he said, the true test will be how the Broads Authority is judged to have used that relationship. Important safeguards in that respect are in place: the Broads Authority is accountable to the Audit Commission and to the local government ombudsman, and the broads forum is another way of keeping it in touch with local user groups.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o375"><a name="80507-0018.htm_para21"><a name="08050789000015">The hon. Member for North Norfolk began his discussion of direct elections by quoting a newspaper that agreed with him. Perhaps he issued a press release saying that the <i> Eastern Daily Press </i>agreed with him and the newspaper printed that, but it was interesting to hear a Liberal Democrat speaking in favour of a first-past-the-post system. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will clarify whether he is in favour of that system for the Broads Authority. It is a very important point.</p>

 There we are; that did not take a great deal of scratching beneath the surface, did it? So the Liberal Democrats want proportional representation to be used in elections to the Broads Authority. That is a perfectly honourable position to take, and it is consistent with his party&#146;s line. Some Members in my party support proportional representation, too. I do not, and I do not think that anyone in the Conservative party does. That shows that we will need to look at the issue and reach a conclusion.</p>

 I think the Minister will find that I am not. This is interesting banter, but the use of proportional representation would imply that the voting will be partisan, and that is certainly not my impression. Is the Minister expecting parties to put up candidates for the elections? Surely that should not be encouraged, and I am not sure that that has been the experience north of the border.</p>

 We have opened a can of worms. I will come on to the detail, but I point out to the hon. Gentleman that I have discussions with members of authorities from across the country. I would not know which political party they belonged to unless I asked them directly, because they put their park, or the broads, first. People put being an authority member first. I have never heard of party politics coming into the situation in relation to either the Broads Authority or one of the park authorities.</p>

 I completely agree with the point that the hon. Member for Rochford and Southend, East (James Duddridge) made; one would expect the elections to be entirely non-party political. That has been the experience in Scotland. I would like a clear indication of whether the Minister supports the principle of direct elections to the authority.</p>

 I am coming to that point. In the case of the two national parks in Scotland&#151;the Cairngorms national park and the Loch Lomond and the Trossachs national park&#151;a percentage of authority members are directly elected. That appears to work well. I do not want us to lose the opportunity to have that discussion. It has been suggested that such a scheme be piloted in the broads, but we know that the process has worked well in Scotland, so one could say that there has already been a pilot.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o376"><a name="80507-0018.htm_para22"><a name="08050789000024">I want to look at the issue across the piece, because it is not only the Broads Authority that is affected. I want to understand the views of the other park authorities in England, and the views of the many people who have an interest in our national parks. The parks are not just local; they are national treasures. My constituents in Chatham have as much right to a say on how the parks are formed as someone who lives in the Lake district, for example.</p>

 I hope that the Minister is not procrastinating. A simple way forward would be to have a short consultation, and for the results to be published. I do not want to pre-empt what he has to say, but I am sure that all the national parks would wish to be consulted, as he rightly says. Having sensed the mood of the House this afternoon, I detect that there is strong feeling. I think that hon. Members would like to know what will happen when the Bill leaves this place today.</p>

 As a number of hon. Members have said, the Bill is not the appropriate vehicle to change the constitution of the Broads Authority. As I have signalled, I want to look at this across the piece to take account of the other national parks in England. I will therefore issue a consultation on the future of the constitution and the composition of the Broads Authority and other park authorities in England. I will advise the House when I intend do so. There will not be long delays, and I hope that I can issue something over the summer period.</p>

 Following the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Vale of York (Miss McIntosh), I hope that that can be done reasonably quickly, because we have been debating the measure for over a year. I recognise that the Department&#146;s views have changed and moved, which I welcome, but will the Minister bear two things in mind? First, at the end of the day, the Norfolk broads are not a national park: they are a strange hybrid. I accept that, from his point of view, it might set a precedent, but I urge him to move as quickly as possible. Secondly, the broads are a national treasure, and his constituents have every right to be represented, but my constituents and those of other hon. Members from Norfolk have an extra right, because this directly affects them, their livelihoods and, indeed, their future. If there is a wait&#151;and we could end up discussing numbers&#151;may I remind the Minister that we are not talking about such representation having anything more than a small minority on the board?</p>

 The hon. Gentleman is absolutely right. The broads are a national treasure, and the people who live around them are affected, as are their livelihoods and businesses. The same applies to all the national parks. The Peak district has the largest population of any national park within its boundaries, and 20 million people visit the Lake district. I want to look at this in the broadest sense.</p>

 With the leave of the House, Mr. Deputy Speaker. The only reason that I took up the Bill was that it involved safety issues.

When they have had the chance, they have been quite positive about some aspects, and we should be grateful for that. One or two issues have been misunderstood and I hope they will be ironed out in the other place.

Obviously, I regret the fact that the other place has voted in the way that it has,  but there is clearly a big disagreement between the  two Houses.</p>

Member for Cambridge (David Howarth), and also by such august bodies as the Magistrates Association, and what they have said, coupled with the reflection we have had from the Lords, means that we will not press this issue to a Division this evening.</p>

I have always had the intention of getting this Bill to Royal Assent by 8 May, and I feel that if we press this issue this evening we will severely complicate those matters. Therefore, I propose that we do not insist on the disagreement with the Lords, and I hope that the hon. and learned Member for Harborough, for whom I have had great regard during the passage of the Bill, and the hon. Member for Cambridge, will accept that with the good grace that I know they have within them.</p>

role properly on this occasion, by inviting a Government to take advice. They have clearly listened to the advice of the other place. I claim no credit for any part in the Government&#146;s decision making; we have all had to do what we have had to do. It happens that the House of Lords&#146; advice coincides with the remarks that I have been making, but that is a coincidence.</p>

 Earlier in the day, I had the intense embarrassment of hearing the remarks I made on this matter yesterday cited with approval by not only the Liberal Democrat spokesman in the Lords but the Minister there.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o400"><a name="80507-0019.htm_para23"><a name="08050789000069">I should reiterate what I was saying yesterday just for one purpose. Clause 10 was trying to deal with a problem that exists not just in respect of summary offences in the magistrates court, but in the Crown court&#151;perhaps to an even greater degree&#151;and in the magistrates court in respect of offences that are triable either way. The Government need to think about a holistic solution to the problem, not just a solution to one particular part of it, because by trying to resolve the problem in parts they threatened to cause a certain amount of confusion in the courts.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o401"><a name="80507-0019.htm_para24"><a name="08050789000070">Another problem was raised in the Lords, where a fair point was made by Lady Butler-Sloss. The Government&#146;s solution was to say, &#147;Perhaps we will implement this clause and then unimplement it.&#148; However, that would mean excessive change for the magistrates courts, in particular, to be able to follow. There has been too much change in the criminal law, one way or the other, for that ever to have been a plausible way out. I thank the Government for their concession on this matter, but I hope that they will keep thinking about how to resolve the problem, which they have rightly identified, in a more comprehensive way.</p>

However, as the Minister of State, Ministry of Justice, my right hon. Friend the Member for Delyn (Mr. Hanson), has explained, there is an urgent need for the Bill to receive Royal Assent.</p>

Of course there will be an opportunity&#151;doubtless there will be frequent opportunities&#151;to revisit the issue in due course if it is the will of this House or the other House to do so. On that basis, I would like to propose that we do not disagree with the Lords in their said amendment.</p>

 I congratulate the Government or, at least, this part of the Government, on having some connection with rationality; I congratulate them collectively and as individual Ministers on the part that they have played in brokering this sensible solution. I know that it is not easy for Ministers to have to accept alterations to legislation that they have so carefully thought about over many months, but the facts of life have returned to haunt them. I do not wish to crow about that for a moment. It is worth pointing out that of those who supported Lord Waddington&#151;to whom considerable praise is owed&#151;13 took the Labour Whip and two were bishops.</p>

My hon. Friend the Member for Arundel and South Downs (Nick Herbert) is at the Prison Officers Association annual conference, and I know that the Secretary of State will be there tomorrow, to read the speech that my hon.

It is a free vote, but we are making public law, and I would hope that all of us could sensibly agree that the position at which we have arrived, while not wholly satisfactory to everybody, is sensible and one that the rational elements among us can agree is the right way forward.

<p><a name="stpa_o409"><a name="80507-0019.htm_para32"><a name="08050789000081">The Waddington amendment remains unacceptable to me for all the reasons that I gave yesterday. It claims that there is doubt about a statutory provision about which there is no doubt. The new offence of stirring up homophobic hatred is clear. It can be committed only by threats or with intent. There is no doubt about its content. To put into the statute a section that says</p>


<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080507/debtext/80507-0020.htm"/>

</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o410"><a name="80507-0020.htm_para0"><a name="08050789000082">implies doubt where there is none and, by its very existence, throws into doubt the rest of the section.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o411"><a name="80507-0020.htm_para1"><a name="08050789000083">The second point is one that I return to without any regret. The Waddington amendment relies on a vague phrase&#151;&#147;of itself&#148;&#151;that is without clear meaning. It assumes that words can be spoken outside their context. We were told yesterday that the problem was that the police believe that words by themselves can be threats. That is nonsense. It is a bad argument that because someone else believes in nonsense, it  should be put into a statutory section. If ever a problem would better be dealt with by guidance than by statute, this is it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o412"><a name="80507-0020.htm_para2"><a name="08050789000084">I stick to the third point that I made yesterday, which is my most serious point. The part of the Waddington amendment about urging people to change their sexual behaviour is inherently dangerous, because it is about not only words but action&#151;action in a context that means it might well amount to threats. The exemption might be interpreted as creating a loophole, and not only that: in the longer term, people of ill will will be tempted to use the phrase as a euphemism&#151;a code&#151;for behaviour that is inherently threatening in its context and intention.</p>

<p><a name="st_o319"><a name="08050789000085"><a name="80507-0020.htm_spnew0"><a name="08050789001051"><b>John Bercow (Buckingham) (Con):</b>
 I entirely agree with the hon. Gentleman&#146;s assertion that the Waddington amendment is both superfluous and undesirable. The Government are conceding this point for entirely understandable, tactical reasons, but that does not affect the issue of principle. Does the hon. Gentleman agree that there is some significance in the fact that the most vociferous supporters of the Waddington amendment are people who have consistently opposed the creation of the offence of homophobic hate crime?</p>

<p><a name="st_o320"><a name="08050789000086"><a name="80507-0020.htm_spnew1"><a name="08050789001052"><b>David Howarth:</b>
 I fully agree. Anyone who was standing at the Bar in the Lords today, as I was, will fully accept that point and agree with the hon. Gentleman. If there was ever a circumstance in which people&#146;s words were different from their meaning, it was in the other place this afternoon.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o413"><a name="80507-0020.htm_para3"><a name="08050789000087">I accept that there is a problem that has to be dealt with. It is the problem of the misinterpretation by the police of existing law, which has led to some ludicrous investigations. It should be said that those investigations took place under the Public Order Acts, which use completely different words&#151;they talk about &#147;threatening, abusive or insulting&#148; language rather than threats alone, which are the words of the proposed offence.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o414"><a name="80507-0020.htm_para4"><a name="08050789000088">Nevertheless, there might be a problem. The question is about the right way to deal with that problem. The Government offered a way to do that today through the use of statutory guidance&#151;a proposal, as I said yesterday, with a good deal of merit. It was rejected by the House of Lords when they accepted the Waddington amendment. It is a sensible way of approaching the question.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o415"><a name="80507-0020.htm_para5"><a name="08050789000089">In addition, a proposal was put forward yesterday by the Liberal Democrats and, in a different way, by the Conservatives, to add some procedural protection under which the Attorney-General or the prosecution authorities, whoever they might be in the future, would have to have special regard to freedom of expression or, in the case of the Conservative proposal, to quite a few other human rights, too, before deciding to bring a prosecution. As I said yesterday, that is an important protection. It is not merely meaningless words, and it provides at least some hope of judicial review in some circumstances.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o416"><a name="80507-0020.htm_para6"><a name="08050789000090">Our view is that the right way to deal with the problem of the absurd investigations would be a combination of the Government&#146;s proposals on guidance and one of the procedural protections proposed by my party and the Conservative party. I deeply regret the fact that the Government have not chosen to go down that route. They had the opportunity to accept that route tonight, at this late stage. They chose not to, because of the lateness of the hour and the political circumstances in which they find themselves. I should remind the Government that they decided to add to the Bill the provisions about industrial relations in the prison system. They could have chosen a different way to do things. The Bill is full of far too many clauses on different issues that have been in the process of being dealt with for far too long. In terms of good legislative practice, it is near to being a disaster. On the offence that we are discussing, my party believes that tonight the Government have caved in to forces to which they should never contemplate caving in.</p>

 I should like to support my hon. Friend&#146;s amendment (a), which he wishes to pursue, and to identify and discuss the three reasons the Government find themselves in an unsatisfactory position. Two of their problems are self-inflicted, but one is a genuine problem that we discussed yesterday.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o417"><a name="80507-0020.htm_para7"><a name="08050789000092">The first self-inflicted problem relates to the timetable that they set themselves with regard to the prison officers issue, which has already been discussed. There were alternative ways of going about the matter. It is unfortunate that the Government are accepting a good offence being made worse because of the timetable. The second problem concerns their failure to win the vote in the House of Lords. If Members read the <i> Hansard</i> of both occasions, they will see that the argument was won, but the vote was not.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o418"><a name="80507-0020.htm_para8"><a name="08050789000093">The first time that the amendment tabled by Lord Waddington and his colleagues saw the light of day, the Government insisted on the House of Lords sitting late into the night, but regrettably they could muster only 57 people when the vote came. They lost by 81 votes to 57. The turnout was better tonight; I understand that the vote was 178 to 168, and that a significant number of Government Members were there. That is laudable, but as the hon. and learned Member for Harborough (Mr. Garnier) said, 13 Government Members still voted for the amendment. I am pleased to say that the Liberal Democrats in the other place were far more cohesive. I understand that none of them voted for the amendment. Given the numbers, the matter was in the  <br>

Government&#146;s hands; they could have prevented us from being in this position, and it is regrettable that they failed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o419"><a name="80507-0020.htm_para9"><a name="08050789000094">The issue of significance is the widespread concern, which I and other colleagues yesterday accepted exists, about the misapplication by the police of existing offences that threaten freedom of expression. The Under-Secretary of State for Justice, the hon. Member for Liverpool, Garston (Maria Eagle) kindly offered to meet us to discuss whether guidance could be provided, not just on the new offence that we are discussing&#151;I was pleased to hear her say that she still intends to produce guidance on that offence&#151;but on sections 4A and 5 of the Public Order Act 1986, which have caused widespread concern.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o420"><a name="80507-0020.htm_para10"><a name="08050789000095">It is acceptable and understandable for Members of this House to express concern about whether freedom of speech is unreasonably threatened by legislation, but as my hon. Friend the Member for Cambridge (David Howarth) set out, the offence of hatred on the ground of sexual orientation is very narrow. There is no doubt about the offence; the only doubt is introduced by Lords amendment No. 285. It will create more problems than it seeks to solve. The lesson is that although we must be vigilant about free speech, we must go about things in a more deliberative way.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o421"><a name="80507-0020.htm_para11"><a name="08050789000096">I ask the Government to consider thinking more deeply about freedom of expression and whether there could be a review of where we are now, so that we can ensure that the police, the prosecutors and the public know what they can do, and so that concerns are not expressed, as they were yesterday, about whether strongly held views that are offensive will be subject to the criminal law. I hope that the Government will recognise that the problem may come back again, unless there is clarity on that point; this is the second time that they have found themselves in difficulty on the issue.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o422"><a name="80507-0020.htm_para12"><a name="08050789000097">I make one final point. We Liberal Democrats are keen to preserve freedom of expression, as can be seen in our amendment (a). I recognise that there is support among Conservative Members for freedom of expression. However, I note that more than 50 Conservative Members voted last night to maintain our blasphemy laws. That is inconsistent of them. I regret the fact that we are in this position, and I will certainly vote in protest at the fact that we have not had the opportunity to register that regret.</p>

 It is a great pleasure to present to the House a petition on behalf of my constituents in Nash Mills parish, as well as the constituents of St. Albans, into where Lower Road bridge runs from my constituency.

That does not sound a particularly large number, but they represent nearly all the families who are having their lives blighted by the dangers of Lower Road bridge in Nash Mills. The Victorian bridge and tunnel has no footpath and was designed for the horse and carriage, not the 40-tonne lorries, buses, cars and motorcycles that go through the tunnel today.

 I am pleased to have secured this debate. I am very grateful to the Minister for staying behind to reply, particularly as we did not know what time it would be when we got to this stage.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o428"><a name="80507-0020.htm_para18"><a name="08050789000484">The subject of this debate&#151;the implications for Tewkesbury of the south west regional spatial strategy&#151;is especially important. Not only do we have green belt, green fields and beautiful areas in my constituency that we wish to protect, but, as the world knows, we have a problem with flooding. I say &#147;as the world knows&#148; because it is true. On recent trips to three countries in the far east and four countries in the Caribbean, my constituency of Tewkesbury was known about for the wrong reason&#151;the terrible floods of July 2007. It is worth remembering that as a result of those floods, three people lost their lives and thousands had their homes and businesses flooded. Hundreds of thousands lost mains water supplies&#151;some for up to three weeks&#151;and power supplies were affected. The effects of the July 2007 floods remain with us. Even now, almost 10 months on, approximately 385 households in my constituency are still displaced from their homes, and some are probably still months from returning to them. Business in certain parts of my constituency remains depressed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o429"><a name="80507-0020.htm_para19"><a name="08050789000485">I have held two Adjournment debates on flooding and on each occasion&#151;and on many other occasions&#151;I have said the following. People in my constituency accept that living at the confluence of two rivers means that the area will flood every so often. Fields in the area flood a number of times each year. Although we all accept that the rainfall of 20 July 2007 was exceptional, we believe that certain factors made the flooding worse than it needed to be. One factor was the poor maintenance of the culverts, sewers, drains, ditches and waterways, but the other factor was that too many houses have been built in flood risk areas. People accept that the area will flood, but the one overriding message that people give to me, which they want me to pass on to the Minister, is that we should not be making the situation any worse than it needs to be. We should mitigate, rather than escalate, the problem. Imagine, then, the disappointment and anger at the contents of the regional spatial strategy, which proposes the building of thousands of houses in my constituency, in areas that have to be classed as at risk of flooding.</p>


<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080507/debtext/80507-0021.htm"/>



<p><a name="stpa_o430"><a name="80507-0021.htm_para0"><a name="08050789000486">Before I go any further, let me state what should be the obvious. This is not just a matter of whether the new houses flood. Houses built in the wrong place take up field space that would otherwise have soaked up water, thereby preventing that water from resting on those fields. Water will be sent into other areas, causing terrible flooding. In other words, the run-off of water from one development causes other developments to flood. That fact should be obvious, but certain people just focus on whether the new houses flood. That is missing the point, either deliberately or otherwise. Those people also state that houses built in those areas should be flood-resilient. Again, that is missing the point, because the presence of these houses causes  <br>


<meta name="Date" content="7 May 2008">

<notus-date day="7" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>7 May 2008 : Column 817</b><br>
other houses to flood. It is my submission, therefore, that to build thousands of houses in or around my constituency would be madness. What further evidence, other than three deaths, people still being out of their homes and business still being flat 10 months on, do those taking the decisions need to persuade them to build houses elsewhere?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o431"><a name="80507-0021.htm_para1"><a name="08050789000487">In the RSS, the required number of houses for the whole housing market area is about 56,400, with 23 per cent. of these&#151;a total of 13,100&#151;proposed for the Tewkesbury district. If we want to talk about constituency boundaries, 27.7 per cent.&#151;15,600 houses&#151;would be within my constituency, much of which is a flood risk area. If we analyse those figures, we see that the RSS proposes the building of many houses at Longford and Innsworth, close to the Walham power station, which, as everyone knows, almost went under during the 2007 floods. If the water had risen much higher at that power station, hundreds of thousands of people would have lost their mains power supply, and that was almost the case. If that area is not at risk of flooding, what is? How can it make sense to propose to build houses in such an area?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o432"><a name="80507-0021.htm_para2"><a name="08050789000488">Houses also flooded in Bishop&#146;s Cleeve, but the RSS proposes the building of thousands of houses close to that village. Uckington floods, and flood alleviation schemes are being built to contain the River Chelt in that area. Yet again, thousands of houses are being proposed for that area, and 2,900 houses are proposed for the rest of the Tewkesbury district. From conversations that I have held with planners, it appears that those houses might have to be built close to Tewkesbury town, which was badly affected only last year, and remains so. No one can forget the television images of the town surrounded by water.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o433"><a name="80507-0021.htm_para3"><a name="08050789000489">The evidence of the problems of excessive building is already there for all to see. For example, in Bredon road in Tewkesbury, houses in the process of being built flooded, and houses that were built in Noverton lane worsened the flooding in the village of Prestbury, where in June&#151;never mind July&#151;houses flooded for the first time in people&#146;s 40-year memories. They flooded again in July of course, and the streets became like rivers. Who can say that those extra houses did not worsen matters?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o434"><a name="80507-0021.htm_para4"><a name="08050789000490">The Government often say that they have strengthened the case against building in flood risk areas through planning policy statement 25. However, a glance at that document, which was published in December 2006&#151;months before the terrible floods in 2007&#151;shows that the guidance on building outside flood risk areas is qualified by &#147;wider sustainability objectives&#148;. The &#147;exceptional test&#148; allows building in flood risk areas.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o435"><a name="80507-0021.htm_para5"><a name="08050789000491">So what is the principle that underpins PPS25? Is it avoiding inappropriate development in flood risk areas or ensuring that housing targets are met? In other words, the exceptional test undermines the principle of the whole document and disregards the dangers and major disruptions experienced by people who live in flood risk areas.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o436"><a name="80507-0021.htm_para6"><a name="08050789000492">As Sir Michael Pitt says in his interim report:</p>
<a name="80507-0021.htm_brev0"><a name="08050789001002"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Some respondents felt that the introduction of this test could be interpreted as a get-out clause for local authorities&#148;&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o437"><a name="80507-0021.htm_para7"><a name="08050789000493">or, in this case, the RSS. Crucially, he continues:</p>

</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o438"><a name="80507-0021.htm_para8"><a name="08050789000494">That is a good point. Who will buy those houses if they are perceived to be likely to flood, and if there are problems with insuring them? Earlier today, the Association of British Insurers told me:</p>
<a name="80507-0021.htm_brev2"><a name="08050789001004"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;We want to ensure that wherever possible new homes are not built in high flood risk areas. If they are, then insurers cannot guarantee to offer cover.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o439"><a name="80507-0021.htm_para9"><a name="08050789000495">Planning policy statement 25 calls for flood risk assessments to be made at all levels of the planning process. However, what flood risk assessments were made during the compilation of the RSS, a document that was largely drawn up before the floods of July 2007? Does not that in itself make it incumbent on the Secretary of State to require the authors to go back to the drawing board on their housing proposals?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o440"><a name="80507-0021.htm_para10"><a name="08050789000496">What constitutes a flood risk area? If the definition is based on annual likelihood of flooding, how can that be assessed if we accept that climate change is taking place? In other words, a place with a one in a  100 chance of flooding in the past can no longer be assumed to be in that category if the climate is changing as the Government tell us it is.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o441"><a name="80507-0021.htm_para11"><a name="08050789000497">We are, of course, supposed to be protected from inappropriate development by the Environment Agency. However, an appeal to build 600 houses near Longford in my constituency, close to Walham sub-station, is currently being considered by the Secretary of State. I have submitted photographs of at least part of that site when flooded, yet the Environment Agency did not even submit an objection to the application. Even worse, the Environment Agency said that the area did not have a monitoring station on the site, but it does. That station indicated flooding, so I hope that the Secretary of State will take that error into account when assessing the appeal.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o442"><a name="80507-0021.htm_para12"><a name="08050789000498">I suggest that the fact that the Environment Agency has not objected to the proposed building at Longford is evidence that, as currently constituted, it is simply not up to the job and its role should be reviewed. How can the Environment Agency, when it has seen the effects of the flooding in my area, fail to object to the proposals to build thousands more houses there? It defies belief. Of course, some might describe my objection to those houses as an example of nimbyism&#151;but if it is, so be it. I am paid to represent the people of my constituency, and I do not believe it to be in their best interests to have those houses.</p>

Village post offices are closing, including a further six in my constituency, pubs are closing at the rate of an estimated 27 a week, and village shops are struggling. So why not top up the housing stock in villages throughout the country? Many villages are calling for such development, partly so that their own people can continue to live in the villages where they were born.</p>

figures are a worry, with a total of 1.62 million more people coming to this country than leaving it over the past 10 years, which puts pressure on housing. That perhaps needs tackling as a separate problem. The method of calculation, immigration, the dispersal of houses and the planning process are all underlying issues that the Government should tackle, rather than allowing unelected regional bureaucrats to make crude calculations about the number of houses that we are supposed to need in each constituency.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o445"><a name="80507-0021.htm_para15"><a name="08050789000501">The Government have made two promises that are relevant to this debate. One, which they made before being elected to office, was to end the predict-and-provide approach to housing. That has not happened; in fact that approach has been entrenched, and on a regional basis, which is why we are in the current predicament. The second promise, made after last week&#146;s election results, was that the Prime Minister would listen to people&#146;s concerns.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o446"><a name="80507-0021.htm_para16"><a name="08050789000502">The Prime Minister paid a welcome visit to my constituency during the flooding. I now call on him, the Secretary of State and the Minister to listen to what the people of Tewkesbury are saying: that building extra housing to the level proposed by the RSS would make the risk of flooding in the area significantly worse, with the risk to life, property, business and possessions being greatly heightened.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o447"><a name="80507-0021.htm_para17"><a name="08050789000503">When he visited Tewkesbury, the Prime Minister saw for himself the water, the bowsers, the problems at Walham and the Mythe, and the enormous efforts that people were making to help each other. I know that he would not want us to go through that again. So through his Secretary of State and the Minister who is here tonight, the Prime Minister needs to reject the proposals in the RSS to which I have referred, in order to reduce that likelihood. To refuse to do so will be to fail to respond to the situation in which we found ourselves last year, and will also represent a failure to listen. As only the changes that the Minister makes to the RSS will be open to further public consultation, this is our last chance to affect the outcome of what, to us, is a crucial process.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o449"><a name="80507-0021.htm_para19"><a name="08050789000506">It would be helpful to start by giving some background to the regional spatial strategy. A regional spatial strategy is a requirement of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004. That piece of legislation, and the role of the RSS in particular, helped to strengthen the role and importance of regional planning. A regional spatial strategy&#146;s purpose is to set out a broad development strategy for a 20-year period. I acknowledge that the process undertaken in the preparation of a regional spatial strategy is often described as, at best, laborious. However, the regional spatial strategy is a vital document. The length of the process rightly reflects the need for extensive dialogue in its preparation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o450"><a name="80507-0021.htm_para20"><a name="08050789000507">A regional spatial strategy is a key component in achieving more sustainable development and provides a spatial context for local development frameworks and other strategies and spending frameworks. Regional spatial strategies include issues such as how much housing is needed, the general location where it should be built, the priorities for new infrastructure and economic development, the strategy for protecting countryside and biodiversity and the policy for reducing carbon emissions and safeguarding natural resources&#151;for example, water and minerals.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o451"><a name="80507-0021.htm_para21"><a name="08050789000508">It might also assist the hon. Member for Tewkesbury if I mentioned something about the history of the regional spatial strategy in his area of the south-west. As he will be aware, responsibility for the initial drafting of the regional spatial strategy rested with the regional assembly, which submitted its draft to the Government on 24 April 2006. A 12-week public consultation gave the opportunity to put comments to an independent panel, which was appointed by the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government to test the soundness of the draft regional spatial strategy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o452"><a name="80507-0021.htm_para22"><a name="08050789000509">Following that, an examination in public was held between April and July 2007 to discuss and test the draft regional spatial strategy before the panel. The length of the examination in the public stage reflected the level of interest in the draft RSS, with the panel reviewing comments from almost 2,000 different  parties. I understand that 191 organisations and  individuals took part in public hearings held in Exeter. The panel&#146;s report was submitted to the Government on 10 December 2007 and was published for information on 10 January 2008. It contains recommendations to the Secretary of State on all aspects of the draft regional spatial strategy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o453"><a name="80507-0021.htm_para23"><a name="08050789000510">I have now set out the background to the draft RSS, but I reiterate what I said in my opening remarks&#151;that I hope that the hon. Gentleman will understand that on account of the quasi-judicial nature of the process, I am very much constrained in what I am able to say at this stage about the detailed proposals contained within the RSS. I must point out that in taking quasi-judicial decisions under the Planning Acts, there is clear guidance for Ministers, which is based on advice from the Law Officers and First Treasury Counsel. A copy of the guidance can be found on the website of the Department for Communities and Local Government and is entitled &#147;Guidance on propriety issues in handling planning casework in Communities and Local Government&#148;. If it would assist the hon. Gentleman, I can certainly provide him with a copy of   <br>

it. That guidance outlines that Ministers should not enter into discussions with interested parties on the changes that might be made to a draft regional spatial strategy while consideration is being given to the panel&#146;s report.</p>

 I am very grateful; I was listening to the debate from another location. The Minister says that the examination in public took account of many hundreds of submissions. However, in an area called Leckhampton, which straddles the boundary between the constituency of the hon. Member for Tewkesbury (Mr. Robertson) and my own, up to 1,300 extra homes have been approved for building on land that is waterlogged as we speak. That development, which will increase flooding in parts of both my and the hon. Gentleman&#146;s constituency downhill, has been approved despite hundreds of objections from local people. In effect, those unelected inspectors have made this decision with no democratic accountability. If the Minister will not answer questions on this strategy, where are we to ask them and how are we to challenge this decision making?</p>

 The hon. Gentleman has made his case, but I am not that tempted to respond to it. As I have tried to explain, the whole process regarding the regional spatial strategy is a quasi-judicial one and I do not want to be tempted to make any comment that would prejudice in any way the Secretary of State&#146;s ability to come to an impartial view about the figures and the detail contained within the RSS. I hope that the hon. Gentleman understands that point.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o454"><a name="80507-0021.htm_para24"><a name="08050789000515">As I said earlier, the panel&#146;s report was submitted to the Government on 10 December and was published for information the following month. I am sure that the hon. Member for Tewkesbury would like me to explain, following the publication of the report for information, what the next step is. The Secretary of State is now considering the panel&#146;s report, along with all the representations previously submitted, and aims to publish her proposed changes as soon as possible. I must stress that at this stage no conclusions have been reached on any of the panel&#146;s recommendations. There will then be a 12-week period of public consultation when the proposed changes are published. That will be the opportunity for those interested in the content of the regional spatial strategy to make their comments known. Following consideration of comments and views arising from that consultation, the Secretary of State expects to publish the final regional spatial strategy before the end of 2008.</p>

and planning permissions on floodplains. I should, however, point out that the Government believe that effective flood defences are a vital component of new infrastructure, and that they will be an integral part of development. Also, it is for councils to take key decisions on individual developments, but we have put in place the toughest planning rules ever through planning policy statement 25. For the first time, all councils must now consult the Environment Agency on their housing plans, to ensure that all new homes are safe from flooding and properly sustainable for the future. Those new rules have been praised by Sir Michael Pitt and the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Committee&#146;s report on flooding, and they have been backed by the Association of British Insurers. I am pleased that we have put in place the toughest planning rules ever with regard to development on flood risk areas.</p>

<p><a name="st_o331"><a name="08050789000519"><a name="80507-0021.htm_spnew6"><a name="08050789001437"><b>Martin Horwood:</b>
 The Minister might be interested to know that not all the environmental organisations accept that the new planning guidance is sufficient, partly because it is only site-specific, so it does not take into account the overall landscape. If a site is entirely inundated with water, it does not really matter where the drainage goes. If the overall landscape has been allowed to develop in such a way that there is too much urbanisation, increasing run-off or increasing surface-water flooding, the local site-specific consultation will not be sufficient. Does the Minister not see the problem with that?</p>

<p><a name="st_o332"><a name="08050789000520"><a name="80507-0021.htm_spnew7"><a name="08050789001438"><b>Mr. Wright:</b>
 To some extent, the hon. Gentleman is making the argument for a regional spatial strategy. These matters sometimes transcend local boundaries, so it is important that we have a regional overview. Essentially, however, it is up to local authorities to carry out developments in a plan-led process, in order to make sure that the whole environment is considered when deciding where development should take place.</p>

However, I am sure he will continue to represent his constituents&#146; views energetically when the proposed changes are published shortly. He has done that tonight, and he did it in the debate in January.</p>
