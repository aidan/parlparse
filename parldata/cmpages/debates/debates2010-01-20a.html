 My recollection is that towards the end of last week-last Friday, I believe-the Secretary-General mentioned the figure of $550 million. We have already responded in the sense that for some time we have argued for use of the Central Emergency Response Fund, so that funds are available to the UN to disburse immediately rather than having to rely on money coming in through a flash appeal. The Secretary-General also indicated that $10 million would be spent directly from the CERF, which was, as I have said, originally a British idea. Secondly, we have made it clear that our funding envelope has been extended to $30 million-approximately £20 million. Within that allocation, we expect funding to go to the UN. We are already committing support to the logistics work of the Office for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs, as well as supporting the work of the International Red Cross and a range of other British agencies.</p>

 First, let me express the sentiment of the whole House, I am sure, in commending and feeling immense pride in the generosity of the British people in responding so overwhelmingly and so compassionately to the terrible scenes that we have seen on our television screens. We held our first meeting with non-governmental organisations last week and my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State for International Development has since had a second meeting with those NGOs, some of which have partners on the ground and some of which have long track records of working in Haiti. There will be a challenge in getting aid supplies into the country, which is why I am pleased to inform the House this morning that my right hon. Friend the Defence Secretary has kindly agreed to send to Haiti the Royal Fleet Auxiliary supply ship, Largs Bay, which will carry urgent relief supplies from UK NGOs and UN agencies. Following a direct request from the UN, it may stay on to assist in distributing supplies around Haiti.</p>

 Save the Children reports today that questions regarding who is in charge of Haiti are causing tension. Does the Secretary of State agree that Haiti urgently needs a single Government entity, comprising the Government of Haiti, the United Nations and perhaps lead donors such as the United States, France and Canada? How will he use his good offices to bring that about as early as possible?</p>

can we help you help?" That is a fair indication of the true spirit of working together that characterises the international response. While, of course, the Haitian Government are central, it is fair to recognise both the depleted capacity of that Government before the earthquake and the very severe damage done to them as a result of it. Similarly, the UN, of course, leads the international co-operation, but its own compound in Port-au-Prince was devastated. The UN continues to co-ordinate the international relief effort, but I am glad to say that it is able to rely heavily on the generous and immediate response offered by the United States, which has more logistical capability and a greater ability to respond immediately than any other partner that the UN could look to. It is in that spirit of co-operation that I hope matters will be taken forward.</p>

 I can give my right hon. Friend the assurance that he seeks. I have been in regular touch with Cathy Ashton, the new High Representative, and the Under-Secretary of State for International Development, my hon. Friend the Member for Worcester, attended a meeting of European Development Ministers in Brussels on Monday. I participated in a conference call on Sunday afternoon with Bernard Kouchner, the French Foreign Minister, and Miguel Moratinos, the Spanish Foreign Minister-the Spanish hold the presidency of the European Union at the moment. Since then, my right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary has been engaged in the discussions as well. All that is in addition to the operational work being undertaken with ECHO, the institution that is co-ordinating the humanitarian response of the European Union.</p>

 As the horrors in Haiti continue to unfold before our eyes, the term "aid effectiveness" seems a rather emotionless concept. May I join the Secretary of State in his tribute to the British contribution, be that the one being made on the ground or people's generosity in giving donations? I recognise the utter devastation challenging the co-ordination of what goes on in Haiti and the policy responses, but will he assure us that what appeared to be conflicting priorities on what to do first in Haiti have been resolved?</p>

 In incredibly challenging circumstances, the international community is working against an established pattern of priorities. First, in the rescue phase, 24 international search and rescue teams have been deployed in Haiti, and I am proud to say that that includes 64 British firefighters. Beyond the rescue phase comes the recovery phase, when we must look to the United Nations to provide the well-established cluster system, whereby individual organisations are tasked to take responsibility for basic human needs, be that food, water, shelter or medicines. Some of the criticism relates to the use of the airport. Approximately three flights a day came into Port-au-Prince before the earthquake and comfortably in excess of 100 flights a day now land there. However, it is important that we continue to work together to improve the situation on the ground.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman's question reminded me of a comment made yesterday by Paul Collier, the distinguished development economist. When he was asked how the Government of Haiti could get back on their feet, he said that they were not on their feet before this crisis. We need to recognise that that country has a traumatic history. The principal funders of development support to Haiti have been the United States, France and Canada. We expect them to continue to take a leading role in the rebuilding phase, but a conference has been organised for Monday by Stephen Harper, the Canadian Prime Minister, which I believe will focus on the challenge of how we take the relief effort forward into the recovery phase.</p>

I fear there may be further deaths once the whole damage that has been done is clear, particularly in the United Nations section of Port-au-Prince. We will do whatever we can to back up the 11,000 troops that the Americans have sent, and the medical supplies.</p>

 I am grateful for that answer. It is not just that 3 million have been affected and 2 million left destitute, and that parts of the country have lost half their buildings; as the Prime Minister said, Haiti will need significant external help with everything, including its whole Government, for many years to come. Of course, we all want to see this old republic govern itself, but in the short and medium term, can the Prime Minister tell us what consideration he is giving to supporting new joint structures through which the UN and the Haitian Government can start to rebuild basic services and government for a people who have suffered so much?</p>

 First, on finance, the Canadian Government are organising a funding conference next week to make sure that the international allocations that countries should make to the rescue effort are made. I may say that the European Union has already offered €400 million as a result of a ministerial meeting that took place.</p>

Gentleman raised. I have also talked to Ban Ki-moon, the Secretary-General of the United Nations, in some detail about this. It is important, of course, that the Government of Haiti are seen as the legitimate Government, but it is also important that the United Nations and, of course, the principal provider of supplies, the United States, can work with most effect together to deliver the co-ordination that is necessary. President Obama has explained to me that in addition to the military effort, which is massive-11,000 troops have gone in with field medical hospitals and every other kind of equipment that is necessary to help people-there is also the civilian effort of USAID, which is working very hard in the region, and, at the same time, the work that is being done by President Clinton and President Bush to co-ordinate the relief that is being given to people.</p>

However, I agree with the Leader of the Opposition that there are lessons to be learned for the future. We have a 1,000-strong civilian team ready to go to areas where reconstruction and stabilisation are necessary; some of them are in Afghanistan at the moment. The world must, at some point, come to a decision, first, that funding has got to be available to move immediately when there is a disaster; and secondly, that we need the signing up of professionals who are able to go at a moment's notice to help where there is a disaster in future, and that will require a UN reconstruction agency.</p>

case review will be produced, but only a summary of it will be published. These dreadful events follow the death of seven children between 2004 and 2009 in Doncaster. Can the Prime Minister tell us why so many warning signs were missed and why it took so long for the Government to step in?</p>

 This is a matter that is in the courts at the moment, but we are all agreed about the seriousness of this case. For two boys to be assaulted in such a way by two other children who were at that time in the care of foster parents, but who had a history in which there had been social services and other interventions to try to deal with their problems, is one of the most tragic cases that we could see.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o14"><a name="100120-0003.htm_para4"><a name="10012070000125">I do not want Britain to be defined by the appalling violence and irresponsibility that has been shown to these youngsters by two other youngsters. It is therefore important that we learn the lessons properly from what has happened. That is why a serious case review is undertaken. It has been said-the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children is one of the organisations that has suggested that this is the best course-that in the interests of people being able to tell the truth about what has happened, the summary is what should be published. That is what will happen, I believe by the end of this week. That serious case review will, in my view, demonstrate that there have been flaws in the organisation of social services. It is therefore necessary, with a new director of social services, with intervention already agreed by the Secretary of State for Children, Schools and Families and with Doncaster already under special measures as a result of that, that we learn all the lessons of what has happened.</p>

 I am going to come on to the issue of whether we should publish the report in full, because I believe that we should, but if the Prime Minister wants to learn the lessons, clearly one of the most important lessons to learn is why so much went wrong for so long before we intervened. If we look at the catalogue of errors, we see that seven children died between 2004 and 2009. There were five serious case reviews--one did not appear for three years--and, of course, in every case only a summary was published.</p>

Does not that alone demonstrate that serious case reviews are not leading to the correct action being taken?</p>

 Lord Laming looked at this last year and made recommendations which are being adopted.

As far as the serious case review itself is concerned, I think we have to wait until we see the findings of that review. I would not want to prejudge that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o17"><a name="100120-0003.htm_para7"><a name="10012070000130">The reason why the whole review is not to be published is that we wish to protect the identity and names of the children as much as anything else. We have had this argument before. The executive summary is published, which allows us to draw conclusions. The problem in Doncaster, if I may say so, is that there were many actions taken, but they were the wrong actions. They were not actions designed to prove that we had children of violence who had to be separated from parents of violence at an early time. That, I believe, will come out in the serious case review summary, which will be published soon. I think the Conservatives should listen to some of the voluntary organisations on this matter, and to Lord Laming himself, and wait for the publication of the evidence. Then let us by all means have the debate that is necessary on what further measures we can take. We know that Doncaster had to be intervened upon, and we know also that a serious case review will reveal what happened.</p>

 The Prime Minister tells us to wait for the publication of the review, but the review will not be published. Of course, I know that there are arguments on both sides about full publication, but are they not tipping in favour? The publication of summaries has not led to action. In the case of baby Peter, the summary was found to be completely inadequate-it was not worth the paper on which it was written.</p>

 I am sorry that the Leader of the Opposition is moving ahead on that point because every voluntary organisation and children's society that I know-and every professional whom I know-has recommended that the best way of proceeding is by publishing a summary of the serious case review. The reason is to protect the anonymity of the children and allow people to say things from which they can learn. The purpose of a serious case review is to learn lessons from what has happened. That is why the summary is published when people are clear about what lessons have to be learned. I hope that the Opposition will not stand isolated against all the professional advice and make an issue simply of whether we publish the summary or the serious case review, when we need to address the lessons that have to be learned from Doncaster.</p>

 Although there is no such thing as a perfect electoral system, the alternative vote would mean that every Member of Parliament returned would have the support of at least 50 per cent. of the local electorate. Unlike any proportional representation system, it would also maintain, and indeed strengthen, the constituency link that is so vital for all Members of Parliament. Will the Prime Minister therefore consider whether he can trust Members of the House and, ultimately, members of the public to have a serious discussion on electoral systems and consider what system they should use to send people here?</p>

 Ultimately, this must be decided by members of the public in a referendum.

Given the issues that have arisen about trust in politics, there is a case to be made for every Member coming here to have the support of more than 50 per cent. of the electorate, as a result of the alternative vote system. I believe that there is a case for a referendum on this issue, and that those who wish for reform will wish for a referendum on that basis.</p>

 With permission, Mr. Speaker, I should like to update the House on the measures that we are taking to enhance our security and our protection against terrorism. Yesterday, at a regular meeting of our National Security Committee, Ministers and I received the latest intelligence and information from the chiefs of our security and intelligence agencies, the head of the UK Border Agency, the country's senior counter-terrorism officials and police officers, and the Chief of the Defence Staff. Yesterday I also spoke to President Obama about our security measures.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o27"><a name="100120-0004.htm_para1"><a name="10012070000183">The failed attack over Detroit on Christmas day signalled the first operation mounted outside Arabia by Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, the Yemen-based organisation with close links to the al-Qaeda core in Pakistan. We know that a number of terrorist cells are actively trying to attack Britain and other countries. Earlier this month, the Home Secretary and the Transport Secretary made statements to Parliament setting out the urgent steps that we are taking to enhance aviation security, including new regulations for transit passengers. Today, following the advice that the Government have received, I want to announce further measures to strengthen the protection of our borders, maximise aviation security, and enhance intelligence co-ordination at home and abroad.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o28"><a name="100120-0004.htm_para2"><a name="10012070000184">Earlier today I paid tribute to those members of our armed forces who most recently gave their lives in the service of the security of our country in Afghanistan. The action that we are taking to counter terrorism at its source in the Afghanistan-Pakistan region and elsewhere is a central part of our wider counter-terrorist strategy. All our actions, which we will update regularly, are founded on what is and must be the first and most important duty of Government: the protection and security of the British people.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o29"><a name="100120-0004.htm_para3"><a name="10012070000185">Although the UK's borders are already among the strongest in the world, I now want to set out how we will further strengthen our protection against would-be terrorists: first, by extending our Home Office watch list; and secondly, in partnership with security agencies abroad, by improving the sharing of information on individuals of concern. I can announce that, as well as extending our watch list, we intend for the first time to use it as the basis for two new lists: first, a no-fly list; and secondly, a larger list of those who should be subject to special measures, including enhanced screening prior to boarding flights bound for the UK. We will use the new technology that we have introduced and our partnerships with police and agencies in other countries to stop those who pose the greatest risk from travelling to our country. But over the coming months we will go further in taking action against people before they even board a plane to the UK.</p>

It has already achieved significant success, enabling nearly 5,000 arrests for crimes that include murder, rape and assault. As a result of the £1.2 billion investment that we are making, by the end of this year we will be able to check all passengers travelling from other countries to all major airports and ports in the  <br>

UK, whether they are in transit or the UK is their final destination, by checking against the watch list 24 hours prior to travel and then taking appropriate action. The e-Borders system will give us a better picture than ever of people coming in and out of our country. My right hon. Friend the Home Secretary is meeting today with European counterparts to push for swift agreement at the European Union level on the ability to collect and process data on passenger records, including on travel within the EU, and to enforce the European Commission's recent approval of the transmission of advanced passenger information to our e-Borders system by carriers based in other member states.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o31"><a name="100120-0004.htm_para5"><a name="10012070000187">As the Detroit bomber highlighted, we also need-and we are sponsoring-research on the most sophisticated devices capable of identifying potential explosives anywhere on the body. As President Obama and I discussed yesterday, greater security in our airports, with the new body scanners introduced from next week, an increase in explosive trace testing and the use of dogs, must be matched by demanding greater guarantees about security in those international airports from which there are flights into our country. I can today inform the House that we have agreed with Yemenia Airways, pending enhanced security, that it suspends its direct flights to the UK from Yemen with immediate effect. We are working closely with the Yemeni Government to agree what security measures need to be put in place before flights are resumed. Aviation security officials are currently in Yemen looking at this. I hope that flights can be resumed soon, but the security of our citizens must be our priority.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o32"><a name="100120-0004.htm_para6"><a name="10012070000188">We will also work with our partners in the International Civil Aviation Organisation, the EU and the G8 to promote enhancements to the international aviation security regime, including stronger security arrangements in airports and greater sharing of information. The Home Secretary will be discussing initial proposals with European and American counterparts this week. We want to offer increased assistance to countries whose weaknesses in aviation security may present a wider threat to the international community, including to the UK.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o33"><a name="100120-0004.htm_para7"><a name="10012070000189">It is because we fully recognise the global nature of the terrorist threat we face today that our response must also be truly global. Plots against the UK and our interests originate in various parts of the globe. Some of the intelligence that we need in order to protect our people against attacks will be here in Britain; some will be held by our international partners and passed to us, just as we help them with our information about the threats they face; and some information will come from the most unstable parts of the world. So, in tackling these threats to life and to our way of life, our security services-and I pay tribute to all of them-need to be able seamlessly to track and disrupt terrorist activity and movements, whether within the UK or beyond. This requires ever-closer working between our agencies themselves, and with our international partners.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o34"><a name="100120-0004.htm_para8"><a name="10012070000190">I can announce that, as part of the work that I have asked the Cabinet Secretary to lead on intelligence co-ordination, our three intelligence agencies have already begun to set up joint investigating and targeting teams to address potential threats upstream, long before the individuals concerned might reach our shores, ensuring that at all times we continue to deliver improvements in  <br>

the way we collect, share and use intelligence, and building on previous reforms including the joint terrorism analysis centre that we set up in 2003, the office for security and counter-terrorism and the national security secretariat in 2007.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o35"><a name="100120-0004.htm_para9"><a name="10012070000191">In addition to all those measures to protect British lives at home and in the air, we are tackling the problem of global international terrorism at its source. I have said before that Yemen is both an incubator and a potential safe haven for terrorism, and that, along with Somalia, it is the most significant after the Pakistan-Afghanistan border areas. We and our allies are still clear that the crucible of terrorism on the Afghan-Pakistan border remains the No. 1 security threat to the west. At the same time, however, we must recognise that al-Qaeda's affiliates and allies, pushed out of Afghanistan and increasingly under pressure in Pakistan, are seeking to exploit other areas with weak governance, such as parts of Yemen and Somalia.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o36"><a name="100120-0004.htm_para10"><a name="10012070000192">In Yemen, we have been at the forefront of the international effort against terrorism for some time. We have been assisting the Government of Yemen through intelligence support and through support for its coastguard and for the training of counter-terror personnel. We are also helping to tackle some of the root causes of terrorism by supporting political, economic and social reform. By next year, our commitments to Yemen will total some £100 million, making the UK one of its leading donors. We are also increasing our capacity-building in Somalia, working with the transitional Government and the African Union.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o37"><a name="100120-0004.htm_para11"><a name="10012070000193">As with all aspects of the fight against terrorism, this new threat can be met only through enhanced co-operation, so we will now work more closely with allies in the region to pool efforts, resources and expertise. Next week, here in London, alongside our conference on Afghanistan, we will be hosting a special meeting to strengthen international support for Yemen in its efforts against al-Qaeda. We will help the Government of Yemen to advance their internal reforms, and we will increase capacity-building and development assistance in a way that directly addresses poverty and grievances that could fuel insecurity and extremism.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o38"><a name="100120-0004.htm_para12"><a name="10012070000194">Since 2001, we have reformed domestic defences against the terrorist threat, trebled our domestic security budget, doubled the staff in our security services and reformed our security structures to bring greater co-ordination across government. We have responded to the changing nature of the threat by bringing in new powers and new terrorism-related offences. Nearly 230 people have been convicted of terrorist or terrorist-related offences since 2001. Today's announcements demonstrate that we will continue to be vigilant, adapting our response to changing terrorist techniques. I commend this statement to the House.</p>

 I thank the Prime Minister for his statement. There is much in it that we welcome. We particularly welcome the emphasis on the national security approach-something that we have consistently called for over the past four years. I want to ask the Prime Minister about four areas in particular: the radicalisation of young British Muslims; how to increase security at our borders; international co-operation; and co-ordination within our own Government.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o39"><a name="100120-0004.htm_para13"><a name="10012070000196">First, on radicalisation, is not the key point about the Detroit bomber that he did not go to Yemen by accident and happen to get radicalised there? He was actually radicalised first in the United Kingdom and went to Yemen as a result. Does not that show that more needs to be done to tackle radicalisation right here in the UK? We welcome the belated decision to ban Islam4UK, having repeatedly called for it. Will the Prime Minister now go ahead and ban Hizb ut-Tahrir? The fact is that too many of our university campuses have tolerated organisations that have acted as incubators of terrorism. Is not one of the lessons of the last few years that we should act not only against the organisations that threaten violence, but against those that threaten our way of life as well? Is it not time for a proper review of the preventing violent extremism strategy?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o40"><a name="100120-0004.htm_para14"><a name="10012070000197">Secondly, there is the question of the security of our borders. We welcome many of the things that the Prime Minister said, particularly on the issue of a no-fly list. The subject of the list was raised by our security Minister, Baroness Neville-Jones, and we very much welcome its introduction. The introduction of body scanners is also welcome, but will the Prime Minister say whether he believes that they would have prevented this particular individual from boarding the aircraft in Amsterdam?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o41"><a name="100120-0004.htm_para15"><a name="10012070000198">As for the question of how we decide to search people at airports, obviously crude ethnic profiling is neither right nor effective, but that surely does not mean that we should not be thinking about how best to target our approach. I understand that the Detroit bomber appears to have displayed a number of high-risk factors: paying for the tickets in cash, carrying only hand luggage, and having previously been denied a United Kingdom visa. Does the Prime Minister agree that those factors should have set the alarm bells ringing? Can he tell us what is being done, in the light of this episode, to enhance the training of security staff at airports to identify those clear risk factors? Above all, when it comes to our borders, is it not time for a proper border police force rather than the pale imitation that we have had so far?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o42"><a name="100120-0004.htm_para16"><a name="10012070000199">Thirdly, international co-operation is obviously exceptionally important. Clearly we need to work with the authorities in Yemen to address the growing threat emanating from that country. We welcome such co-operation, but is it not important that these matters are handled properly? We were initially given the high-profile announcement of a big conference on Yemen next week, which now turns out to be a two-hour meeting in the margins of the summit on Afghanistan. Can the Prime Minister explain how that came about?</p>

need is a proper national security council with a national security adviser, at the heart of Government, which can address these issues in the round? The Prime Minister will say that we already have one, but let me put this point to him.

First, let me advise him not to draw conclusions too quickly about the nature of the citizen who was arrested for the Detroit incident.

Since July 2005, eight individuals have been deported on grounds of national security, and a further eight have made voluntary departures. So we take action when it is right to do so, and on the proscription of organisations, we take action when we have evidence that will stand up in a court of law. Decisions on proscription must be based on evidence that the group concerned is involved in terrorism as defined in the Terrorism Act 2000. It is not a party-political decision that is being made, but a decision on legal grounds that can be challenged in the courts. That is why the decision on Islam4UK was made in the way in which it was made, and that is why we have been careful in relation to what has happened over the organisation called HuT.</p>

We cannot be absolutely sure that the scanners we use at the moment are foolproof; they are the best we have at the moment, but we will continue to invest further in them. The point I am making today is if the UK invests in scanners, it will be necessary for other countries also to develop these sophisticated techniques so that we have protection not only in our country's airports, but in the airports from which people travel to our country.</p>

Gentleman has not drawn himself into this debate. The counter-terrorism strategy we need starts from what we do in the UK by securing our borders. It means having enhanced co-operation with the security agencies of other countries at all times, and it means that the de-radicalisation work we are carrying out goes on not simply in Britain but in other countries throughout the world to expose the extremists and to support the moderates and reformers. It leads us to take action in the Afghan border area to make sure that al-Qaeda cannot again gain a foothold in Afghanistan that would allow the Taliban to get back into power.

We took the action we did as part of a 43-nation coalition, which was supported by the UN and is still supported by the UN. This is one of the widest alliances ever formed; the reason for it is that we must prevent al-Qaeda from getting space in countries like Afghanistan in order to threaten the rest of the world.</p>

The Gowers review identified many steps that could be taken to allow our great cultural institutions-such as the British Library, the British Film Institute and the National Archives-to curate their works in a manner that allows all the opportunities of the digital age to be grasped. The review highlighted that the UK had far more stringent restrictions on copying classes of work for archival and preservation purposes than other countries.

Just because they do not have the capacity to lobby Governments as easily as the British Phonographic Industry, young people will react strongly at the ballot box if their internet rights are diminished. When they are told by an army of big publishing lobbyists that the creative industries are in peril, they have the capacity to Google a strong riposte.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o80"><a name="100120-0007.htm_para16"><a name="10012070000302">The first clause goes to the heart of the Bill. It is clear from the recent Second Reading debate that this is a pretty lousy Bill. It is conceptually flawed. Nobody from the Labour Back Benches spoke in favour of the Bill on Second Reading. On the Government Back Benches today I see two hon. Members. If I am not much mistaken, both voted against the Bill on Second Reading. It is not a Bill that excites much support or interest, and there is probably very little that can be done with it to save it from itself. The right hon. Member for Norwich, South (Mr. Clarke) put it well when he described the Bill as vacuous and irrelevant. That did not stop him voting for it, but perhaps he does not have high expectations of the Bills that his Government introduce for him to support.</p>

 Does my hon. Friend think that Labour Back Benchers are not present because the Bill says that they must cut public spending by about £100 billion a year by the end of the four-year period? Presumably that means that they do not think they will be in government, so that is not their problem.</p>

<p><a name="st_o174"><a name="10012070000304"><a name="100120-0007.htm_spnew9"><a name="10012070002929"><b>Mr. Gauke:</b>
 That might be one explanation. It is probably a better explanation than the one we heard in the winding-up speech on Second Reading from the Exchequer Secretary, who speculated that the absence of Labour MPs supporting the Bill was a result of the weather and that they were stuck in the snow. I suspect that my right hon. Friend makes a better stab at answering the question. In the course of the afternoon, we may get an explanation. As there appear to be no Back Benchers who are prepared to speak on the Bill, perhaps we will hear from the Front Bench.</p>

We are trying to bring some coherence to the Bill. They would not make it a good Bill, because it is still conceptually flawed and we do not support it, but one issue, which emerged on Second Reading, is worth exploring a little further.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o82"><a name="100120-0007.htm_para18"><a name="10012070000308">My right hon. Friend the Member for Wokingham (Mr. Redwood) first made the point in an intervention on the Chancellor of the Exchequer. My right hon. Friend raised the question of what would happen if there were a recession over the period that the Bill covers. The first duty, contained in subsection (1), is that of lowering the public sector net borrowing every year from 2011 onwards to 2016; the second duty, in subsection (2), deals with halving public sector net borrowing from 2010 to 2014; and my right hon. Friend asked, "What about automatic stabilisers? What happens in the course of a recession-were one to happen?" I appreciate that the Government are not predicting a recession, but then again they did not predict the most recent recession, either.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o83"><a name="100120-0007.htm_para19"><a name="10012070000309">That point was pursued by the hon. Member for Southport (Dr. Pugh), who intervened later in the debate, again on the Chancellor, and essentially asked, "What would have happened if this legislation had been in place over the last few years? Would the Chancellor have been free to bail out the banks?" Let us remember that this Bill represents a flagship policy: this is how the Government are to acquire credibility on the issue, because they are legislating to reduce borrowing. The Chancellor, in response to the question about whether he would be free to bail out the banks or be hamstrung by the legislation, said:</p>
<a name="100120-0007.htm_brev0"><a name="10012070002672"><ul><p class="tabletext">"No, because the Chancellor would quite obviously have to come back to the House if circumstances were as severe as those that pertained a couple of years ago. I do not think that anybody would argue for getting ourselves into a position through legislation where the Government were completely hamstrung and could not effectively govern the country. That would be nonsense."-[<i> Official Report</i>, 5 January 2010; Vol. 503, c. 70.]</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o84"><a name="100120-0007.htm_para20"><a name="10012070000310">That seems to be a reasonable answer, but it entirely undermines the legislation that the Chancellor was advocating.

 The hon. Gentleman makes an excellent point. That is exactly right. We do not accept the argument that declaratory legislation in these circumstances is of value, or that the Bill adds something to the credibility of the UK's fiscal position, but if we were to be sympathetic to the Government and accept those points, we would discover a difficulty, because the Government have set themselves a target that does not get to the heart of the issue-the structural deficit.</p>

Member for Southport made when he raised the bank bail-out issue might be regarded as a reductio ad absurdum argument, but it was helpful. If there is a crisis, the targets do not apply. That is the Chancellor's position. However, that does not quite answer the question, "What would happen if there was something not of the scale of the bank bail-out that we saw a couple of years ago, but a substantial slowing of the economy and, perhaps, a recession?" Clearly, the targets would become much harder to hit. Unemployment would go up and tax receipts would fall; and, if we look at borrowing as a percentage of GDP, we find that GDP falls so the percentage of borrowing would go up.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o86"><a name="100120-0007.htm_para22"><a name="10012070000314">The Opposition recognise the need for automatic stabilisers-our argument has never been about that-but I find it hard to see how anyone who has argued consistently, as the Government have, for a discretionary fiscal stimulus when the economy slows down, can support this Bill on reading it, because the targets are focused on public sector net borrowing, not on the structural or cyclically adjusted element.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o87"><a name="100120-0007.htm_para23"><a name="10012070000315">Of course, that argument works the other way, too. If the economy exceeds the Government's growth expectations-admittedly, that is fairly unlikely given that their expectations are somewhat greater than that of most independent forecasters-those targets may well be met either without imposing significant discipline at all or, certainly, by imposing much less than the Government have in mind. The focus must be not on public sector net borrowing, but on the structural element.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o88"><a name="100120-0007.htm_para24"><a name="10012070000316">I read the Chancellor's lengthy interview in the <i> Financial Times </i>at the weekend, and the full transcript was placed on the paper's website. There was an interesting section on whether the Chancellor had tried to remove the Prime Minister over the past few weeks, but the interview focused primarily on matters of fiscal responsibility. The Chancellor referred three times to getting the structural deficit down, but interestingly at no point in that lengthy interview did he refer to the Bill-suggesting that it is not exactly at the heart of his strategy to restore credibility to the public finances. Even the Chancellor does not appear to believe in it. The Bill is so discredited that he does not pray it in aid during a lengthy interview.</p>

that Governments should spend and borrow more when the economy is slowing down, or that the automatic stabilisers should apply, the wrong measure is to aim at public sector net borrowing. We should focus on the structural element. Indeed, if we read what the Chancellor told the <i> Financial Times</i>, we find that he focuses on the structural deficit. So if the Bill is supposed to reflect Government thinking and, essentially, be Government policy, and the Chancellor talks about the structural deficit, why does the Bill not deal with the structural deficit? Instead, it includes non-cyclical elements.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o90"><a name="100120-0007.htm_para26"><a name="10012070000320">I should point out that this is not in any way meant as some sort of Government trap. The projections that the Government have made in the pre-Budget report for public sector net borrowing and cyclically adjusted public sector net borrowing suggest that, in both cases, they should meet the targets that they have set out. Borrowing should fall in every year from 2010-11 to 2014-15. In both cases, the deficit will halve from 2009-10 to 2013-14. That does not make the duties more onerous or less onerous, as in both cases they should be met under the Government's own projections. We can have a debate about why we might need to be sceptical about those, but that does not fundamentally change the position.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o91"><a name="100120-0007.htm_para27"><a name="10012070000321">Of course, the Bill still has huge weaknesses that we will debate over the course of the afternoon, including its lack of an enforcement mechanism and the fact that it is, in many respects, a fig leaf to cover the Government's failure to set out credible spending plans to address the deficit. However, we could at least introduce a relevant measurement, which would partly address some of the concerns about the Bill. We have some scepticism about the Government's actions, but if they are trying to do what they say they are, the amendments would assist them.</p>

 The lead amendment in the next group, amendment 4, stands in my name and that of my colleagues, so I may take the opportunity then to speak slightly more broadly about clause 1 given that we are not having a stand part debate.

<p><a name="stpa_o92"><a name="100120-0007.htm_para28"><a name="10012070000323">I share the views of the Conservative spokesman in two regards. First, as was discussed on Second Reading, the Bill is inherently flawed and there are all kinds of problems with it. Just over a week ago, I took part in a radio debate with a Labour MP who, when I raised the issue of the deficit, said, "Of course we, the Labour party, are serious about the deficit. We're legislating to reduce it-how much more serious can one be than that?" She appeared to believe that that was a sensible argument to advance, and it is, essentially, the root cause of the Government's problems-their belief that they can solve a financial problem by passing a law saying that they have solved it even if they are not taking the necessary financial measures to address the difficulties that they find themselves in. That is the inherent flaw in the Bill, and what makes it so utterly preposterous.</p>

bad parts of it. One of those parts relates to a point that has been raised by the right hon. Member for Wokingham (Mr. Redwood) and others. Why would the Government wish to bring in legislation that prevents the operation of the automatic stabilisers, which we all accept and which the Prime Minister routinely boasts about, or champions, in relation to Government intervention to protect some of the most disadvantaged people in society? Why would they wish to impose on themselves a straitjacket that prevents such measures from being implemented to help the people who are hit hardest in a recessionary environment? That is not only an unintelligent position to take but, potentially, a very socially divisive one. It seems to Liberal Democrat Members that it is worth specifying that, even if one accepts the basic premise of the Bill that we should ourselves with the structural element of the deficit. Therefore, we would support the hon. Member for South-West Hertfordshire (Mr. Gauke) were he to press the amendment to a Division.</p>

 I rise to support the amendment tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for South-West Hertfordshire (Mr. Gauke). I am grateful to him for considering the problem that I, and others, posed on Second Reading.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o94"><a name="100120-0008.htm_para1"><a name="10012070000326">It beggars belief that a Government who have spent so much time claiming credit for the automatic stabilisers that all Governments have always used-it is something that happens naturally-should now try to legislate to stop their operation. They seem to be doing so in the spirit of a Government who think that their days are numbered and that it would be very amusing to pre-empt all the Budgets of the next Parliament by laying down in law what the overall shape of those Budgets should be. Moreover, they are doing so in such a way that if they leave a mess that results in a further downturn, or even a period of very disappointing growth, which is a possibility, the automatic stabilisers would not come into effect on the scale that they naturally would otherwise, so there would have to be offsetting action. I hope that the Minister shows, for once, that he is master of his brief, as he boasted at the beginning of the debate, and that he can understand this point and therefore wishes to support his Prime Minister's previous position, which was that the automatic stabilisers are a very good thing, and does not wish in any way to pre-empt their operation through the clause.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o95"><a name="100120-0008.htm_para2"><a name="10012070000327">Clause 1, which we are seeking to amend, is the kernel of this miserable piece of legislation. It says, correctly, that the excessively large deficit that the Government have built up has to be curbed. As my hon. Friend said, we object to it for two principled reasons. First, a deficit is curbed not by legislation but by changing one's spending and/or taxing plans so that one controls the budgets properly and sets them sensibly.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o96"><a name="100120-0008.htm_para3"><a name="10012070000328">Our second objection is that the profile of the reductions is wrong. It is not essential to cut the deficit in every year over a long period-not least, as we have heard, because of the need to look at the state of the economy-but it is terribly important to get on with cutting the deficit much more quickly than the Bill demands or the Government are requesting.</p>

Why does that matter?

Small businesses are having to pay many times the 0.5 per cent. minimum lending rate. The Government themselves are now having to pay eight to nine times their preferred short-term interest rate if they wish to borrow for 10, 20 or 30 years.</p>

Once their quantitative easing stops and they stop printing money to pay wages in the public sector, which looks as though it will happen within a few weeks, they may well find that there is another surge in the cost of borrowing, which will be another direct hit against the productive economy, people's aspirations, small businesses and those who wish to gain a mortgage and own their own home.</p>

 There is an Alice in Wonderland quality about the Bill, and particularly about clause 1. One particular passage from that book is apposite. I shall not linger on it for long, but it is the passage in which a large white rose tree in the garden is being painted red. Alice goes up to the gardeners timidly and asks why they are painting the roses. The answer comes:</p>

As you may remember, Sir Alan, nobody does get their head cut off in "Alice's Adventures in Wonderland" because there are in fact no real penalties, as there are none in the Bill. All that will happen is that Government Members will find themselves sitting on this side of the House quite shortly. The Bill has failed to convince the public of its intended purpose, perhaps because it will change nothing and cannot have any meaningful impact because it is just rhetoric. It is designed to create an impression that something has changed when nothing has, just like the coat of paint on those roses, and to make a Government who are bereft of ideas look as though they had a meaningful exit strategy from the economic crisis.</p>

Friend the Member for South-West Hertfordshire (Mr. Gauke) and my right hon. Friend the Member for Wokingham (Mr. Redwood) pointed out. Of course, having a policy to reduce the deficit is sensible, and it is Labour's failure to provide such a policy in the detail required to get us out the fiscal hole we are in that has so troubled analysts. It has also troubled the Treasury Committee, which berated the Government only a few weeks ago for their failure to add greater detail and clarity to the plan for cutting the deficit. However, having a statutory requirement to reduce the deficit is truly ridiculous, as my hon. Friend and my right hon. Friend illustrated.</p>

Let us set aside for the moment the ghastly truth that by the Government's own estimate, three quarters of the unprecedentedly large deficit-by the way, it is the largest in peacetime history, as far as I know-was caused by Labour's mishandling of the public finances. That is to say, it is structural. Clause 1(1) dismantles the stabilisers, which is why amendment 1 is absolutely essential if we are to make any sense of the Bill at all. It would enable it to address the right measure, which has to be the structural deficit.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o110"><a name="100120-0008.htm_para17"><a name="10012070000347">Of course, restricting the application of the Bill to the structural deficit might require an alteration of the targets in order to get the same level of desired reduction.

None of the major economies have made the mistake that the Bill does in any downturn in recent history.

 The hon. Gentleman is absolutely right. I could not emphasise that more strongly. What my right hon. Friend and I have been saying about debt is directly related to our credit ratings. If we lose that status in the international bond market, we are in very dangerous waters. That is why it is so essential that the underlying truth of the overall debt-net debt-is explicit, that we concentrate on it, that we get the figures right, and that we tell the British people the truth.</p>

Friend the Member for Chichester said. The crucial point is that public sector net borrowing is forecast to peak at 12.6 per cent. of GDP in 2009-10 before falling in every subsequent year, reaching 4.4 per cent. in 2014-15. The crucial point is that public sector net borrowing is forecast to peak at 12.6 per cent. of GDP in 2009-10 before falling in every subsequent year, reaching 4.4 per cent. in 2014-15. Of course, Labour will not be in government then-at least, I sincerely trust that it will not. The public sector net borrowing-based on those invented figures, which bear no relationship to the truth of the economy and are certainly not fiscally responsible-for 2008-09 is shown as 6.6 per cent of GDP or £95 billion, which jumps to £177.5 billion or 12.6 per cent. of GDP in 2009-10, which is the general election year. For 2010-11, the figures are almost the same and then-dramatically, as if to try to convince the British people, although they are unlikely ever to read this garbage-they fall suddenly to 9 per cent., then to 7 per cent., then to 5 per cent. and finally to 4 per cent. by 2014. That is a Houdini-style attempt to try to prove something that simply cannot be proved.</p>

However, the Government's difficulty, as my right hon. Friend said, is that the actual figures are dramatically more. He rightly mentioned Network Rail, the public sector pensions, which will cost £1 trillion, and nuclear decommissioning. The latter figure has not yet been identified, but we know that it will be substantial, especially if we go down the nuclear route, as we will have to do for the sake of our energy supply.

 It is wonderful that one Labour Back Bencher does have the time to talk about the odd £100 billion in cuts that are the subject of this Bill. As one who has done some work on this issue, I can tell the House that I simply applied company accounting principles, laid down by the Government, to the state's accounts. Why should they not apply to the country's accounts as much as to the companies that are made to follow them?</p>

 The most obvious answer is that a country is not a company. One of the difficulties in company accounting is the assumption that the company might not exist in perpetuity-<i> [Interruption.]</i> Well, this particular Government might not, but who knows? It is for the electorate to judge. However, this country, and its governing system, will continue to exist. Some assumptions have to be made in company accounting-for instance, when valuing pension liabilities-and one of those assumptions is that the company might cease to exist. That is perfectly reasonable. However, to apply that to public sector pensions is unrealistic and assumes somehow that this country might cease to exist at some point in the future and that all the liabilities would be paid up. If this country ceased to exist, that might be the least of our problems.</p>

The targets and time frames are set without a direct relationship to economic cycles or events-the classic example of the latter being 9/11. Such events can have a major effect on our economy, and have to be taken into account when using economic instruments to achieve appropriate outcomes.

 The right hon. Gentleman is nodding. That was a perfectly reasonable political objective and one that I supported, because of the problem of reassurance and-as much as anything else-unfamiliarity. The fiscal rules provided at least some framework for reassuring the wider financial community that the new Labour Government would follow a clear structure and not make ad hoc and irresponsible decisions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o146"><a name="100120-0010.htm_para1"><a name="10012070000417">The design of the rules, however, was imperfect even then. The difficulties with them were exposed when the crisis hit, but to be honest, as those who have looked at the Treasury Committee's comments on such matters over the years will know, many felt that they had imperfections even before the crisis hit. Part of the problem is that they tend to look in the rear view mirror. One is constantly looking at the past rather than setting public spending and economic priorities based on the future and projections. The past has some value in informing us, but it throws up difficulties, for instance with defining where economic cycles begin and end. We started to get into that in the middle of this decade. That could have been addressed using a better tool set, focusing more on the future.</p>

As much as anything else, the measures were meant to demonstrate a difference and send out the message that we would pursue our economic policies within a published framework, within a clearly understood reporting mechanism, and within a set of rules that appeared to have been set with a degree of objectivity.</p>

 I was in no position of responsibility at that time, so I cannot disagree with the right hon. Gentleman more authoritatively, but I would say that there were more factors behind the difficulties of the early '90s than that, although we all recognise that there is some truth in what he has said.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o148"><a name="100120-0010.htm_para3"><a name="10012070000423">I suspect that there is a consensus on the purpose of having something like what is proposed in the Bill. The exact mechanism, and whether we do things through a legal framework, are fair subjects for dispute. However, the need to build a clearer relationship with the wider economy in whatever we attempt to do in managing our fiscal future is essential. I have some doubts about whether the Bill does enough on that. The time frames within which we attempt to challenge the mountain of debt that we face also need to be debated. There is a genuine difference in policy on that. I take a firm view that rapid reductions in public spending have particularly deleterious effects in two ways. First, it is my experience that cutting rapidly means cutting badly. People cut the easy things; indeed, there is an argument that, in part, the Government too might be making that mistake. Capital expenditure has taken much the heaviest hit in the projections of where savings might be made, but it might not be the wisest place to do so.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman is making a thoughtful speech, as my right hon. Friend the Member for Wokingham (Mr. Redwood) has just said. Mention was made of the exchange rate mechanism, which is related to the stability and growth pact, and which is also part of the thinking embedded in the golden rules and the other rules, as well as the question of whether we can manage to get a responsible economy. I very much agree with the hon. Gentleman's sense of direction, but I would ask him to bear in mind that, although I do say so myself, a lot of these matters are conditioned, if not governed, by the criteria set down in the Maastricht treaty.</p>

 Which the Government have sought to distance themselves from, at least in part, by not joining the common European currency. Without hinting at my slightly dubious reputation on the Government Benches for being a Euro-realist, as opposed to a Eurosceptic, I start from the view that the Government made the right decision about that, and one that has stood us in good stead.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o149"><a name="100120-0010.htm_para4"><a name="10012070000426">My instinct is that the House probably shares more common ground on many of the subjects that we are discussing than will be conceded in a debate of this kind. The areas of genuine debate are partly to do with the speed with which we proceed. It would be wise to see clear evidence of economic recovery-certainly beyond today's encouraging unemployment data-before rapidly reducing public spending. However, public spending reductions also need to be approached using a rather more robust methodology produced over a period of time, rather than simply taking out the razor blade as  <br>

rapidly as we can. My instinct is that some of the steps that the Opposition have suggested fit into the category of saying, "Let's make some headline cuts that sound dramatic," but which are ill considered when set against a wider portfolio of policy making.</p>

<p><a name="st_o228"><a name="10012070000427"><a name="100120-0010.htm_spnew8"><a name="10012070002983"><b>Mr. Brooks Newmark (Braintree) (Con):</b>
 I apologise for missing the beginning of the hon. Gentleman's speech. I am sure that this point has been made, but he has made two important points about identifying where the fiscal responsibility lies, one part of which is about halving the amount that is out there. However, surely one important benchmark is where we start from. Neither the transparency of what is on balance sheet-obviously, that is what the Government go on about-nor the transparency of what is off balance sheet, which is what I, along with my hon. Friend the Member for Stone (Mr. Cash), my right hon. Friend the Member for Wokingham (Mr. Redwood) and everybody else on the Conservative Benches, go on about, is clear. It is important that we understand what the starting point is, and then think about where to go, rather than simply halving what is out there on balance sheet.</p>

<p><a name="st_o229"><a name="10012070000428"><a name="100120-0010.htm_spnew9"><a name="10012070002984"><b>Mr. Todd:</b>
 I, too, am sorry that the hon. Gentleman missed the start of my speech, because I touched on that point. We do not have a common data set that we can all share. Although there are areas of dispute-I am not sure whether this happened before or after the hon. Gentleman arrived, but I had an earlier exchange about one of them with the right hon. Member for Wokingham-there are also areas where intelligent people can probably largely agree. On such an important subject, it would be helpful to try to find as much common understanding as possible of what our difficulty is before deciding how to tackle it, which partly relates to the point that I was making before the hon. Gentleman intervened. Simply naming cut figures and headline items is a simplistic approach to tackling a long-term strategic problem for our country.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o150"><a name="100120-0010.htm_para5"><a name="10012070000429">Finally, the other useful aspect of this debate is the suggestion that what we are discussing is a problem that needs to be confronted. There are people-both in this House, to some extent, and certainly in the country at large-who would be prepared to accept a debt of roughly the scale that we confront now. They have equated our situation with that of others and said, "Well, the Italians managed perfectly well with a debt of that kind. Why shouldn't we just adjust our economy to deal with those changed circumstances?" I profoundly disagree with that position. Therefore, one of the values of this discussion is to expose that side of the debate and say, "No, that isn't the kind of economy that we would wish to run on in this country into the future." We are simply not equipped to achieve that, and trying to do so would have a thoroughly undesirable drag-anchor effect on private enterprise in any country where that took place. That aspect of the debate is of value in a discussion of a Bill of this kind.</p>

difficult to agree with most of the other things that hon. Members have said about the Bill. That is a shame, because there are some strong arguments that can be made about focusing on structural borrowing, but they were not made by the Opposition. I will come to the amendments in a short while, but given the instruction that this should also be a stand part debate, let me say something broader about the economic and fiscal context. I shall do so briefly, because all Members will be aware of the events that have taken place over the past 18 months to two years, the actions that the Government have taken to stabilise the economy, and the situation that we now face, with a pressing necessity to reduce the overall national debt.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o152"><a name="100120-0010.htm_para7"><a name="10012070000432">I want to focus first on the areas on which we can all agree. There is wide agreement across all political parties that we need to see fiscal consolidation in this country. One of the big issues between us is the pace of that consolidation. If we strip away the political rhetoric, we find that there are two judgments: one that has been made, and one that needs to be made.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o153"><a name="100120-0010.htm_para8"><a name="10012070000433">Going into the recession, it was quite clear that the Conservatives would have spent less. They opposed the fiscal stimulus, so they would not have spent money on it. We wanted to see investment in public services, and we believed that the fiscal stimulus was necessary. We also believe that debt would be higher now if we had not taken the action that kept people in work. I think that every political party agrees on the need to use automatic stabilisers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o154"><a name="100120-0010.htm_para9"><a name="10012070000434">The second judgment relates to the speed at which we get the debt down. The difference between the parties relates to whether we cut immediately or wait until we are sure that the recovery is locked in before we take action. The Government's view is that we should do the latter. We want to ensure that the recovery is in the bag. We do not want to jeopardise the economy or risk falling back into recession by taking precipitate action.</p>

 The Minister has mentioned reducing the debt. However, at the end of this deficit-consolidation phase, the annual deficit will still be 5.5 per cent. of gross domestic product, which will definitely be above trend and almost certainly above annual growth. When do the Government intend to start paying the debt down, as opposed merely to reducing the level of the deficit?</p>

We have set out measures to reduce borrowing by £57 billion by 2013-14, and to contribute to more than halving the deficit over four years. The measures in the pre-Budget report of 2008, the 2009 Budget and the pre-Budget report of 2009 will make a difference. Sometimes, the Opposition like to pretend that we are doing nothing to cut the deficit and that we have no plans to do so. Well, what is the 50p rate of tax?

<p><a name="stpa_o158"><a name="100120-0010.htm_para13"><a name="10012070000448">In the Bill, we are embedding into legislation the deficit reduction that was announced in the three fiscal events that I have just mentioned. We are also setting further targets for reducing the deficit in each year to 2015-16, and for halving the national debt falling in that year. These plans contribute to ensuring sustainable public finances in the medium term.

<p><a name="stpa_o159"><a name="100120-0010.htm_para14"><a name="10012070000452">It is also right that Parliament should be given a role in setting and monitoring our fiscal plans. It is enshrined in the Bill that Parliament must approve the plans before they become law, which represents a significant development of the extent to which the Government are held to account for their medium-term fiscal policy. Again, I think that that is the right thing to do. The hon. Member for Chichester (Mr. Tyrie) was jumping up and down a moment ago. I saw him first, so I shall give way to him first.</p>

We think that that is the responsible thing to do. The Conservatives seem to imagine that it is something that only the United Kingdom is doing, and that no one else has even dreamt of doing it because it is such a strange idea, but a number of other countries have introduced legislative fiscal targets. For instance, in June 2009 a new debt break was enshrined in the German constitution-and the Germans are not known for their gesture politics-to underpin fiscal consolidation over the coming years. That rule will become effective in 2011, and will require a steady reduction in the structural deficit from 2011 until 2016. According to the International Monetary Fund, moves to strengthen medium-term frameworks, including fiscal responsibility laws, should help to support the fiscal adjustment that will be necessary in most economies following the financial crisis.</p>

 I want to address the points about pace and flexibility before I give way again. First, however, I want to respond to some of the comments made by the hon. Member for Stone (Mr. Cash)-and, indeed, by the hon. Member for Braintree (Mr. Newmark)-about Government accounting. I shall not go into a huge amount of detail, as the issue is not directly relevant to the clause. As is well known, however, following our moves towards a system of resource accounting and  <br>

budgeting, we have been operating in accordance with new international financial reporting standards. We also report under the Maastricht treaty-the hon. Member for Stone does not like the treaty, but we have a legal responsibility to report under it-using the ESA95 rules. There are differences between those rules and international financial reporting standards. Rather than trying to put the two together and say that there can be only one right set of accounts, we should ensure that there is proper transparency and that information is available. so that those who examine these matters closely can understand what is going on. The hon. Member for Stone referred to public sector net borrowing. It is defined in the code for fiscal stability. A revised code was published yesterday, a copy of which is in the Library of the House.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o164"><a name="100120-0011.htm_para2"><a name="10012070000469">Finally, let me deal with the question of whether financial interventions should be included in the Government's accounts. I ask the Committee to consider for a moment whether it is realistic to include all the assets and liabilities of Royal Bank of Scotland in the Government's accounts, perhaps on a line-by-line basis, or whether it is better to treat them as a separate entity. When I was running an investment company with investments in a range of companies, I found that, if one owned more than 50 per cent. of the shares, line-by-line consolidation produced a very distorting picture of the overall financial position of the organisation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o165"><a name="100120-0011.htm_para3"><a name="10012070000470">I believe that clarity and transparency are important, and we in the Government are very clear about what we are doing. We expect the financial interventions that we have made to be temporary. We have no desire to own Royal Bank of Scotland for a long period; we want, over a sensible period and when it means value for the taxpayer, to divest ourselves of our stake in it. It simply does not make sense to take some of the actions that Opposition Members have suggested in terms of accounting treatment, and the same applies to pensions. My hon. Friend the Member for South Derbyshire (Mr. Todd) made several good points in rebutting some of the arguments advanced by the hon. Member for Braintree.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o166"><a name="100120-0011.htm_para4"><a name="10012070000471">We can probably argue about different definitions of national accounts until the cows come home. What is important is proper transparency, enabling those who examine financial accounts under different accounting conventions to understand what is going on. These matters can be quite confusing for the public. However, it is important for us to meet our legal commitments under the Maastricht treaty by reporting under the ESA95 rules, and also important for us to apply international financial reporting standards.</p>

 I beg to differ. I think that the Minister, whom I know to be an intelligent and thoughtful individual, will have gone to the Corporate Project Solutions website at www.cps.co.uk and seen three excellent pamphlets written by yours truly-one called "Simply Red", one "The Price of Irresponsibility" and the other "The Hidden Debt Bombshell". Through these, we have called for greater transparency. The Minister mentioned the word "transparency", but he knows as well as I do that generally accepted accounting principles today say that if one acquires any other company or bank with a more than 50 per cent. stake, one has to consolidate the balance sheet. That means that the Government must be much more honest about the debt they acquire when they acquire those banks. In addition, there is the rule that the pension liabilities of companies have to be shown on balance sheet; the Government should do likewise.</p>

 I do not want to go over the history of the Royal Bank of Scotland, but I do not believe that the hon.

Our judgment, as the Chancellor made clear, is that taking steps to reduce the deficit while securing group growth-that is what the clause requires-is the right approach to take. In turn, growth will make it easier to lower the deficit and pay back debt, which is also required by the clause. Our judgment is that tightening fiscal policy too quickly in 2010-11 would present risks, and it is not just the Government who think that. The Governor of the Bank of England has said:</p>

 I am pleased that my hon. Friend has pointed out the dangers of dealing with debt too rigorously.

That is the way to get the deficit down over the longer term-by maintaining employment, which means sustaining public expenditure in the short term.</p>

 I believe that growth is the best way to cut debt, which is why we should not jeopardise the recovery. We need to ensure that the public finances are on a sustainable footing and that is what we are trying to achieve. We are forecasting GDP growth to accelerate, predicting it will be 1.25 per cent. in 2010. I simply note that the latest average prediction of independent forecasters is that it will be about 1.4 per cent. and that their estimates are creeping up. We predict that it will be 3.5 per cent. in 2011 and 2012. In those circumstances, there is greater space for the Monetary Policy Committee to use interest rates to support demand as well.</p>

 My hon.

She is right to point out the difficult circumstances that it could create in many communities in this country. The Government must be extremely mindful of that when calibrating policy and taking decisions. As I said, growth is what is important. The more we can secure growth, the more we will be able to achieve the reductions that are required to meet the targets in this Bill. She is right to point out that this is very difficult, but I do not think that extending things over a longer period of time would be in the country's best interests. We have to strike what we think is the right balance in taking action to ensure that we have sustainable public finances over the medium term-that gives the markets confidence to want to continue to invest in the UK economy. Our judgment is that the pace that we are proposing is appropriate and right for the circumstances, but we cannot pretend that it will be anything other than very difficult indeed.</p>

 With respect, may I say to my hon. Friend that what he is suggesting is contradictory? If, as he is suggesting, this tightening of belts and cutting is going to be painful, that will have the opposite effect to promoting growth, because it will reinforce the recessionary tendencies in the economy. It is having a more relaxed approach to public expenditure in the short term that will help to promote growth and keep employment high, and that will reduce benefits payments and increase tax revenues. That will solve the problem.</p>

 Again, I understand my hon. Friend's point. However, we still need to take action to ensure that we have fiscal consolidation in this country. The more that we can have growth, the better it will be as it will give us the opportunity to reduce the deficit still further. He is right to say that if we see public sector job reductions as a result of the measure, that will have consequences in communities and for our economic output. We need to consider all that in the round in making our decisions about how best to act, and I want to reassure my hon. Friend that it is certainly the Government's intention that we should do so.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o171"><a name="100120-0011.htm_para9"><a name="10012070000504">Let me move on briefly to address the issue of flexibility. A number of hon. Members sought to suggest that there was no flexibility in the Government's consolidation plans. That is not correct. In the event of a significant and sustained economic shock on the scale of that which we have seen over the past 18 months to two years, we would quite obviously want to consider what path of fiscal policy would be appropriate for the economy. Subject to progress being made in reducing borrowing every year, there is flexibility on the profile for halving the deficit by 2013-14. So, for example, if growth is lower and the impact of the automatic stabilisers is greater, there is the flexibility to accommodate that so long as there is progress on reducing borrowing.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o172"><a name="100120-0011.htm_para10"><a name="10012070000505">On the amendments, I first want to agree that the structural deficit is an important fiscal aggregate, so the hon. Member for South-West Hertfordshire (Mr. Gauke) has a point. One of the key ambitions of the Bill is to provide certainty, as he knows, about the future path of fiscal policy, and targeting a structural measure of the deficit when there is such uncertainty about the position of the economy and the size of the output gap runs counter to that ambition. We are trying to target overall borrowing, which is a directly observable national statistic that is measured independently by the Office for National Statistics. Not even the hon. Member for Stone disputes that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o173"><a name="100120-0011.htm_para11"><a name="10012070000506">Furthermore, amendment 2 would reduce the extent of the plans to tackle the deficit. The hon. Member for South-West Hertfordshire needs to think very carefully about pressing the amendment to a vote. The pre-Budget report forecasts-on the basis of the forecast for overall borrowing falling to 5.5 per cent. of GDP in 2013-14, which is the Government's target-that cyclically adjusted borrowing will fall by almost two thirds, far more than the Opposition's amendment requires. Opposition Members are saying that they want to move faster, but amendment 2 would not do that. That is not to say that I would advise my hon. Friends to support it, either-I do not think that that is the right course of action.</p>

However, in the speech of the hon.

To paraphrase his argument, what he said was, "I'm not sure this Bill will ever become legislation, but it does at least give us an orderly process for discussing the matter." That is a reasonable point, but I am not sure that the big moment the Government have been waiting for was a Back-Bench Member speaking in support of the Bill in such a fashion.

Sometimes, Government Ministers-and in particular the Prime Minister-are less careful in their characterisation of Opposition policies than the Minister, and it is right that he said that. It is also welcome that the Minister displays a degree of honesty as to the difficult future choices the country faces; at  <br>

least there was none of the "cuts versus investment" nonsense that has so characterised the Prime Minister's utterances on this matter over the last few months.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o176"><a name="100120-0012.htm_para2"><a name="10012070000512">On fiscal targets, the Minister made the point that Ministers should be accountable to the House, which raises the question of why we need to put all this in legislation in the first place. It is entirely otiose-to use a word of which the Minister is fond-to do this. He also fully accepts that the structural deficit is a valuable measure, but he brings into question certainty in that regard. This Government have, of course, relied on cyclical measures for most of the time that they have been in power, and I know that that it is not necessarily the strongest argument in favour of cyclical measures and targets, given how they were abused. However, the Minister did not say anything that got to the heart of amendments 1, 2 and 3, which is that, even if we accept that there is a need for a straitjacket-which we do, although we are doubtful about the need for a legislative straitjacket-it is important that we have the right straitjacket. This is the wrong straitjacket. Given that the Chancellor has said that if there was another banking crisis, he would just have to come back to the House and ignore the Bill, it does nothing for the credibility of these targets, and the Government's policy on the deficit, to have in place the wrong measure.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o177"><a name="100120-0012.htm_para3"><a name="10012070000513">I remain confused about the Minister's argument that our proposal suggests cutting the deficit more slowly than the Government propose in both cases. He referred particularly to amendment 2, which relates to subsection (2). We end up with the relevant measure of borrowing by 2014 being half of what it was in 2010. I look at the numbers in the pre-Budget report, and the Government's projections show public sector net borrowing falling from 12 per cent. to 5.5 per cent. and the cyclically adjusted PSNB falling from 8 per cent. to 3.6 per cent. The ratio of those numbers in both sets is almost identical, so I do not think that that is right. It enables the Bill to take into account economic growth and the economic cycle. If economic growth turns out to be faster than the Minister anticipated, it would mean reducing borrowing by even more, and there will be scope to do so.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o178"><a name="100120-0012.htm_para4"><a name="10012070000514">Clause 1 misses the main target and nothing that the Minister said today addresses that. I say to Labour Members, some of whom, I hope, will have listened to the debate, that ours is a more sensible and pragmatic approach. Let there be no doubt that we are very serious about the deficit and we think the Government are taking too long to address it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o179"><a name="100120-0012.htm_para5"><a name="10012070000515">In conclusion, I intend to press amendment 1 to a Division. Were that to be successful-on the balance of the debate in the Chamber, it should be-I shall press amendments 2 and 3. For the moment, I shall press amendment 1 to test the mood of the Committee.</p>

Member for Chichester (Mr. Tyrie) on the last group of amendments, there is indeed an Alice in Wonderland quality to the Bill-it is extraordinary that we are all being invited to spend a whole day discussing it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o185"><a name="100120-0012.htm_para11"><a name="10012070001020">I said in my last contribution that when I was doing a radio interview recently a Labour MP said to me, "What do you mean we don't take the deficit seriously? We are bringing in a law to deal with the deficit," as though passing legislation and having a positive set of policies and a desire to implement them were one and the same. Clearly they are not. The very same Labour MP, in the same radio debate, maintained that the principal party of opposition to the Iraq war was hers as well. The whole Labour party is now in a state of complete denial about its position in politics, and nowhere is that more true than with regard to the enormous budget deficit that it has presided over. It told us that it had abolished boom and bust, that Britain could enjoy continuous economic prosperity and growth, and that the normal economic cycle that had applied throughout history no longer applied under the current Prime Minister. That has now emphatically been proven not to be the case.</p>

Member for Wokingham (Mr. Redwood), I perhaps caused some confusion by mentioning the aspect of the Bill that has attracted the greatest attention-halving the deficit in what people assume will be the lifetime of the next Parliament, if it runs a typical length of time. However, there is the added inflexibility of the requirement to reduce the deficit year on year, through to 2016. There is therefore no scope for making adjustments based on exceptional circumstances. That should concern us all.</p>

His response was evasive-I do not mean that he was disrespectful to the House, simply that he followed the logical consequences of his position. I gave two examples. First, I asked what we would do in the case of a massive additional threat to our national security. I hope that that is unlikely, but it is not impossible-we must have some sort of contingency plan and provision for an event of that magnitude.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o188"><a name="100120-0013.htm_para0"><a name="10012070001023">At the end of the second world war, Britain's cumulative debt was 250 per cent. of GDP. Our public finances were in a truly frightening position, but the judgment was made-I suspect that everybody agrees that it was the right judgment-that it was worth putting ourselves in such straitened circumstances because the prize of winning the war was so great and the downside of losing so immense. We had to put normal economic considerations to one side to protect the freedom and independence of our country and all the values that we hold important. Obviously, I hope that nothing that serious happens between now and 2016-or, indeed, ever-but were something serious to happen to us as a country, how could we possibly proceed with the assumption in the Bill that the deficit would be cut year on year, and cut in half by 2014?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o189"><a name="100120-0013.htm_para1"><a name="10012070001024">My other example, which is perhaps more likely, was about re-entering recession between now and 2014 or 2016, depending on which of the two time scales in the Bill applied. What would happen? Plenty of eminent economists believe that there is a risk of a so-called double-dip recession-that we will not recover as the Government forecast, that there is genuine potential for the structural damage to our economy to prove lasting, and that growth will be weak and even negative. If there were some wider international dimension-we all acknowledge the international dimension to the recession out of which the world is now pulling-that caused shock waves throughout the developed world and economies, it is possible that, even if the Government or any subsequent Government acted with great fiscal restraint, we would still be thrown into another recession, due not to the decisions made in the House or by Ministers, but perhaps to seismic events in one of the big economies elsewhere. In that case, the measure, which requires us to halve the deficit-not simply the dimension covered by amendment 1, which the Government defeated-would put us in a ruinous position if we abided by it while trying to grapple with serious world events.</p>

<p><a name="st_o290"><a name="10012070001025"><a name="100120-0013.htm_spnew0"><a name="10012070003535"><b>Mr. Andrew Love (Edmonton) (Lab/Co-op):</b>
 Does the hon. Gentleman agree that a double-dip recession is most likely if we remove the fiscal stimulus in 2010, when growth is forecast to be a very sluggish 1 to 1.5 per cent, and when no one could consider the recovery secure?</p>

<p><a name="st_o291"><a name="10012070001026"><a name="100120-0013.htm_spnew1"><a name="10012070003536"><b>Mr. Browne:</b>
 The hon. Gentleman makes a slightly different point-he is talking about the timing. As there is a reasonable consensus in the Committee, including all but one or two Labour Members, that we would like the deficit to be lower than it is at the moment, the debate ends up being about timing, rather than whether we aspire to cut the deficit.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o190"><a name="100120-0013.htm_para2"><a name="10012070001027">There is a range of views on timing. For what it is worth, the Liberal Democrats' view is that it should not be political-it should not take account of the requirements of a general election campaign in the next few months. We need to bear in mind a range of economic factors, including Britain's credit worthiness and unemployment, before we can make meaningful decisions about the appropriate speed with which to reduce the deficit. On that basis alone, we are uncomfortable with, and opposed to, this legislation, leaving aside the Alice in Wonderland nature of the deliberations.</p>

 Is my hon. Friend basically saying that there is no way we can legislate for unforeseen circumstances? Does it strike him as somewhat ironic that the very reason why we are having this debate in the first place is that the Government did not see the recession coming?</p>

<p><a name="st_o293"><a name="10012070001029"><a name="100120-0013.htm_spnew3"><a name="10012070003538"><b>Mr. Browne:</b>
 I am put to shame by my hon. Friend's brevity, because that is what I have basically been saying for the past 10 minutes. He sums up the situation brilliantly.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o191"><a name="100120-0013.htm_para3"><a name="10012070001030">I cited the examples of a huge threat to national security or a double-dip recession, but we could doubtless think of other exceptional but nevertheless imaginable circumstances in which the straitjacket of this legislation would simply not be in our interests. When that problem came up on Second Reading, the Chancellor, with a waft of his hand, said, "Oh well. In those circumstances, we'd just ignore it." I am paraphrasing, but I should have the exact quote-it might have been still more casual, something like, "Of course we wouldn't be bound by this legislation in such circumstances." That prompts the question why we have been invited to spend hours in the Chamber when the legislation, as I understand it, is in practice a set of guidelines to which Ministers can adhere if they find that convenient, but ignore if that is a preferable option. Of course, the Government can do that in any case. If the Bill can be discarded on a whim, and if there are no sanctions for doing so, why have it at all?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o192"><a name="100120-0013.htm_para4"><a name="10012070001031">On that basis, I tabled amendment 4, which would allow the provisions to be suspended for one year, which could of course happen repeatedly if that was felt necessary. I have sought to introduce a procedure that would give the Chancellor's casual observance a legal basis. I am not in favour of the Bill-I think it is utterly absurd-but if we are going to have it on the statute book, and if the Labour Members packing into the Chamber to weigh up the arguments cannot be persuaded of the case that I and others are making, we might as well have a measure that works and that is at least vaguely credible in terms of its practical application.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o193"><a name="100120-0013.htm_para5"><a name="10012070001032">To have no contingency, which is the case at the moment, seems ridiculous. My hon. Friend alluded to the fact that that is particularly so because the Prime Minister who claimed to have abolished boom and bust has now presided over the biggest peacetime deficit in our history, or certainly for a very long time-I have actually been told that our deficit might have been greater in 1921. He is now introducing legislation that seems to be predicated on the assumption that, despite all evidence to the contrary, boom and bust has been re-abolished and there is no danger we will encounter it again.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o194"><a name="100120-0013.htm_para6"><a name="10012070001033">Of course, that is not the Government's position in practice. The Chancellor announced in 2008 that he would break the Government's much championed golden rule, and when he was asked why he was doing that, he replied:</p>
<a name="100120-0013.htm_brev0"><a name="10012070002688"><ul><p class="tabletext">"To apply these rules rigidly in today's changed conditions would be perverse."</p>

made in the Budget 2008, the pre-Budget report 2008, the Budget 2009 and the pre-Budget report 2009. The amendment may appear, on first inspection, to be somewhat tangential, but I tabled it to emphasise the incompetence of the Government in their forecasts and management of public sector net borrowing, and ask the valid question why the Government expect us to have any faith or confidence in their ability to make these projections through to 2016.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o197"><a name="100120-0013.htm_para9"><a name="10012070001036">In previous debates, the Chancellor has said-I paraphrase slightly-that although the forecast for borrowing for this year was £175 billion and has now gone up to £178 billion, he has always made it clear that the figure would be roughly of that order and nothing surprising has happened. But that is not the case. The latest estimate for the deficit for this financial year, which ends in a few months, is £178 billion. In the Budget in 2008-less than two years ago-the Chancellor predicted that borrowing this year would be £38 billion. He was out by £140 billion. He then revised the figure upwards in the PBR at the end of 2008 to £118 billion. In the Budget 2009, only a few months later, it was up to £175 billion-a £57 billion increase in only a few months. Then it went up again by another £3 billion in the PBR only a few weeks ago.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o198"><a name="100120-0013.htm_para10"><a name="10012070001037">My point is that the Government's projections for the public finances were emphatically wrong, out by £140 billion. In the Budget 2008, less than two years ago, the Government prediction for borrowing in 2010-11 was £32 billion. They are now predicting that it will be £176 billion. For 2011-12, the Government predicted £27 billion of borrowing, and now they predict £140 billion. The Government's estimates are way off beam. They underestimate our borrowing requirements by almost £3 billion a week. Now they seek to give us a projection of their intentions right through to 2016 and invite us to take that seriously.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o199"><a name="100120-0013.htm_para11"><a name="10012070001038">As I said on amendment 4, we do not know what will happen between now and 2016. We must have a plan in place with some intelligent, sensible guidelines that take account of the state of the economy and the need to reduce our huge deficit as quickly as we can, consistent with not damaging the economic recovery or economic growth and with maintaining the level of public services that people in this country want. It is a balancing act. A quarter of public spending is unfunded at present. There are no simple solutions and we are in a very difficult position, but the idea that there is some magic formula that can be put forward in a six-clause Bill, when the Government cannot even work out two years in advance their borrowing requirement, is entirely  fanciful.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o200"><a name="100120-0013.htm_para12"><a name="10012070001039">On that basis, I hope that the Committee will debate with enthusiasm, and support, amendments 4 and 5. Depending on what the Minister and others say, I might seek permission to press amendment 4 to a Division.</p>

amendments 4 and 5, and I will say a word or two about that in a moment. The grouping also includes new clause 16, tabled by the hon. Member for Dundee, East (Stewart Hosie), and new clause 1.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o201"><a name="100120-0013.htm_para13"><a name="10012070001041">Amendment 4 proposes to delay the operation of the Bill. I have much sympathy with the thinking behind the amendment as it was set out by the hon. Member for Taunton, although I am not entirely sure whether it would necessarily work as he would like and allow the disapplication of the Bill for a year. I will be interested to hear what the Minister has to say about that. I was confused by the words:</p>
<a name="100120-0013.htm_brev1"><a name="10012070002689"><ul><p class="tabletext">"beginning with the coming into force of the order."</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o202"><a name="100120-0013.htm_para14"><a name="10012070001042">Given that the targets and duties set out in the Bill will not apply immediately, I am not sure how effective that would be. Perhaps that can be clarified during the debate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o203"><a name="100120-0013.htm_para15"><a name="10012070001043">On amendment 5, I have a lot of sympathy with what the hon. Member for Taunton said about the need to review the accuracy of the forecasts provided by the Treasury in recent years. That was a well-made point. I suspect that the Minister will say in response to many of the hon. Gentleman's remarks that the recession threw everything out; that borrowing therefore rapidly increased; that we did not anticipate the recession, or at least the depth of the recession; and that that is why we are in this position.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o204"><a name="100120-0013.htm_para16"><a name="10012070001044">The problem, however, goes deeper and goes back further. It is worth noting the various budget estimates of when the country would next have a balanced budget. In 2003 it was estimated in the Budget that we would have a balanced budget by 2005; by 2004 that had moved to 2007; in 2005-I do not know whether this is a coincidence, but that was the pre-election Budget-the estimate was still 2007; by 2006 it had moved to 2008; by 2007 it had moved to 2009; and by 2008 it had moved to 2011. And that was before we started to get into the real horrors of the recession and the significant downgrading in the 2009 projections.</p>

 In the forecasting business, it is easy to look back at previous forecasts and point out the inadequacies of those contained in the Budget and pre-Budget documents. However, the hon. Members for South-West Hertfordshire (Mr. Gauke) and for Taunton (Mr. Browne) speak as if there were a magic formula, or a forecaster who has been getting it right all the time. Yet all the private forecasters have been just as bad, or indeed even worse. Although the IFS has been critical of Government forecasts, it has not exactly been an accurate forecaster itself. Does the hon. Gentleman accept that there are difficulties in forecasting, and that all that his figures do is reflect those difficulties?</p>

good. I am being generous in not focusing on the spectacular inaccuracies of the past couple of years-a point made by the hon. Member for Taunton-because, as the Minister will no doubt say, there was the recession. However, there is another significant point to be made, which is that those inaccuracies are starting to undermine the credibility of the Government-by that I mean government in general; I am not necessarily making a partisan point-in that there is an apparently systemic bias in the Treasury's projections. We can run through the past six or seven years, but the Treasury constantly gets it wrong the same way, year after year.</p>

<p><a name="st_o297"><a name="10012070001049"><a name="100120-0013.htm_spnew7"><a name="10012070003542"><b>Mr. Love:</b>
 I thank the hon. Gentleman for giving way a second time. Let me take a specific example. It is well understood in the forecasting business that forecasts for six months or a year ahead can be relatively accurate, but as the forecast moves forward in years, the inaccuracy increases exponentially. Let us take the forecast for 2010-11. A year ago, when the Government made the forecast that growth would be 1 to 1.5 per cent., they were widely ridiculed, on the specific basis that the hon. Gentleman mentioned, for being biased in an over-optimistic way. We now discover that the consensus of forecasters is that growth this year will be 1 to 1.5 per cent. Does he admit that sometimes the Treasury gets it right?</p>

<p><a name="st_o298"><a name="10012070001050"><a name="100120-0013.htm_spnew8"><a name="10012070003543"><b>Mr. Gauke:</b>
 I do not think that the hon. Gentleman has accurately characterised where the debate was a year or so ago. I remember making speeches about the issue at the time, and the Treasury forecast was at the upper end of forecasts, but it was not that out of line. The criticism-I remember hearing this point made, and I even made it myself-was more of the forecasts for 2011 and onwards, which predicted a trampoline recovery, with growth at 3.5 per cent. year after year.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o207"><a name="100120-0013.htm_para19"><a name="10012070001051">The Treasury might prove to be right about that. However, if the hon. Gentleman wants to highlight the success of the Treasury's growth forecasts, I would also remind him what the growth forecasts were for the economy at the time of last year's Budget. The forecast was for a much shallower recession than we have actually had. If I remember rightly, the Treasury predicted a recession of the value of about 3 per cent. of GDP, which is significant enough, but the figure turned out to be 4.5 per cent. Taken over those two years, the Treasury was not bang on the money; it got it wrong. However, when it comes to the public finances, the Treasury has consistently got it wrong the same way.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o208"><a name="100120-0013.htm_para20"><a name="10012070001052">That could be just one of those things, but there is a certain perception out there. This is an important point that I want to put directly to the Minister, but there have been reports that the Prime Minister has on a number of occasions tried to interfere with the Treasury to ensure that its figures were better than they would otherwise have been, whether for growth or borrowing numbers. That accusation has been published on a number of occasions. It is a very serious accusation, so if the Minister could provide some reassurance to the House that there has been no interference from the Prime Minister in such matters, that would be welcome.</p>

economic circumstances change, and my point was that this is so difficult for the Government precisely because the circumstances are always evolving in that way. Is the hon. Gentleman also saying that there is another factor at play-that improper political pressure is being brought to bear on the statisticians, and that the figures with which everyone in the House is working, and which are presented to the public at large, are not a faithful representation of what the Government believe the actual picture to be?</p>

We are not going to get into a full debate on this now, but our proposal for the establishment of an office of budget responsibility, whereby the powers to make such forecasts would be transferred to an independent body outside the Treasury, would address a number of issues, including the concern that political interference might drive some of the numbers produced by the Treasury. The hon. Member for Edmonton (Mr. Love) was right to say earlier that forecasting was difficult. We are talking about two very big numbers here-expenditure and receipts-and getting them exactly right is not something that we can necessarily expect. However, the bias-by which I mean the tendency of the Treasury to look at this always from an optimistic point of view-is a concern.

If the Bill is intended to provide reassurance to those institutions that lend to us, or to the advisers to whom they listen, the evidence so far is pretty clear: it will not work.

Implicit within that is the fact that the Government have not so far set out a strong commitment to fiscal sustainability.

Lady does not believe that we should stop the borrowing, but we cannot simply confiscate people's assets; we have to persuade them that if they are going to lend to us, they will get their money back. If we do not have credible fiscal policies, the markets-I know that the hon. Lady is not a fan of the markets-will either not be prepared to lend to us or will do so only at a higher rate because of the perceived risk. It is one of the great ironies of those on the left that they are so dismissive of international finance yet pursue policies that make this country so dependent on such finance to fund their very high levels of public spending. So there is an issue about fiscal responsibility. My point is that the Bill does not persuade the markets; if it does not do so, what is the point of it?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o221"><a name="100120-0014.htm_para8"><a name="10012070001079">Perhaps I am wrong.

 An important point has to be made here. I think that the public will agree with the view of Government Members and some Opposition Members that if we were to cut off the fiscal stimulus, the best that could be expected is that it would undermine future growth prospects, increasing our deficit. The worst-case scenario, however, is that it would throw us into a double-dip recession. Either way, we will increase the amount of debt that we have to fund into the future.</p>

<p><a name="st_o316"><a name="10012070001083"><a name="100120-0014.htm_spnew9"><a name="10012070003561"><b>Mr. Gauke:</b>
 The hon. Gentleman makes an interesting point. It is not particularly relevant to the argument that I am trying to make, but I shall respond by making two comments. He presumably supported the withdrawal of the VAT cut at the beginning of the year. That cut was the big part of the Government's discretionary fiscal stimulus and they consider that withdrawing it was the right thing to do. We did not support the cut in the first place, as he knows. I simply make that point to him before he expresses too much certainty on the issue of the withdrawal of fiscal stimulus measures.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o222"><a name="100120-0014.htm_para9"><a name="10012070001084">My second point relates to where the real risk lies. The Conservatives' view is in line with what a number of commentators have said and what the spokesman for one of the credit rating agencies, Fitch, said this morning. We think the real risk is that if this country does not have credible fiscal policies, it runs the risk of its credit rating being downgraded-that is clearly being looked at-and of paying more for its debt. If we pay more for our debt, we will end up with interest rates rising, and that will choke off the economy. So, there is a relationship between fiscal policy and monetary policy-this is exactly the point that the Governor of the Bank of England was making last night-and a judgment has to be made as to when one withdraws the fiscal stimulus and when one tightens these things. Our view is that we need to get on with it.</p>

 There is indeed a question as to when one withdraws the fiscal stimulus, but this debate is taking place within a vacuum. The International Monetary Fund is clear about this matter: the UK is the only G7 country to be fully withdrawing its fiscal stimulus package in 2010. Irrespective of the view taken by the Conservatives or the Labour Front-Bench team, the idea that the stimulus package is still in place is completely false.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman is right to caution against a simplistic understanding of the fiscal stimulus, but I should point out that the UK is borrowing more than any other G7 country and is in a worse position than any other G7 economy. We need to do more to rectify that.</p>

Given that this Bill is so much about trying to move the perception of Britain's public finances in a more positive direction, hearing what those witnesses had to say would be hugely valuable and extremely helpful. We opposed the programme motion because of that, and I suspect that the hon. Member for North Ayrshire and Arran (Ms Clark) might have done so, too.

Is the Minister able to tell the Committee whether the Government consider this to be a money Bill? If that is the case, the House of Lords will not have the opportunity to give it the full level of scrutiny that it requires.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o225"><a name="100120-0014.htm_para12"><a name="10012070001091">This Bill has not had sufficient parliamentary scrutiny. It is important to know what the wider world thinks about it.

New clause 1, which would give an opportunity for full consultation on the Bill, for a report summarising those consultation responses to be put before the House, and for Members to be given the opportunity to debate in Committee of the whole House whether to bring in the Bill, would be a valuable addition. It would ensure that we do not implement legislation that serves no purpose, that persuades nobody and that undermines the credibility of this place and the Government's policy on addressing our deficits. I hope that we will get the chance to vote on new clause 1.</p>

 That is absolutely right, and it is the fundamental case that I am trying to make. Nobody believes this Bill will deliver anything. It will not deliver the degree of fiscal consolidation the Conservatives want, and in my view it goes far too fast and far too deep and risks economic recovery-and in so doing risks making the task of tackling the deficit and then the debt more difficult. The Bill therefore satisfies nobody. We should at least have information in advance that enables us to determine whether the duties that the Treasury wishes to impose on itself are even sensible.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o233"><a name="100120-0014.htm_para20"><a name="10012070001104">The big picture is that the 2 per cent. increase in Government consumption last year provided the stimulus to the economy, while household consumption was down 3.5 per cent., business investment was down 22 per cent. and gross fixed capital formation was down 17 per cent. We may reach the technical end of a recession, but growth will be slow, faltering and fragile, and there will be huge risks, particularly from unforeseen shocks, which could occur at any time. I am certain that, before the Government take any action that could weaken the economy or its ability to recover, they must provide a proper assessment of the impact on GDP growth of the actions that they intend to take.</p>

The fall in output following the global financial crisis has been the biggest factor in the increase in the deficit, so the return of strong and sustainable growth will be crucial in cutting the deficit over the medium term and restoring fiscal balance. Our forecast, as hon. Members know, is GDP growth of 1.25 per cent. in 2010, rising to 3.5 per cent. in 2011.

 I assure the Minister that this will be my only turn during this section of our proceedings. He is right to talk about the international context and the problems that the Government faced, but I was concerned to read in <i> The Irish Times </i>yesterday that the banks that we control through Government investment have given €6 billion of support to their Irish subsidiaries. Surely that should not be the Government's responsibility. In terms of the stresses and strains that are put on our own finances, it will impact on whether this Fiscal Responsibility Bill is required.</p>

 I must confess that I have not read <i> The Irish Times</i>, but the hon. Gentleman will be aware of the interconnected nature of the banking system in the global economy. We rightly took action to stabilise the banks in the United Kingdom-the Irish Government, as the hon. Gentleman is very well aware, have taken significant action to stabilise their banking system-and, indeed, to cut the deficit in Northern Ireland. The Bill proposes a set of measures that we believe are appropriate to the UK's specific circumstances.</p>

 I think that it was Francis Bacon who talked about dreams and predictions being subjects only for a chat by the fireside, so I do not want to get into the differences between the two. What I do want to say is that forecasting is not an exact science; it is particularly prone to error when there are major global shocks, as we have seen over the past couple of years, so it is not surprising that the Treasury's forecasts, along with all other forecasts, have not proved accurate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o241"><a name="100120-0015.htm_para5"><a name="10012070001120">As the Chancellor said, the Government are cautious but confident about growth, and that assessment of growth has been used when judging the appropriate pace by which to reduce the deficit. We have discussed the appropriate pace before, and the Government want to ensure that the recovery is locked in. I believe that the economy is growing as we speak, but we do not want to jeopardise it. If we take action too early, we could put in danger the recovery that I believe is taking place this year.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o242"><a name="100120-0015.htm_para6"><a name="10012070001121">If growth proves stronger than we are currently forecasting, the priority should be a further reduction in structural borrowing. The Bill allows for that by setting fiscal ceilings, not floors, and it sets targets that the Government judge appropriate, because it is deliberately drafted to allow for overachievement. The ceilings are binding and designed to provide certainty that the Government will deliver their consolidation plans.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o243"><a name="100120-0015.htm_para7"><a name="10012070001122">It is worth noting that, subject to making progress on reducing borrowing every year, there is flexibility in the profile over which the deficit is halved by 2013-14. As I said earlier, there is the flexibility to accommodate lower growth and the greater impact of the automatic stabilisers so long as progress is made on reducing borrowing. It is important to recognise that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o244"><a name="100120-0015.htm_para8"><a name="10012070001123">The issue is not just about economic growth. The hon. Member for Taunton pointed out that significant shocks to the public finances could come from a natural disaster or other actions, and my general point is that, in extremis, the Government would have to come back to Parliament if it were necessary to amend the targets in the Bill. However, the Bill has been designed so that, rightly, the duties in clause 1 can be changed only through new primary legislation. That is a higher hurdle than the procedure in his amendment; and our approach allows for greater parliamentary scrutiny than his amendment, which would make it a lot easier to disapply the duties.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o245"><a name="100120-0015.htm_para9"><a name="10012070001124">We think it right and proper that new primary legislation should be required in order to divert from the course set out in the Bill. The difficulty and seriousness of doing that should underline the Government's commitment to meeting the Bill's targets. I agree with the hon. Member for Taunton that it is important to consider alternative circumstances and scenarios. However, his amendment would make it too easy to change the targets when it is important that they are seen by everyone to be hard targets that could be changed only by going through the full parliamentary procedures required for new primary legislation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o246"><a name="100120-0015.htm_para10"><a name="10012070001125">Amendment 5 is the first of three amendments that would require the Treasury to produce a report before commencing certain parts of the Bill. It seeks to impose on the Treasury a requirement to lay before the House a review of the accuracy of recent forecasts. I understand the comments that have been made by the hon. Member for Taunton-I have referred to some of them-and by the hon. Member for South-West Hertfordshire. I accept, of course, that it is important to account for past forecast differences and to explain them in an open and transparent way; that is why, since 2002, the Treasury has published an end-of-year fiscal report. That report is underpinned by the provisions of the code for fiscal stability, which require the Government to provide an indication of past forecast errors for public sector net borrowing. The report provides retrospective reporting and analysis of fiscal issues, and it builds on the information that is already available and published in the Budget and the pre-Budget report. It is a comprehensive analysis of forecast performance, and many fiscal commentators find it a useful source of information. In addition to the regular analysis of changes from forecast to outturn in the end-of-year fiscal report, each Budget and PBR analyses changes from forecast to forecast made at the previous fiscal event and provides a discussion of these developments. A lot of information is available out there on a regular basis. The Treasury reviews the accuracy of its forecasts, in the way that I have outlined, and its forecasts compare well with those of other forecasters such as the OECD, the International Monetary Fund and the European Council. The amendment is therefore unnecessary.</p>

was to more than halve borrowing to 5.5 per cent. of GDP in 2013-14. That judgment was confirmed in the PBR forecast, and through powers in the Bill it has been put into legislation. The path for consolidation has remained stable, and it has been public for some time. There has been significant discussion of these plans by financial commentators; and indeed, many discussions have been held in this House. A range of views have already been expressed. We have heard lengthy quotes from the hon. Member for South-West Hertfordshire and from a wide range of stakeholders.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o248"><a name="100120-0015.htm_para12"><a name="10012070001127">There are already mechanisms in place that allow for the policy to be scrutinised. In particular, after each Budget and PBR the Treasury Committee takes evidence, not only from Treasury Ministers and officials but from expert witnesses. The Treasury also receives a large number of representations in advance of each PBR and Budget. Introducing a late-stage consultation process and similar requirements would risk creating unnecessary uncertainty about plans that have already been extensively discussed and are in the public domain.</p>

 Germany has already introduced similar legislation, and the IMF, in a report that I believe was published in December, stated that legislating on fiscal frameworks can make good sense, so what we are doing is not exceptional. That is the point that irritates me slightly about the Opposition. They pretend that what we are doing is bizarre and unusual and that no sensible Government would do it, but the German Government have already done it and the IMF says it is sensible, so it is nothing other than good practice. It can help to ensure that there is greater market confidence that the Government will carry out credible plans for fiscal consolidation.</p>

I wish to make it clear that we assess the impact of our policies on economic growth as a matter of course. That is part and parcel of what we do-it is the day job of the Treasury to consider such matters. The Government have judged that the pace of consolidation required in the Bill is consistent with supporting growth in the early stages of recovery and the need to ensure sound public finances in the medium term. The hon. Member for Dundee, East (Stewart Hosie) and I happen to disagree on the pace of consolidation. He thinks we are going too fast and the official Opposition think we are going too slow.

 The Treasury will always be concerned about the impact of public spending on growth. As part of its normal Budget and pre-Budget report process, it will need to examine the economy as a whole and public sector spending plans in order to set out credible and sustainable plans for the future. My hon. Friend is absolutely right to point out the sensitivities that exist.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o252"><a name="100120-0015.htm_para16"><a name="10012070001137">I have to be absolutely blunt-we will have to make some tough choices about public expenditure in future. We have already made some tough decisions, as my hon. Friend and other Members well know. We have taken measures to introduce a fiscal consolidation of already about £57 billion, including measures that will raise tax, such as a 50p tax rate and increased national insurance contributions, and we have made efficiency savings through schemes such as the smarter Government programme and the operational efficiency programme. Those measures will make a significant difference.</p>

The more we can get growth going in the UK economy again, the better the public finances will be in the longer term. Our forecast for GDP growth was set out in the pre-Budget report and shows growth accelerating to above trend rates in 2011. It takes account of the consolidation plans that we have in place and of previous Budgets and pre-Budget reports, which is why I do not believe a separate report is required.</p>

 When talking about amendment 4, the Economic Secretary recognised that there were circumstances-he cited natural disaster, but the most obvious example is another recession in the next few years-whereby it would be impossible or at least extremely difficult to stay within the Bill's parameters. The Chancellor has acknowledged the same point, but there is no provision, save for getting rid of the Bill, for the necessary procedures to take account of issues of great budgetary consequence, whether natural disaster, another recession, a war and so on.</p>

worth anyway. However, if targets are to be set, even though they are based on forecasts that get harder to project with any accuracy as we go into the future, such an approach must make some provision-as the Chancellor and the Economic Secretary acknowledged-for events overtaking the predictions.

The Conservative spokesman was anxious about that, but the provision must take effect from day one. The amendment would provide for suspending the Bill for a year if the situation were sufficiently grave. Of course, it could be suspended for a second or subsequent years, but that could be done only by an order laid before Parliament-it could not therefore be done by Executive fiat-and a positive resolution of the House. We would have to make a conscious decision if the Chancellor came to the House and said that he or she was unable to continue following the timetable in the Bill because of factors so grave that it would not be in our national interest to abide by it.</p>

 I hope to speak to the amendments and new clauses in a fashion that makes sense in the short time available. Apart from amendment 6, which I shall describe separately, this is a package of amendments and new clauses that seeks fundamentally to replace the duties that the Government sought to impose on themselves with a set of principles, according to which the deficit and then the debt would be tackled and reduced.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o270"><a name="100120-0016.htm_para12"><a name="10012070001649">Amendments 9 to 14 would amend the section on progress and compliance reports to align them with the principles that I have set out in new clause 14. Amendment 15 would remove the requirement to report on the duties in clause 1(3), as I am seeking to replace those duties with principles. Likewise, amendments 16 and 17 would remove references to "duties in section 1". New clause 15 would allow duties to be imposed, but only in so far as they are framed with reference to the principles set out in new clause 14, which is the key new clause, as it lays out the principles that I believe should be adhered to, rather than having the arbitrary political dividing lines, cuts and time scales-the straitjacket to which others have referred-set out in the Bill.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o271"><a name="100120-0016.htm_para13"><a name="10012070001650">However, before I address that point more fully, let me briefly describe amendment 6. It was tabled with the purpose of preventing the Government from taking any action or imposing any further duties-or damaging cuts, as we call them-if the principles of fiscal responsibility set out in new clause 14 are already being adhered to. In a sense, amendment 6 is a stand-alone amendment. Because of the way in which amendments can be debated and called in this place, it made sense, if I chose to push it to a vote, to table it in such a way that it could stand alone.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o272"><a name="100120-0016.htm_para14"><a name="10012070001651">The key provision in the group, however, is new clause 14, and that is what I should like to concentrate on. It contains five principles, which, as I said on Second Reading, are closely based on the principles that the New Zealand Government introduced in their Fiscal Responsibility Act 1994. The first principle is about reducing debt to a "prudent level". It is important that we should allow the Government of the day to specify what is or is not prudent, depending on the circumstances that they face. There must be a degree of flexibility, which is a theme running through all our debates today.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o273"><a name="100120-0016.htm_para15"><a name="10012070001652">The second principle says that once debt is reduced, the Government should</p>
<a name="100120-0016.htm_brev0"><a name="10012070002703"><ul><p class="tabletext">"maintain a balanced budget on average over the medium to long term."</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o274"><a name="100120-0016.htm_para16"><a name="10012070001653">That would not prevent any Government from implementing the steps that they believed were necessary to achieve the long-term objective of having a prudent level of deficit and prudent debt levels, but it would  <br>

 I am interested in what the hon. Gentleman says. He talks about a prudent level of debt, but in fact our gross debt is reasonable compared with many other countries. Most countries have higher debt levels. The annual borrowing figure is relatively high in the short term, but I would suggest that we already have a prudent level of debt, and it is not going to get much higher than anything that we would regard as prudent.</p>

 It is forecast to grow; the Minister conceded that earlier. It will go up to about 77 per cent. of GDP in 2014-15, according to the Government's figures, and according to the treaty calculation that we heard so much about earlier, it will go up to £1.7 trillion, which is about 91 or 92 per cent. of GDP. The hon. Member for Luton, North (Kelvin Hopkins) has been present at many of the debates on the Bill, and he will know that other measures of debt take those figures higher still.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o281"><a name="100120-0016.htm_para23"><a name="10012070001662">The key point is that the level of debt is determined by the annual level of deficit.

before the deficit targets have been reached-a real danger, if the Labour Government back-load the cuts and we hit another downturn with no room to manoeuvre-we might be unable even to invoke the automatic stabiliser, let alone to use the proper fiscal stimulus package that could well be necessary to prevent the situation from deteriorating further.</p>

 We could have a debate about what is or is not a prudent level of debt, but we should all focus on how we bring down the deficit. The way to do that is surely to maintain public investment, particularly in job creation and the sustaining of jobs, in order to maintain tax revenues and minimise the level of benefits payments. That is the way forward, which means that a prudent level of public spending might be rather higher than most people are implying.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman's last point is absolutely right. That is why I have been critical of the Labour Government's £800 million cut to the Scottish budget, and why the Scottish Government and the Scottish National party have argued for a further year's re-profiling of capital expenditure to protect the economic recovery and not allow it to be threatened in any way. I have argued time and again that we must have a sustained and sustainable recovery before we start the fiscal consolidation. As I have said, if people think that tackling the deficit and, subsequently, the debt will be difficult from a position of sustained economic growth-and it will be-it will be impossible from a fragile position of weak recovery, of no recovery at all or of a double-dip recession.

 I am grateful to the hon. Member for Dundee, East (Stewart Hosie) for tabling the amendments, because I think it important for us to debate the framework of the Bill. As the hon. Gentleman explained, his amendments seek to replace the target-based duties in the Bill with duties to comply with broad principles very similar to those used in the New Zealand Fiscal Responsibility Act. In general, those principles relate to prudent management of the public finances. There is then the flexibility for the Treasury to impose further duties on itself, framed by reference to the principles. The amendments would also give Ministers power to disapply the targets in clause 1. Legislative principles are, of course, useful. That is why the Government already have a set of them; they are enshrined in the Finance Act 1998, and underpin the Government's fiscal policy and framework.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o290"><a name="100120-0016.htm_para32"><a name="10012070001674">I believe that specific quantitative targets for deficit and debt reduction are most helpful to supporting consolidation at the present time. Those targets will deliver the Government's objectives in a manner that accords with their principles. As I explained earlier, the Government have set out their key principles in the Finance Act 1998 and the code for fiscal stability. A revised version of the code was published yesterday, and copies are available in the Library. Those key principles are stability, transparency, responsibility, efficiency and fairness. Section 155 of the Act states:</p>
<a name="100120-0016.htm_brev8"><a name="10012070002711"><ul><p class="tabletext">"It shall be the duty of the Treasury to prepare and lay before Parliament a code for the application of the key principles to the formulation and implementation"</p>

Securing sound public finances is all about putting the public finances on a path such that they are able to withstand unknown future shocks.

 I thank the Minister for his answer. He relied heavily on, and prayed in aid, the draft code for fiscal responsibility. I suspect that if I were to go through it in as much detail as I want to do, we would be here for some time. It talks about transparency, but as I have said, the Government seem determined to use the public sector net borrowing and debt ex figures-those excluding the contingent liability. It talks about responsibility in the management of the public finances, but then may well negate the use even of the automatic stabilisers. It remains wholly inflexible; as the Minister said, that was my main rationale for tabling the amendments. It talks about fairness, including between generations, but this Government are allowing generation after generation still to come to pay for the off-balance-sheet private finance initiative debt, which keeps going up and stands at about £2 billion.</p>

Given that the IMF has confirmed that the UK is the only G7 country fully to withdraw its fiscal stimulus package in 2010, and given the fact that the risks of even being able to tackle the deficit and the debt will be much greater if the economy's recovery falters or if we tip into a double-dip recession, I think that the Government, although they are cognisant of the risks, are ignoring them.</p>

 I beg to move, That the Bill be now read the Third time.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o320"><a name="100120-0018.htm_para3"><a name="10012088000016">I thank all hon. Members who participated in the Committee stage today. The Bill is short, and we have had sufficient time to scrutinise its key provisions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o321"><a name="100120-0018.htm_para4"><a name="10012088000017">As we debated on Second Reading and in Committee, the Government have set out consolidation plans to halve the deficit over four years and put debt on a downward path. The Bill places obligations on the Government to cut the deficit at an appropriate and sensible pace, as well as allowing us to protect the economy and maintain key public services.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o322"><a name="100120-0018.htm_para5"><a name="10012088000018">Every country has been hit by a severe financial crisis, resulting in the worse global economic recession for decades. That has had a profound impact on the public finances and resulted in a significant increase in Government borrowing and public sector net debt. We have had to be responsible but flexible in the way in which we have dealt with those changing circumstances. That is why the Government provided a fiscal stimulus to support the economy and help people and businesses-a measure that the Conservative party opposed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o323"><a name="100120-0018.htm_para6"><a name="10012088000019">Of course, there were costs to stepping in, but not allowing borrowing and the deficit to rise to help people and businesses would have meant greater pain and more job losses. However, the Government have always made it clear that support for the economy must be followed by steps to rebuild our fiscal strength. It is our judgment that tightening fiscal policy too much in 2010-11 would risk the recovery and be likely to cause the fiscal position to deteriorate. We believe that the economy can support a more rapid tightening in 2011-12, and growth will help us reduce our borrowing and debt.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o324"><a name="100120-0018.htm_para7"><a name="10012088000020">As we look to the future, the Government believe that it is appropriate to strengthen the fiscal framework. Other Governments around the world are considering similar measures. The Bill enshrines consolidation plans in legislation. It requires the Government to have at all times a legislative fiscal plan, approved by Parliament, for delivering sound public finances, and places a binding duty on the Government to fulfil the plan.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o325"><a name="100120-0018.htm_para8"><a name="10012088000021">Some have claimed that placing those plans in statute is a distraction. As we have debated, legislation will provide certainty and stability for business, and the Bill will bind the Government, to ensure that they deliver the tough decision to more than halve the deficit over four years and get debt falling.</p>

<meta name="Date" content="20 Jan 2010">

<notus-date day="20" month="1" year="2010" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><b>20 Jan 2010 : Column 394</b><br>

<p><a name="stpa_o326"><a name="100120-0018.htm_para9"><a name="10012088000022">The UK is not alone. As Governments throughout the world work together on the response to the downturn, many other countries are also examining their fiscal frameworks. Indeed, the International Monetary Fund has highlighted fiscal responsibility laws as a way of supporting fiscal adjustment by strengthening institutional arrangements. As I have said previously, Germany already has similar legislation on its statute book.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o327"><a name="100120-0018.htm_para10"><a name="10012088000023">The fiscal plan for delivering sound public finances must be approved by Parliament before it becomes law. As I said, the Bill places a binding duty on the Government to meet that plan. We believe accountability to Parliament is important. Giving Parliament that new scrutiny role in relation to progress and compliance with fiscal plans is innovative and new for the Government.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o328"><a name="100120-0018.htm_para11"><a name="10012088000024">I contrast what the Government are doing-we are willing and prepared to be open and responsible to Parliament-with the policies of the Conservatives, who want to set up an office of budget responsibility, which would, in effect, be an unelected quango. They would diminish the role of Parliament in such important decisions, but we do not believe that that is the right thing to do. Under the Bill the Government will be required, through regular progress and compliance reports, to account to Parliament for their actions. The progress reports, which will be produced alongside Budgets and pre-Budget reports, must set out progress that has been made toward compliance with the plans. If targets are not met, the Treasury must explain why not to Parliament.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o329"><a name="100120-0018.htm_para12"><a name="10012088000025">I think it right that that is the method of accountability. The Conservatives say that we could hive off economic forecasting to a separate office, while presumably relying on those forecasts, but who would be responsible if the forecasts turned out to be wrong? Who is to blame if policy is wrong because forecasts are wrong? Would it be the new office of budget responsibility or the Government? Why should Parliament not hold the Government to account for those actions? That is why setting up a new office or body and separating forecasting from policy consideration and delivery, rather than going down the legislative route that we have proposed, is the wrong way to go.</p>

<p><a name="st_o362"><a name="10012088000026"><a name="100120-0018.htm_spnew1"><a name="10012088001079"><b>Mr. David Drew (Stroud) (Lab/Co-op):</b>
 Can the Minister assure us that the Governor of the Bank of England is also bound-in to those statements?</p>

 My hon. Friend may have heard some earlier exchanges about the Governor and his views on cutting the fiscal deficit. We are all agreed-the Governor and all political parties-about the need to cut the deficit. The big debate between us is on how quickly to do it. The Conservatives would place the recovery at risk by acting too soon.</p>

<p><a name="st_o364"><a name="10012088000028"><a name="100120-0018.htm_spnew3"><a name="10012088001081"><b>Mr. Deputy Speaker (Sir Alan Haselhurst):</b>
 Order. I am sorry to interrupt the Minister, but he places me in a difficulty. On Third Reading, he should really be concentrating on what is in the Bill. If he talks about what might have been in the Bill, it makes it difficult for me to resist counter-arguments that would almost certainly be out of order.</p>

<p><a name="st_o365"><a name="10012088000029"><a name="100120-0018.htm_spnew4"><a name="10012088001082"><b>Ian Pearson:</b>

<p><a name="stpa_o330"><a name="100120-0018.htm_para13"><a name="10012088000030">Our judgment is that it is better to engage in the necessary fiscal tightening from 2011-12 onwards, when all the predications say the economy is likely to be growing far more and we will be better able to make those necessary, difficult decisions. However, having said that, our fiscal consolidation plan extends from 2009-10 right through to 2015-16.</p>

<p><a name="st_o366"><a name="10012088000031"><a name="100120-0018.htm_spnew5"><a name="10012088001083"><b>Ms Sally Keeble (Northampton, North) (Lab):</b>
 What if the Government were to start fiscal tightening earlier? When-roughly-would redundancy notices have to start going out to public sector workers to get savings in the coming financial year?</p>

<p><a name="st_o367"><a name="10012088000032"><a name="100120-0018.htm_spnew6"><a name="10012088001084"><b>Ian Pearson:</b>
 I do not particularly want to speculate on that, other than to say that it is difficult to take action now that will produce meaningful results in 2010-11, and I have not seen proposals of any significant detail from the Conservatives that would deliver what they say they want.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o331"><a name="100120-0018.htm_para14"><a name="10012088000033">There is a clear commitment in the Bill to a fiscal consolidation plan that will halve public sector borrowing as a share of gross domestic product over four years from its forecast peak in 2009-10. As we have debated, we are setting a target in secondary legislation for borrowing to be 5.5 per cent. of GDP or less in 2013-14. The plan also commits us to reducing borrowing as a share of GDP in each and every year from 2009-10 to 2015-16 and it ensures that public sector net debt is falling as a share of GDP in 2015-16. This is the sharpest reduction in the budget deficit for any G7 country, but it is not unreasonable. The average pace of consolidation over the period is forecast to be comparable with the speed at which the deficit was reduced during the period of consolidation in the 1990s.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o332"><a name="100120-0018.htm_para15"><a name="10012088000034">The framework that we propose is flexible, as I explained in Committee. The key point to recognise is that as growth picks up we have to ensure that we have sound public finances. That is essential for economic stability for the long-term health of our economy. We all know that; the debate has been about the pace at which we achieve that and the point of having legislation on that issue. The point of legislation is to give confidence to the public and the markets that we are committed to taking these actions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o333"><a name="100120-0018.htm_para16"><a name="10012088000035">Actions have already been announced, as part of the PBR 2008, the Budget 2009 and the PBR 2009. Further actions will undoubtedly be necessary. We are building on principles in the code for fiscal stability, the revised version of which was published yesterday, and we discussed those principles in Committee. The building of the fiscal framework on top of those principles-enhancing it through this Bill-will support the task of ensuring that we have sound public finances for the long term. Parliament will be given a new role to hold Government to account, and that is important and the right thing to do. I commend the Bill to the House.</p>

 It has been striking, in the brief course of this Bill, just how embarrassed the Labour party and the Government are about it. On Second Reading, we did not have a single contribution from a Labour Back Bencher in support of the Bill. The explanation given by the Exchequer Secretary, in the course of her winding-up  <br>


<meta name="Date" content="20 Jan 2010">

<notus-date day="20" month="1" year="2010" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><b>20 Jan 2010 : Column 396</b><br>
speech, was that perhaps those who wanted to make a contribution were not able to do so because of the bad weather. Well, the weather is fine today and, despite the best efforts of the Government Whips, we have had one contribution from a Labour Back Bencher that could be said to be mildly supportive. It was from the hon. Member for South Derbyshire (Mr. Todd), although his argument was that the Bill gave us an opportunity to debate the matter and he did not expect it to become legislation in any event. He did not sound unduly unhappy about that state of affairs.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o334"><a name="100120-0018.htm_para17"><a name="10012088000037">Even on Second Reading it was clear that the Chancellor of the Exchequer did not have his heart in proposing the Bill. He explained that if there was a major recession the terms of the Bill would have to be ignored anyway. Even by his standards, he had the lugubrious and weary tone of someone who did not really want to be there, and his body language was almost enough to say, "That's another fine mess you've got me into, Gordon." Since then, the Chancellor has had one of his periodic bouts of assertiveness and has started giving lengthy newspaper interviews about cuts in public spending, although it is noticeable that he has stopped talking about this Bill. Even the Chancellor does not take it seriously enough, or believe that the public will take it seriously enough, to be bothered to advocate its merits.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o335"><a name="100120-0018.htm_para18"><a name="10012088000038">We have not had enough time to debate the matter. The Minister said that there had been sufficient time, but I am not sure how many Bills there have been on which consideration in Committee has not got beyond clause 1, which is what has happened on this occasion. I suspect that the Lords will not have an opportunity either to scrutinise the Bill sufficiently. Unlike with most Bills, there has not been an opportunity for evidence sessions to hear what the experts say. Given that this Bill is all about creating the right impression, one would have thought that that would have been of some use.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o336"><a name="100120-0018.htm_para19"><a name="10012088000039">It is not surprising, however, that we have been denied the opportunity to hear what the experts have to say, given that practically every public comment on the Bill has dismissed it. I have quoted at length already various economist and business leaders. One person whom I have not quoted, however, is Lord Turnbull, former Cabinet Secretary and permanent secretary to the Treasury, who last week wrote in the <i> Financial Times</i> that</p>
<a name="100120-0018.htm_brev0"><a name="10012088001048"><ul><p class="tabletext">"an external constraint is needed... It should not take the form of a statutory limit on borrowing, as the present government proposes. Remember the fate of the US Gramm-Rudman act and the European Union's stability and growth pact...More promising is the proposal for an office of budget responsibility...Its purpose should be to provide authoritative judgments and commentary that ministers ignore at their peril-in other words, to raise the political cost of bad policy."</p>

However, the Bill does not do that. An office of budget responsibility would do that.</p>

 That is a helpful contribution. I am sure that you, Mr. Deputy Speaker, would not want me to be overly diverted on to the governance of such an office of budget responsibility. Clearly, however, accountability to Parliament is important, and I have no doubt that such an office would enhance the role of the Treasury Committee and Parliament's ability to scrutinise what the Government are doing.</p>

 Traditionally, at this point in the Bill process, we all thank the Clerks and the others who have contributed so much to our deliberations over many weeks, but as we have not had any meaningful deliberations, it is difficult to thank them to the extent that normally I would. I have hardly got to know them or, for that matter, the Minister any better than I did. It was the most cursory examination of a most pathetic Bill. The Minister says that we have had a chance to look at the Bill in detail, but we got only to the end of clause 1. Admittedly the Bill has only six clauses, but if the entire detailed scrutiny process gets bogged down in clause 1, it is hard to argue that we have had the opportunity that the Minister claims we have.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o340"><a name="100120-0018.htm_para23"><a name="10012088000046">Leaving that to one side, it is fair to argue that we do not need to scrutinise the Bill for very long because it is so pathetic and because it is such an insult to the House to introduce it in this form, as is the idea that the Government have fiscal responsibility merely because they proclaim in an Act of Parliament that they possess it, even though they have no evidence to support that assertion. Indeed, that is such a laughable claim that very few Labour MPs have been able to bring themselves to come to the House and show any enthusiasm for the Bill at all, which is extraordinary when we consider what the Government are proposing.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o342"><a name="100120-0018.htm_para25"><a name="10012088000048">Let us imagine what would happen if we went into another recession in, for the sake of argument, 2013 or 2014.

What an extraordinary position for Labour MPs to be in. Indeed, I am amazed that the Government could find any MPs to vote for the legislation at all. I know that some oppose it from the left, as it were, because they think that the Government are cutting the deficit with excessive zeal, but that is not essentially the point that I am making. The point that I am making is that the Government should not be putting Labour MPs in a straitjacket with this preposterous Bill, which takes no account of what might happen in the next six years and chains Labour MPs to a potentially devastating series of public spending cuts.</p>

 I have said that, and I do not know many people who think that £178 billion a year is not enough. Of course we need to cut the deficit. Less than two years ago the Government estimated that the deficit this year would be £38 billion; instead it is £178 billion. We are borrowing about £500 million extra every day. One quarter of our entire public expenditure is unfunded. Do I think that that is sustainable? Of course not. Of course we have to address the budget deficit. The question is whether we actually do something about it, by making concrete proposals and putting in place a series of credible measures, or whether, as an act of displacement, we pass a law that says that in future we have to make some meaningful suggestions and actually do something, and imagine that, as a consequence, people will be reassured.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o345"><a name="100120-0019.htm_para0"><a name="10012088000059">We are supposed to be debating Third Reading and there are four specific objections to the Bill. First, it offers no flexibility. We have tried to improve that, but there is still no flexibility short of the Chancellor ripping up the legislation. Secondly, the provisions cannot be disregarded. There is no flexibility for different circumstances, and there is no formal mechanism for disregarding the Bill. It is all to be done on the whim of the Chancellor or a Minister. Thirdly, there is no accountability. What will happen if the Government do not meet the terms of their own legislation? The answer is nothing.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o346"><a name="100120-0019.htm_para1"><a name="10012088000060">Finally, and most importantly, the Bill is not meant to achieve any of the things that I have mentioned. The Minister has acknowledged that it is meant to send a signal that the Labour Government are credible on deficit reduction, but no one believes that it sends that signal. There are only two reasons why anyone in the markets and in the country is feeling reassured about deficit reduction. The first is that Lord Mandelson has seized the wheel of the Government again, and he appears to have an understanding of these matters that the Prime Minister does not. The second is that people are expecting Labour to lose the general election. They are not as alarmed as they would otherwise be because, when they see this charade; they know that the group of people surrounding the Prime Minister who put together this insulting legislation will be governing the country for only a matter of weeks, and that we can then get on with the serious business of making proper progress.</p>

 I have sat through the debates all afternoon; I left the Chamber for only a short time. I hope that the House will forgive me if I intervene at this point, but my amendment was not reached. I think that that has now happened for about three days running, but never mind.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o347"><a name="100120-0019.htm_para2"><a name="10012088000063">The tragic irony for many of us is that there is a consensus across the main political parties that some of us do not share. That consensus is on the answer to the question: who is going to pay for this crisis? It appears from the consensual discussions that have taken place that the people who will pay for it are those who never contributed to it. It will not be the people who got the bonuses, or those who, through their reckless greed, brought the economy to a standstill and into crisis. Nor, to be frank, will it be the Government Ministers who, through their neglect and deregulation, allowed that to happen. As a result of this Bill, it will be ordinary working people who will lose their jobs.</p>

On average, we can expect a 10 per cent. cut in jobs, which means 500,000 civil servants. The tragedy is that, in the very month in which the Government are announcing those cuts through this legislation, they are also bringing forward proposals to scrap the civil service compensation scheme, so the redundancy scheme will go as well. Large numbers of people will lose their jobs as a result of this economic crisis, which was not of their making. They will also  <br>

lose the redundancy entitlements that they had been expecting and to which they signed up when they took their jobs in the public service.</p>

We have already seen announcements in London this week about possible hospital closures. There was a lobby of Parliament today by Land Registry workers, 1,700 of whom are to be sacked, and 1,500 jobs are to go at Network Rail, which will put public safety at risk. This is all because there is consensus in this House that ordinary working-class people will pay for this crisis.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o350"><a name="100120-0019.htm_para5"><a name="10012088000066">Some of us think that there is an alternative. Yes, it would involve cutting some public services, but it is also about scrapping Trident and ID cards, and about getting rid of the waste of resources involved in privatisation and getting rid of all the consultants, on whom we spend hundreds of millions: £400 million alone was spent on the private finance initiative on the London underground. It is also about re-introducing a fair taxation system that would tackle all the avoidance and evasion and ensure that those people who have made such profits through their exploitation of the public services that have been privatised actually pay their way in our economy. Why are we so hidebound in trying to resolve this economic crisis within the four-year time scale that the Government have set for us?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o351"><a name="100120-0019.htm_para6"><a name="10012088000067">What we are asking for now is a planned approach to our economy-no longer a casino economy, but an economy that serves the needs of our people. Rather than the current rush towards cuts and further privatisations, we need the creation of an economy that will enable the casino wheels to start spinning again. That is the debate that we should have had today, but instead we have had a surreal debate about a meaningless piece of legislation that will have no effect in the real world in terms of reassuring the markets in the long term, but will have a real effect in terms of cuts in public-</p>

 I am very pleased to be able to bring this somewhat esoteric subject of ex parte applications in the family courts for consideration in the House. Ex parte applications are now known as without notice applications, and, effectively, only one side of the argument is presented in the courts when a particular type of order is sought from the courts. I believe that to be particularly acute in the family courts at the moment and would pray in aid an article written by two district court judges, published in the <i> Law Society Gazette</i> of 22 May 2008. That date is getting on for two years ago, so it is not as if it is a new problem-it is a long-standing one. The two judges were Judges Stephenson and Gerlis, and the article was entitled, "Abusing the system". I believe that this is an abuse of the system.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o366"><a name="100120-0020.htm_para0"><a name="10012088000558">I was prompted to raise this subject, initially, for two unrelated reasons. First, a celebrated local lawyer in Liverpool, Mr. Rex Makin, had written his usual diatribe in the local newspaper. On that occasion, not for the first time, he was attacking members of the legal profession. He complained, with great cause, about the increasing and frivolous use of ex parte, or without notice, applications before our courts. That also brought to mind a case with which I was involved, to which I shall refer, which I have taken up with the Minister in the past. I would obviously not wish to identify the people involved, but it is a good example of what happens. I shall refer to them as family A-Mr. and Mrs. A-to give a flavour not only of what happens when this abuse of the system takes place but of what happens subsequently, when the layman or woman, perhaps somebody like myself, tries to find out what the process is.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o367"><a name="100120-0020.htm_para1"><a name="10012088000559">Some time ago, Mr. A left the family home late one evening and took the only child of the marriage with him. Obviously, that is a sad incident that repeats itself in many families and homes across the country when there is a breakdown or potential breakdown in a relationship. The highly distressed mother of the child, quite naturally, sought legal advice the following day. Critically, she had to pay in advance-let us be fair, people get nothing for free from the lawyers-for the solicitor to write a letter to the estranged husband at his parents' home, where he had gone with their child.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o368"><a name="100120-0020.htm_para2"><a name="10012088000560">That same Friday afternoon, unbeknown to the wife and mother, her husband had filed several applications for orders through his solicitor. It has become commonplace for this to occur up and down the country. The applications were for a prohibited steps order, a residence order and an occupation order. The net effect of those orders, if they had been granted, would have been that the mother would have been on the street and isolated from her only child. That is the fact of the matter, but for whatever reason-I choose my words carefully-the judge saw fit only to give a prohibited steps order. It was put in place for one week until there was a full hearing of Mr. A's application. That was done ex parte-that is, Mrs. A had no idea that these decisions about her only child were being made.</p>
<br>


<meta name="Date" content="20 Jan 2010">

<notus-date day="20" month="1" year="2010" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><b>20 Jan 2010 : Column 407</b><br>

<p><a name="stpa_o369"><a name="100120-0020.htm_para3"><a name="10012088000561">A week might not seem a very long time from the perspective of a place like this, but to the mother of a five-month-old baby, it is a cruelty beyond measure, because a week seems like an eternity. When such orders are granted without her knowledge, she is left in a vacuum of ignorance, at least for a while. When she was informed, it was by a process server, late that evening. Anybody with any experience of the law in the towns and cities of this country knows that a person's ability to obtain legal advice over the weekend in one of our provincial cities, unless that person has a regular solicitor and lots of money behind them, is virtually impossible. She was left in total ignorance about what could be done.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o370"><a name="100120-0020.htm_para4"><a name="10012088000562">I was very interested when I saw the forms. The form used for an occupation order has a box to be filled in if an applicant-Mr. A in this instance-wishes to have the application heard ex parte, and Mr. A, or his solicitor, had ticked this box. The box has a rubric, saying:</p>
<a name="100120-0020.htm_brev0"><a name="10012088001055"><ul><p class="tabletext">"The reasons relied on for an application being heard without notice must be stated in the statement in support."</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o371"><a name="100120-0020.htm_para5"><a name="10012088000563">I therefore went through both order applications. Form C1 for the prohibited steps and residence orders has a section 13 in which was printed a series of unsubstantiated allegations about Mrs. A's mental health. These were repeated in an affidavit accompanying the occupation order application. Nowhere, however, was there any written argument as to why the application should be heard, as a matter of urgency, ex parte.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o372"><a name="100120-0020.htm_para6"><a name="10012088000564">I thought to myself, "Well, perhaps that argument was put orally." That is not unknown; when we look at the literature, we find it is sometimes done over the telephone-it is done by solicitors under the old pals principle within the legal fraternity, but in my view that denies a basic principle of justice. In the case under discussion, however, if that argument was put orally to the judge, there is no record of it. I found that extraordinary, and I was not alone: two judges have since remarked on that fact in subsequent hearings of the family A case. After all, there are only three reasons why a judge might rule in favour of an ex parte hearing: if there is a risk of harm to the applicant or child from the respondent; if otherwise the applicant would be deterred from pursuing the case; and if otherwise the respondent-Mrs. A-would simply evade the court proceedings. She clearly would not do that, however, as she did not know anything about them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o373"><a name="100120-0020.htm_para7"><a name="10012088000565">I know the actors in this drama, and it would take a persuasive case to convince anyone that Mr. A-a 6 feet 2 inches tall, 18 stone, rugby-playing man-would either be intimidated or put off from pursuing the case by anything his wife might say or do. I went through the statements, and the only reference I could find to anything that might be taken as even remotely hostile or aggressive was his claim that his wife was</p>
<a name="100120-0020.htm_brev1"><a name="10012088001056"><ul><p class="tabletext">"abusive and shouting, and waving her arms around...goading me into hitting her".</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o374"><a name="100120-0020.htm_para8"><a name="10012088000566">For that reason, he was somehow deemed worthy of getting an order in his favour at this ex parte hearing.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o375"><a name="100120-0020.htm_para9"><a name="10012088000567">The criteria for ex parte hearings were, in general, designed to protect abused women, rather than abusive men, but the judge in this case clearly did not think so-or was convinced by Mr. A's solicitor. We will never  <br>

know for sure about that, however, because there is no record. I tried to find the record of what transpired in this case. I looked at the document bundle, and there was nothing in that, so I tried, on behalf of Mrs. A, to get this phantom record via Her Majesty's Courts Service. Its flat response to my inquiry was that Mr. A's affidavit</p>
<a name="100120-0020.htm_brev2"><a name="10012088001057"><ul><p class="tabletext">"explains why Mr. A felt the need to apply for an urgent order".</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o376"><a name="100120-0020.htm_para10"><a name="10012088000568">That is wholly untrue, and wholly unhelpful. That organisation has insisted to me that it followed the administrative process, which is its role, and that the decision was down to the judge. I am very well aware of that fact, but it can give me no rationale as to why the case was heard ex parte. There must be a record of this somewhere, and I would love to see it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o377"><a name="100120-0020.htm_para11"><a name="10012088000569">I was advised to contact Sir Mark Potter, president of the family court, to whom I expressed my misgivings in writing. He told me there were three means of redress in these circumstances. One was an appeal, and another was a complaint for misconduct by the judge other than a wrong decision. How can we complain, however? We have no idea what his decision was, so what is there to complain about? Also, how can anyone appeal when they do not even know that the action has taken place until halfway through the period of time in which the child is taken away-from the mother in this case?

I understand that, of course. No bureaucracy is going to set aside the decision of a court, but what chance has a poor woman, especially a stranger to the legal system? How would she know where to begin to have a decision reversed, when she is already in emotional turmoil because of what has happened? No doubt she could have a judge disciplined for being politically incorrect, but where would she get the money to obtain the advice to turn over a wrong decision on a weekend in the provinces?</p>

In the case that I described, I clearly believe that the woman is in the right and the man is in the wrong, but it does not affect just men as opposed to women, or vice versa. It depends who gets in first.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o386"><a name="100120-0020.htm_para20"><a name="10012088000578">It is a sine qua non of justice that people have a right to be heard, other than in the most extreme circumstances. It has become a matter of habit that people are denied the right to be heard by the frivolous use, or abuse, of the system in order to get ex parte hearings. If there are sound reasons for an ex parte hearing in line with section 45 of the Family Law Act 1996, so be it. We all recognise that there are extreme circumstances in which an ex parte hearing is right, proper and unavoidable. For example, if somebody has disappeared, gone abroad or cannot be traced, what alternative is there to an ex parte hearing? But in the present case it is an abuse.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o387"><a name="100120-0020.htm_para21"><a name="10012088000579">It cannot be right that there should be an old pals act between lawyer and judge, casually agreed late on a Friday afternoon when they are all anxious to get away, to suit the convenience of everyone involved except for the bewildered, shocked and sometimes traumatised respondent. That cannot be right. I know that the Minister is fair-minded. I urge her to look urgently into how we can prevent this abuse. It has gone on far too long, it is happening far too often, and it does not serve the reputation of anyone involved if it is allowed to continue.</p>

In particular, in all ex parte applications it is likely that article 8 of the European convention on human rights, on the right to respectful private and family life, and article 6, on the right to a fair hearing, will be engaged for many if not all the parties-and the courts have to pay full regard to the parties' convention rights.</p>

<notus-date day="20" month="1" year="2010" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><b>20 Jan 2010 : Column 410</b><br>

<p><a name="st_o388"><a name="10012088000584"><a name="100120-0020.htm_spnew2"><a name="10012088001571"><b>Bridget Prentice:</b>
 I shall come on to that point in some detail. My hon. Friend gave some examples of occasions when ex parte applications have to be heard. Sometimes it is because the individual cannot be found, but more often in domestic violence cases, it is because an abused woman needs the protection of the courts speedily. Generally, applications are heard with neither party in attendance, although that situation would be exceptional in private law applications, especially those in respect of children. Under the Children Act 1989, the court is required to make the welfare of the child its paramount consideration whenever it determines a question about the upbringing of a child. Normally, therefore, a court will have to weigh up the evidence of both parents; sometimes, to assist the court in making that decision, it may receive a report from the Children and Family Court Advisory and Support Service.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o390"><a name="100120-0020.htm_para24"><a name="10012088000585">The court should make an order only if it considers that to be better for the child than not making an order at all. Unfortunately, it is not possible to identify from court statistics the number of private law applications that are heard ex parte under the 1989 Act, but the courts take the view that only in exceptional circumstances should orders be made without all parties being present. However, in answer to one of my hon. Friend's queries, I should say that there are occasions when the court is presented with a situation in which an immediate decision must be made to secure the safety and security of the child. But there would need to be a compelling reason on welfare grounds to change a child's residence on an ex parte basis. That situation may arise if there are unexplained injuries that the child claims have been inflicted by the partner of the parent with whom the child lives. The court would then have to make an immediate decision to safeguard the child's welfare.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o391"><a name="100120-0020.htm_para25"><a name="10012088000586">Generally, the court directs that any order that it makes will be effective only for a short time, and that all parties should then attend the full hearing-usually after seven or 14 days. However, I accept my hon. Friend's point that for a mother of a five-month-old child, seven days is a very long time. It is a very long time in the child's life, too, and that should be taken into account as well. Alternatively, the court might make the order subject to granting other parties the power to apply to vary the order at short notice.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o392"><a name="100120-0020.htm_para26"><a name="10012088000587">The court rules require the applicant to serve the section 8 order application within 48 hours of making the order. They also provide that the application is to be filed when the application is made, unless the hearing is by telephone, in which case the deadline is 24 hours after the application is made.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o393"><a name="100120-0020.htm_para27"><a name="10012088000588">Courts are aware that making a decision without hearing from both parties carries considerable risks, so they should take steps to ensure that the order can be reviewed at the earliest stage possible. I was interested in what my hon. Friend said about the legal representation in the case that he cited. There is also a high duty owed to the court by the advocates making the application without notice. They have to make the fullest disclosure of all the material facts, including any defence that they have reason to anticipate may be advanced. Where one of the parties is not able to attend the court, the court will have to make the order subject to freedom to apply to vary or revoke the order should the individual who is unable to attend subsequently be able to do so.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o394"><a name="100120-0020.htm_para28"><a name="10012088000589">Let me turn to how abuse of process might be avoided. I have to say to my hon. Friend that there are no general fixed rules that have to be applied. Justice Munby said in a case in 2001:</p>
<a name="100120-0020.htm_brev7"><a name="10012088001062"><ul><p class="tabletext">"The circumstances in which ex parte relief is obtained in the Family Division vary very widely."</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o395"><a name="100120-0020.htm_para29"><a name="10012088000590">He goes on to set out a form of guidance, which he says is not a "set of inflexible rules" because</p>
<a name="100120-0020.htm_brev8"><a name="10012088001063"><ul><p class="tabletext">"Circumstances alter cases and, in the final analysis, every case must be considered on its own facts".</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o396"><a name="100120-0020.htm_para30"><a name="10012088000591">However, the general features that can be determined are that there must be compelling reasons why notice cannot be given. For example, where the case involves children, a compelling reason might be that the child's welfare would be compromised if a parent were alerted in advance of the application. There must be a genuine emergency. Lack of information itself-this is key in my hon. Friend's case-does not justify an emergency. The applicant must give candid and frank disclosure of all the circumstances known to them and, as I said, the advocates are under a high duty to the court. Justice Munby said:</p>
<a name="100120-0020.htm_brev9"><a name="10012088001064"><ul><p class="tabletext">"Unparticularised generalities will not suffice"</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o400"><a name="100120-0020.htm_para34"><a name="10012088000599">There is considerable judicial opinion that ex parte applications should be used only in exceptional circumstances and that they should normally be heard on notice. I will ask officials to see whether they can find out whether there is a systematic exercise going on whereby some advocates are using Friday afternoons to make an application, in the full knowledge that it makes it very difficult for the respondent to have any opportunity to make a response. I will also raise the matter with the president of the family division in case further guidance is needed on that issue, as well as in general. I hope that in doing that, I will give my hon. Friend some succour in the idea that I am taking on board the difficult circumstances that he has outlined.</p>

We will ensure that applicants and respondents have the opportunity to make their case and that children are not removed from a family home or a parent with care without proper consideration and investigation of the circumstances surrounding them.</p>
