<p><a name="st_o0"><a name="60214-01_spmin0"><b>The Minister of State, Department for Transport  (Dr.   Stephen Ladyman): </b> 
 The national rail network in south-east England, like that of the rest of the United Kingdom, is owned and operated by Network Rail, which is investing substantial amounts across its network, including in south-east England, to help to address years of under-investment. Total investment in 2005&#150;06 is expected to be about &#163;3 billion.
</p>





<p><a name="st_o1"><a name="60214-01_spnew0"><b> Michael Gove: </b> 
 I thank the Minister for his reply. He will be aware that the <i>Evening Standard</i> has been running a campaign to stress the importance of safety in our stations, but he will also be aware that safety is not only an issue in the capital. In my constituency, Camberley station has witnessed an upsurge in antisocial behaviour recently. I invite the Minister, when he invites companies to tender for the franchise currently held by South West Trains, to ensure that passenger safety and security are at the heart of the tendering process so that my constituents have the protection they deserve when they travel.
</p>





<p><a name="st_o2"><a name="60214-01_spnew1"><b> Dr. Ladyman: </b> 
 I share the hon. Gentleman&#039;s concern that everybody should feel safe on the railway, and I can give him the assurance he seeks. In the consultation document about the letting of the franchise, we made it clear that safety, security and the condition of stations were key factors, which we shall reflect in the tender documents when they are issued to the shortlisted bidders.

</p>





<p><a name="st_o4"><a name="60214-01_spnew3"><b> Dr. Ladyman: </b> 
 My hon. Friend should be aware that we are looking into a number of opportunities to change services. There is a consultation and her views will be taken into account. She should bear in mind, however, that we need to ensure that we make the best use of existing rail capacity, and underused services sometimes have to be rationalised. When that happens, we have to ensure that there are alternative services, but at the end of the day we have to get the greatest number of people on to existing capacity, which is what we seek to do. However, my hon. Friend&#039;s views and those of her constituents will of course be taken into account.

<p><a name="st_o14"><a name="60214-01_spnew13"><b> Dr. Ladyman: </b> 
 Yes, the company will be able to use those facilities and we shall look into how we can facilitate that.

</p>





<p><a name="st_o16"><a name="60214-01_spnew15"><b> Dr. Ladyman: </b> 
 Of course the funding will be transferred, but I should add that London has already received a very generous settlement from the Government.

 (Con): I listened carefully to the Minister&#039;s response to my hon. Friend the Member for Surrey Heath (Michael Gove) about the South West Trains franchise. I read the tender document this morning. It sets out about 12 overall objectives for the new franchise agreement. It makes no reference at all to safety. Why?
</p>





<p><a name="st_o18"><a name="60214-01_spnew17"><b> Dr. Ladyman: </b> 
 The hon. Gentleman should read it again: the consultation document very clearly refers to safety and to the state of stations.
</p>





<p><a name="st_o19"><a name="60214-01_spnew18"><b> Chris Grayling: </b> 
 I did read it, and it is the Minister who may need to read again, because I can assure him that it makes no reference to safety. The Government promised in their 10-year plan to enable passengers to travel safety and to feel secure. Since the plan was first published, the number of violent assaults taking place on trains and at stations has risen by 43 per cent. Does the Minister think that the Government are keeping that promise?
</p>





<p><a name="st_o20"><a name="60214-01_spnew19"><b> Dr. Ladyman: </b> 
 First, let me tell the hon. Gentleman what the consultation document states, since he seems to have had a little bit of word blindness:

<a name="60214-01_para2">
<a name="stpa_o2">Certainly, it is true that the figures on attacks at stations that we produced this week are very disappointing. However, the mechanism by which they were calculated changed halfway through, which gives them a false air, unfortunately. Nevertheless, one is one too many. That is why we have increased the number of British Transport police on mainline stations and the underground by 50 per cent in the past two years&#151;we have increased it by 300 in the past year alone&#151;and it is why we are working to invest in CCTV at stations and to improve station services. We are making that

<p><a name="st_o21"><a name="60214-01_spmin1"><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Transport  (Derek Twigg): </b> 
 The changes made in the Railways Act 2005 are designed to improve efficiency and co-operation across the rail industry. As part of those changes, Network Rail is now accountable for performance and co-ordinating rail industry planning and operational management.
</p>





<p><a name="st_o22"><a name="60214-01_spnew20"><b> Rosie Cooper: </b> 
 Under the Tories&#039; botched privatisation, Railtrack and the train operating companies were constantly fighting one another, and the main losers were the travelling public. With Network Rail in place, instead of Railtrack, what steps is the Minister taking to ensure that all parts of the rail industry work together for a better service&#151;for example, the rail interchange that was opened last week in my constituency at Burscough? What improvements does he believe&#151;

<p><a name="st_o23"><a name="60214-01_spnew21"><b> Mr. Speaker: </b> 
 Order. One supplementary question is fine.
</p>





<p><a name="st_o24"><a name="60214-01_spnew22"><b> Derek Twigg: </b> 
 It is important to point out that, of course, working together is a very significant part of improving performance. That is why reliability is improving, with the number of on-time trains reaching more than 85 per cent and, of course, with the record investment of &#163;87 million a week that is going into the railways. We have introduced joint control centres along lines, such as Birmingham to Waterloo, and joint improvement plans are being set up between the train operating companies and Network Rail. Of course, we are working together on projects such as that in my hon. Friend&#039;s constituency at Burscough Bridge station, which I opened last week.

 (Con): Bitter experience&#151;most recently, yesterday&#151;has taught me to expect all trains from Worcestershire to London Paddington to be at least half an hour late, largely owing to the creaking infrastructure. Will the Minister urge Network Rail to co-operate much more effectively with the train operating company and listen to First Great Western&#039;s very practical and affordable suggestions to improve the infrastructure on the line and the reliability of services?
</p>





<p><a name="st_o26"><a name="60214-01_spnew24"><b> Derek Twigg: </b> 
 Clearly, part of the problem is that money was not spent on the infrastructure over the previous few decades, particularly under the Conservative Government, but I have raised the issue with First Great Western and Network Rail. Of course, we want to see further improvements, and significant investment has been put in place on the Great Western lines to ensure that improvements take place over the coming years.

</p>





<p><a name="st_o28"><a name="60214-01_spnew26"><b> Derek Twigg: </b> 
 I understand exactly what my hon. Friend is saying. Of course we have made representations about the fact that we have concerns, and we want services to improve as well&#151;so, yes, such discussions take place.

<p><a name="st_o29"><a name="60214-01_spnew27"><b> Tom Brake  (Carshalton and Wallington)</b> 
 (LD): Co-operation between Network Rail and the train companies is so poor that three out of 10 cancelled trains are cancelled because of Network Rail. Co-operation between the Department for Transport, the Association of Train Operating Companies, Network Rail and Alstom is so poor that Alstom has closed the UK&#039;s only test track for trains without formal prior discussions. Does the Minister believe that the Secretary of State for Transport&#039;s efforts to improve co-operation on the railways have been more or less effective than his intervention in the Dunfermline and West Fife by-election?
</p>





<p><a name="st_o30"><a name="60214-01_spnew28"><b> Derek Twigg: </b> 
 The point that the hon. Gentleman is trying to make about the Alstom test track is an interesting one. The fact remains that railway performance is improving. We have record investment in new rolling stock, the youngest railway stock that we have had for a number of years and more than 1 billion passengers used the railways last year. It is the fastest-growing railway in Europe. Significant improvements are being made but, of course, there are still things to do. About 20,000 train services run every week, about 1.2 per cent. of which are cancelled. Of course, we need to improve that, and it is something that we are working on.

<p><a name="st_o32"><a name="60214-01_spnew30"><b> Derek Twigg: </b> 
 I do not think that we have any proposals to privatise Network Rail, but the working relationship between the train operating companies, Network Rail and the Government has been important in securing improvements to the railways. Network Rail has improved its performance and its efficiency, but there is clearly still more to do on the railways. We want to see further improvements on the improvements that we have already made.

 (Con): Does the Minister realise that one of the biggest obstacles to improving the rail infrastructure is the sheer complexity of the number of bodies involved?

Is it Network Rail; is it Central Trains, which is about to lose its franchise; is it Worcestershire

</p>





<p><a name="st_o34"><a name="60214-01_spnew32"><b> Derek Twigg: </b> 
 If we are talking about the mess made to the organisation of the railways, we have to go back to the Tory party and what it did to Railtrack and so on. We have now set up a new structure on the railways involving the Department for Transport, Network Rail, which is responsible for performance, operating and improvement, and the train operating companies, which are responsible for improving the service. Clearly, the answer to the hon. Lady&#039;s question depends on who owns the platform. Bringing together the partners is an important part of any business case or reasoning for developing the platform or changing it.

 The Government encourage communities to support franchised local railway services via community rail partnerships. They recognise the role of voluntary organisations in running independent railways. They will not normally provide direct financial support for independent lines, but will consider working with local authorities to implement specific improvements where they are value for money.
</p>

 The East Lancashire Railway is a very successful voluntary rail company. It passes through my constituency and those of my hon.

Will the Minister consider a joint evaluation with the Greater Manchester passenger transport authority to see whether it is possible to create a link through Heywood that would satisfy, and provide benefits to, the public and all three constituencies?

 I know that my hon. Friend is a very strong campaigner for improving public transport. A few months ago, I opened a new bus station in his constituency and I know that he also campaigns to try to improve rail links. The East Lancashire Railway is part of a heritage railway that brings in lots of income and visitors to the area. However, on the point about extending its use to mainline services, I must say that we have not received any representations from Manchester or Lancashire about reopening the line for passenger services.

We have gone through a consultation process on the new franchise, and clearly we will examine its results when we consider the invitation to tender. He is right to highlight the importance of community railways. We now have six such schemes throughout the country and there is increasing support for community rail development, so it is especially important to involve the community, whether that is businesses, local authorities or members of the public.

 As my hon. Friend says, the scheme is a successful development that forms part of the Government&#039;s overall commitment to community rail development. As part of the overall growth in the railways, we want more people to use the line. If we get more of the community involved in supporting the service, including businesses and local authorities, and make the service attractive, I am sure that it will continue to grow.

 Numerous studies have made the rather obvious point that the more congested the road system, the greater the disadvantage to the economy. The bigger question to address is what we do about that. Clearly, we need additional capacity, which is why, for example, we completed a major widening of the M25 just before Christmas. We need to manage the road system better, which we are doing throughout the network with, for example, traffic management officers clearing up after

We need to examine whether it might be better to replace the existing system of paying for road use with distance-based charging. As I have said on many occasions, if we do not do that, we will face total gridlock. We are not short of analysis, but we need to concentrate on solutions that will reduce congestion in the longer term.

Many of our motorways are almost urban slip roads around the great cities of Britain, yet we have one of the few motorway systems that involves no charge. Will my right hon. Friend consider introducing in the interim a vignette of &#163;30 to &#163;40 for motorway users, including all foreign cars and lorries that come into Britain, but allowing rural people who do not use motorways not to pay that extra money? Such a simple and practical scheme could be put in place until his all-singing and all-dancing road pricing and satellite in the sky operation comes into being, for which we might have to wait a little after the end of his term of office.

 Having been here for almost four years, I would not bank on that. I am not sure how much thought my right hon. Friend has given to the matter, but it simply would be neither feasible nor desirable simply to toll motorways if we thought that we would adopt a completely different method of charging for roads a few years later. I have said before that a national road pricing scheme is some years off, but I believe that we can pilot such a scheme regionally in the next five years or so. Simply charging for some roads, but not for others&#151;<i>[Interruption.]</i> I shall come on to the vignette in a moment. Although my right hon. Friend prides himself on his knowledge of matters European, I think that he would find that the Commission would come down very hard on us if we tried to impose something that discriminated against foreign drivers, because the Single European Act is supposed to stop that. The short answer is that I do not think that he is advocating a good idea, but I will be more than happy to discuss it with him afterwards.

</p>





<p><a name="st_o49"><a name="60214-02_spnew12"><b> Mr. Darling: </b> 
 I do not think any of the authorities that have expressed an interest in road pricing have looked at whether it should be anything more than revenue neutral. I announced just before Christmas the funding that was available for seven areas, and later this year I will announce funding for more areas. I have made it clear, however, that we are prepared to provide that funding, because I want to be able to choose, probably next year, a particular area where we can pilot the scheme. Until we conduct a pilot we will not be able to bottom out the technical problems or evaluate how people behave in practice. However, I am proposing to help local authorities to do so by providing funding.

 My fellow Ministers and I meet the Road Haulage Association regularly. It was supportive of our work on lorry road user charging&#151;a form of road pricing&#151;which was included in the national scheme.

It believes that that means that everyone who uses our roads should pay to do so&#151;I think that that is the point that my right hon.

 It remains to be seen whether we use Galileo or GPS. The hon.

Norwich Union, for example, offers pay-as-you-drive insurance. The Government believe that if we can use existing technology or work in partnership with others who do so that would be much better than the Government having to invent a system on their own, as the history of doing so by successive Governments has not been an altogether happy one. Galileo would have other uses besides road transport.

<p><a name="st_o63"><a name="60214-03_spmin1"><b>The Secretary of State for Transport  (Mr. Alistair Darling): </b> 
 As part of the preparation needed to implement a road pricing scheme, I am considering ways to make it easier to run bus services by mutual agreement. We are discussing with the Office of Fair Trading how this can be done, consistent with competition law.
</p>





<p><a name="st_o64"><a name="60214-03_spnew6"><b> Tony Lloyd: </b> 
 I warmly welcome my right hon. Friend&#039;s helpful remarks. He is aware that when people from a city such as Manchester travel to London, they are often amazed at how comprehensive the bus service is. They compare it with the post-deregulation period in Manchester, where bus services have been withdrawn from the estates and other areas where people live, and they draw the conclusion that we need re-regulation to ensure that we get back to the kind of bus services that London has and other cities expect. Can my right hon. Friend help us with that?
</p>





<p><a name="st_o65"><a name="60214-03_spnew7"><b> Mr. Darling: </b> 
 I think I can. As my hon. Friend knows, my Department and I have been in discussion the Greater Manchester passenger transport authority, among others, about how we improve public transport, particularly bus services. The problem is that it is not possible for representatives of a local authority and two bus companies to sit down and reach an agreement about the adequacy of the bus service, matters of fares and so on. If we are to achieve greater demand management and introduce road pricing and other measures, there must be such an agreement. If we are to say to people, as in London, &quot;Don&#039;t take your car, but get on to public transport&quot;, the public transport must be available in the first place. I am not satisfied that the present system of dealing with buses deals with that. I have said before that I do not want to go back to the pre-1986 legislation because that had its own problems, but I think we can make a quantifiable change in the way in which bus services are provided outside London. That is what we are discussing, and I hope to have something further to say in the not too distant future.

Given the discussions that his Department has had with the GMPTE, can he advise me as to what powers he will look at providing it with specifically to tackle traffic congestion?
</p>





<p><a name="st_o69"><a name="60214-03_spnew11"><b> Mr. Darling: </b> 
 My hon. Friend makes a good point. It is as much in the interests of bus operators as of everybody else to ensure sensible management of the amount of traffic going through the streets of Manchester, as well as other places. That is why the Greater Manchester passenger transport authority is currently looking at the measures that it needs to take over the next five to 10 years to reduce the amount of traffic coming into the city and improve public transport. We are working closely together to achieve that. In terms of bus services, it will be possible to deliver such improvements only with the powers that will be necessary to ensure that buses are running where they are supposed to be running, as they should be if we are to persuade people that they should leave their cars at home. We discuss these matters not only with the Greater Manchester PTA, but with Stagecoach and other bus operators.

</p>





<p><a name="st_o71"><a name="60214-03_spnew13"><b> Mr. Darling: </b> 
 The position varies across the country. The hon. Gentleman is right that London bus usage has increased dramatically, but he should bear in mind two things. First, the Mayor of London has deliberately introduced measures such as the congestion charge and others to encourage people to leave their cars at home. Furthermore, through the support of central Government, the Mayor is spending more than &#163;400 million supporting those bus services. In other parts of the country, such as Brighton, York, Oxford and Cambridge, where bus companies and local authorities are working well together, there has also been an increase in bus patronage. What I have been referring to is further measures that are important and indeed necessary if we are to see an increase in the use of buses, particularly in larger conurbations such as Greater Manchester or in the west midlands, where I 

<br>&nbsp;<br>

<p><a name="st_o76"><a name="60214-04_spnew1"><b> Mr. Darling: </b> 
 My hon. Friend is absolutely right. That station carries many more passengers than it was ever designed for, and it is essential not only for Birmingham and the west midlands, but for many other routes that run through the area. On any view, there will have to be a substantial public contribution, which may involve the railways funded by the Department for Transport, the Department of Trade and Industry or others.

In addition, the BTP is being asked to do an increasing amount of sophisticated work in relation to anti-terrorist activities in London, where it works with the Metropolitan police. The question that we are considering is whether it is best that it should remain as   the BTP&#151;[Hon. Members: &quot;Yes&quot;]&#151;or be firmly focused.

 Trams can be very effective in heavily trafficked areas. We remain prepared to support the introduction of trams when they are the right solution, but we must take account of the cost. In many cases, a well-designed and promoted bus-based system is likely to provide a more cost-effective solution.

 The Under-Secretary&#039;s answer is as      enlightening as the Department&#039;s usual communications on light rail. In the light of the Government&#039;s decision not to fund the Leeds supertram scheme, and figures that show that three times as much money is spent per person on public transport in London and the south-east compared with Yorkshire and the Humber, does he agree that the Department is failing on public transport outside London, that the Government&#039;s regional economic policy is a sham and that all that shows an ever-increasing&#151;

 First, may I pay tribute to my hon.

She is right that IT crucially enables local government&#039;s delivery of public services and I believe that approximately 30 local authorities are involved in the initiative. Of course, we would like it to be rolled out much further so that best practice becomes common practice throughout the country.

 I would assume that the hon. Member for Vale of York (Miss McIntosh) would know the position in North Yorkshire better than I do. Nevertheless, I can tell her that public services have been transformed and personalised throughout the country through changes in IT. In North Yorkshire, like the rest of the country, most of those services are highly effective and our constituents use them. For example, they may renew tax discs and pay tax online and visit Directgov. If the hon.

 My hon. Friend is absolutely right that IT has the potential to bridge the divide, which, left unchecked, would grow. There are excellent examples of that improvement throughout the country. I visited Eastserve in Manchester, a project in the western isles and another on an oil platform in the North sea halfway to Norway. They are excellent innovations and examples of the delivery of public services to people, regardless of their background and age. However, I agree that much more can be done and many comments and ideas are contained in our transformational government strategy, which was published in November last year.

We are learning from the Dutch, the Danes and others who match our aspirations and ambitions on better regulation. Importantly, we shall know that we have succeeded&#151;as we are beginning to do now&#151;when other countries look at our example.

 My hon. Friend&#039;s analysis is correct. If the UK and the European Union are to succeed in the global economy, given the challenges from China and India, our ambitions for better regulation need to be much more robust.

So why has not he, as the Cabinet Office Minister charged with responsibility for deregulation, published a list of the regulations to be scrapped?

</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="60214-06_para6">
<a name="stpa_6">In Britain today, there are some 770,000 disabled children&#151;7 per cent. of all the children in our country. Despite medical advances, the prevalence of disability is increasing. Since 1975, there has been a 62 per cent. increase in the number of disabled children. At this point, I want to pay tribute to the many thousands of parents, carers and teachers of children with severe learning disabilities, who work tirelessly day in, day out, to give children in their care all the opportunities, love and support that they need and deserve.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60214-06_para7">
<a name="stpa_7">One test of a civilised society is how it supports the families in greatest need. We know that disabled children and young people face multiple barriers to achieving their potential, or to sharing similar life chances to everyone else. We know, too, that severe disabilities place great burdens on families and close friends. Surveys show that it costs three times as much to bring up a disabled child, while for many parents the barriers to work are insurmountable. More than half of disabled children in Britain today live in poverty.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60214-06_para8">
<a name="stpa_8">Successive Governments have recognised our obligations to these families. The Government&#039;s recent report, &quot;Improving the Life Chances of Disabled People&quot;, which was masterminded by the Under-Secretary of State for Education and Skills, my hon. Friend the Member for Liverpool, Garston (Maria Eagle), set out the overarching children&#039;s policy framework and how it has evolved in recent decades: from the Children Act 1989, to the &quot;Every Child Matters&quot; Green Paper and the subsequent Children Act 2004. That report highlights how the Government are doing more to support disabled children and their families through measures such as extra cash help in the form of the child tax credit, a network of special educational needs co-ordinators, and section 8 of the national service framework for children. But we know that there is still a long way to go.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60214-06_para9">
<a name="stpa_9">Last December, I met the parents and teachers of Kingsland school in Stanley, in my constituency, to where younger children with severe and profound learning difficulties come from across the Wakefield district. Kingsland is truly a brilliant school. Highly praised by Government inspectors, it is the first special school in my district to receive the primary basic skills quality mark. As I have seen, the children have a great time every day, especially at lunchtime. But when I talked to a group of parents and teachers, I heard first hand how tough life can be. Head teacher Nitsa Wainwright explained to me how difficult the school finds it to access services such as speech therapy or physiotherapy outside the school term.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60214-06_para10">
<a name="stpa_10">Parents&#039; biggest concern is the lack of reliable respite care. They described to me the great stress that both parents and siblings endure, especially during the holidays, when there is no school and such families are

<br>&nbsp;<br>caring for severely disabled children 24 hours a day, seven days a week. They told me how much they value the chance of an occasional break&#151;to go to the pub or on a trip to meet friends&#151;and they explained how much more difficult life becomes when, as happens too often, their respite care is delayed, curtailed or cancelled because of staff shortages or problems with transport. These parents need more support, and I have been in contact with my local authority and primary care trust to represent their concerns. There is a real will in our district to make things better.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60214-06_para11">
<a name="stpa_11">I have also discovered that these families are not alone in their struggle. Contact A Family and Mencap tell me that thousands of parents across the country face similar problems. In Britain today, 3,000 children are on waiting lists for family-based short breaks; three out of 10 children wait more than a year for such a break; and six out of 10 of those in greatest need get no, or very few, breaks. It is no wonder that, according to a Mencap survey, eight out of 10 families with disabled children are at breaking point. Margaret Sparks, a school governor of Kingsland school, told me of her and her husband&#039;s huge struggle to get proper respite care for their daughter, Kathryn. As one parent said to me:

<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_4">&quot;Most of the time the organisational challenge of getting out together as a family can be too great and it&#039;s just too difficult. At least with respite care you have the hope of a chance of being able to go out and be a normal family and enjoy things like cinema or swimming which many people just take for granted. For us, respite care means the difference between doing normal things like this and actually cracking up as a family.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="60214-06_para12">
<a name="stpa_12">My Bill aims to improve the services for families such as the ones whom I met in my constituency. It is supported by Contact A Family, the Council for Disabled Children, Mencap and the Special Educational Consortium, which have been working together for several years to raise awareness of the issues that the Bill addresses. It is also supported by a number of backers and supporters from all parts of the House, many of whom have campaigned for years for a better deal for disabled children and their parents. They include Members such as my right hon. Friend the Member for Coatbridge, Chryston and Bellshill (Mr. Clarke), who introduced disabled persons legislation in 1986, and who is chairman of the all-party group on learning disability.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60214-06_para13">
<a name="stpa_13">I also wish to pay tribute to the late Rachel Squire, the former Member for Dunfermline and West Fife, who was a patron of Contact a Family and a tireless campaigner on behalf of carers and disabled children and adults. She will be sadly missed.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60214-06_para14">
<a name="stpa_14">My Bill proposes three important changes that would improve the rights of disabled children and their families. First, it seeks to make clear in law for the first time that local authorities must assess disabled children and provide them with a range of services where those are assessed as necessary. Our research has shown that there is no duty to assess disabled children under the Children Act 1989 equivalent to that in the National Health Service and Community Care Act 1990, although that duty has been implied in case law and policy guidance.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60214-06_para15">
<a name="stpa_15">The Bill would give disabled children the right to a local authority assessment and to receive services. It would do so by proposing amendments to section 17 of 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>14 Feb 2006 : Column 1286</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>the Children Act 1989, and by drawing directly on a previous and pioneering private Member&#039;s Bill, which became the Chronically Sick and Disabled Persons Act 1970. I am sure that the whole House joins me in paying tribute to the work of Alf Morris, now Lord Morris, whose work radically improved the life chances of disabled people in our country.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60214-06_para16">
<a name="stpa_16">Secondly, my Bill would give disabled children and their families an explicit right to short breaks and respite care. Under the community care regime, adult social service authorities are obliged to provide disabled adults with short breaks where the authority has assessed that such a need exists. However, no such obligation exists at present under the Children Act 1989. If enacted, the Bill would therefore empower parents in coming forward to ask for assessments and for the services and respite care they badly need.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60214-06_para17">
<a name="stpa_17">Thirdly, my Bill would also require NHS bodies to work co-operatively with local authorities to promote the health and welfare of disabled children in England and Wales, and enhance the delivery of services such as speech and language therapy.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60214-06_para18">
<a name="stpa_18">I know from my discussions with Ministers that they support the objectives of my Bill.

I know, too, that Ministers are committed to using every lever at their disposal to deliver our manifesto commitment to

<p>
<a name="60214-06_para19">
<a name="stpa_19">I look forward to further discussions and, in the forthcoming spending review, I hope that the Government can bring forward a cross-cutting public service agreement for disabled children, which can match resources with greater co-ordination between local authorities and the NHS to deliver, for families with disabled children, the care and support they badly need.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60214-06_para20">
<a name="stpa_20">I hope that we can make progress in giving parents with disabled children enhanced support&#151;building on what has already been done&#151;so that every child in our country has the best start in life.

<p><a name="st_5">Ed Balls accordingly presented a Bill to make provision about the assessment of disabled children&#039;s needs; to amend the law relating to children; to place duties on local authorities and the National Health Service in respect of disabled children and their carers; and for connected purposes: And the same was read the First time; and ordered to be read a Second time on Friday 12 May, and to be printed [Bill 128].</p>





<p><a name="st_6"><a name="60214-07_spnew0"><b> Mr. Eric Forth  (Bromley and Chislehurst) (Con):</b> 
 On a point of order, Mr. Speaker. I seek your guidance, because I hope that the House will be able to divide on 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>14 Feb 2006 : Column 1287</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>amendment No. 8 to the Health Bill. I say that for two reasons. First, I believe that the House should be given an opportunity to vote for the status quo, and my amendment would provide the only chance to do so. Secondly, if the House cannot vote on my amendment, some of us might be obliged to vote against the Bill on Third Reading, which would be most unfortunate, because it would mean a confusion between the smoking elements in part 1 and the rest of the Bill, which is&#151;I have no doubt&#151;admirable. I hope that you will give consideration to allowing a division on amendment No.   8, so that the House may take a distinct and separate view on that part of the Bill.
</p>





<p><a name="st_7"><a name="60214-07_spnew1"><b> Mr. Laurence Robertson  (Tewkesbury) (Con):</b> 
 Further to that point of order, Mr. Speaker. I endorse the comments made by my right hon. Friend the Member for Bromley and Chislehurst (Mr. Forth). You will note, Mr. Speaker, that my amendment No. 36 accepts that some places may be deemed smoke-free but that licensed premises would not be smoke-free and thus not caught by the legislation. Is it your intention to allow a vote on that amendment too, if we get to that point?
</p>





<p><a name="st_8"><a name="60214-07_spnew2"><b> Mr. Speaker: </b> 
 I can tell the hon. Gentleman and the right hon. Member for Bromley and Chislehurst (Mr.   Forth) that the key is new clause 5. I am not encouraging either Member to do this, but they would be advised to vote against the new clause, because if it is carried their amendments fall. Procedurally, that is the position&#151;<i>[Interruption.]</i> The right hon. Member for Bromley and Chislehurst may be displeased but I can only tell him that that is the procedure. If new clause 5 is carried, the amendment mentioned in his point of order will fall.

<p><a name="st_9"><a name="60214-07_spnew3"><b> Mr. Christopher Chope  (Christchurch) (Con):</b> 
 Further to that point of order, Mr. Speaker. Does the same apply to amendment No. 6, in my name, which deals with the important issue of whether people should be allowed to smoke in their private motor vehicles?

 On a point of order, Mr. Speaker. I ask for your help in ensuring that Members do not have the procedure of the House of Commons explained to them too clearly, because it will completely confuse them and they might actually use their own opinion to decide how to vote.

<p><a name="st_18">I am delighted that we have reached the Health Bill&#039;s final stages in this place. The Bill had 12 constructive sessions in Committee, just over six of which were devoted to the smoke-free provisions, with the remaining time spent discussing other important parts of the Bill. With no programming at all, I was delighted that the Committee managed to discuss all the Bill&#039;s main provisions. I was even more pleased that there were only two Divisions during Committee, a reflection of the fact that this is a very good Bill indeed.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60214-07_para1">
<a name="stpa_24">As time is more precious on Report, we decided to programme the proceedings, but only lightly. Although the smoke-free provisions are clearly an important part of the Bill, and have generated much interest, the measure contains many other significant provisions. Few amendments have been tabled in relation to other parts of the Bill, but there are amendments on the important provisions on infection control in part 2, and it is right that they should receive a hearing. We have thus proposed a generous three hours in which to conclude our discussions on the first two groups of amendments, which relate to smoking, after which we shall move through the remaining amendments. That is a sensible allocation of time and I hope that Opposition parties will not delay the start of what promises to be a lively debate.</p>

</p>

<p>
<a name="60214-07_para2">
<a name="stpa_25">In the three hours available, we are discussing two groups of amendments&#151;those relating to the smoking ban and the completely separate provisions about the 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>14 Feb 2006 : Column 1289</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>position of 16 to 18-year olds. As the first group is obviously contentious, with a wide range of related issues, it seems extremely likely that the whole three hours will be taken up by discussion of the smoking ban, which means that the provisions on 16 to 18-year-olds will not be debated at all, although I am aware that there was a short debate in Committee. Furthermore, as there is a Government new clause it will be voted on, even though it will not have been debated.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60214-07_para3">
<a name="stpa_26">Will the Secretary of State confirm that even if we do not debate the new clause she will force a vote on it? She is nodding, so she must be happy for us to change the position for 16 to 18-year olds without debate in the House. It will thus seem that not enough time was available, but in fact the Government could have given us more than one day on Report. The Pensions Bill had three days on Report. If these important issues cannot be properly debated because there is not enough time this afternoon, the Government should allocate extra time and not make a quite major change without any debate. For that reason, I regard the programme motion as unsatisfactory.

If passed into law, it will save thousands of lives every year, as vulnerable people are no longer exposed to dangerous second-hand smoke at work, and as thousands of smokers are encouraged to cut down or quit altogether.&quot;</p>

Almost 85,000 people die every year from lung cancer, respiratory illnesses and heart disease. We have acted to deal with that scourge. We have already banned tobacco advertising, strengthened health warnings on cigarette packets and introduced NHS stop-smoking programmes, which in 2004&#150;05 alone have helped nearly 300,000 people to give up smoking.

<p>
<a name="60214-08_para3">
<a name="stpa_31">Yesterday, the Under-Secretary of State for Health, my hon. Friend the Member for Don Valley (Caroline Flint), launched our latest anti-smoking television and radio campaign. Now, with this Bill, we will ensure that from the summer of next year&#151;18 months earlier than we originally proposed&#151;smoke-free workplaces and public places will become the norm. Over time, we estimate that an additional 600,000 people will give up smoking as a result of this law and that millions more will be protected from second-hand smoke.

 I do indeed share my hon. Friend&#039;s surprise at that. All Labour Members believe that it is right to legislate to ban smoking in the vast majority of workplaces and public places, and I welcome the fact that at least some&#151;perhaps many&#151;Opposition Members now agree with us. However, there are different views inside and outside the House on exactly how far smoke-free legislation should extend and on where the balance should be struck between protecting people from harm and protecting people&#039;s freedom of choice.

<p><a name="st_70"><a name="60214-09_spnew3"><b> Dr. Howard Stoate  (Dartford) (Lab):</b> 
 My right hon.

<a name="stpa_34">The new clause provides a general power to make exemptions from the smoking ban. This is necessary to exempt from the ban people&#039;s own homes and places that are, in effect, someone&#039;s home, at least temporarily&#151;in other words, long-term adult residential care homes, hospitals and mental health hospitals for adults, prisons and hotel bedrooms.

 We believe that it is right for prisoners, who quite properly have no choice about where they live, to be able to exercise choice in the matter of smoking within appropriate restrictions.

That is a straightforward question that deserves a straightforward answer.

 I note that the manifesto policy of the Liberal party is for a total ban. That is not, of course, the policy of most of the contenders for the leadership of the hon. Gentleman&#039;s party.

 Just so we are absolutely clear about what the Secretary of State is now proposing, as opposed to what she outlined on Second Reading, will she confirm that new clause 5 would not only prevent the designation of smoking rooms&#151;although the original proposals would have allowed that, and she said on Second Reading that the Government would consult on the matter&#151;but not permit pubs that did not serve prepared food along with drink to be exempt? Is it not the case that as distinct from when she gave evidence to the Health Committee, she has expressly moved away from the manifesto position that she extolled on Second Reading?

<a name="60214-09_para3">
<a name="stpa_35">We have begun to explore two controversial issues. There is the question of whether all pubs and licensed premises should be covered by the smoking ban, or whether, as we originally proposed, those that do not serve food should be exempt. Unlike clause 3, new clause 5 would not allow any exemption to be made for licensed premises. In other words, all pubs, bars, discos and night clubs, including those that do not serve food, would be entirely smoke-free. It is right to have a complete ban on smoking in public places, including all licensed premises, so I hope that my hon. Friends and other hon. Members will join me in voting for new clause 5.

 Will the Secretary of State explain whether she thought the opposite on Second Reading on 29 November? Did she believe at the time that it was right to exempt pubs that did not serve food? Who in the Government believed that the policy that she presented to the House then was the right approach?

<p><a name="st_89"><a name="60214-09_spnew22"><b> Ms Hewitt: </b> 
 I said on Second Reading that I was delighted to be bringing forward a Bill that is an enormous step forward for public health, regardless of the question of non-food-serving pubs. As I indicated, the issue is how we strike the right balance between protecting people from harm on the one hand and protecting people&#039;s freedom of choice on the other. One such balance is reflected in clause 3, but I and many of my hon. Friends believe that it would be better to achieve the balance of imposing a smoking ban on all licensed premises, regardless of whether they serve food.

 The Secretary of State is quite right to listen to the consultation and to propose to amend the original Second Reading formulation. However, new clause 5 contains a potential anomaly, as it says:

<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_8">&quot;The appropriate national authority may make regulations&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="60214-10_para0">

Theoretically, if the Bill is enacted and comes into force before the national authority makes those regulations the absurd prospect arises that it would be illegal to smoke in one&#039;s own home. Can the Secretary of State assure us that she will make sure that those regulations are made in time to prevent that anomaly arising?

<a name="stpa_37">The second issue on which there are genuine differences of opinion both inside and outside the House is that of private membership clubs. Government new clause 5 would exempt genuine private membership clubs from the ban. To allow hon. Members to express their views on that issue separately from the question of licensed premises generally my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary has tabled amendments (a) and (b) to (d) to the new clause. Those amendments, taken together, would not allow any exemption to be made for private clubs&#151;in other words, the smoking ban would extend to them as well. By &quot;membership clubs&quot; we mean only the qualifying clubs operating with a club premises certificate under the specific rules of the Licensing Act 2003, including the stipulation that the club is not open to the general public and that it is run on a not-for-profit basis.

<p>
<a name="60214-10_para5">
<a name="stpa_41">There are about 18,500 registered membership clubs in England, representing a wide range of interests. There are working men&#039;s clubs, political clubs, military and sporting clubs and so on. I believe that the arguments on membership clubs are very finely balanced. On the one hand, there is a case for making even more places smoke-free and establishing a level playing field for pubs, licensed premises and membership clubs. On the other, there is the case, strongly put to me by many of my own constituents, that a genuinely private membership club that is not for profit and is effectively owned and run by the members themselves should be treated in the same way as people&#039;s own homes, where people decide for themselves. I believe that that is a very strong argument, but I will listen to the debate extremely carefully, and on this point in particular.

 Let me make it clear that if Parliament should decide to exempt private members clubs, the regulations that follow&#151;which will be subject, as I said, to the affirmative resolution procedure&#151;will require members to have an annual vote on the smoking issue, and in order to fulfil our manifesto commitment to protect employees even in those exempt premises, smoking will be banned in the bar. Furthermore, we will review those and other provisions of the new law within three years.

If the amendments fall but the new clause is passed unamended, the smoking ban will cover all public places and workplaces, including licensed premises, but not genuine private members clubs. If the new clause falls, the smoke-free provisions that are set out in the current draft of the Bill will remain&#151;in other words, in that situation we will introduce regulations to exempt both membership clubs and licensed premises that do not prepare and serve food.

We did indeed debate on Second Reading and in Committee the question whether it could be achieved on a self-regulatory basis.

</p>

<p>
<a name="60214-11_para2">
<a name="stpa_47">Let me be clear: smoking kills and it remains the largest cause of avoidable deaths in this country, and that mortality includes several thousand people each year who we believe die as a consequence of exposure to second-hand smoke. The greatest element of that problem is exposure to second-hand smoke in the home, to which the Secretary of State referred. The figures were clearly set out in November 2004 in the Scientific Committee on Tobacco and Health report: there is a 24 per cent. increase in the risk of developing lung cancer for non-smoking women whose partners are smoking men; there is a 37 per cent. increase in the risk of developing lung cancer for non-smoking men whose partners are smoking women; and there is a 19 per cent. increase in the risk of developing lung cancer for those who are exposed to passive smoke in the workplace.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60214-11_para3">
<a name="stpa_48">The risk of lung cancer is well understood; the risk of cardiovascular disease is less well understood, but arguably much more significant. The risk of developing lung cancer increases in direct proportion to the number of cigarettes smoked and the duration of smoking. Damage to the heart and arteries, however, seems to occur disproportionately at lower exposures, such as those experienced through exposure to second-hand smoke. Although passive smokers may have an uptake of tobacco smoke equivalent to only about 1 per cent. of that of an active smoker, the risk of their developing heart disease increases by 25 per cent.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60214-11_para4">
<a name="stpa_49">Last year, a study in the <i>British Medical Journal</i> estimated on that basis that more than three times as many people die from ischemic heart disease as a result of passive smoking as die from lung cancer. Evidence produced in the past four or five years suggests that small amounts of exposure to second-hand smoke can lead to substantial increases in the risk of developing cardiovascular disease.

 The BMJ report refers to some 1,500 people dying from passive smoking as a result of the increased risk of lung cancer, some 5,500 people dying from passive smoking as a result of the increased risk of cardiovascular disease and about 4,000 people dying from the increased risk of stroke&#151;interestingly, the Scientific Committee on Tobacco and Health did not find on the evidence that there is an established relationship between exposure to second-hand smoke and an increased risk of stroke.

I do not dispute that a significant number of deaths have been and continue to be associated with exposure to second-hand smoke in the workplace, which is one of the reasons why we have always supported protection in the workplace. As we set out in our manifesto, the objectives of policy should be to reduce the incidence of smoking, to ensure that non-smokers are not exposed to smoke unless they want to be, to protect workers in the workplace and to ensure that children are not exposed to second-hand smoke. We set out that position in our manifesto; I said it again on Second Reading; and I have not departed from it.

<a name="stpa_50">As shadow Secretary of State for Health, I must say&#151;not least to my hon. Friends&#151;that it is imperative on health grounds to stop unwanted exposure to second-hand smoke and potentially reduce the prevalence of smoking, especially among young people whose smoking habits tend to become entrenched in the workplace. The Secretary of State accepted that point when she introduced the Bill at the end of last year, but she then made a perverse and bogus distinction between pubs that serve food and those that do not. On Second Reading, we asked her to explain the health grounds for making such a distinction, but she offered no evidence on that point. However, given the effect of that on health inequalities, which was subsequently exposed in great detail by the Select Committee on Health, we knew that it was wrong when it was presented. I think that most Labour Members knew that it was wrong and, frankly, that the Secretary of State knew that it was wrong, but she would not admit it.

 I understand the hon. Gentleman&#039;s point. I suspect that the reason is more to do with pragmatism than anything else, but I am making an argument about private clubs. The Secretary of State says that 95 per cent. of passive smoke comes from the home, as though the other 5 per cent. is somehow inconsequential, yet we have heard that we are talking about a very large number of people whose health is clearly adversely affected and, probably, thousands of premature deaths over a period of years. Although I enjoyed the comments of the hon. Member for Ealing, North (Stephen Pound), perhaps we need not be apocalyptic, but such things are fundamentally important to each individual case.
</p>





<p><a name="st_187"><a name="60214-15_spnew8"><b> Mr. Andrew Turner: </b> 
 Of course, such things are fundamentally important to each individual case but, if only 5 per cent. of those who have died of passive smoking acquired that outside the home&#151;that seems to be the figure that the Secretary of State was quoting&#151;will the hon. Gentleman explain on what basis we are supposed to make a judgment? Of course, if that was 100 per cent. likely, the case for banning it might be better than if it was nil per cent. likely.

</p>





<p><a name="st_188"><a name="60214-15_spnew9"><b> Steve Webb: </b> 
 No. The hon. Gentleman is getting confused between a certainty of 5 per cent. and a probability of five in 100. In other words, as we have just heard, no one doubts that the health of people who work in bars where people smoke suffers and that some of them die prematurely. That is certain, inasmuch as these things can ever be proven with certainty. There is not a 5 per cent. chance that that is true; it is pretty much 100 per cent. true for that 5 per cent. That is the distinction that I am making. A set of people who work in such environments suffer and that is pretty much proven empirically.

A distance criterion has been suggested, as though the smoke will come to a screeching halt at the line. That is a strange basis on which to protect people&#039;s health. Will we say that people can smoke if they face away from the bar but not if they face towards it? It seems incredible that ministerial comments so far have suggested a distance criterion. People can smoke if they stand away from the bar, but not if they are close to it. The Secretary of State shakes her head, but that is exactly what was said on Second Reading, as the record will show.

People would also have to clear the glasses in such rooms and sort out any scuffles that might take place. Smoke will remain in such areas, especially if they are sealed, for a considerable time. Without the ventilation found in a Jumbo jet&#151;I gather that it is what it would take completely to purify the air&#151;there will be residual toxins in the air.

 I said earlier that when the Under-Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, my hon. Friend the Member for St. Helens, South (Mr. Woodward), made a statement on comprehensive legislation on the matter for Northern Ireland, which will be considered in the House because of the suspension of the Assembly, he said that ventilation did not work. We examined ventilation and found no evidence to support its use. An academic from the university of Wales could supply us with no evidence that air conditioning works.

Let me summarise what the Committee found. First, scientific evidence on the health effects of second-hand smoke is clear and overwhelming. We accept the verdict of the Government&#039;s advisers from the Scientific Committee on Tobacco and Health&#151;SCOTH&#151;that exposure to second-hand smoke increases the risk to non-smokers of heart disease and lung cancer by about a quarter.

<a name="stpa_100">In most, although not all, cases, the tobacco industry continues to deny such evidence. Representatives of the industry continued to pursue that line when they gave evidence to the Committee. However, it should not be forgotten that for many years the industry denied in public that direct smoking was a cause of cancer, although its private view was very different. Indeed, action that was taken in the United States meant that it opened its archives, which gave us evidence that it knew about the consequences of direct smoking years ago, but hid those facts.

 Will my right hon. Friend acknowledge the work of Sir Richard Doll, who sadly died a year ago at the age of 90?

 I acknowledge what Richard Doll did in not only the United Kingdom, but worldwide. His authority on the matter was denied for many years, mostly due to the connivance of the tobacco industry, which tried to hide the fact that deaths were caused by tobacco here and throughout the world.

<a name="stpa_101">Using the estimates of risk in the SCOTH report, Professor Konrad Jamrozik calculated in a paper published in the <i>British Medical Journal</i> that exposure to second-hand smoke in the workplace caused about 600 deaths a year, which is about three times the number of people in this country killed in industrial accidents each year. Second-hand smoke is also responsible for thousands of episodes of illness. For example, Asthma UK reports that it is the second most common trigger of asthma attacks at work.

<a name="stpa_102">Of course, workers who are routinely exposed to other people&#039;s smoke are those who are most at risk.

I suggest that there are thus sufficient health and safety justifications for ending smoking in the workplace. I deeply regret that the Bill is seen as a measure of public opinion, rather than a measure to protect people in the workplace, which is how other such legislation that we pass is thought of.

Why should workers in such pubs be denied the protection that other workers are to be given? It is nonsense to think that we should pass such a measure in the House. Health and safety concerns are sufficient reason not to exempt membership clubs from the law. Licensed clubs employ bar staff, who are routinely exposed to other people&#039;s smoke. The fact that the clubs in which they work are owned by members does not afford them any protection from lung cancer or heart disease. The notion that club members should be able to vote to continue to expose their workers to such risks is unacceptable. I came to the House after working for 18 years in one of the most dangerous industries in the United Kingdom. It would be unacceptable for Parliament to pass legislation on that industry by ignoring fundamental facts, but the Bill attempts to do so on smoking.

In its evidence to the Select Committee, the Health and Safety Commission clearly recommended that pubs, bars and clubs should be covered by the law in the same way as every other workplace. That view is shared by the TUC, which passed a motion nem. con. in congress in September to ban smoking in all workplaces. The Union of Shop, Distributive and Allied Workers, which represents more than 640 bar workers in clubs, wants a ban, and issued a press release on Friday&#151;I am sure that Members have seen it&#151;in which general secretary John Hannett said:

They step outside into unconfined spaces and still enjoy drinks and cigarettes as well without affecting other people in the pub, including bar workers.

The answer is that every drinking establishment, club, restaurant and pub is licensed to sell alcohol, and it does not take a great leap of imagination to work out that it is possible to licence every pub, club and restaurant to be either smoking or non-smoking. The public and employees would then choose which type of establishment they want to patronise, and they will choose smoke or smoke-free. I have no problem with making the installation of cleansing equipment a condition of obtaining a smoking licence. It has been said in this House this evening that air conditioning does   not work, but we are not talking about air conditioning&#151;we are talking about air purification. Air purification systems do work.

She is the Secretary of State for Health and this is one of the most important public health issues that this Parliament will debate. It would have been helpful if, under the protection of a free vote, she could have indicated to the House what her preference was among the options available to us. She said that she would listen to the debate. I have been listening to this debate for 30 years, and it would be astonishing if some new and decisive argument were to emerge in these two hours to clinch the debate one way or the other.

As the right hon.

He also explained that the barrier between a private club and a pub is a very narrow one&#151;a &#163;3 subscription will give access to a wide range of clubs. The tobacco industry wants a confused signal to emerge from Parliament that smoking is an activity that can be validated in certain circumstances.

<a name="stpa_144">It is a good thing that we are going to ban smoking in public places tonight, but it is extraordinary that we did not do it a long time ago. It is such an obvious public health measure and Parliament should have turned its attention to it long ago. My only dissent from what is being proposed&#151;I do not think that it will be tested in the Division Lobby&#151;is that we could have taken a much simpler approach from the beginning. We should simply have proposed to separate the smokers from the non-smokers. The distinctions that the Government originally introduced were not sustainable. The idea that we should distinguish between pubs that served food and those that did not had no foundation in any public health argument. Nor do I believe that the distinction between pubs and clubs is sustainable. Some hon. Members have argued forcefully about the freedom involved in private members clubs being allowed to do their own thing, but that argument is trumped by the view that basic protections should be afforded to the workers involved, and that overrides the distinction. Those workers would not have the freedom not to be exposed to other people&#039;s smoke.

Dr. Richard Edwards, a senior lecturer in public health from Manchester, told the Health Committee on 20 October about a study in the north-west that compared the level of PM2.5 found on heavy traffic roads with that found in smoky pubs.

We have heard that 150,000 people, if not more, work in members&#039; clubs, and I have always felt that the health of a bar worker in a club is every bit as important as that of a bar worker in a pub. Some Members have suggested that perhaps bar workers should change jobs if they do not like the premises that they work in.

<a name="stpa_194">I shall finish by recapping on how the new clause and our amendments will work and the choice they offer Members&#151;<i>[Interruption.]</i>
</p>





<p><a name="st_262"><a name="60214-23_spmin0"><b>Mr. Deputy Speaker  (Sir Michael Lord): </b> 
 Order. I am finding it increasingly difficult to hear the Minister against the buzz of conversation, which seems to be growing by the minute. May we please listen to the Minister in the last few minutes of the debate?
</p>





<p><a name="st_263"><a name="60214-23_spnew3"><b> Caroline Flint: </b> 
 Conservative Members were shouting, &quot;Boring&quot;; I suppose that it is boring to try to save lives&#151;[Hon. Members: &quot;Oh!&quot;] I thought that we were in a new Cameron era that was not about yah-boo politics, but there we go.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60214-23_para9">
<a name="stpa_195">We have heard a wide range of arguments about the merits of the various options that the Government have proposed in the new clause and the amendments. I hope that the second reading of new clause 5 will be a formality. We shall then turn to the amendments to the new clause. As it stands, the new clause allows exemptions for membership clubs but not for licensed premises. Members who believe that private members&#039; clubs should also be smoke-free should vote to accept the amendments tabled in my name. Those who want them to be exempted should vote against.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60214-23_para10">
<a name="stpa_196">Once the amendments to the new clause have been dealt with, we shall vote on the new clause itself, either as drafted or as amended. Regardless of any amendments that may be passed, the main point of the new clause is to prevent any exemption for licensed premises so if Members believe that all pubs, bars, nightclubs and so on should be smoke-free, they should vote for new clause 5. However, if they support clause 3, they should vote against it. Amendments Nos. 18, 19, 20 and 21 are consequential to new clause 5.

<a name="stpa_197">The debate has represented a huge range of views on both sides of the House and has reflected the views held by the public.

<p><a name="st_264"><a name="60214-23_spnew4"><b> Lynne Jones: </b> 
 Will my hon. Friend explain whether the Government&#039;s definition of &quot;substantially enclosed&quot; would include the outside areas of an establishment that served food and drink?
</p>





<p><a name="st_265"><a name="60214-23_spnew5"><b> Caroline Flint: </b> 
 We discussed that issue in Committee, and it was felt that it could be dealt with in regulations. We considered whether some areas&#151;for example, the concourse of a railway terminus&#151;which are substantially but not wholly enclosed, should be smoke-free. There are other examples, but we felt it right that such issues should be sorted out through regulation. They have been raised with me and others, and we shall look at them case by case.
</p>





<p><a name="st_266"><a name="60214-23_spnew6"><b> Mr. Lansley: </b> 
 Will the Minister give an undertaking that regulations made under subsection (2) of the new clause, which defines enclosed and substantially enclosed, should be made by the affirmative rather than the negative procedure?
</p>





<p><a name="st_267"><a name="60214-23_spnew7"><b> Caroline Flint: </b> 
 The hon. Gentleman raised points about substantially enclosed and semi-enclosed premises in Committee, and I am still considering whether some of those areas, including vehicles, should be subject to affirmative resolution. We shall hold full public consultation on all aspects of the regulations, so there will be a chance for everybody in the House and outside to make their views known.

<a name="60214-23_para12">
<a name="stpa_198">This week, we launched a new advertising campaign to show the impact of smoking on people&#039;s lives, especially for the relatives of smokers. I am grateful that Trudi and her daughters were willing to take part in our campaign. Trudi is dying from lung cancer and, with her daughters of 17 and 11, is already making plans for her funeral. It is important that we realise that smoking affects not only the individual who smokes but those who have to breathe in their smoke as well as those who suffer the devastation of losing someone because of a smoking-related illness.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60214-23_para13">
<a name="stpa_199">The adverts are harrowing and challenging, but alongside them we have launched a series of adverts to bring to our screens examples of two ordinary people who have taken up the NHS &quot;stop smoking&quot; services, which have never previously been available in that form. The Government realise that the issue is not simply about restrictions in public places, but about providing our health service with funds to help people give up in difficult circumstances, because for many of them smoking is an addiction.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60214-23_para14">
<a name="stpa_200">I am proud that since 1997 we have not only taken measures to control cigarette advertising but, for the first time, provided, through the health service, opportunities for people to give up not just once but to try again if they fail. Today, we are debating legislation that will make a huge contribution to the public health of our nation. If the Bill is successful in the other place, I look forward to working with every Member of the House to ensure that in every constituency, there will be opportunities for people to take advantage of the restrictions to make choices about changing their

<a name="stpa_201">Most Members share that aim and there is no doubt that our debates over the past eight months have contributed to a huge public debate, which is good. Often, there is not much discussion in the public domain of what we do in this place, so if that is a sign of positive democracy it is to be welcomed.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60214-23_para16">
<a name="stpa_202">However, the task does not end with passing the Bill and introducing restrictions; 95 per cent. of deaths from cancer are among people exposed to smoking in the home. The Bill is not the end of something, but the start of trying to persuade smokers to give up and to give them every possible support.

 We come to a number of minor and consequential amendments. I know that there will be interest in later debates, so I hope we need not spend too long on them but my experience in Committee was that Opposition Members liked a brief Government explanation of the purpose of amendments.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60214-27_para1">
<a name="stpa_210">New clause 7 and amendments Nos. 30 to 32 have a simple objective: to ensure full and proper enforcement of the responsible pharmacist provisions. They do so by placing a specific duty on the Royal Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain and the Pharmaceutical Society of Northern Ireland to enforce those elements of section 72A of the Medicines Act 1968 that are not subject to an offence as a matter of professional misconduct.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60214-27_para2">
<a name="stpa_211">Clause 28, by inserting a new section 72A into the Medicines Act 1968, sets out the detailed provisions in respect of the responsible pharmacist. We debated this at some length in Committee. The responsible pharmacist has a statutory duty to ensure the safe and effective running of the pharmacy for which he or she is responsible. Breach of certain conditions in respect of the responsible pharmacist is an offence, such as the failure to keep a record of who is the responsible pharmacist for a pharmacy at all times.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60214-27_para3">
<a name="stpa_212">Other aspects of the responsible pharmacist requirements are less clear. For example, it is less clear where responsibility lies for the content of the standard operating procedures and how those requirements 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>14 Feb 2006 : Column 1355</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>would be enforced. These more readily lend themselves to enforcement by the pharmaceutical societies through professional regulation. The amendments make it clear on the face of the Bill that the pharmaceutical societies have that duty of enforcement, and that it applies wherever the registered pharmacy is located, whether in a hospital or in the community. Furthermore, the amendments to sections 108 for England and Wales, 109 for Scotland and 110 for Northern Ireland of the Medicines Act clarify that the appropriate Minister in those areas does not have a duty to enforce those provisions that are not subject to offences. However, they give the appropriate Minister a right of entry to inspect and investigate in relation to the other provisions in section 72A.

<br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>

<p>
<a name="60214-28_para1">
<a name="stpa_217">This is an important group of amendments. We discussed health care-acquired infections, particularly MRSA, at some length in Committee, though we were disappointed that the time available did not allow us to explore as fully as we would have liked all the clauses following those related to the ban on smoking. Nevertheless, we covered a great deal of ground.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60214-28_para2">
<a name="stpa_218">The Minister is, I expect, acutely aware of the toll that health care-acquired infections take in the United Kingdom. We reckon that about 5,000 people are killed every year and the statisticians tell us that that is more than the number killed on our roads, so it is a substantial problem. In addition, there are the people whose recovery is impeded as a result of health care-acquired infections but who, fortunately, do recover. The cost to the national health service is enormous. Some estimate that it is around &#163;1 billion a year, so this is a big issue, and it is appropriate that Ministers should take the opportunity to try to improve matters in the course of the Health Bill.
</p>





<p><a name="st_339"><a name="60214-28_spnew2"><b> Mr. Philip Hollobone  (Kettering) (Con):</b> 
 I congratulate my hon. Friend on the words that he has just uttered. Is there not a third category of people who need hospital treatment&#151;I am thinking of elderly people in particular&#151;but who are very worried about the reports that they read about MRSA and other hospital-acquired infections? Such people may not pick up any infections, but the stress and strain they undergo as they await their hospital appointment is often intolerable.
</p>





<p><a name="st_340"><a name="60214-28_spnew3"><b> Dr. Murrison: </b> 
 My hon. Friend is correct. Like me, he will have had constituency experience of the worry involved. People who face the possibility of going to hospital often volunteer the fact that they are worried about it. As I pointed out in Committee, I usually go to some lengths to put the matter in some sort of perspective. Although it is a substantial problem&#151;I hope that the figures that I have given underscore that&#151;the chances of somebody succumbing to such an infection are small. It is important for those of us who try to be responsible to try to reassure people wherever we can.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60214-28_para3">
<a name="stpa_219">The figures speak for themselves, however, and in public health terms, 5,000 deaths a year are significant, so Ministers need to address the problem as a matter of urgency. The way in which they have chosen to do that is to introduce a code. In Committee, we were not particularly happy with the draft code, of which we were heavily critical. I am more than happy to tell the Minister that the version that has been provided more recently&#151;very recently, I have to say; it was placed in the Library unheralded and unannounced yesterday, where we found it&#151;is an improvement, and I am grateful for it. When we met a little while ago, the Minister said that she would let hon. Members have the revised copy as soon as possible, and she has at least given us sight of it before this debate. We must be thankful for that, although it would have been nice to have had the opportunity to examine it more closely and at a more leisurely rate.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60214-28_para4">
<a name="stpa_220">Last week, we saw some updated figures for MRSA bacteraemia, of which the Minister will be well aware. The raw data for the six-month reference periods since 2001 run at 3,616, 3,584, 3,749 and 3,525. The figure for 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>14 Feb 2006 : Column 1357</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>April to September 2005 is 3,580. The best interpretation of those figures is that there has been little or no change during that period; the level seems to have been pretty well flat-lining. The overall rate per thousand bed days is not entirely clear from the data, only in so far as it is specific for individual trusts. The overall rate for the health service is a little opaque. On the basis of eye-balling the results from trusts, I suspect that the overall rate per thousand bed days would probably give a worse impression of our success or otherwise with MRSA than the raw data that I have just quoted. Sadly, my statistical skills are not quite what they were, so I struggled with the figures presented to me by the Health Protection Agency, but I believe that that is a fair reflection.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60214-28_para5">
<a name="stpa_221">The disparity between trusts that is apparent from the Health Protection Agency data is grounds for alarm but also hope, because it suggests that health care-acquired infection, and MRSA in particular, can be controlled. For example, the fact that Cambridgeshire and Yorkshire can do so well against the record in Somerset and London suggests that infection rates will be reduced by the adoption of best practice. Presumably, that is why the Minister has introduced the code, which is the burden of part 2, and it is also certainly the reason for our insistence that the code should be robust.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60214-28_para6">
<a name="stpa_222">The question is whether the code is robust. In the short period that we have had to examine it, we have formed the view that while it is better than the draft version, it is not quite as robust as we might have liked. On comparing amendment No. 12 and what we have said in Committee with what has transpired, we have found bits that we would commend and that improve the original draft, on which we congratulate the Minister, but we are disappointed by some elements.
<a name="time_17">
<a name="60214-28_time0"><h5>7.45 pm</h5>
</p>

<p>
<a name="60214-28_para7">
<a name="stpa_223">We were pleased to note that one or two of the elements in amendment No. 12 have been reflected. Notably, there are improved lines of accountability, but we note that there is no categorical mention of a board member with specific responsibility for health care-acquired infection control. Perhaps the Minister will clarify that point, as we felt that it was important to nominate at board level somebody with specific responsibility for the matter, perhaps among other duties, and to whom those who carried out hospital policy on health care-acquired infection were responsible. That board-level responsibility is not entirely clear, although we accept that some of the changes in the revised code would improve the prominence of health care-acquired infections at such a level.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60214-28_para8">
<a name="stpa_224">We have also noted that the code now refers to pre-admission screening, which we said in Committee was important, as the Minister will remember. Indeed, there is also some reference to post-discharge surveillance in certain circumstances. I imagine that that has been informed by the University College hospital work in the area, which I am happy has found its way into the revised draft code.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60214-28_para9">
<a name="stpa_225">Other good things have appeared, such as a strong reference to occupational health in hospitals. I freely admit to my interest in the matter, as before I was 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>14 Feb 2006 : Column 1358</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>elected, I was a locum consultant occupational physician at the Gloucestershire Royal hospital, so I have a particular interest in occupational health. I am convinced that the health service has traditionally not done particularly well on occupational health, and I am pleased that it has a relatively high prominence in the revised code.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60214-28_para10">
<a name="stpa_226">I struggled to find much reference to dealing with locum casual and agency staff in the health service. It relies heavily on such personnel, so it is important that any occupational health service captures them adequately. My experience as a locum is that people often simply come and go, and that occupational health and any control mechanisms do not touch them at all. It is important that we deal specifically with such staff. As I said in Committee&#151;I was perhaps rather too graphic&#151;we do not want any Typhoid Marys wondering around the health service, potentially spreading infection through bad practice or whatever. That is an omission from the code, and perhaps the Minister could reflect on it in her remarks.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60214-28_para11">
<a name="stpa_227">We remain concerned about the lack of clear standards relating to a model cleaning contract, a point that we raised in Committee. Despite the strengthening of lines of accountability that I have mentioned, we are concerned about the fact that managers are still not clearly and indisputably in charge of everything that happens at ward level. I know that the Minister will regard that as a constant Opposition refrain, but we believe in it strongly. Our experience suggests that we need proper control of what goes on at ward level, and we believe that cleanliness and hospital-acquired infections are all rolled up with the lack of control that sometimes exists in our national health service.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60214-28_para12">
<a name="stpa_228">We regret very much the lack of reporting of health care-acquired infections at departmental level. The Minister will remember that we spent some time on these matters, and that I described my personal experience of them. As I recall, we had a slightly light-hearted debate about the cleanliness of doctors&#039; hospital clothing&#151;their white coats, neckties and so on. My hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Bedfordshire (Mrs. Dorries) spoke at some length about nurses&#039; uniforms. Departments are not ultimately responsible for health care-acquired infections. The national health service is labour-intensive: it relies on its people. At the end of the day, it is people who are responsible for all the good things that happen in our NHS and, sadly, for those areas in which things are done less well.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60214-28_para13">
<a name="stpa_229">Unless we focus on individuals at a level lower than that envisaged by the code, we may miss a trick in identifying less good practice that potentially causes or contributes to a health care-acquired infection, which is why we have insisted that any data should be collected at the lowest possible level, although having read the revised draft code, it does not seem that that point has been adequately taken on board. When we get data, I hope that the report is conducted at a fine level rather than at a macro level, where I suspect that lessons will be lost.

It is reasonable to assume that some trusts are doing less well because they do not comply with good practice, much of which is laid out in the code. The matter is, of course, complicated, and some trusts do less well because of the nature of their work, but it is still reasonable to assume that those trusts that are doing less well are to some extent not applying the best practice laid out in the code. I hope that the Healthcare Commission examines that matter and, where it is necessary to do so, implements the necessary measures to make sure that those institutions improve.

 I support the thrust of the amendment, but we have got the law right and are about to get the code right. What is important now is ensuring that the fine words are put into practice in hospital environments up and down the country.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60214-29_para0">
<a name="stpa_233">Before Report, I visited Stafford hospital to talk to hospital staff about protection for patients and visitors to hospitals against health care-associated infections. It was heartening to see that some of the measures that we are debating are already being used in practice. For example, amendment No. 12 suggests that a lead person on the board should take responsibility for that matter, which already happens at Stafford hospital.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60214-29_para1">
<a name="stpa_234">The director of clinical standards at Stafford hospital, Jan Harry, is also the director of infection prevention and control. The modern matron for surgery, Naeema Khan, takes the lead as the internal champion to develop strategies on infection prevention and control, and she has sent me a note reminding me about one or two things that they are up to at the hospital. For example, the national guidance about the &quot;Clean your hands&quot; campaign has been taken to heart in the hospital, where there is now a network of hand-washing champions, who are role models for staff, visitors and patients.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60214-29_para2">
<a name="stpa_235">To gain community involvement&#151;no doubt this is true of many hospitals&#151;there has been a competition in schools to design posters for the walls of the hospital. That is a sensible way of trying to capture the public&#039;s attention, and hopefully people will consider their

<br>&nbsp;<br>cleanliness when they are admitted to hospital or visit other patients. Among the many documents reminding hospitals how they should behave, there is now revised guidance on contracting for cleaning. Naeema has informed me that Stafford hospital will be a pilot site for a new ward-cleaning management system and that the relevant preparatory work is under way now.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60214-29_para3">
<a name="stpa_236">In Committee, I discussed capturing information on the level of infection in hospitals, which involves testing and early analysis. Stafford hospital has superb on-site laboratory facilities, so there is the opportunity, with the right guidance, to follow best practice in taking samples, getting assessments, making reports and collecting information. As the hospital has pointed out, however, it could do with some help in its constant fight to keep down health care-associated infections, which requires partnerships that go outside the boundaries of hospitals.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60214-29_para4">
<a name="stpa_237">When I visited the hospital, we discussed care homes for elderly people, which provide many admissions to hospitals these days and which, like hospitals, are an environment where we might anticipate a degree of infection unless care is taken. My hospital and its partners, which include residential care providers, are willing to undergo joint screening and to export good practice from the hospital to those homes. Sadly, the hospital has found that there is a cost, and unless people feel particularly motivated, they will not incur it unless they have to. As politicians, we can take the message to potential partners and hospital trusts that there is something that everyone should do.

 In many walks of life, best practice is discovered in the variety of ways in which different organisations operate. If the code is too prescriptive, is there not a danger that innovations in cleaning technology, detection and control will be stifled because such matters are dealt with uniformly?
</p>





<p><a name="st_343"><a name="60214-29_spnew2"><b> Mr. Kidney: </b> 
 Given his intervention, the hon. Gentleman will probably like the Minister&#039;s response. The Minister will say that we should not tie ourselves down with overly restrictive legislation and that a code that can be changed from time to time to keep up to date with innovations and changes is therefore desirable. By informing partnerships beyond the boundaries of hospitals, we are inviting people to take part in the challenge of eradicating those infections. As the hon. Gentleman said, nobody has exclusive possession of the knowledge that will help us to defeat such infections, and I would welcome help from my constituents who want to contribute to the fight. How we engage people outside the boundaries of hospitals in making sure that the incidence of such infections is driven as low as possible is a challenge for us all.

<a name="stpa_239">However, I am not here to lob grenades across the Table by criticising the Government. I want to look at where we are now and how we can move on to improve the situation. I well remember the NHS in the 1970s under a Labour Government, and in the 1980s under a Conservative Administration. The most fearful bug that we had to deal with in those days was klebsiella, which lived on bars of soap. Things are different now.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60214-29_para7">
<a name="stpa_240">I am not naturally a retrospective person, but in the matter of MRSA one has to be. In the 70s and 80s, hospitals were indisputably much cleaner than they are today. However, it is not just a decline in cleanliness that has brought about MRSA in our hospitals; it is also the result of an over-reliance on antibiotics, increased movement of patients within the hospital estate, centrally imposed targets that pressurise hospital staff and administrators to hot-bed patients by getting a patient into a bed before it has gone cold or has even been cleaned properly, and dirty wards and bathrooms. A combination of those factors causes MRSA in hospitals.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60214-29_para8">
<a name="stpa_241">There is another factor which causes me, as an ex-nurse, some embarrassment. It is easily preventable. I discussed it with the Minister in Committee and was disappointed to note that it was not addressed in more detail in the draft code of practice. It is the fact that nowadays nurses travel to and from home in their uniforms. We all know that that is the case. How often do we see a nurse outside the school gates picking up her children, going into a nursery to pick up her toddler, or leaning over the vegetable section in a supermarket while getting groceries on her way into work? We cannot blame nurses for that because changing facilities are no longer available as they used to be. One has to ask why that is.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60214-29_para9">
<a name="stpa_242">One also has to ask on what this casual behaviour of travelling around in nurses&#039; uniforms is based. Is it based on the premise that nurses believe that the uniform is there to protect them, or doctors, from patients and to keep them clean? If so, that is extremely misguided. The purpose of the uniform is to protect the patient from the nurse or the doctor&#151;the patient who, as a result of being in hospital for procedures or from illness, needs to be protected from anybody who enters their vicinity, including nurses and doctors.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60214-29_para10">
<a name="stpa_243">My amendments relate directly to that situation and are simple and to the point. Hospital staff with direct responsibility for patients should not place them at risk by wearing their uniforms to and from work. That is wrong, and it is undoubtedly a direct contribution to MRSA in hospitals.
</p>





<p><a name="st_345"><a name="60214-29_spnew4"><b> Sandra Gidley  (Romsey) (LD):</b> 
 I am listening to the hon. Lady with interest. She will surely accept that many staff do not wear uniform, including doctors and, most particularly, consultants. How would she address that situation given that they probably go from one patient to another much more frequently than nurses?
</p>





<p><a name="st_346"><a name="60214-29_spnew5"><b> Mrs. Dorries: </b> 
 Hospital consultants and doctors wear white coats and tend to put them on when they go into hospital. Having worked as a nurse in the NHS for 10 years, I know that most doctors certainly did so to protect themselves from patients&#151;consultants perhaps 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>14 Feb 2006 : Column 1362</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>not so much, but they were a law unto themselves at the time. That does not mean that they should be excused from this. The practice of cleanliness in hospitals needs to be upgraded at every level to include nurses, doctors, consultants, hospital staff and everybody who has contact with the patient. Doctors usually wear white coats, and if they do not that is unforgivable.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60214-29_para11">
<a name="stpa_244">The practice of nurses wearing their uniforms to work and back and in the home environment indubitably contributes to MRSA, which costs the NHS about &#163;1 billion a year. I received a copy of the draft code of practice this morning. One 10-word sentence on page 6 relates to staff uniforms. It says that they should be clean and fit for the intended purpose. We know full well that bacteria cannot be seen by the naked eye and that we cannot see a virus. If we could, there would be no MRSA in hospitals. We would not have search and destroy policies&#151;they would be seek and destroy policies because we would be able to see them. As we cannot, how do we know whether a nurse&#039;s uniform is clean? How can a ward manager know whether a uniform is clean? How do we know that the uniform that a doctor or nurse comes into hospital wearing was not the uniform that they wore to collect a child from school? How do we know whether that child has washed their hands all day? How do we know that they have not been sick or in contact with another child who has viruses or bacteria? How do we know that the nurse did not collect the child and get into a car that had been used by the family pets? Did the nurse then walk on to the ward in that uniform after collecting that child from school and driving in that car to a patient who is critically ill and in a vulnerable, immune-suppressed state?
</p>

<p>
<a name="60214-29_para12">
<a name="stpa_245">As we know, 25 per cent. of hospital infections are brought from communities into hospitals, and there is no doubt that a large proportion of that percentage is brought in by staff who use their work uniforms to go home. If there was an overall stipulation that staff who had direct contact with patients did not travel to and from work in their uniforms, I am sure that the figure of 25 per cent. would reduce dramatically. Prohibiting staff from travelling to and from work in uniform would be simple to introduce. It would have no cost implications for the Government and I am sure that it would save lives.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60214-29_para13">
<a name="stpa_246">Amendment No. 37 proposes that washing instructions should be made available to staff with regard to the safe home laundering of uniforms. That is based on my own research. I asked a number of staff who work in hospitals how they launder their uniforms. Replies varied from, &quot;I bung it on a wool wash because it&#039;s navy and it runs&quot;, to, &quot;I bung it on a wool wash because it&#039;s white and falls to bits on a hot wash&quot;, to, &quot;I&#039;m a member of the Green party and I do all my washing on a cold wash.&quot; According to the guidelines for washing uniforms, none of those is correct. A cold wash is nowhere near sufficient to kill bacteria or viruses on uniforms. Would it not be easy and cost-effective, and would it not save lives, if notices in utility rooms and staff cloakrooms stated the correct washing instructions for nurses&#039; uniforms?

<a name="60214-29_para14">
<a name="stpa_247">The draft code of practice for the prevention and control of hospital-acquired infections is 28 pages long, and it is an improvement on the original version. Florence Nightingale had no such document when she

</p>

<p>
<a name="60214-29_para15">
<a name="stpa_248">If we had a policy of search and destroy and effective cleaning solutions that worked when they were used on wards, if we brought back state enrolled nurses and allowed no uniforms to be worn on the way to work, and if uniforms were laundered safely at home with proper instructions, I am sure that that would make a huge difference to MRSA rates. However, that is up to the Government and the Minister.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60214-29_para16">
<a name="stpa_249">I end on a note of caution. Yesterday, I met a lady who, unlike everyone else, will not accept the out-of-court settlement that she has been offered for contracting MRSA. She is taking the matter to the High Court. She realises that the cash settlement she gets will be less than that which the hospital trust has offered, but she wants to set a precedent so that others can litigate when they contract MRSA. I hope that the Minister will not let the problem reach the point when people are rushing to the courts.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60214-29_para17">
<a name="stpa_250">We can do better than a 10-word sentence about staff uniforms. From speaking to nurses, those who have contracted MRSA and people in the community, I know that they do not want nurses to go home in their uniforms. Nurses do not want to wear their uniforms to and from work and they readily say, &quot;If we were told not to, we wouldn&#039;t.&quot; They said that changing rooms were not absolutely necessary. One nurse told me, &quot;I&#039;d go to the cloakroom where I hang my coat and leave my bag.&quot; There is no reason for not imposing such a provision. I hope that the Minister will reconsider the draft code and what happens to nurses, their uniforms and the cleaning of those uniforms at home.

<a name="stpa_251">Four or five years ago, we conducted a major survey in my constituency on health care services in Bristol.

As my hon.

I do not want to include such requirements in a code dealing with infection prevention and control. I think that infection prevention and control should be everyone&#039;s business; it should not be left to a cohort of infection control nurses. Setting a ratio of specialist infection control staff to beds, rather than challenging the culture in the organisation, will encourage people to see the job as one to be performed by those people alone. Appropriate management and clinical governance systems are required, and that will be dealt with by the code of practice.

The draft code already requires NHS bodies to ensure that they have adequate isolation facilities to prevent the spread of infection. &quot;Adequate&quot; should not be interpreted as a dismissive term. It means what it says: it means enough to deal with the circumstances that might arise. The draft code also requires NHS bodies to have a cleaning plan giving details of the standards of cleanliness needed in each part of their premises. While I accept the strength of the arguments advanced in Committee and today, I feel that the code strikes the right balance, although we will keep it under constant review.

 &quot;Clean&quot; is a matter of perception. We can say, &quot;You look clean&quot;, but we cannot see viruses and bacteria, as I said earlier. How can a ward manager know whether a uniform is clean and fit for purpose if they do not know what bacteria or viruses are living on it? If it has been worn at home, it could have been worn while the member of staff picked up their child from school or went shopping in the supermarket.

 Many years ago&#151;I do not want to say how many&#151;plastic aprons and gloves were commonplace throughout wards. Before a nurse went to any patient, she would take off her existing apron and put on a new one; indeed, that is what I did. Aseptic technique was drilled into us as nurses. Everything that we did involved aseptic technique, particularly when dealing with patients who were vulnerable and at risk. That same mental attitude toward asepsis and changing gowns and gloves is no longer present in wards; it simply does not happen any more. In the past, the provision of such gowns was prescribed. Would it not be appropriate, therefore, for the code to make reference to the provision of freely available gowns, so that what happened in the 1970s and 1980s&#151;the constant changing of gowns and gloves&#151;happens again?

We will have time to take such concerns on board as the Bill progresses&#151;I hope&#151;through the other place.

 These amendments seek to amend clause 32, which deals with application for provision of pharmaceutical services. It may be worth spending a little time on the context of these amendments. As the House knows, following the Office of Fair Trading consultation a couple of years ago, new pharmacies are controlled by something called the control of entry regulations. Any application to open a new pharmacy has to go before the primary care trust or the Assembly in Wales and has to pass certain tests.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60214-31_para4">
<a name="stpa_279">It is also worth remembering that pharmacies are private contractors which have a contract with the national health service. Historically, that has been to deliver dispensing services, but that has recently changed with the introduction of the new pharmacy contract. That seeks to extend the role of pharmacists, which is widely regarded as a good thing.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60214-31_para5">
<a name="stpa_280">Instead of just relying on dispensing, the contract is divided into levels of service. The standard services are those that all pharmacies should supply, and include services such as dispensing and health promotion. Advanced services are developing gradually and the first, which has been successful so far, is the medicines use review&#151;or MUR&#151;which has benefited many patients. So far, so good. The potential exists for enhanced services, such as smoking cessation&#151;I had to mention that tonight&#151;and monitoring the progress of disease or providing services to care homes. Commissioning of such enhanced services has been very patchy. Some primary care trusts have been very good and tried to embrace new services, but others have ignored the opportunity completely. Some of the evidence shows that the future of the enhanced services next year looks shaky, to say the least. However, that is probably a debate for another day.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60214-31_para6">
<a name="stpa_281">Clause 32 applies only when a primary care trust has two applications before it to provide pharmaceutical services in a similar locality. Each pharmacy must pass the existing test as to whether it is necessary or desirable.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60214-31_para7">
<a name="stpa_282">As drafted, clause 32 would mean that an NHS contract could be awarded according to promises made in relation to the commercial part of the business. That is wrong and unenforceable, and various problems arise. I admit that the Government have consulted on the proposal, but most respondents rejected it. All the contractors who were consulted did so, regardless of whether they represented single, independent contractors or large multiples.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60214-31_para8">
<a name="stpa_283">The contractors&#039; objections revolved around a few simple propositions. They said that no request for a certain level of medicine pricing could be enforced, as no 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>14 Feb 2006 : Column 1372</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>price could be guaranteed in the long term. Contractors could promise the earth, but how could that be monitored by the PCT on a regular basis? What would happen if circumstances changed? For example, a certain price for over-the-counter medicines might be allowed, but the company or pharmacist involved could renege on the deal.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60214-31_para9">
<a name="stpa_284">The best analogy that I can come up with is with the contracts awarded to NHS dentists. Such dentists spend two or three years building up their patient lists, but then decide that they do not want to provide dentistry on the NHS. In those circumstances, the PCT has no control over what happens, and it is the question of control that is important here.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60214-31_para10">
<a name="stpa_285">Also, it is difficult to see how a PCT can balance different offers in different applications. For example, one pharmacy might offer a certain price for over-the-counter medicines, while another offers an enhanced delivery service. How can the first offer be compared with the second? Who decides what is best for patients? During the consultation, the concern was raised that the proposal could lead to more application refusals being contested, and therefore to a possible increase in the number of judicial reviews.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60214-31_para11">
<a name="stpa_286">What happens if a pharmacy is sold, quite legitimately, to an independent contractor or a different group? The buyer might have different marketing or pricing policies, or want to offer a different range of services. How will that be dealt with?
</p>

<p>
<a name="60214-31_para12">
<a name="stpa_287">It has been argued that the proposal will help disadvantaged communities, as they would have access to cut-price medicines. I have worked in such communities, and my experience is that that is not really a consideration. People who live in such areas know that they can get free prescriptions from their GPs, and are happy to do so. As a result, that argument is something of a red herring.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60214-31_para13">
<a name="stpa_288">Very often, businesses in disadvantaged communities are run by independent contractors. At first, they might not be able to offer big attractions in respect of cut-price medicines, but their commitment to the community can mean that they choose to plough some of the profits back into developing future services. Traditionally, that is what has happened in pharmacy, but the clause could put a stop to pharmacists&#039; very realistic desire to do the best that they can within the constraints of their budgets.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60214-31_para14">
<a name="stpa_289">In short, the clause is unworkable as it stands, being difficult both to monitor and sustain. If the Minister is committed to proceeding with it, I hope that she will at least review the new system after it has been in place for a year or 18 months. In that way, she will be able to see whether any of the problems that I have highlighted are based in reality rather than in fear.

<a name="stpa_292">I do not share the hon. Lady&#039;s pessimism&#151;or I would not be proposing the measure.

<p><a name="st_384"><a name="60214-32_spnew1"><b> Sandra Gidley: </b> 
 I understand the possible drivers for persuading applicants to offer extra services, which must be a good thing for patients. However, it is difficult to balance the offer of a low price on medicines against those other services. The consideration should not be purely financial. Although the provision of other services is worthy and could benefit the local health economy, merely to consider the price of medicines seems a step too far.

 I hear what the hon.

That is important and would be welcomed by everybody, but I do not accept the concerns expressed by the hon. Lady, so I hope that the amendment is a probing one.

<p><a name="st_392"><a name="60214-32_spnew5"><b> Dr. Murrison: </b> 
 I will not press the amendment to a vote but very much hope that we will find ourselves in violent agreement with the Government, who have consistently made it clear in Committee and during today&#039;s proceedings that they favour the affirmative procedure in respect of regulations, which flow like the Tiber through the Bill. Amendments Nos. 33 and 34 would simply ensure that the affirmative procedure would be applied to clause 5, which clearly deals with vehicles, and clause 2, in respect of which we are particularly concerned about the definitions of what is enclosed, substantially enclosed, not enclosed and so on. The Minister must agree that that it is important, given the uncertainly that surrounds such things, that the regulations that the Secretary of State may wish to enforce are subject to the affirmative procedure.
</p>





<p><a name="st_393"><a name="60214-32_spnew6"><b> Caroline Flint: </b> 
 As the hon. Gentleman suggests, under amendments Nos. 33 and 34, regulations made under clauses 2 and 5 would be subject to the affirmative procedure. Clause 2 makes provision for premises open to the public and those used for work to be smoke-free. It applies only to premises that are enclosed or substantially enclosed and enables regulations to be made to define the meaning of the words &quot;enclosed&quot; and &quot;substantially enclosed&quot;. Meanwhile, clause 5 enables regulations to be made to provide for vehicles to be smoke-free.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60214-32_para6">
<a name="stpa_296">Those matters have been left to regulations to enable consultation with stakeholders and to allow flexibility to amend requirements if need be, based on practical post-implementation experience without the need to amend primary legislation. Given the possibly technical nature of the regulations that would be made under clauses 2 and 5, we have undertaken to conduct a public consultation exercise with respect to any draft regulation prepared.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60214-32_para7">
<a name="stpa_297">The negative procedure was selected for the exercise of those powers, as we felt that Parliament would have no good reason in particular to consider such highly technical matters in such detail that it would warrant taking the affirmative route. However, we discussed such issues in Committee, and I said that I would 

<br>&nbsp;<br>

<br>&nbsp;<br>consider them. The hon. Gentleman has again expressed his wish for the affirmative procedure to be used, and I will listen to the views of the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee of the other place when it comes to scrutinise the Bill. On that basis, I cannot support the amendment but remain of an open mind and open to persuasion.
</p>





<p><a name="st_394"><a name="60214-32_spnew7"><b> Dr. Murrison: </b> 
 I am grateful to the Minister for clearly pointing out that these matters will be considered in another place.

 I beg to move, That the Bill be now read the Third time.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60214-33_para0">
<a name="stpa_298">I am proud to move the Bill&#039;s Third Reading. I particularly want to thank the Minister of State, Department of Health, my right hon. Friend the Member for Liverpool, Wavertree (Jane Kennedy) and the Under-Secretary of State for Health, my hon. Friend the Member for Don Valley (Caroline Flint) who have done a superb job in piloting the Bill through Committee and much of the Report stage that we have just had. <i>[Interruption.]</i> Despite some of the sedentary comments by Opposition Members, I also pay tribute to Members on both sides who have adopted a positive and constructive attitude to the elements of a Bill that not only protects public health inside and outside hospital but that will further improve the performance and efficiency of the national health service.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60214-33_para1">
<a name="stpa_299">Of course, the main focus of our debate and of public attention has been on the Bill&#039;s smoking provisions. This evening, the House voted absolutely decisively to introduce a complete ban on smoking in all enclosed 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>14 Feb 2006 : Column 1376</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>public places and workplaces, including all licensed premises and private members&#039; clubs. We have therefore not only delivered on the manifesto promise to ban smoking in virtually all public places and workplaces on which we were elected 10 months ago but have gone additional steps further. That reflects the excellent debate that took place on the smoking provisions in which I and my hon. Friends, who genuinely believed, and always have, that the arguments about private members&#039; clubs were finely balanced, have none the less voted for a complete ban, particularly in the interests of ensuring a level playing field between different businesses such as small pubs and members&#039; clubs. I recognise that there will be some disappointment among at least some members of private clubs at the outcome of the vote, but I nevertheless believe that it was the right one.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60214-33_para2">
<a name="stpa_300">The comprehensive ban for which the House has decisively voted will mean, over time, that some 600,000 people, beyond those who would have otherwise given up smoking, will be led to abandon it. The result of that and the protection that we are giving to people from second-hand smoking will be thousands of people&#039;s lives being saved and thousands of families being spared the grief of losing a loved one prematurely. That is why I think today&#039;s vote and the Bill will be seen as historic legislation on public health equivalent to, for instance, the legislation on seat belts of some decades ago.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60214-33_para3">
<a name="stpa_301">I am also delighted that, although it was not debated this afternoon, we have also taken power to raise the age for the purchase of tobacco from 16 to 18 following the consultation in which we engaged. I pay tribute to my hon. Friend the Member for Barnsley, East and Mexborough (Jeff Ennis), who has campaigned vigorously and effectively on that issue.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60214-33_para4">
<a name="stpa_302">Other vital provisions include the statutory code of practice on MRSA and associated health care infections. It will be very widely welcomed not only by the public, who quite rightly expect every hospital to get down their MRSA and other infection rates, but by staff in both the NHS and the independent sector.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60214-33_para5">
<a name="stpa_303">The Bill will also provide for much stronger management of controlled drugs in response to some of the shortcomings identified in the Shipman inquiry and will improve safeguards against the very small minority of people who would divert those drugs for personal abuse, financial gain or even, regrettably, for criminal purposes. It will also help us to continue improving and modernising NHS pharmacy services, ensuring, as my right hon. Friend the Minister of State said, that we can continue expanding the services offered by our pharmacists and make them much more convenient to patients.

<a name="60214-33_para6">
<a name="stpa_304">I was pleased to read the discussion in Committee during which the provision of ophthalmic services in England was praised. Although there was concern that the Bill would tamper with a service that is already excellent, I hope that hon.

The new framework for ophthalmic

<br>&nbsp;<br>services will ensure that we will be able to provide enhanced services in the community of the kind that are often available at present only in hospitals. That will be in line with the direction that we have just spelled out in the White Paper.
</p>





<p><a name="st_405"><a name="60214-33_spnew1"><b> Mr. Lansley: </b> 
 We did not have the opportunity to discuss general ophthalmic services on Report. Does the Secretary of State agree with the sentiments of amendment No. 17 that when primary care trusts use their powers to contract general ophthalmic services, they should maximise the choice available to patients? We want to ensure that PCTs will be able to continue to exercise choice on accessing services, so it would helpful if the Secretary of State said whether that is firmly her intention.
</p>





<p><a name="st_406"><a name="60214-33_spnew2"><b> Ms Hewitt: </b> 
 I am happy to reassure the House that we want more choice for patients in ophthalmic and other medical services. We want the best possible services to be available in every community, with, of course, the best value for money.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60214-33_para7">
<a name="stpa_305">The Bill has important provisions that give new powers to the counter-fraud service, which already does excellent work to ensure that taxpayers&#039; money is used for the purpose for which hon. Members vote&#151;better patient care. The Bill also responds to the Public Administration Committee&#039;s report on government by appointment and reconfirms our commitment to an independent appointments process.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60214-33_para8">
<a name="stpa_306">The Bill is a major and historic step forward for public health. It will help us to continue to improve the national health service and will give patients and the public better, faster, more convenient and safer health care. The Bill was good, but it has been made even better by today&#039;s votes. I commend it to the House.

 I am sorry that the right hon. Member for Rother Valley (Mr. Barron) is not in the Chamber. If congratulations are being offered on the outcome of the Bill&#039;s principal measures on smoking, we must accept that they probably owe much to his work and leadership of the Health Committee.

However, she and the Prime Minister have voted completely contrary to the exemptions that Ministers presented to the House three months ago. She may congratulate herself and her colleagues on their stewardship of the Bill, but the truth of the matter is that the House was taken in precisely the wrong direction on Second Reading. Additionally, a substantial amount of time was expended on the matter in Committee, although we all knew at that point that Ministers were on an impossible wicket.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60214-33_para12">
<a name="stpa_310">On Second Reading, the Conservatives pressed for a free vote, and it was quite obvious that it would have been better for the Government to abandon the distinction between pubs that serve food and those that do not. There are often mutual congratulations on Third Reading, and I shall offer mine in a minute, but I must tell the Secretary of State and the Under-Secretary of State for Health&#151;the so-called public health Minister&#151;that the Bill was not well handled. It was one of the most astonishingly badly handled Bills in recent years. It should not have been introduced in the form in which it was introduced, it should not have been pursued in that way, and even if it has produced a solution with which Parliament is happy, that was not by virtue of ministerial design. Ministers should therefore not accept congratulations. <i>[Interruption.]</i> If the Secretary of State is saying that my colleagues voted for a more comprehensive ban, I do not have a difficulty with that. She should perhaps remember that we made it clear on Second Reading that there would be a free vote on the express basis that Opposition Members had distinct views on the judgment that should be made. A free vote was not offered to Government Members. The Government should accept that there was a crass error on their part, for which they should apologise.

 As a Conservative candidate, I stood on a manifesto commitment that we would not introduce legislation on this issue. Labour Members, however, stood on a commitment to introduce such legislation. They have broken their word, because they have extended the legislative effect of their proposals. I am proud to have stood by my manifesto to defend individual liberty in this country.
</p>





<p><a name="st_409"><a name="60214-34_spnew1"><b> Mr. Lansley: </b> 
 Our manifesto made it perfectly clear that people must take responsibility for their own health. We made it clear before the election that we would pursue a more vigorous self-regulatory solution. However, if that did not deliver the substantial protection that we sought within three years, so that non-smokers were not exposed to smoke, children not exposed to second-hand smoke and staff protected, we would take legislative powers.

However, even though I have no doubt that another place will respect the decision of the House on a free vote, and with a significant majority at that, it should consider issues relating to smoking including definitions, what additional places will be specified under the legislation, under what circumstances private vehicles might be specified, and whether vehicles used for work are to be included in the smoke-free provisions. Those are important matters, and some valuable work will no doubt be done in another place.

<b>14 Feb 2006 : Column 1380</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>hon. Friend the Member for Westbury (Dr. Murrison), we suggested in Committee that it might be better for the regulations to be made by affirmative procedure in the first instance, rather than by affirmative procedure in every case. Subsequent technical amendments to the regulations could be made by negative procedure, but the initial regulations, which will contain substance as well as technicalities, might well be made on an affirmative basis.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60214-34_para3">
<a name="stpa_314">We discussed infection control previously and had the opportunity to raise some of the issues on Report and in discussions with the Minister in Committee and elsewhere. The issues are important and intractable. As the Minister will acknowledge, the latest six-monthly MRSA statistics do not show the progress that she and we might have wished. That demonstrates the difficulty of making progress and the necessity for the measures described in the code to be implemented effectively. Isolation facilities must not only be appropriate but must follow a risk assessment. We need to work on the design of hospitals and ensure that the necessary facilities are built in from the outset.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60214-34_para4">
<a name="stpa_315">Clinical data, which the Minister agreed should be collected by a clinical department, should be used as a performance management tool in hospitals to deliver improved infection control, should be a basis on which health care providers are held to account, and should be used by them better to inform public debate about infection control. One of the central issues that we constantly try to highlight is the distinction between prevalence and incidence. Not all incidents of infection in hospitals are by any means the consequence of infection being contracted in hospital. Distinguishing between the two can make an enormous difference to public understanding. I hope that another place will take a substantial interest in those matters and in model cleaning contracts, nursing uniforms and standards. Committees in another place have done significant work on those aspects in the past, and I hope they will follow it up.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60214-34_para5">
<a name="stpa_316">We hope that the pharmacy contract will increasingly be implemented innovatively. Only a few weeks ago, we discussed the White Paper and the desire for greater opportunities for people to be screened for disease and to initiate for themselves more checks on their health status. It is perfectly clear that pharmacies can do a great deal in that direction, and the pharmacy contract always allows that. The issue is whether primary care trusts are contracting for such an approach. One aspect that needs to be followed up is not merely legislating or contracting for such possibilities, but ensuring that the structure of commissioning inside primary care trusts with regard to pharmacies allows for them.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60214-34_para6">
<a name="stpa_317">One issue that we have not had a further opportunity to discuss is the span of control of a pharmacist, and I hope that those in another place will pursue it. The professional confidence that we place in pharmacists is important, and the profession itself attaches considerable importance to that. Many pharmacists do not want to move beyond the rule of one pharmacy, one pharmacist, or if they do, it is only in very exceptional circumstances and it must be delineated. I do not think that we have yet arrived at a point at which it is delineated in the Bill, and I hope that that will be pursued further.

<a name="stpa_318">On general ophthalmic services, the Secretary of State made it clear that PCTs should pursue the maximum choice consistent with value for money for the Exchequer. That must be true. Many people are wondering precisely what the motivation is for the legislation and what is going wrong in general ophthalmic services that demands such a change. Currently, optometrists and registered opticians can offer services, and patients can use them; they have maximum choice, and there does not seem to be a difficulty with that. If we are to move to a new design, let us ensure that those things continue. Let us ensure that the central funding is clearly set out, either in the legislation or in ministerial commitments for the future, so that the free sight test is available and cannot be compromised by budgetary pressures on individual primary care trusts; that the scope of the sight test can be adapted in line with best clinical practice as we move forward; that optometrists and opticians are able and encouraged to provide sight tests and related tests that not only focus on the basic question of visual field, but go beyond to trying to detect disease to the maximum extent; and that the free sight test itself is not infringed in years to come.

Members: &quot;Yes.&quot;] I know that they object to what the House has decided, but frankly, it was always our view that the matter was best dealt with on a free vote. Since we have at last come to that and the House has taken a decision on a free vote, for my part, whether or not I agree precisely with the outcome, I think that that is a fair basis for the House to reach its conclusion. I am content for the legislation as a whole to go to another place in its current form, and I hope that it will be further improved there.

Indeed, the BBC and Sky conducted two polls immediately before Christmas showing support of about 85 or 90 per cent. for raising the age of sale. I have always regarded the measure as common sense. Before 1997, exactly the same proportion of young people smoked in Guernsey as in the UK, but following the implementation of the measure, the rate in Guernsey fell to 50 per cent. of that in the UK. The measure has been

<br>&nbsp;<br>adopted in many European countries as well as in Scotland and Ireland. It has the support of the Trading Standards Institute, which is the enforcement agency that carries out age-of-sale test purchases.

 The whole House will congratulate the hon. Member for Barnsley, East and Mexborough (Jeff Ennis) on pursuing an issue and seeing it through to the point where the public and the industry will be consulted and then the House can form a view through affirmative resolution. When we debated the programme motion, I said that it was an important issue that warranted a debate. As I predicted, we did not get it. Very few people in the House&#151;the hon. Member for Barnsley, East and Mexborough was one of them&#151;knew what was happening when the Speaker called for new clause 6 to be added to the Bill. Such an important issue should have got an airing so that we could think it through further. At least the House has a chance to come back to it once a consideration has been made.

It goes further. Of the three Front-Bench speeches that opened our debate, only one&#151;modesty forbids my saying which&#151;unequivocally argued for a total ban, which is what the House overwhelmingly concluded, no doubt persuaded by the oratory. To sway the House, on a free vote, to a majority of more than 200 is one of my early parliamentary highlights but no doubt not the last.

She was obviously committed throughout to a full ban, and it was poetic that she tabled the amendment that brought it in. That seems only right and proper.

<a name="stpa_330">I agree with the hon. Member for South Cambridgeshire that the Bill has not been well handled by the Government. In a sense, the Under-Secretary inherited a compromise. It is good that, through the evolution of the provisions, we have ended up with a clearer position. I was just discussing signage with my hon. Friend the Member for Bristol, West (Stephen Williams). Presumably we no longer need to put up signs saying that people cannot smoke in these places because it is now the law of the land that one cannot smoke in an enclosed public place, wherever it is. That is one example of how much cleaner, simpler and more effective is the total ban that the Bill now contains. I thank my hon.

 I, too, participated in the Second Reading debate and served on the Standing Committee. It is right to praise the Ministers who steered the Bill through proceedings in this House and the Members who served on the Committee. Ministers listened to concerns expressed on Second Reading and acted in Committee. An example is the changes made on ophthalmic services. Ministers listened to cogent arguments put forward by my hon.

They exposed the weaknesses of that distinction and forced hon. Members to make a starker choice between the status quo and a complete ban. A pretty convincing opinion has been expressed in the House on a free vote.

However, as a postscript, I want to mention my disappointment about the process in this place. Through a spark of ingenuity, I persuaded House officials to accept that amendments about breast feeding came within the Bill&#039;s remit. By a stroke of good fortune, the Committee Chairman selected them for debate. Alas, I was struck down by the timetable that was imposed on our deliberations in Committee. My new clauses on breast feeding probably constituted the one issue of substance that was never considered in Committee. The Speaker did not select them for debate today. They will not be considered in the context of the Bill in the House of Commons, but I believe that they raised important issues of public health and discrimination, which must be left for another day.

<a name="stpa_335">I do not know whether the same spark of ingenuity can strike twice and enable me to find another way to raise those important matters in the near future, but I look forward to the guidance on breast feeding from the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence later this year because we have a poor record in this country&#151;

 In a moment.

<a name="60214-36_para3">
<a name="stpa_339">There are of course colleagues who, if pressed, would probably favour banning smoking per se altogether. I think that they would be wrong. There are certainly colleagues who believe that the law should not have been changed at all. They are entitled to that view, but I think that they, too, are wrong. The bulk of the argument today focused on variations on a theme of two main options, each of which was honourable, and between which we had to decide. The options were a partial ban, of one form or another, or a total ban.

<p>
<a name="60214-36_para4">
<a name="stpa_340">My view is that the Bill has been improved this afternoon because a partial ban would have been undesirable. A partial ban based on a distinction between pubs that serve food and those that do not struck me as risible. It would certainly have been inequitable as between one employee and another, and it would unquestionably have been unfair to children. It would also have been a source of legal challenge, and it would demonstrably have been conducive to unfair competition between different outlets. That does not mean that it was a dishonourable proposal, but it would have had all sorts of hazardous consequences. Most Members, irrespective of party allegiance, believe that we have a duty to legislate in terms that are simple to understand, readily accepted as fair, and capable of straightforward enforcement, and I do not think that that proposal would have satisfied those criteria.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60214-36_para5">
<a name="stpa_341">The alternative approach was to introduce a partial ban of the type that characterised much of this afternoon&#039;s debate, namely, a ban on smoking in pubs, clubs and restaurants, with the exception of private membership clubs. I could not for the life of me see a justification for the creation of that special, untouchable category of private membership club.

<p><a name="st_428"><a name="60214-36_spnew5"><b> John Bercow: </b> 
 The House has made the right decision, and I am delighted to have got my point on the record, Madam Deputy Speaker. I know how keen you are that I should focus on the contents of the Bill.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60214-36_para6">
<a name="stpa_342">I believe that the Bill&#039;s smoke-free provisions are manifestly in the interests of public health. We do not have to look into the crystal ball when we can read the book. If we look at the evidence of what has happened in Ireland, we can see an improvement. We can observe what has taken place in New York, and recognise that it has resulted in a betterment of public health. It would have been curious if we had not done what we did this afternoon. After all, Scotland is to enjoy smoke-free legislation, as is Wales, and the Government certainly intend that Northern Ireland should do so. It is very much in the public interest that England should do so as well.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60214-36_para7">
<a name="stpa_343">This provision is good news for smokers and non-smokers alike. I believe that those who suggested that a ban would be bad news for smokers and their families are wrong. The overwhelming likelihood is that significant numbers of smokers will be encouraged, as a result of the passage of the Bill, to give up their habit. The notion that they would simply smoke in private houses in front of their children on any significant scale seems profoundly misconceived. Parents care about their children, and I do not believe that they would do that.

<p><a name="st_456"><i>Motion made, and Question proposed,</i> That this House do now adjourn.&#151;<i>[Mr. Cawsey.]</i></p>



<a name="time_30">
<a name="60214-38_time1"><h5>10.2 pm</h5>


<p><a name="st_457"><a name="60214-38_spnew2"><b> Judy Mallaber  (Amber Valley) (Lab):</b> 
 I dedicate this debate on the commercial Canadian seal hunt to the memory of Tony Banks, an extraordinary campaigner for animal welfare. Today, I received a letter supporting us in the debate from Sally Banks, who has taken up the baton. She says:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_44">&quot;Tony&#039;s passionate opposition to this barbarous hunt is the reason that I have pledged to continue his work.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="60214-38_para3">
<a name="stpa_357">Sally says that the issue was close to Tony&#039;s heart, so perhaps it is appropriate that on Valentine&#039;s day we are holding a debate on the massacre of seal pups for their fur&#151;appropriate as long as we win the argument and achieve the ban that we all want.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60214-38_para4">
<a name="stpa_358">Last year, the Humane Society of the United States witnessed and filmed the killing of harp seals to the north of Prince Edward island. This morning, I watched the film again; it does not make for easy viewing. It starts with a seemingly endless shot of a seal pup gurgling slowly to death in its own blood. I challenge anyone to watch that film and not be sickened, and not to want to do all that we can to stop such barbaric slaughter. The main contribution that we can make in this country is to block the trade in seal products that fuels that slaughter. I shall discuss the legal case for such a ban, but first I shall set out the arguments for a ban and, secondly, the Government&#039;s opposition to the seal hunt, which has already been expressed in a previous Adjournment debate in 2003.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60214-38_para5">
<a name="stpa_359">The callous routine brutality used by those who kill the seals must be seen to be believed. In that film, the sealers can be seen running from seal to seal, hitting as many as they can, as quickly as they can. They do not even stop to see whether the seals that they have hit are dead. Those in the film show as much regard for the rules as they do for the seals.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60214-38_para6">
<a name="stpa_360">The Canadian Government&#151;I have a letter to this effect&#151;claim that the hunt is humanely conducted, but I have detailed quotes from two experts who viewed the film footage. Dr. Donald Broom, professor of animal welfare at Cambridge university, notes that many of the seals were still conscious after being clubbed. The chief veterinary officer of the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, Dr. Steve Cheetham, was appalled and talks of pain and suffering and the incompetence of the sealers, but that is clear to anyone who looks at the film, the end shot of which shows a seal struggling, exhausted, in a pool of blood and icy water.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60214-38_para7">
<a name="stpa_361">The conduct of the hunt is partly due to the way that the Canadian Government design the quota system. An overall limit is set, so the sealers race around to kill as many seals as they can individually and by boat until the total is met. The hunt is inherently cruel. Many people, probably most people, do not even realise that the hunt still happens each year. They think that it ended back in the 1980s, but in fact, twice as many seals are killed today as back then and it is the largest, most brutal slaughter of marine mammals anywhere on the planet.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60214-38_para8">
<a name="stpa_362">In 1983, a long time back, the European Economic Community banned the import of furs and products made from whitecoat seals&#151;new-born harp seals until 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>14 Feb 2006 : Column 1394</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>they begin to moult when they are just 10 days old&#151;and bluebacks, which are young hooded seals. The sealers now cynically wait a few days until the harp seals are approximately four weeks old&#151;still pups, unable to swim and have never eaten a solid meal. In the United States, it is illegal to trade in marine mammal products and there is no Canadian market, but those clubbed seal pups have moulted, so their skins are legally imported into the European Union and the United Kingdom. The crux of tonight&#039;s argument is to stop that trade.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60214-38_para9">
<a name="stpa_363">The last time that the Canadian seal hunt was debated in the House was on 4 November 2003, when the then Minister for Trade and Investment&#151;now the Solicitor-General&#151;stated that the Government
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_45">&quot;do not accept the need for any seal cull.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="60214-38_para10">
<a name="stpa_364">He continued,
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_46">&quot;we do not accept that clubbing is acceptable.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="60214-38_para11">
<a name="stpa_365">He said that it
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_47">&quot;does Canada&#039;s reputation a great deal of damage.&quot;&#151;[<i>Official Report,</i> 4 November 2003; Vol. 412, c. 219&#150;21WH.]</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="60214-38_para12">
<a name="stpa_366">He also said that the Canadian Government had been asked to consider a total ban on the commercial seal hunt. Since that debate, more than 600,000 seal pups have been clubbed to death or shot on the ice floes of eastern Canada during two more years of the commercial hunt. I will not quote the horrific description of a seal being skinned alive while still conscious, given by the hon. Member for Southend, West (Mr. Amess) in that debate a couple of years ago. Many seals escape from being shot to die in agony from their injuries.

<a name="60214-38_para13">
<a name="stpa_367">It is abundantly clear that the Canadian Government continue to ignore our Government&#039;s overtures, as well as public opinion, including that of the majority of their own citizens who want an end to the hunt, according to a survey commissioned by the International Fund for Animal Welfare in Canada in 2005. The Canadian Government also ignore evidence on conservation and biodiversity issues. I have here a review by Professor Stephen Harris, who shows that the Canadian modelling of the seal population and quotas is unsafe and that there is a serious threat to the survival of the seal population.

<a name="60214-38_para14">
<a name="stpa_368">To get to the heart of the matter, what should our Government do? What are we asking? What action do we want? Part of the problem with the United Kingdom&#039;s position is that by continuing to allow the import of seal products that come from the hunt, the Government are sending out a mixed message to Canada. On one hand, they say that they disapprove of the hunt, while on the other, they are saying that it is okay to trade in the products. It is not, and until we ban the import and trade in all the hunt&#039;s products, we too have the seals&#039; blood on our hands.

</p>

<p>
<a name="60214-39_para8">
<a name="stpa_377">The ethical argument for banning the seal hunt is made comprehensively and with great authority by Rev. Professor Andrew Linzey in the pamphlet &quot;Public Morality and the Canadian Seal Hunt&quot;. He talks about how the activity is devoid of moral justification and his detailed conclusions have been endorsed by more than 70 leading academics, theologians and philosophers from 14 countries. The other aspects of the legal opinion by Philippe Sands are detailed and comprehensively argue why, under several strands of the WTO rules, it would be completely possible for us to go ahead with the ban.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60214-39_para9">
<a name="stpa_378">The matter is more critical than ever this year because the melting of the ice will present a real threat to seals&#039; whelping areas in Canada. Will the Minister call on the Canadian Government to respond to the situation by banning the hunt this year as a matter of emergency? I urge him to accept the legal arguments to which I have referred and ban the appalling trade.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60214-39_para10">
<a name="stpa_379">The Canadians will say that they are arguing for their sealing community. Sealers are fishermen who make a small sum by killing seals for just a few days a year. The activity is dangerous, dehumanising and provides them with less than 5 per cent. of their annual income. Some 1,200 sealers have died during the history of the seal hunt and two died as recently as 2002. The Canadian Government already have measures in place on fishing diversity and compensation for fishermen that could be applied to the sealing industry, so their argument does not hold water.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60214-39_para11">
<a name="stpa_380">The ban in other countries has not been challenged, so I do not think that a ban that we enforced would necessarily be challenged. I know that the Minister will be given endless arguments by civil servants and lawyers about why it would be legally impossible to enforce a ban, but we have strong legal advice that suggests that it would be possible. We will have to bite the bullet, go ahead with a ban and challenge the Canadians on the matter. They have not taken it up with other countries, so there is no real reason to expect them to do that with us. We should thus go ahead with a ban.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60214-39_para12">
<a name="stpa_381">Two early-day motions before the House refer to the seal hunt. Early-day motion 237 has been signed by 182 Members. It notes that trade data show that thousands of seal skins were imported into the UK between 1995 and 2003 and calls on the Government to prohibit the import of all seal products into the UK.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60214-39_para13">
<a name="stpa_382">Early-day motion 1416, which was tabled more recently&#151;in only the past month, I believe&#151;already has 118 signatures. It honours the life and work of Tony Banks. At the time of Tony&#039;s death, he had started a new initiative and was working with Respect for Animals to encourage people and retail outlets to boycott Canadian seafood products. I understand that most of the trade into this country goes straight out again to other European countries, so we probably cannot create pressure as easily as we could through a consumer boycott. The Government must thus put the main pressure directly on the Canadian Government through a legal ban. They must also try to persuade other European countries to go ahead with a ban.

I met Mark Glover and Nicky Brookes from Respect for Animals, together with their colleague, Rebecca Aldworth from the Canada section of the Humane Society of the United States, on 15 June last year, and we had an informative exchange on these subjects. Officials from the Foreign Office have since had regular contact with both organisations. I am aware of the results of the opinion poll conducted on behalf of Respect for Animals on attitudes towards the seal hunt in the UK, to which my hon. Friend referred and which 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>14 Feb 2006 : Column 1399</b>

<a name="60214-40_para2">
<a name="stpa_387">The UK and Canada have common traditions and attitudes. We share close historical links and a strong relationship, which involves working together in a number of international forums. Canada is a liberal country with values similar to ours. The association between Canada and seal clubbing clearly does the reputation of Canadians no good at all. We hope that they will recognise that soon and end all commercial seal hunting. We will continue to press the Canadian Government on that issue. As hon. Members are aware, the hunt focuses on two main species&#151;the harp seal and the hooded seal. The Canadian Government argue that the commercial seal hunt quota is based on sound conservation principles to maintain a sustainable seal population. They state, too, that the hunt provides valuable income to a large number of sealers and their families in Eastern Canada. They argue that the harp seal population has almost tripled since 1970 and their most recent estimate puts the north-west Atlantic stock of harp seals at 5.9 million animals. As my hon. Friend said, the Canadian seal hunt is regulated by quotas set by the Canadian Government and based on the total allowable catch&#151;TAC in the terminology of the fishing industry&#151;which hon. Members may find inappropriate or offensive given what happens in the hunt. The TAC for 2003&#150;05 was set at 975,000 harp seals to meet the Canadian Government&#039;s plan to reduce the current population of harp seals from 5.9 million to 4.7 million by 2006.

<p><a name="st_470"><a name="60214-40_spnew1"><b> Ian Pearson: </b> 
 I am well aware of those different views, which is why I made it clear that the estimate was made by the Canadian Government, who believe that the hooded seal population is 470,000. A new population survey was conducted last year, but the results are not yet available. The 2006 TAC for hooded seals is 10,000, and the figure has been set at that level for a number of years. With respect to hooded seals, however, it is our understanding that a total of only about 500 have been taken in Canada since 1999.

<a name="60214-40_para3">
<a name="stpa_388">The methods used in hunting seals have long been mired in controversy. Canada&#039;s Royal Commission on Seals and Sealing found that those methods compared favourably to those used to kill any other wild or domestic animal. Despite that, it is alleged that 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>14 Feb 2006 : Column 1400</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>thousands of seals are killed each year inhumanely. Respect for Animals claims that in 2005, 40 per cent. of the seals were skinned while still alive.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60214-40_para4">
<a name="stpa_389">The Canadian Veterinary Medical Association claims that 98 per cent. of seals taken during the seal hunt are killed in an acceptably humane manner. Even if that figure is accurate&#151;it is the subject of much dispute&#151;this still means that a significant number of animals are not killed effectively. We fully support continued attention being paid by the veterinary profession to the conduct of the seal hunt. If seal hunts are to continue, it is vital that the Canadian Government closely regulate and monitor the hunt to ensure that no seals suffer improper treatment or are killed inhumanely.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60214-40_para5">
<a name="stpa_390">My hon. Friend the Member for Amber Valley referred to the European seals directive, which was introduced in 1983 and extended in 1989 prior to the entry into force of the World Trade Organisation agreement on 1 January 1995. As she knows, it protects harp and hooded seals from over-exploitation but requires member states only to prohibit the commercial importation of skins and other listed products of certain harp and hooded seal pups. The prohibition, rightly, does not apply to seal products resulting from traditional hunting by the Inuit people, as it recognises that that forms an important part of their traditional way of life and economy and does not have a negative impact on seal populations.

<p>
<a name="60214-40_para6">
<a name="stpa_391">The seals directive was transposed into UK legislation by means of the Import of Seal Skins Regulations 1996. The regulations prohibit the commercial importation of raw, tanned or dressed furskins, and other products from whitecoat harp and blueback hooded seal pups. I should explain that a whitecoat pup is a harp seal up to approximately two and a half weeks old, and a blueback is a hooded seal up to approximately 16 months old. As my hon. Friend pointed out, the issue is that sealers wait longer than two and a half weeks and are then free to take the animals.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60214-40_para7">
<a name="stpa_392">We are aware that a number of non-governmental organisations and members of the public are calling for an extension of the directive to cover products from all harp and hooded seals, not just whitecoat and blueback pups. However, the view of the European Commission is that there is currently no scientific basis to warrant an extension of the seals directive on conservation grounds. According to the International Union for the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources&#039; red list of threatened species, neither the harp nor hooded seal species are classified as endangered.

They have a royal decree that proposes to introduce a labelling requirement for cat, dog and seal fur products, but it is still at a fairly early stage. I have asked officials to look into the approach that is being adopted in Belgium.
