supermarkets follow the lead of supermarkets such as Booth&#146;s,
which got involved very early on with the Bowland milk initiative,

holds discussions with the Department for Communities and Local

extra homes will lead to only one in 1,000 increase in total water use
or that of Professor McDonald, as expressed in the eighth report of the
House of Lords Science and Technology Committee, that the prediction of
a minor increase in water demand is at odds with every other
forecast?</p><p><a name="06062258000046"><b><a name="06062258000444">Ian
Pearson:</b> The Government want to see new
housing development and to give people the right to have affordable
housing in the south-east. However, that housing must be sustainable.
That is why DEFRA, the Environment Agency and Natural England are
working closely with the Department for Communities and Local
Government on its new growth point scheme. As part of that, we are
closely considering water supplies, sewerage infrastructure, flood risk
and biodiversity. It is right that any proposals must balance social,
economic and environmental sustainability. We will not accept proposals
that we believe would damage the environment or that did not provide
for adequate water
supplies.</p><p><a name="06062258000047"><b><a name="06062258000445">Mr.
Mackay:</b> The Minister will recall that, during the
statement in the House a couple of weeks ago, he bizarrely told me that
my constituents and I were wrong and that the large number of houses
being built in the south-east would have almost no impact on the
current water crisis. He now knows that the Lords Science and
Technology Committee&#151;a Committee of experts&#151;has reported
and backed us up. Will he accept that he is wrong and they are
right?</p><p><a name="06062258000048"><b><a name="06062258000446">Ian
Pearson:</b> No, I do not accept that. We
will respond to the House of Lords Science and Technology Committee
report in due course. The key matter to stress is that work can be done
to improve water efficiency. For example, Anglian Water has maintained
water supplies of 1.2 billion litres a day&#151;the same amount as in
1989&#151;but it is supplying 20 per cent. more households today.
That shows what can be done about water efficiency.</p><p><a name="06062258000049">It

working on a new code for sustainable homes, and the Department for
Communities and Local Government is leading that work. We believe that
new homes should be built to the highest standards of water and energy
efficiency. Grey water systems and sustainable housing are very much
part of our thinking as a Government&#151;we want to encourage

there will be enough water to serve the new housing developments in
London?</p><p><a name="06062258000054"><b><a name="06062258000451">Ian
Pearson:</b> My hon. Friend is right to point out that Thames
Water&#146;s leakage levels are unacceptably high. It recently
reported that it had failed again to meet its target. That is a matter
for the regulator in the first instance. Ofwat has already said that it
views the issue as serious and that it will scrutinise the
company&#146;s return before deciding on regulatory action. As my
hon. Friend knows, Ofwat is responsible for setting leakage targets and
has powers to deal with poor performance under the Water Act 2003,
which Conservative Members voted
against.</p><p><a name="06062258000055"><b><a name="06062258000452">Martin
Horwood (Cheltenham) (LD):</b> I am grateful to the Minister
for identifying the failure of Thames Water, the scale of which is
staggering. Ofwat&#146;s latest figures show that it is leaking 200
million litres of water a day more than it was at the beginning of the
last five-year period. Ofwat described this significant failure
yesterday as very serious and unacceptable. As the Minister pointed
out, Ofwat has not said what it is going to do about it. What is he
going to do about
it?</p><p><a name="06062258000056"><b><a name="06062258000453">Ian
Pearson:</b> It is Ofwat&#146;s responsibility as the
economic regulator to take action, and it has powers under law to do
so. Those powers are contained in the Water Act 2003, which the
Conservatives inexplicably voted against. We will not pre-empt
Ofwat&#146;s response, but we expect it thoroughly to examine the
company&#146;s return and to take the appropriate
action.</p><p><a name="06062258000057"><b><a name="06062258000454">Anne
Main (St. Albans) (Con):</b> Will the Minister assist my
constituency, which has to have thousands of extra houses and their
attendant cars and pollution, and which already has air quality
management areas? Will he send a message to councils about how to deal
with these air quality management issues? Will any extra funding or
help be given to councils to deal with the existing
issues?</p><br><notus-date day="22" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>22 Jun 2006 : Column 1449</b><br><p><a name="06062258000058"><b><a name="06062258000455">Ian
Pearson:</b> Air quality has certainly been better than it has
been for decades. It is the responsibility of local authorities in the
first instance to take these matters forward. Let us be clear that new
houses are required in the south-east. If we are going to do the right
thing by thousands upon thousands of young couples who want affordable
homes in the south-east, we have to take action, and that is what the
Government are doing. But we are taking action and taking care of the
environment at the same time, which is why my Department, the
Environment Agency and Natural England are all involved in the new
proposals.
</p><p><a name="06062258000059"><b><a name="06062258000456">Mr.
Peter Atkinson (Hexham) (Con):</b> The Minister talked about
increasing water capacity, but is he aware that Northumbria Water,
which owns a water company in Essex, has been trying to increase
capacity by raising the banks of an existing reservoir by 10 ft? The
company reckons that if it finally gets planning permission for this,
it will have taken 18 years from the moment the scheme was first put
into play to the time when the water is actually in the reservoir.
Surely it is time for the planning processes relating to such schemes
to be
simplified.</p><p><a name="06062258000060"><b><a name="06062258000457">Ian
Pearson:</b> I am not responsible for the planning processes.
Water companies&#146; 25-year water resources plans often include
schemes for building new reservoirs and for extending existing ones,
and it is right that such schemes should go through a robust planning
process because people have to be consulted on these matters. However,
the whole House will agree that planning processes should be as
efficient as possible. The Government have done quite a lot to speed up
such processes, but they should not be speeded up at the expense of
individual rights.</p><p><a name="06062258000061"><b><a name="06062258000458">Mr.
Peter Ainsworth (East Surrey) (Con):</b> We all want
affordable housing in the south-east&#151;there is no question about
that&#151;but we also want the people who live in them to have access
to water. Will the Minister join me in congratulating the hon. Member
for Edinburgh, North and Leith (Mark Lazarowicz) on achieving Royal
Assent for his Climate Change and Sustainable Energy Bill? That will
have a significant and positive impact on improving energy efficiency
in new homes, and on promoting renewable energy. Is it not ironic,
however, that the Bill fell under the responsibility of the Department
of Trade and Industry? Is not this another example of how impotent
DEFRA has become? The hon. Member for Bolton, South-East (Dr. Iddon)
has just made a very sensible suggestion. What plans does DEFRA have to
introduce its own legislation to ensure that house building is
compatible with the natural resources of the country and the planet,
and, in particular, that there are adequate water supplies to ensure
that the new homes are worth living
in?</p><p><a name="06062258000062"><b><a name="06062258000459">Ian
Pearson:</b> I certainly congratulate my hon. Friend the
Member for Edinburgh, North and Leith (Mark Lazarowicz) on his Bill
receiving Royal Assent. However, there is a difference between us and
the Conservatives on these issues. The hon. Member for East Surrey (Mr.
Ainsworth) is on record as saying that the present level of house
building is excessive, but the 
<br><notus-date day="22" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>22 Jun 2006 : Column 1450</b><br>Government do not believe that to be the case. We believe that thousands
of young couples should have the opportunity to have new houses, but
that has to be achieved in a sustainable way. That is why we are
working closely with the Department for Communities and Local
Government on its growth point plans, so that, when the schemes come
forward, those growth point areas will have been subjected to a
rigorous analysis of the environmental impacts and benefits. That is
the right way to do it. The Conservatives say that they want to see
house building, yet they support early-day motions that oppose new
house building. That strikes me as the activity of a party that is
neither responsible nor in
control.</p>

Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (David
Miliband):</b> In March the Government announced a
climate change programme setting out measures that will affect all
major sectors and sources of UK emissions. The review predicts that the
measures will reduce the UK's carbon dioxide emissions to 15 to18 per
cent. below 1990 levels and the emission of greenhouse gases to 23 to
25 per cent. below 1990 levels, which is double the Kyoto target.
Progress will be monitored and assessed regularly and frequently by an
inter-departmental board, and there will be an annual report to
Parliament every year, starting next year.</p><p><a name="06062258000066"><b><a name="06062258000463">Norman
Baker:</b> I hope that the Minister agrees that if any target
is to be meaningful, it must include aviation, which, as he will know,
presents a major threat. If that continues at the same rate, it will
cancel out all the gains made in other sectors. Does the Minister
accept that while emissions trading is a useful tool which represents a
step forward, it is not enough in itself to halt the inexorable rise of
aviation? Does he accept that when one of my constituents goes to Spain
and back by air solely to buy fags and beer cheaply, the price of
aviation must increase?</p><p><a name="06062258000067"><b><a name="06062258000464">David
Miliband:</b> The hon. Gentleman may be confusing the question
of whether we have an emissions trading scheme with the question of
what the scheme includes. At present aviation is not included, but the
Government are committed to ensuring that it is. If there are rising
levels of air travel, they must be offset elsewhere. That strikes me as
a more sensible way of putting a cap on emissions and tackling the
problems. If the hon. Gentleman wants to tell his constituents that
they are not allowed to fly he can do so, but I think it is better to
say that if more people are flying, emissions must be offset and
reduced elsewhere.

205030 per cent. of houses will have been built since the
introduction of the new building regulations, which represents a 40 per
cent. improvement in energy efficiency in new housing. Secondly, I
believe that there should be cross-party support for the home
information packs that will be introduced next year. They will include
an energy rating of every household, which has never been available
before. They will also tell householders how they can cut energy
emissions, and how they can save themselves money. <i> [Interruption.]

carbon dioxide emissions, and given that transport is one of the
largest sources&#151;and an increasing source&#151;of carbon
dioxide, why are the incentives for motorists to drive low-emission
cars so utterly feeble? Will the Secretary of State undertake, as one
of his first acts, to press the Chancellor of the Exchequer to widen
substantially the differentials relating to vehicle excise duty, so
that those who choose to drive low-emission cars receive a proper

said, this country should be proud of the progress that has been made

the EU that the UK held. I think that the debate about the scientific
evidence is now conclusively over. Vice-President Gore referred to 928
articles that showed absolute consensus about climate change and its
causes. We need to move on to a debate about the level at which we
should stabilise emissions, and how we can do so. I believe that the

forward-looking strategy, entitled &#147;Water Resources for the
Future&#148;. Water companies also produce 25-year water resources
plans to reconcile supply and demand. In April 2007, the production and

Burstow:</b> I am grateful for that answer. The Minister will
be aware that just yesterday, Thames Water admitted that, for the third
year on the trot, it has missed its leakage reduction target. At the
same time, it announced a 31 per cent. increase in its profits. Will
the Minister tell the House today what is being done to make sure that
the regulator is taking the necessary steps to ensure that increased
water charges to consumers are not just put into increased dividends,
but used to increase spending on dealing with
leakages?</p><p><a name="06062258000132"><b><a name="06062258000526">Ian
Pearson:</b> I do not know whether the hon. Gentleman was not
listening a moment ago when I clearly said that Thames Water&#146;s
leakage rates are unacceptably high. As I also said, that is, in the
first instance, a matter for the regulator, and we expect the regulator
to want to assess Thames&#146;s returns and decide on appropriate
action. The regulator has powers under the Water Act 2003 to fine a
company up to 10 per cent. of turnover. I have to point out, again,
that the Conservative party voted against that Act, which would have
meant those powers not being

Pearson:</b> As a Government, we believe that water metering
has the ability to reduce water demand. Research suggests that water
savings of something like 10 per cent. can result from metering, which
is why the water savings group that I chair and which includes
representatives from the industry, the Environment Agency, Ofwat and
consumer groups is looking closely at what more can be done on
metering. We do not think that universal compulsory metering is the
right way to go, but in areas of water stress there is a strong case
for looking at metering, and that is what the Government are
considering.</p><p><a name="06062258000135"><b><a name="06062258000529">Mr.

has a good record on leakage rates. It is supplying the same amount of
water that it supplied in 1989 to 20 per cent. more customers, so it
has done a lot about water efficiency.</p><p><a name="06062258000137">Of course, water companies need
to be involved in the planning process. The Water Act 2003 enables them
to be statutory consultees on regional spatial strategies and local

did the Minister decide to abandon the concept of replacement value for
cattle? I have a copy of the June compensation tables. You will be
aware, Mr. Speaker, that there is a big difference between a

The hon. Gentleman acknowledged in his question that there had been
47,000 responses to the consultation, which may be a record for any
Government consultation. Of course, it is important that the Government
take those representations seriously, and that we study the science. On
the hon. Gentleman&#146;s point about compensation, he is aware that
a number of independent reports have criticised the Government and the
Welsh Assembly for seriously over-compensating farmers for TB reactors
and that we have a new system based on table valuations, with 47
categories. That was consulted on twice. We are always looking at ways
to improve the system but it is already proving extremely effective in
addressing the serious issue of over-compensation that occurred
previously.</p>

the way in which we pay for the cost of animal diseases is moving more
and more in the direction of cost-sharing between industry and the
taxpayer. However, I will look into other ways in which we can help to
support the industry; for example, it would be sensible for the
industry to set up its own hardship fund, from which a business could
seek help if it got into serious trouble. Perhaps the hon. Gentleman

know, because the track record of the Department for Environment, Food

that I cannot give him an answer to his last point about where the
disease came from. We simply do not know at the moment, but there is an
intensive epidemiological investigation under way. If we get a better
idea, we will keep the House informed. The cost depends on how many
businesses are ultimately affected. My understanding is that the
businesses that are worst affected at the moment&#151;as raised by
the hon. Member for Ryedale and one or two others&#151;are those that
move fish out to other fish farms for breeding or catching. The
majority of the fish farms in the area that are producing trout and

Haven&#146;t Found What I&#146;m Looking For&#148;. Perhaps we
could have a touch of Dire Straits for the Deputy Prime Minister with
the track &#147;Money for Nothing&#148;. I suppose that the
Chancellor might look to Diana Ross with &#147;You Keep Me
Hangin&#146; On&#148;. Perhaps the Prime Minister would like the
Clash&#146;s &#147;Should I Stay or Should I Go&#148;. Talking of
clashes, perhaps the Chancellor would describe his relationship with
the Prime Minister with the White Stripes track &#147;Every Day I
Love You Less and Less&#148;. Or, given the Chancellor&#146;s
commitment to new Labour, maybe his track for him and the Prime
Minister should be Elton John&#146;s &#147;Friends Never Say
Goodbye&#148;:</p>

Straw:</b> The first question that the right hon. Lady asked
me was about the West Lothian question and the report from the Scottish
Affairs Committee, which I have indeed read with interest. We have no
plans for an immediate debate on the issue. It has been debated at
great length. What the Conservatives&#151;who used to be called the
Conservative and Unionist party and were concerned about the break-up
of the Union&#151;need to think about is that however superficially
sedulous the West Lothian question may be, it is a very dangerous idea
to argue that Members of this House should not be able to vote on
issues that affect the whole of the United Kingdom. We determine in
this House, with a vast majority of English MPs, total spending in the
Scottish Parliament, because we decide the block grant. We decide many
other issues for Scotland. It was we who decided to vote, again with a
majority of English MPs, in favour of the Scotland Act 1998 and of the
Government of Wales Act 1998. We are a unitary country and we remain
so. I am proud to have been a member of an Administration which, with
support from the Liberal Democrat party and others, ensured a good
measure of devolution to Scotland and Wales, while preserving the
Union.</p><p><a name="06062258000186">The
right hon. Lady&#146;s second question was about the head teacher who
is mentioned in one of the newspapers. Of course I am very sorry, as I
know my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Education and
Skills is, about that particular head teacher and his concerns about
education. However, we should not generalise from the concerns of one
individual. Anybody who goes into schools across the country can see
the dramatic improvement that is shown by many indicators. It is shown
in the salaries of head teachers and in the professional support now
given to head teachers. Above all, it is shown in the fantastic
increase in standards being delivered by those head teachers to our
schoolchildren. It is reprehensible of the Opposition to seek to
denigrate 
<br><notus-date day="22" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>22 Jun 2006 : Column 1468</b><br>the fantastic performance of teachers across the country in raising
standards for all our children.</p><p><a name="06062258000187">The right
hon. Lady then asked me about Trident. Our manifesto at the 2005
general election stated that we&#151;the Labour
Government&#151;are</p><a name="06062258000406"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;committed
to retaining the independent nuclear
deterrent&#148;.</p></ul><p><a name="06062258000188">In speaking
about the longer term, as well as this Parliament, my right hon. Friend
the Chancellor of the Exchequer was fully consistent with that
manifesto commitment put before the British people at the last
election. Decisions on Trident&#146;s replacement have yet to be
taken. When they have been taken, they will be put to Parliament in a
White Paper. I cannot anticipate at this stage the most appropriate
form of debate, but it will be in a form that shows proper respect for
the House. I hope that by the time of our White Paper and the debate,
the Conservative party will have determined not just what its policy is
on Trident, but whether it has a
policy.</p><p><a name="06062258000189"><b><a name="06062258000552">Dr.
Julian Lewis (New Forest, East) (Con):</b> Of course we have a
policy: retain and
replace.</p><p><a name="06062258000190"><b><a name="06062258000553">Mr.
Straw:</b> If that is the policy, why was it not mentioned in
the Conservatives&#146; 2005 manifesto? The 2005 Conservative
manifesto was completely silent on the issue of Trident&#146;s
replacement.</p><p><a name="06062258000191">The right
hon. Lady asked about the Prime Minister-designate. I am glad to know
that she believes that the Prime Minister-designate is the Chancellor,
not the Leader of the Opposition. Finally&#151;I congratulate her
researchers on their efforts&#151;she came up with some laboured
quotations from titles of various pop songs. I will not try and compete
with her&#151;I apologise for that&#151;except to say that, like
her, I deeply regret the passing of &#147;Top of the Pops&#148;,
which connected me, and no doubt her, to our
youth.</p><p><a name="06062258000192"><b><a name="06062258000554">Kate
Hoey (Vauxhall) (Lab):</b> My right hon. Friend will aware of
the Friends of the Earth&#146;s Big Ask campaign, which is about
trying to get a Bill on climate change into the Queen&#146;s Speech.
It is a big issue&#151;I had a huge meeting at Lambeth Friends of the
Earth last week&#151;and we want to set targets year by year. Will my
right hon. Friend arrange for a debate on climate change before the end
of the Session so that Members who have been involved with the campaign
might influence what goes into the Queen&#146;s
Speech?</p><p><a name="06062258000193"><b><a name="06062258000555">Mr.
Straw:</b> I am glad that my hon. Friend has raised the issue,
as I know of her constituents&#146; great concern and of the work
that she has done. She, in turn, will know that it has become a major
priority not only for the Government but, through our right hon. Friend
the Prime Minister, for the G8, and it will be followed up at the
forthcoming G8 summit in St. Petersburg. I cannot promise a debate
before we rise for the summer recess, but I promise that I will do my
very best to see whether we can have a debate this Session before the
Queen&#146;s Speech.</p><p><a name="06062258000194"><b><a name="06062258000556">Mr.
David Heath (Somerton and Frome) (LD):</b> What are the right
hon. Gentleman&#146;s intentions regarding a welfare reform Bill? The
consultation paper from the Department for Work and Pensions makes the
process
clear:</p><a name="06062258000407"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;The
timescale is now pressing (given that we intend to have the new
Employment and Support Allowance in place from 
<br><notus-date day="22" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>22 Jun 2006 : Column 1469</b><br>2008). We therefore hope to introduce a Welfare ReformBill in
this Parliamentary session and to seek Royal Assent by Easter
2007.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06062258000195">Is it the intention to introduce a Bill
before the summer recess, and is it the right hon. Gentleman&#146;s
intention that it should be carried over to the next parliamentary
Session, which is the only conclusion that we can draw from the
statement in the White Paper?</p><p><a name="06062258000196">Once again, can I ask for a
debate on post offices? I accept that this is a well-worn track, as the
issue has been raised by many hon. Members on both sides of the House,
but it remains a pressing need. I will receive two petitions this
weekend from constituents who are concerned about the future of their
local post offices. I did not organise those petitions&#151;they were
organised by my constituents, who are worried about the future of their
local post office. There is a pressing need to hold a debate, because
the termination of the Post Office card account has been announced, and
sub-post offices have lost the right to issue the BBC television
licence. I understand that, next year, the contract with the Driver and
Vehicle Licensing Agency for the issuing of the road fund licence is to
end. Before a decision is made to give that contract to someone else,
can we have a debate in the House on the future of the Post Office?
</p><p><a name="06062258000197">Finally, as the
nights are now drawing in, may I set the scene for our consideration
late in the evening and ask for a debate on the conundrum of
ministerial responsibility, which puzzles all of us? Yesterday, the
hon. Member for Uxbridge (Mr. Randall) asked a question about the new
post of liveability Minister. The Prime Minister did not deny that he
was going to make such an appointment, but he did not confirm it, nor
did he give any indication of who would be the liveability Minister.
However, he
said:</p><a name="06062258000408"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Liveability
is the ability of local communities to be freefrom crime and
fear&#148;.&#151;[<i> Official Report</i>, 21 June 2006; Vol. 447,
c. 1315.]</p></ul><p><a name="06062258000198">I take the
old-fashioned view that making sure that communities are free from
crime and fear is the job of the Home Secretary, so is that a
responsibility of which he has now officially divested
himself?</p><p><a name="06062258000199"><b><a name="06062258000557">Mr.
Straw:</b> On a welfare reform Bill, we hope to introduce such
a measure. It is a candidate for carry-over, on which there will be
consultations with the usual channels. The hon. Gentleman asked for a
debate on post offices, implying that there had not been any debates on
the financing of rural post offices. However, there have been a great
many, not least on the Adjournment and in Westminster Hall. He will
know that because of changes to the way in which people communicate
with one another and in banking practice, the Post Office operates in a
more commercial environment. No, I cannot promise a debate before a
decision is made by the Post Office&#151;and not by
Ministers&#151;on whether it can win a contract with, for example,
the DVLA, because that is a matter between the DVLA and the Post
Office. Of course, issues of public service will be taken fully into
account. Notwithstanding the closure of some post offices,99
per cent. of people in urban areas&#151;I accept that the figure is
lower in rural areas&#151;live within a mile of their local post
office, and the network of post offices is still substantial. In
addition, the level of subsidy from the public purse to support the
network in rural areas is still very high.</p><br><notus-date day="22" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>22 Jun 2006 : Column 1470</b><br><p><a name="06062258000200">On the interesting issue of

hon. Friend&#146;s attention to the present debate about Thames
Water, which has decreased its capital spending while increasing prices
enormously? May we have a debate on the whole saga since privatisation
of the water companies by the Conservative party? The public not only
in the Thames region, but across the country, feel that they are being
ripped off by companies that shove up the salaries of their senior
operatives&#151;the chief executive and so on&#151;and shove up
prices for the consumer, but do not invest in order to provide the
water supply that we
need.</p><p><a name="06062258000205"><b><a name="06062258000561">Mr.

widespread concern, particularly on this side of the House, about the
original water privatisation conducted by the Conservative party.
Something has gone wrong with the balance between
investmentand profit. My hon. Friend the Member for Vauxhall

unending series of leaks which, after years and years of claiming to
have put them right, Thames Water still allows to

of the House will be aware that the United States Senate is this week
considering American policy in Iraq and that the House of
Representatives had a similar opportunity quite recently. Does it not
remain a disgrace that, in more than a year since the previous general

British Government policy on Iraq to be fully debated? Will the Leader

There was the most intensive engagement in respect of Home Office

else. During the 2001 general election, I was pursued&#151;almost

together a peace agreement. However, since then there has been nothing
but obstruction in Khartoum of the attempt to move from African Union
to United Nations troops coming in to enforce the peace. Sadly, there
is much evidence of small arms flooding into Darfur, especially from
China, as the rebel groups splinter. Is not it time that hon. Members 
<br><notus-date day="22" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>22 Jun 2006 : Column 1477</b><br>had a genuine opportunity to discuss in the Chamber what is happening in

more optimistic when, in January, I spoke firmly to all parties
involved in the peace process in Abuja. Not least because of the
efforts of my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for
International Development, we have got the agreement, but as my hon.
Friend says, too many in Khartoum still resist implementing
it.</p><p><a name="06062258000252">I accept that we
should have a debate if we have time. On arms flooding into Sudan, one
of the reasons for the Government&#146;s commitment to obtaining and
implementing an international arms trade treaty is that once it exists,
we can take genuine measures against not only the ballistic and nuclear
weapons that are there but small arms and light weapons, which are all
too readily available and fuel all conflicts, especially in
Africa.</p><p><a name="06062258000253"><b><a name="06062258000598">Bob
Russell (Colchester) (LD):</b> I wonder whether time could be
found for a debate on the so-called private finance initiative to fund
public buildings, services and facilities, which often ends up with the
public paying considerably more for less. The scheme for the expansion
of Colchester general hospital through PFI collapsed last week, leaving
the NHS with a bill of &#163;3 million wasted and the private sector
with a bill of &#163;7 million wasted, which it is trying to claim
back from the NHS. The result is &#163;10 million lost, no new
facility and the voluntary sector in the town, which provides so much
support for the health service, being denied its revenue because the
NHS says that it cannot afford it.</p><p><a name="06062258000254"><b><a name="06062258000599">Mr.

Adjournment debate on that issue; it is obviously a good subject for
one. I do not know the details of what has happened in Colchester, but
I stress that the PFI has generally been successful in ensuring much
earlier investment in hospital services than would otherwise be the
case. I waited 25 years for promises that the previous Government made
to build a new hospital in my constituency to be fulfilled. It never
happened, but as a result of a PFI decision in 1998, we now have a
brand new district general hospital almost completed, up and
running.</p><br><notus-date day="22" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>22 Jun 2006 : Column 1478</b><br>

<h3 align="center"><a name="06062258000003">Rural Payments
Agency</h3><h5 align="left"><a name="06062258000415">12.16
pm</h5><p><a name="06062258000255"><b><a name="06062258000600">The
Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (David
Miliband):</b> With permissionMr. Speaker, I shall
make a statement on the Rural Payments Agency. In my written statement
on 9 May, I promised to keep the House informed on progress made by the
RPA on the single payments scheme. At oral questions today, no
questions on the SPS were on the Order Paper. I therefore thought it
right to give hon. Members the chance to raise the issue.</p><p><a name="06062258000256">In summary,
there has been some progress, but the situation is far from
satisfactory. As of Tuesday 20 June, some &#163;1.38 billion,
representing more than 90 per cent. of the total fund, has now been
paid to more than 100,000 applicants; 82,571 claims have been settled
in full, and 18,785 applicants have received a partial payment and are
awaiting their
&#147;top-up&#148;.</p><p><a name="06062258000257">On
9 May, I said that the priority for the RPA would be claims of more
than &#8364;1,000 Euro where no payment had been made. The number of
claimants in that category is now approximately 2,300. I recognise the
hardship involved for them and deeply regret the distress caused. The
RPA is taking further steps to pay those complex claims, including
discussing issues direct with claimants and, when feasible, bringing
parties together in cases of continuing disagreement&#151;for
example, when two or more parties have made a claim for the same piece
of land. The RPA has written twice to all the individuals
concerned.</p><p><a name="06062258000258">I also
recognise the importance of the unresolved hill farm allowance
payments. Of the approximately 10,500 eligible HFA claims, 5,000 have
been paid in full and a further 900 authorised for partial payments.
Full and partial payments are continuing to be made.</p><p><a name="06062258000259">The EU defined payment window
for making 2005 SPS payments runs from 1 December 2005 until30
June this year. Work is continuing to pay as many claims as possible by
30 June. However, farming leaders have made representations to me on
behalf of the farmers who do not receive the full sum due to them
during the legal payment window. I have therefore authorised the RPA to
make interest payments at the London Interbank offered rate plus 1 per
cent. calculated from 1 July, in respect of any payments where
responsibility for the delay rests with the RPA. That will be subject
to a minimum interest payment level of &#163;50. Further details will
be given on the timing of those payments once the RPA has assessed how
they can be integrated most effectively into the existing payment
schedule.</p><p><a name="06062258000260">Work on
delivery of the 2006 scheme to be paid between 1 December this year and
30 June next year is under way. As I said on 9 May and want to repeat
today, the 2006 scheme year will be challenging. The RPA&#146;s
interim chief executive, Tony Cooper, has made an initial assessment of
the task ahead. He has confirmed that, in respect of customer service
and management information, there is no quick fix. Possible options for
the 2007 scheme&#151;for example, the use of a minimum payment
level&#151;are not available for
2006.</p><p><a name="06062258000261">Against this
background, farming leaders have understandably called for partial
payments to be made in 2006, as they were in 2005. I have discussed the
need 
<br><notus-date day="22" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>22 Jun 2006 : Column 1479</b><br>for the necessary EU legislation to make partial payments with the
Commissioner, Mrs. Fisher-Boel, and authorised the RPA to start work on
the necessary systems. However, until the RPA chief executive has had
an opportunity to make a realistic assessment of the prospects for full
payments, I do not want to commit to a particular timetable or specify
whether or when partial payments might be necessary. Initial validation
of the 2006 claims is under way, and detailed validation should start
next month. By the time the House returns after the summer recess,
therefore, we should have a better understanding of the prospects for
the 2006 scheme, and I will make a further statement
then.</p><p><a name="06062258000262">Given the
position on the 2006 scheme, I have decided to simplify to the maximum
extent possible the arrangements for the incorporation into the single
payment scheme of additional support arising from last
November&#146;s landmark EU sugar reform. In practice, that means
that the &#163;52 million concerned will be added entirely to the
entitlements held by sugar beet producers who meet the defined
criteria, rather than some of the funds being used to increase the flat
rate value of all entitlements. Further details, including on
arrangements for 2007, will be announced in due
course.</p><p><a name="06062258000263">I
can also report that an EU regulation has been adopted which provides
for all 2006 claims to be accepted without penalty until 15 June. Under
the original timetable, the limit would have been 15 May. This extra
time above and beyond the extension to 31 May&#151;to which I
referred in my statement on 9 May&#151;will mean that around 4,000
farmers will not now be penalised. I am sure that the whole House will
join me in expressing my gratitude to the European Commission for its
understanding on this
issue.</p><p><a name="06062258000264">The fundamental
review of the RPA that the then Secretary of State, my right hon.
Friend the present Foreign Secretary, set in train earlier this year
will be important for the future of the RPA when it reports at the end
of this year. In the meantime, I know that this year&#146;s problems
have caused real distress and I repeat the apology to farmers that I
have made before, both in the House and elsewhere. I can assure the
House that the new RPA chief executive, with the support of the
Department, will be looking to take interim steps to aid the recovery
process and to improve the experience of farmers dealing with the
agency to the maximum possible extent. I will keep the House informed
as matters
progress.</p><p><a name="06062258000265"><b><a name="06062258000601">Mr.
Peter Ainsworth (East Surrey) (Con):</b> I
am grateful to the Secretary of State for keeping the House informed of
the modest progress that is being made to deal with this problem. It is
unfortunate, Mr. Speaker, that the BBC&#146;s &#147;Farming
Today&#148; programme probably heard about this statement before you
did&#151;but that is life these days, under new Labour. As I said, it
is good to hear that modest progress is being made to address this
appalling fiasco, which has brought added hardship to many in the
farming community and related industries at a time of profound change,
uncertainty and stress.</p><p><a name="06062258000266">Many
questions remain to be answered, however. How did the problems arise in
the first place? What 
<br><notus-date day="22" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>22 Jun 2006 : Column 1480</b><br>happens next? The Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Committee is
conducting an inquiry into what went wrong. Will the Secretary of State
give an assurance that the Committee will be given access to all the
information that it needs to form a balanced, accurate and
comprehensive view of the events that led to the failure to make
payments on time? The Committee&#146;s inquiry has already produced
some interesting evidence, and we look forward to its findings with
great interest. Meanwhile, the BBC&#146;s &#147;File on 4&#148;
programme has disclosed that the Office of Government Commerce gateway
review was warning two years ago that there were severe problems with
delivering the new system. Why were those warnings ignored?</p><p><a name="06062258000267">I welcome the
announcement that the Government will start paying interest on the
money that they owe from 1 July. But what about the people who are
entitled to payment but have received nothing for the six months before
30 June? Those people have been put at ahuge competitive
disadvantage by the Government&#146;s incompetence, denial and
mismanagement, and have been forced to take out commercial loans. The
Secretary of State said that 90 per cent. of the total fund had now
been paid, but he did not say&#151;unless I missed
something&#151;how many claimants remained unpaid. I would be
grateful if he could give us that information. Will he also tell us
whether the hill livestock allowance claimants will benefit from the
initiative on interest payments that he has announced today?</p><p><a name="06062258000268">How many
farmers will receive compensation equal to the salary of the sacked
chief executive of the Rural Payments Agency, who, as I understand it,
is still on the payroll but doing nothing? What estimate has the
Secretary of State made of the total bank interest paid to date by the
farming sector in England as a result of his Department&#146;s
failure? What estimate has he made of the likely cost to British
taxpayers of the Government&#146;s failure to meet the 30 June
deadline? Are we to assume that the Government&#146;s humiliating
plea to the European Union for an extension beyond that deadline has
been refused? What discussions has he had with the EU Commission about
the fines that Britain will have to pay for this failure? What
discussions has he had with the Chancellor about which budget the fines
will be paid out of? If they will be paid out of the Department for
Environment, Food and Rural Affairs budget, what will the Secretary of
State cut in order to pay them? Or will they come from some other
source?</p><p><a name="06062258000269">Does the
Secretary of State realise that the RPA is still getting its field data
wrong and making wildly inaccurate partial payments? Will he tell us
how many overpayments and underpayments have been recorded, and give us
the value in each case? Can he give us the date on which he expects the
2005 payments to have been completed? Is he really unable to give us a
date by which farmers can expect to receive their cheques for 2006? Can
he guarantee that the UK will not face fines a second
time?</p><p><a name="06062258000270">Much
has been made by Ministers of the hard work of the staff at the Rural
Payments Agency, and I am sure that the majority of them have worked
very hard to sort out the mess that their political masters have
created. Will the Secretary of State take this opportunity to comment,
however, on press reports about RPA staff who, even as calls to the
rural stress network reached 
<br><notus-date day="22" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>22 Jun 2006 : Column 1481</b><br>record levels, were cavorting naked in the office and hiding cups full
of vomit in office cupboards?</p><p><a name="06062258000271">We detected a bad smell about
the handling of the single farm payment last year, but the Government
denied that there was a problem. We called last year for the Government
to introduce a partial payment scheme. Their refusal to open up that
option at the time cost the farming community millions of pounds. We
called on Ministers to return to farmers the interest that they had
paid because of the Government&#146;s failure, but again the door was
closed. It has taken months for them to accept any financial liability
at all. Every time we prise open the door on this wretched affair a
little further, the smell gets worse.</p><p><a name="06062258000272"><b><a name="06062258000602">David
Miliband:</b> The hon. Gentleman has asked
some intelligent questions, which I shall address. However, he has also
made some allegations that are completely unworthy of him, and should
be rejected utterly. There is no question of the Department speaking to
&#147;Farming Today&#148; about the interest payments that have
been speculated about. We have made a point of being scrupulous in our
engagement with stakeholders, and about coming to the House and not
making &#147;Farming Today&#148; the first step.</p><p><a name="06062258000273">I am happy to confirm to the
hon. Gentleman that there will be full co-operation with the
Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Committee. I am not sure, however,
whether he fully understands the purpose of the gateway reviews. Their
role is to identify issues that need to be addressed, and at every
stage the purpose of the different traffic lights is to show which
those issues are. Officials and Ministers have tried to address those
issues; they certainly have not ignored them.</p><p><a name="06062258000274">I think that I made it clear in
my statement that 2,300 claimants of more than &#8364;1,000 had not
been&#151;</p><p><a name="06062258000275"><b><a name="06062258000603">Bill
Wiggin (Leominster) (Con):</b> How many in
total?</p><p><a name="06062258000276"><b><a name="06062258000604">David
Miliband:</b> If the hon. Gentleman will just contain himself,
I can assure him that he will get the full picture. As I was saying,
2,300 claimants of more than &#8364;1,000 have not been paid, and
about 12,000&#151;it might be 12,200&#151;claims of less than
&#8364;1,000 have not been paid.</p><p><a name="06062258000277">As for the taxpayers, the hon.
Member for East Surrey (Mr. Ainsworth) will know that the European
Commission requirement is not to pay 100 per cent. of the payments by
the deadline. Obviously, some people die, and there are other reasons
involved. The target is a 96.1 per cent. payment for the UK as a
whole&#151;this will be of interest to Members from outside
England&#151;and our commitment is to make as many payments as
possible by 30 June. It would be wrong for me to make predictions,
especially given the history of some previous predictions, but we have
now reached over90 per cent. for England, and we are trying to
make as many payments as we can as soon as

operating beyond its productivity quotas, namely the press and
communications office. I hope that that does not reflect the Secretary
of State&#146;s priorities, because this continues to be a grave
issue for a number of farmers. I was informed today that, in the last
three days alone, five farmers who have received no payment have
approached my right hon. Friend the Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed (Mr.
Beith). We now know from the Secretary of State&#146;s own figures
that a substantial number of claimants&#151;nearly 15,000&#151;have
received no payment. That is obviously devastating for some of the
farmers
involved.</p><p><a name="06062258000284">We
are pleased that further progress is being made on payments. We are
also pleased that the Secretary of State has seen fit to authorise
interest payments, which we have requested for some time, and partial
payments for the 2006 single payment scheme, which we have also
requested. However, it is worth noting that it is reported that the
parliamentary ombudsman has received several complaints about the
maladministration of single farm payments. If that is indeed the case,
is it not clear that the interest payments have been granted at a time
when the Government have a gun to their head?</p><p><a name="06062258000285">Moreover, the

expectations about the timing of their payments above the legal

that he has told the Treasury to expect for the overrun that will be
caused by the fact that the European Union will not meet any payments
made by DEFRA after 30 June. What is that figure, and will it be met
from the departmental budget? If so, what other budget lines will be
cut to defray the extra cost? If not, will the Secretary of State
assure us that the amount will be met from the contingency reserve?

payments now. Equally, it is right that I come back to the House in
October with a written or oral statement to report on what the RPA

five years and that farmers make payment claims in good faith? Although
they may not wish to receive the subsidies, they come to rely on
them.</p><p><a name="06062258000307">The Secretary of

behaviour of RPA staff in Newcastle. Although I gather that most
farmers in Vale of York have now received their money, they were at
their wits&#146; end because, even as late as March, they had
received none at all. Does he agree that RPA staff showed an utter lack
of respect for their clients in partying and calling farmers names in
the way that has been alleged? I hope that disciplinary action will be
taken and that, if necessary, staff will be
dismissed.</p><p><a name="06062258000308"><b><a name="06062258000618">David

earlier and am glad to have another opportunity to do
so.</p><p><a name="06062258000309">The
allegations are very serious, but there is an important distinction to
be drawn. The hon. Lady implied that the whole office in Newcastle was
at fault, whereas the hon. Member for East Surrey made it clear that
most of the staff are hard-working and that only a minority indulged in
antics that bring the RPA and the whole of public service into
disrepute. Of course the behaviour is appalling and must be taken in
the most serious possible way. I can tell the House that one member of
staff has been dismissed, and that a number of others face severe
disciplinary action. The behaviour&#151;some of it alleged, but much
of it substantiated&#151;is completely unacceptable and needs to be
dealt with in the most serious
way.</p><p><a name="06062258000310">The hon. Lady is
right that many farm incomes are under pressure and the hon. Member for
Macclesfield (Sir Nicholas Winterton) made the same point. However, I
think that she will accept that the farming industry has different
sectors, some of which are doing better than others. In addition, some
sectors&#151;such as the poultry sector, most obviously&#151;are
not involved in payments at all. It is important to recognise that we
are not dealing with a single picture, but the message that I want to
give is that British farming is important, for the countryside and for
the whole country. We all benefit from a strong farming sector and it
is incumbent on the Government to do all that we can in that respect.
She is

the interest payments on the loan that he had to take out, as he has
been paid 90 per cent. of his claim only recently? Can we imagine what
the House would hear if the Secretary of State&#146;s salary and

know exactly how much an arrangement fee for loan costs or how much
interest has to be paid on borrowings that were taken up. Can the

the welcome partial interest payments just announced, the Secretary of

incompetence of the Government and their agency. Certainty is, as
repeatedly mentioned, a key matter for farmers in an increasingly

the uncertainty surrounding their 2005 payments has undermined any
certainty about the basis of their next payments, so they cannot plan,

do not want to be churlish, but I am not impressed by his apology. The
fact is that people who have suffered losses should be paid full

journalist at <i> The Times</i> reported me as calling for a boycott of
British strawberries, which is something that I never did, and that
journalist was kind enough to write a note confirming that I never
called for such a ban. That is not a matter for the Chair, but I should
like to draw your attention to the fact that, when I was standing in
the queue for the Table Office, the hon. Member for Sherwood (Paddy
Tipping), whom I have told that I would make this point of order today,
was standing in front of me. He tabled an early-day motion that
suggested that those words were true, although I was able to show him

true.</p><p><a name="06062258000333">My hon. Friend
the Member for Shrewsbury and Atcham (Daniel Kawczynski) was unhappy

do if possible, Mr. Deputy Speaker, is to insist that those very high

Minister of State, Ministry of Defence(Mr. Adam
Ingram):</b> Any debate on defence policy should be
grounded in key current operations. I should therefore like to start by
laying out the policy context for our major existing deployments,
before setting out our future
thinking.</p><p><a name="06062258000338">Ministers
have a responsibility to develop a clear policy framework that allows
front-line service people to understand what they are being asked to
do, and why, and ensures that they have the resources to succeed. It is
then for our military commanders to ensure that that policy is
implemented on the ground. Without motivated, informed and properly
supported people, policy is just empty
words.</p><p><a name="06062258000339">I
have made it a key part of my role over the past five years to see for
myself our military contribution to overall UK and international
efforts, whether in Iraq, Afghanistan or elsewhere. I pay tribute to
the achievements of our troops. They carry out their role with the
highest degree of professionalism, commitment and dedication to duty.
Those are the attributes that they are delivering in the highest
measure in our two main operational theatres&#151;Iraq and
Afghanistan&#151;and I want to touch on both of those
areas.</p><p><a name="06062258000340">On Iraq, to
withdraw prematurely would represent a huge disservice to the Iraqi
people, undermining their hopes for a better future after
Saddam&#146;s tyranny and the recent and current sectarian
insurgency. What is needed is a measured and agreed process of
transition. This week, we have seen two good examples of that approach:
first, the announcement of the Iraqi security forces taking
responsibility for Al Muthanna, and secondly, the new Basra security
plan, announced yesterday, that will increase the number of Iraqi
security forces patrolling the streets to make the city a safer
place.</p><p><a name="06062258000341">The plan also
has a public services element, supported by the coalition provincial
reconstruction team, to provide local people with the know-how to
ensure the provision of vital services&#151;things that we all take
for granted in our own communities, such as clean water, reliable
electricity supplies and refuse collection. As in Al Muthanna, our
objective is progressively to transfer responsibility to the Iraqi
security forces in the other provinces in Multi-National Division
(South-East): Maysan and Di Qhar and
Basra.</p><p><a name="06062258000342">In Afghanistan,
forces from 36 countries are now assisting the Afghan National
Government through the NATO-led, international security assistance
force, working within and under a full UN mandate. In Afghanistan, too,
we have a duty to play our part in helping a fledgling democratic state
to overcome fanatical and undemocratic antagonists. As in Iraq, and
previously in the Balkans, transition is a key 
<br><notus-date day="22" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>22 Jun 2006 : Column 1493</b><br>feature of our strategy. With our allies, we are training and equipping
local police officers and soldiers to take back responsibility for the
control of their country in the face of intimidation and
terror.</p><p><a name="06062258000343">Over time, a
process of transition from ISAF to the Afghan security forces will take
place. Completing that process is not simply a moral obligation to the
Afghan people; success is also essential for future British security
interests. If the Karzai Government were to fail and Afghanistan were
to be an unpoliced and impoverished black hole, there could be no
greater boost for worldwide Islamist extremism and no more certain way
to ensure abundant and uninterrupted supplies of heroin on our streets.
That is why we the United Kingdom, along with others, have made a
long-term support commitment to
Afghanistan.</p><p><a name="06062258000344"><b><a name="06062258000640">Bob
Russell (Colchester) (LD):</b> The right hon. Gentleman gave

them are also represented in Helmand

Ingram:</b> There are a number of countries in the south,
which is part of phase 3 of the process. Canadian, Australian, Dutch
and forces from other nations are assisting as well. Clearly, the
United States is still there as well. We have deployed a significant
force to Helmand, but the south is, of course, bigger than Helmand, and
it is going to the north of that area as well. Our military deployment
in Helmand is part of the planned NATO move into the south to support
the Afghan National Government. There is a tendency to focus on
military developments, but it is important to place them in context.
The real measure of success, of which the military effort is but a
part, is effective civil policing, economic development, reconstruction
and social
cohesion.</p><p><a name="06062258000346"><b><a name="06062258000642">Mr.

a useful debate yesterday, and he made a very good contribution. I did
not agree with everything; I did not get the chance to address every
point that he made, but he has a lot of knowledge on the subject. I
hope that his intervention will be about
Afghanistan.</p><p><a name="06062258000348"><b><a name="06062258000644">Mr.

today&#146;s debate is the Defence Committee&#146;s fifth report,
&#147;The UK deployment to Afghanistan&#148;. I appreciate that the
Minister takes a huge interest and has an obligation to speak, but he
is just about to touch on other areas that go far beyond the military
interest. Therefore, why do we not see members of the Foreign Office
team here and, importantly, the Department for International
Development team, given the huge sums of money that are coming from
those Departments as
well?</p><p><a name="06062258000349"><b><a name="06062258000645">Mr.

of the Conservative Foreign Office team in opposition to me. The debate

It so happens that the 
<br><notus-date day="22" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>22 Jun 2006 : Column 1494</b><br>Defence Committee has tabled its report on Afghanistan, and those
members of the Select Committee who are present can clearly make their
contribution in the light of their report and the Government&#146;s
response to it. I take the point&#151;as I recollect, it was made
yesterday&#151;that there should be greater engagement and debate
across the Government, either from the Foreign and Commonwealth Office
or from DFID. I understand that that was raised earlier during
businesses questions. That will be taken on board, and we must consider
how best we ensure that there is an understanding that such things are
co-ordinated across the Government and not solely
defence-led.</p><p><a name="06062258000350"><b><a name="06062258000646">Mr.

we should pull out of

Ancram:</b> I am very grateful to the right hon. Gentleman for
giving way, but I would not presume that he can give me instructions on
what my intervention should be about. In fact, I was not going to ask
him a question about
that.</p><p><a name="06062258000353">On the general
policy, since the strategic defence review in 1998, have not the
envisaged levels of commitment gone up and the envisaged levels of
resources, both human and financial, gone down? Are not our armed
forces more undermanned, more ill-equipped and more under-trained than
at any time in the past 60
years?</p><p><a name="06062258000354"><b><a name="06062258000649">Mr.
Ingram:</b> I agree in part with some of that, but not with
the latter part. If anything, there is a greater intensity in ensuring
proper training. In many ways, the nature of the deployments that our
troops have undergone has given them greater awareness, greater
knowledge and greater capacity to keep up their skills. There was a
long time&#151;it was certainly before my time&#151;when that must
have proved difficult, because we had a static position in Germany.
Sadly, we had the experience of Northern Ireland. Much of that
experience has helped us elsewhere.</p><p><a name="06062258000355">In terms of training and
knowledge, that is not the picture that I have of Her Majesty&#146;s
armed forces at present. In terms of equipment, I would accept that
that was the picture in the early stages of our deployment&#151;but,
of course, needs must. What happened in Afghanistan happened, as did
the attacks on the twin towers. They happened, and not by design or
with predictability. We had to react, and we did so&#151;I believe
correctly.</p><p><a name="06062258000356">At the
same time as we were having to react to that, we had a major exercise
under way in Oman, which had been planned five years before. Its
purpose was to ensure that we had the necessary logistic support and
the right kit&#151;that the kit being used was capable of working in
hostile environments such as those in Oman. We could have cancelled
that exercise.</p><p><a name="06062258000357"><b><a name="06062258000650">Mr.

Ingram:</b> We did not try to. We decided to continue with it
because it was teaching us invaluable lessons, as is clear if one looks
at what is happening now in terms of logistic support, the way in which
urgent operational requirements have been triggered in, and how our
personnel are currently kitted out. Complaints about equipment by our
personnel to people who visit them are now very rare. I am not saying
that there are no complaints, but they are very rare, and they are
certainly at nothing like the level they were at five years
ago.</p><p><a name="06062258000359">On reshaping and
restructuring the armed forces overall, we could have a debate about
future army structure, and the projected size of the new navy, while
remembering the ships we are purchasing&#151;I will address that
later in my speech&#151;which require fewer personnel to serve on
board. That is the case even for the new larger aircraft carriers, for
which I think about 200 fewer personnel are needed. That meant there
would be a reshaping. We have also reshaped the RAF; about 7,500 posts
have gone. The RAF has never been busier, and, actually, it is
delivering to tremendous effect. So we should get this issue into the
proper context. If the right hon. and learned Member for Devizes (Mr.
Ancram) is prepared to say, drawing on his parliamentary experience,
that the armed forces were always fully manned and always equipped
beyond need, he is not living in the real
world.</p><p><a name="06062258000360">I
have been talking about the tendency to focus on military developments
and the importance of putting that in context. I said that that has to
be part of an overall package of delivery of civil policing, economic
development, reconstruction and social cohesion. As the House will be
aware, the means by which we hope to achieve that is through the proven
route of a provincial reconstruction team to be based in Helmand. It
will combine the various agencies of UK Government delivery&#151;the
Ministry of Defence, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and the
Department for International Development. That mechanism has already
delivered in the north and west of Afghanistan. I recognise that the
south is a more difficult environment, but we are determined to
succeed.</p><p><a name="06062258000361"><b><a name="06062258000652">Mr.
Nigel Evans (Ribble Valley) (Con):</b> Will the Minister state
whether he believes that there are sufficient forces in Afghanistan to
deliver all the things that he has said they wish to achieve in that
very large country?</p><p><a name="06062258000362">The Minister also mentioned
heroin and the drug supplies that come from Afghanistan. What support
is he getting from within Afghanistan to help to eradicate those
supplies?</p><p><a name="06062258000363"><b><a name="06062258000653">Mr.

train and assist a standing Afghan force that deals with eradication,
and it is very successful. The problem is huge, and it will not be
solved overnight. <i> [</i><i> Interruption.</i><i> ] </i>I hear the
points that are made, but I do not hear any solutions, other than those
that we are seeking to deliver. If anyone has a better solution for
dealing with the increase in the opium crop, I will be interested to
hear it, because we will certainly take on board any good
ideas.</p><br><notus-date day="22" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>22 Jun 2006 : Column 1496</b><br><p><a name="06062258000364">On the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
other point, we have always said that we will keep the size of the
deployment under review. We recently made an announcement in respect of
sending a company of the RAF regiment to lay down better force
protection at Kandahar airfield. We will always examine what we are
doing and listen to what the field commanders are saying&#151;about
whether they need particular expertise, or strengthening in one area or
another. All that is judged on a military basis&#151;although, of
course, it must ultimately have ministerial approval&#151;so if there
is such a requirement and it can be met, it will be
met.</p><p><a name="06062258000365"><b><a name="06062258000654">Dr.

night:</p><a name="06062258000413"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;I have

President Karzai. The incident referred to is recent, and he clearly
has specific views on what should be happening. We have an
international capability, which is seeking to deliver. If more needs to
be done, let us see if more can be done.</p><p><a name="06062258000368">What we are seeking to do in
Afghanistan has been well planned, well structured and has a very clear
focus. I say again to the hon. Gentleman that if he thinks we should be
doing more, he should tell us how, and we should also set that against
his view that we are overstretched and we cannot run campaigns in two
theatres. If he wants us to do more, where does he think that will come

we seek to do. We are also constantly seeking to engage greater
international buy-in to this. That process will continue; that is part
of what NATO force generation is all about. We cannot commit other
countries; we cannot force them to do things. We can only consult our
allies and seek to get the best possible lay-down of military presence.
Also, we keep closely in touch with President Karzai; we listen to his
concerns, and if we can react, we will do
so.</p><p><a name="06062258000372"><b><a name="06062258000658">Sir

the current attempts to co-ordinate them?</p><br><notus-date day="22" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>22 Jun 2006 : Column 1497</b><br><p><a name="06062258000373"><b><a name="06062258000659">Mr.

Gentleman has sophisticated knowledge of these matters. He knows what
we are doing. We have worked successfully in the north and the west,
and we have proved that we can deliver in a particular way. We then
said, &#147;Let&#146;s look at what can now be delivered in the
south&#148;&#151;which is stage three of the development. It took a
good number of months to build up force capability and to see what to
do. We are almost fully deployed&#151;but we are not there yet.
However, we are already taking action against whatever force comes up
against us&#151;such as insurgencies inspired by the Taliban or
tribal warlords. When that has proved successful, the intention is to
move into the east.</p><p><a name="06062258000375">This has been a progressive
process, which has &#147;approvability&#148;. We are now in the
most difficult environment: the south. This stage will take time, but
difficult time scales will be set down for the military commanders to
make judgments as to when we can make the next move in the process. I
agree that what the right hon. and learned Gentleman recommends is
required, but we are not yet at the stage to do that.</p><p><a name="06062258000376">Let me now turn to broader
issues.</p><p><a name="06062258000377"><b><a name="06062258000660">Ann
Winterton (Congleton) (Con):</b> Will the Minister give
way?</p><p><a name="06062258000378"><b><a name="06062258000661">Mr.
Ingram:</b> No. The comprehensive approach
that we have adopted in both Iraq and Afghanistan guides much of the
work of the MOD. We work increasingly closely with other Departments on
a range of security issues. The conflict prevention pools and the
post-conflict reconstruction unit are major innovations in joined-up
Government. They bring together MOD, FCO and DFID resources for a more
strategic approach to conflict reduction. They integrate the
Government&#146;s conflict prevention work in a wide range of
countries. Countering the proliferation of non-conventional arms is a
good example of that and is a cross-government priority. Our work on
instruments such as the non-proliferation treaty and the chemical
weapons convention aims to eliminate certain types of weapons of mass
destruction.</p><p><a name="06062258000379">In
particular, we are actively pursuing global partnership activities in
the former Soviet Union and elsewhere. For example, I recently visited
Shchuch&#146;ye, in the Russian Urals. In Shchuch&#146;ye, the MOD,
on behalf of the UK and other international donors, has implemented
projects to enable the construction of a key chemical weapons
destruction facility. The UK&#146;s role has been to bring together
some 10 international donors, with a funding commitment of &#163;55
million, as part of a major Russian/US-led project designed to destroy
the chemical weapons stockpiles of the former Soviet Union.</p><p><a name="06062258000380">The MOD is
also actively working with other Government Departments to further the
UK&#146;s commitment to gaining international support for an arms
trade treaty, which will improve international mechanisms and reduce
the flow of irresponsibly traded conventional arms, particularly in
areas of conflict. There are too many parts of the globe from which
this illegal and evil 
<br><notus-date day="22" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>22 Jun 2006 : Column 1498</b><br>trade emanates, which is why we need renewed and better-focused
international mechanisms to deal with the
problem.</p><p><a name="06062258000381">Running
alongside that is the important role played by the MOD&#146;s defence
diplomacy initiatives, which are aimed at changing attitudes and
perceptions among emerging states and at helping the development of
democratically accountable armed forces. Our financial contribution is
in the region of &#163;50 million and covers conflict prevention and
management, as well as post-conflict reconstruction. That contribution
is made within the financial and policy framework of the global
conflict prevention pool and the defence assistance fund, and brings
together defence diplomacy and defence development work. All that is
conducted within a common strategy, and in the light of shared conflict
analysis agreed between the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, the MOD
and the Department for International Development. The programmes
delivered through this mechanism can make a real difference, whether in
sub-Saharan Africa or

is only so much that the United Kingdom can do in isolation, however.
We contribute strongly to the wider work of international agencies to
deliver change. This is why we are keen to see the UN being properly
transformed to deal with the new global challenges and threats. NATO is
also undergoing a dramatic transformation so that it, too, can respond
to the full range of global security challenges; the most prominent
example is the ISAF mission in Afghanistan. NATO continues to make a
vital contribution to ensuring stability in Kosovo.</p><p><a name="06062258000383">On the European front, the
European security and defence policy is progressing. It is proving to
be both an effective partner to NATO, and is able to act in its own
right when NATO as a whole chooses not to be engaged. It is
contributing a peace support mission in Bosnia, after taking on that
role from NATO. Of course, NATO will remain the natural choice for
operations involving both European and north American allies, and it
remains the essential basis of our collective
defence.</p><p><a name="06062258000384">The European
Union also has the potential to bring together its diplomatic, judicial
and economic strengths, alongside its ability to conduct a range of
military operations. Both the EU and NATO have the potential to play a
role in partnership, or individually, to promote world security. They
are co-operating in the Balkans&#151;in both Bosnia and
Kosovo&#151;and they are working together to support the African
Union peacekeeping mission in Darfur. NATO is playing a vital role in
Afghanistan, and the EU has helped to end the civil war in
Aceh.</p><p><a name="06062258000385"><b><a name="06062258000662">Jeremy

to another key part of our defence policy: the defence industrial
strategy. The strategy is more than just a policy document: it is a
framework for action, so that both the MOD and the UK defence industry
can develop and implement the changes that both need to make. The
Government&#146;s commitment to defence should not be in doubt. We
are working on some massive programmes: future aircraft carriers, Type
45 destroyers, new armoured fighting vehicles, Typhoon and the new
joint strike fighter, to name but a few. These and other platforms will
have long lives. In the unpredictable future that we face&#151;of
uncertain threats and new requirements&#151;we are looking at new
ways of delivering support to the front line, and at doing so in
partnership with
industry.</p><p><a name="06062258000388">The
defence industrial strategy is designed to match this new environment.
It provides greater transparency in respect of our defence
requirements, and sets out the industrial capacity that we need in the
United Kingdom to meet them. Its overall aim is to ensure that, in
future, we can provide our armed forces with the equipment that they
require. We are delivering the DIS. We announced today in a written
ministerial statement the signature of a strategic partnering
arrangement and a business transformation incentivisation agreement
with AgustaWestland&#151;an arrangement that balances opportunity and
challenge to create precisely the demanding partner relationship
envisaged by the DIS. I am also delighted to say that we have placed an
order for 70 Future Lynx helicopters with AugustaWestland. That fulfils
another DIS commitment, and will help to sustain critical skills
onshore and provide vital major equipment for our armed
forces.</p><p><a name="06062258000389"><b><a name="06062258000664">Mr.

always believe newspapers&#151;on 12 June entitled, &#147;Huge cuts
to the defence industry&#148;. It alleges that the Chancellor wishes
to take &#163;1 billion out of the defence budget per year and to
devote it to homeland security. It then suggests that one major
procurement project&#151;the Minister has just been discussing those
projects&#151;could be scrapped, such as the aircraft carriers. Can
the Minister please categorically deny
that?</p><p><a name="06062258000390"><b><a name="06062258000665">Mr.

authoritative source. I have just mentioned the aircraft carriers, our
procurement programme and the major development of the rotary wing
fleet, and more will follow on the back of that. Today&#146;s

because it does mention the new partnering arrangement. A dismissive
reference has been made to that arrangement, but it is a new
arrangement not just with AugustaWestland but across industry, the
purpose of which is to incentivise the industry and ensure that it
delivers on its commitments to the existing fleet. We are looking at
new ways of ensuring greater availability of existing platforms, and of
perhaps extending their life, to ensure that the spares required to
sustain those fleets are provided at the right time and in the right
volume. Of course, part of the overall package that we have delivered
for AugustaWestland is a future procurement stream, but it must also
deliver on the existing stream. Industry understands this&#151;we are
adopting this approach with Boeing, Rolls-Royce and BA Systems. The
hon. Member for Aldershot (Mr. Howarth), who has detailed knowledge of
these issues, would do well to spend some time studying our efforts in
this regard. If he does, he will find that there is full, not just

in Afghanistan. We have a potent force in the Apache attack
helicopters. We are up against intelligent and capable enemies, whether
in Afghanistan or Iraq, and we know that they will continue to look for
ways to attack land-based vehicles or air-based platforms. We have a
lot of measures in place. The hon. Lady will understand that it is not
appropriate to discuss all the detail, but where we identify a
threat&#151;be it a new or technological threat&#151;we identify a
quick way to deal with it. Sometimes that takes time as we come to
understand the threat before developing the technical response. Our
focus at all times is the protection of our personnel, whether it
involves fixed-wing aircraft, helicopters, land-based systems or
maritime
systems.</p><p><a name="06062269000013">I
want to deal with the future of our Trident nuclear deterrent. It is
worth reminding the House that when the Government came to power we
initiated a range of changes to our nuclear weapons profile. The UK has
an excellent record in meeting our international legal obligations. We
have withdrawn and dismantled the RAF's air-launched WE177 nuclear bomb
without replacement, so that Trident is our only nuclear weapons
system. We have dismantled all our remaining Chevaline

reductions in the UK's nuclear weapons. We have reduced our
operationally available stockpile of nuclear weapons to fewer than 200
warheads&#151;a 70 per cent. reduction in the potential explosive
power of our nuclear forces since the end of the cold war. We have
reduced the readiness of our nuclear forces: only one Trident submarine
at a time is on deterrent patrol, carrying 48 warheads, compared with a
previously planned total of 96, on several days' "notice to fire", and
its missiles are de-targeted. We have signed and ratified the
comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty. We have also continued to press
for negotiations without preconditions, to begin at the conference on
disarmament in Geneva, of a fissile material cut-off
treaty.</p><p><a name="06062269000014">At
the last election, we stood on a manifesto commitment clearly stating
that we intended to retain this country's current independent nuclear
deterrent. That commitment remains. We sent an initial memorandum to

currently have no requirement for a new nuclear warhead, nor do we have
a programme in place to develop a new nuclear warhead. We did, however,

Establishment, the purpose of which was to put in place a programme to
ensure that our current Trident warhead remains both safe and
reliable.</p><p><a name="06062269000018">We have made
it clear that decisions on the future of the UK's nuclear deterrent are
necessary in the current Parliament. As a consequence, work is under
way by officials on risks, threats, options and costs in order to
prepare the ground for eventual decisions to be taken by Ministers. It
remains the case that no decisions have yet been taken in principle or
detail on any replacement for Trident. I stress that any decisions that
may be taken on the future of the UK's nuclear deterrent will be fully
consistent with our international legal obligations, including those
under the nuclear non-proliferation
treaty.</p><p><a name="06062269000019">On
the role of Parliament in this process, the Prime Minister has
repeatedly promised&#151;most recently yesterday at Prime

of a Government policy to abandon the existing Trident system. The
question is not whether they intend to retain it, but whether they
intend to replace it. Last night, the Chancellor of the Exchequer said
that he would support the retention of our independent deterrent in the
long-term. That has been interpreted as meaning replacement, which is
why it is on the front pages of the press. Have the Government decided
to replace the nuclear deterrent? If they have not, does he think that

personnel.</p><p><a name="06062269000045">We
recognise that our people remain our greatest asset, and we are doing
our utmost to implement policy that will provide our service personnel
with conditions and services that help to generate and maintain
battle-winning defence capability. Among the wide range of projects and
initiatives under way, I shall mention two in the context of the
debate: improvements in training and accommodation for our
people.</p><p><a name="06062269000046">The
defence training review rationalisation programme aims to provide
modern, cost-effective specialist training, improved facilities and
accommodation and significant savings through the more efficient
utilisation of a reduced training estate. That will give our servicemen
and women the best living and learning environment that we can provide,
and we expect to announce preferred bidders later this
year.</p><p><a name="06062269000047">The importance
we attach to our personnel is also reflected in the investment we are
making in modernising the defence estate across the country. In
Colchester, the modernisation programme will enable us to move more
than 2,000 service personnel from their current cramped and inadequate
living accommodation to state-of-the-art, single occupancy, en-suite
accommodation fit for the 21st century. It will 
<br><notus-date day="22" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>22 Jun 2006 : Column 1506</b><br>also provide exemplary social and working conditions for personnel
across the garrison.</p><p><a name="06062269000048"><b><a name="06062269000593">Bob
Russell:</b> The Minister is describing a private finance
initiative project. Will there be accommodation in the new garrison for
every serving
soldier?</p><p><a name="06062269000049"><b><a name="06062269000594">Mr.
Ingram:</b> Not in the whole British Army. The figure I
mentioned was 2,000. I realise that the hon. Gentleman is a strong
supporter of the project, but as I do not know the basis for his
question I cannot give him a specific answer. If I can find out the
answer before the wind-ups, I will let him know. It is a major project
and he has taken a close interest in it. I was proud to cut the first
sod&#151;</p><p><a name="06062269000050"><b><a name="06062269000595">Bob

me.</p><p><a name="06062269000051"><b><a name="06062269000596">Mr.
Ingram:</b> I will not even go there. It was great to see the
project and the enthusiasm of everyone associated with it. The private
contractors and our own people&#151;both civilian and
military&#151;are keen for it to
succeed.</p><p><a name="06062269000052">I
want now to touch on future policy and to address our long-term
strategic defence posture. Our investment decisions are measured in
decades ahead, rather than individual years, and we need to get them
right. The debate is an opportunity for the House to consider the
challenges of the longer term, and to understand how the Ministry of
Defence is looking at them. The primary responsibility of any
Government must be to provide security for its citizens, but we also
have a global responsibility to defend international stability. It is
in the UK&#146;s interest to act internationally to bring about a
peaceful and prosperous world.</p><p><a name="06062269000053">Our prosperity rests upon
globalisation and we need, as a nation, to remain engaged in its
development to ensure both our security and success. Our armed forces
are a key asset for achieving that. Their quality and reputation are
second to none. Their capabilities allow us and, often, international
organisations, such as the UN, the EU and NATO, to respond to threats
and to support an international system based on human rights, good
governance, democracy, civil and political liberties and free
trade.</p><p><a name="06062269000054">As the House
will agree, no nation can be the world&#146;s policeman, and that
applies equally to the UK. However, we will continue to act where it is
right to do so. The British people expect nothing less. That is why we
have to adapt in good time to the trends that we identify both at home
and around the world. We do not expect that purely national and
military solutions will be adequate. Armed forces cannot act alone to
maintain international stability. As I have indicated, we recognise
that the major security challenges of this century will require joint,
integrated and multinational solutions. UK policy needs to be based
upon putting to good use the resources and expertise of different
Departments in the UK, and different nations across the world. We will
continue to build on our alliances, working together with the
international community in Iraq, Afghanistan, the Balkans and Africa.
It seems to me that public debate tends to focus on the British and
American roles only, but we must not ignore the vital contributions of
our allies and partners.</p><br><notus-date day="22" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>22 Jun 2006 : Column 1507</b><br><p><a name="06062269000055">The success of
our British military contributions has derived from expeditionary
forces whose structure and capabilities provide speed, agility,
deployability and the ability to conduct a range of tasks. Those
capabilities, which make the UK armed forces almost unique, are
possible only because of commitment to professional excellence and
sustained investment to deliver whatis required in
today&#146;s&#151;and tomorrow&#146;s&#151;security
environment.</p><p><a name="06062269000056">All that
brings me to the longer-term policy question of the future strategic
context. Globalisation is driving unprecedented growth and prosperity
across the world. Increasing cross-border flows of resources, goods,
services and people will spread values and ideas. We can expect greater
wealth, lowered cultural and ideological barriers and widening
freedoms. All that could be suggestive of a 21st century world where
conflict between nation states would be a rarity, unlike the terrible
wars and traumas of the 20th century. However, as we move into the 21st
century, we see the beginning of profound changes to the strategic
environment. There is the speed with which powerful forces are
developing, the range of unpredictable ways in which they could
interact, and the vulnerability of an increasingly interdependent
international system to physical, economic or political
shocks&#151;all those things breed uncertainty.</p><p><a name="06062269000057">Key security
challenges for the future will include the familiar&#151;weak and
failing states, the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and
global terrorism&#151;but we also need to consider the potential
security consequences of climate change, rapidly growing pressures on
natural resources, accelerating technological change, and the social,
cultural and geopolitical challenges that will accompany the rise of
Asia and other emerging powers. It is not possible to predict how those
and many other factors will interact, but it is right to acknowledge
that not all of the potential futures are benign and that conflict
within and between states will not disappear. Weak states will continue
to face severe pressures. Extremist ideologies will still find breeding
grounds among those who believe that they are not gaining from rapid
change. Even a return to confrontation between major states or blocs
cannot be ruled out.</p><p><a name="06062269000058">British Governments, like the
entire international community, will continue to have to work hard to
promote security and success in that challenging future environment. We
need to consider systematically how our armed forces can strengthen the
UK&#146;s ability to act, to influence the international management
of crises and to respond to unforeseen events. Later this year, the
Ministry of Defence will publish a paper on the future strategic
context for defence. It will offer an analysis of the future strategic
environment and its implications and, I hope, improve understanding of
the issues and the key questions to be decided.</p><p><a name="06062269000059">Painstaking analysis of
security challenges helps to maintain the vital continuous
understanding among service people of how they fit into overall policy,
which I mentioned at the beginning of my contribution. It also helps us
to continue to give our people the right tools, by investing in the
highest priority programmes. Beyond the services, in a democracy such
as ours, major decisions require an informed public discussion. 
<br><notus-date day="22" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>22 Jun 2006 : Column 1508</b><br>I hope that today&#146;s debate will contribute substantially to that
process and I look forward to hearing the contributions from both sides

pm</h5><p><a name="06062269000060"><b><a name="06062269000597">Dr.
Liam Fox (Woodspring) (Con):</b> Let me start with a quote
from 1997:</p><a name="06062269000501"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;A
strong defence capability is an essential part of Britain&#146;s
foreign policy...By 1999 defence spending will have fallen
to2.6 per cent. of GDP...The people who have had to bear
the burden of these cuts are our servicemen and women, overstretched
and under strength as never before. The strain on our Armed Forces is
huge. We have a continuing commitment in Northern Ireland. Our forces
operate in the Gulf, the Balkans, Africa, the Falklands, Cyprus, Hong
Kong, Gibraltar, Germany and other parts of the world all at
once.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06062269000061">That was our Prime
Minister in full pre-election flow. What have we seen from the
Government he brought to office? The answer is further commitments in
Sierra Leone, Iraq and Afghanistan, and cuts in our armed forces of
almost 40,000. The Army is down 9,000, the Navy is down 10,000 and the
RAF is down 16,000 since the Government came into office. This year we
will spend only 2.2 per cent. of our GDP on defence&#151;the smallest
proportion of our national wealth that we have spent on defending our
country in any year since 1930. So much for the overstretch that the
Prime Minister described when he was in opposition.</p>

<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060622/debtext/60622-0631.htm"/>


<p><a name="06062269000062">That level of defence
expenditure is supposed to provide for, at most, no more than one
small-scale operation and two medium-scale operations at any time.
However, since 1999, British armed forces have been operating over and
above the Government&#146;s own planning assumptions in every year
but one. The Chancellor and the Secretary of State for Defence, the
former Chief Secretary to the Treasury, have trimmed the available
resources time and time again&#151;at the same time as the Government
have been asking our soldiers to do more and more. For example, the gap
between deployments for infantry units had dropped to 15 months, when
it is supposed to be a minimum of24 months, increasing the
stress placed not only on our servicemen and women, but on their
families&#151;something that is not sufficiently taken into account.
As a consequence, there is a rising divorce rate among service
personnel.</p><p><a name="06062269000063">There are
serious capability gaps now, and more looming in the immediate future.
Only 40 per cent. of the Lynx and Gazelle helicopter fleet is fit for
purpose&#151;as is only 40 per cent. of the C-130K Hercules fleet. At
times, we have had so few aircraft that soldiers have been left sitting
on the tarmac in Basra because there have been no planes to fly them
back home. This March saw the withdrawal of the F/A2 Sea Harriers,
leaving the maritime fleet without air defence. As Ministers openly
acknowledge, we shall be reliant on the United States for air defence
of the fleet until the Type 45s, with their air defence role, enter
service around 2009. These will be followed by the new carriers, with
their joint strike fighters, which are due to enter
service&#151;well, we do not know exactly when they will be entering
service. Perhaps the Minister could enlighten
us.</p><p><a name="06062269000064"><b><a name="06062269000598">Mr.
Ingram:</b> The hon. Gentleman has missed
the full explanation on the Sea Harriers. This keeps being raised. 
<br><notus-date day="22" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>22 Jun 2006 : Column 1509</b><br>The background is that to have upgraded the Sea Harriers would have cost
in the region of &#163;500 million. The process would have been
technically difficult and there was no guarantee of success; in fact,
it was so technically difficult that it could have meant a delay in the
aircraft flying. Against those criteria, the judgment was made not to
proceed. That was done on the basis of military advice:
&#147;Don&#146;t spend the money on something you can&#146;t get
a guaranteed return for.&#148; Clearly, however, the old spendthrift
ways of the Tories are still there. That is why we have such a big
headache in defence in relation to some of the legacy
programmes.</p><p><a name="06062269000065"><b><a name="06062269000599">Dr.
Fox:</b> As ever, the Government, having been in office for
nine years, can find nothing better to do than blame their predecessors
for the problems that they themselves have brought in. Many in the
military believe that the Sea Harriers could have been kept flying
without a change in engine for some time yet, but the Government have
chosen instead to leave that gap in our services and to leave us
dependent on the United States. I am keen on our partnership with the
United States, but we are talking about a Government whose members kept
telling us when they were in opposition that there was overstretch and
underfunding and that gaps were being left. Since they came into
office, we have had greater commitments, insufficient funding and
greater
gaps.</p><p><a name="06062269000066"><b><a name="06062269000600">Mr.
Ellwood:</b> However the Minister dresses it up, there remains
a fundamental gap in our air defences. Even when the T45 is rolled out,
it will still have only a limited radar capability to the horizon. The
only way in which we are going to protect our fleet is by having either
Sea Harriers or the F-35, which has the radar capability. However the
Minister dresses it up, our sea fleet will be vulnerable until the
aeroplanes are replaced.</p><p><a name="06062269000067"><b><a name="06062269000601">Dr.
Fox:</b> My hon. Friend is not only knowledgeable, but has a
regular discourse with the Minister in Westminster Hall. That sounds
like a good attempt to make sure that we keep that discourse going.
Since my hon. Friend has been getting by far the best of the debate, I
am sure that he can look forward to that.</p><p><a name="06062269000068">The Public
Accounts Committee reported recently that on average, 30 per cent. of
the UK armed forces had serious weaknesses in their peacetime readiness
levels between January and September 2005. Our armed forces are already
experiencing serious gaps in their capabilities, and as major projects
such as the carriers and the future rapid effect system continue to
fall back, the effect of those gaps will become more acute.</p><p><a name="06062269000069">That brings me on to a second
type of capability gap, which occurs when a capability is cut back to
such an extent that it is no longer able to fulfil the role that is
required of it. For example, there were originally meant to be 12 Type
45s. The number was cut down to eight, and the Government have failed
to give a commitment on the final two ships, which would leave the Navy
with six. That is the case before we get on to the ludicrous prospect
of reducing our purchase of aircraft carriers, as has been rumoured,
from two to one, to address budgetary
shortfalls<i> &#151;[</i><i> Interruption.</i><i> ]</i> If the Minister
wishes to confirm that we will be having two not one, I will happily
give way to him.</p><br><notus-date day="22" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>22 Jun 2006 : Column 1510</b><br><p><a name="06062269000070"><b><a name="06062269000602">Mr.
Ingram:</b> I think that I set out our future programme:
future carriers&#151;plural&#151;the Type 45s, land systems and air
systems. The programme is substantial. There was the biggest increase
in defence spending for 20 years in the last spending round, so let us
get back to the
facts.</p><p><a name="06062269000071"><b><a name="06062269000603">Dr.
Fox:</b> And let us get back to the spin from the Treasury.
Not content with confusing the Government over their nuclear programme,
the Treasury has been happily briefing that it wants the proportion
that we spend on defence to be brought down from 2.2 per cent. of GDP
and that major cuts might have to be introduced. Perhaps it would be
worth while for the Cabinet to meet now and again to discuss some of
these issues, so that we could get less confusion from two different
wings of the
Government.</p><p><a name="06062269000072"><b><a name="06062269000604">Mr.
James Arbuthnot (North-East Hampshire) (Con):</b> Will my hon.
Friend bear in mind what the Minister just said about the increase in
defence expenditure? If a Government reduce spending on defence
dramatically on coming into office, they can of course introduce the
largest percentage increase in defence expenditure on the bit that they
previously cut; that is not a difficult thing to
do.</p><p><a name="06062269000073"><b><a name="06062269000605">Dr.
Fox:</b> Obviously, my right hon. Friend has
studiously worked out how Labour&#146;s arithmetic is calculated and
how the process of spin, which the Government have improved as a black
art, can make something turn out to mean anything that anyone wants.
The truth of the matter is that it is impossible for any Government to
increase the number of commitments for our armed forces without equally
increasing the resources that enable them to do their job properly.
Without such resources, we get unacceptable cuts and a lack of
capacity.</p><p><a name="06062269000074"><b><a name="06062269000606">Mr.
Jenkins: </b>Will the hon. Gentleman give
way?</p><p><a name="06062269000075"><b><a name="06062269000607">Dr.
Fox:</b> I will give way to the hon. Gentleman in a
moment.</p><p><a name="06062269000076">Let me turn to
the situation in Iraq. Many people see the deteriorating security
situation in Iraq and claim that that in itself is an argument that the
war in Iraq was wrong. I do not believe that. I still believe that it
was right to want people to determine for themselves who would govern
them. It was right to help people to enjoy free speech and a legal
framework that they could design, which we take for granted in this
country. It was right to free those people from a vicious and bloody
tyrant who used chemical weapons against his own people. It has to be a
good thing that we saw the end of a regime that had started two wars
and was almost certainly sanctions busting and attempting to gain
nuclear technology. Frankly, those who take a contrary view need to
explain why Iraq, the middle east and the rest of the world would be
better off with Saddam still in
control.</p><p><a name="06062269000077">Like everyone
else in the Chamber, I believe, I want our troops to come home as soon
as possible&#151;but that can happen only when we are confident that
the Iraq that we leave behind is a functioning stable nation. I
purposely do not use simply the words &#147;a functioning
democracy&#148;. Far too many people take the simplistic 
<br><notus-date day="22" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>22 Jun 2006 : Column 1511</b><br>view that democracy simply means an exercise in electoral mechanics. It
took us in this country 200 years to get from Adam Smith to universal
suffrage. We are a liberal democracy, but we were liberal before we
were democratic. We had a set of liberal values, a judicial system that
applied equally to the governing and the governed, a respect for human
rights, and the ability to own property and to exercise our individual
liberty in a market system. All those things are necessary for a
functional stable state. Being a democracy is not enough, as Gaza has
all too clearly demonstrated. We need to take that into account when
people consider the expectations of what can be achieved in Iraq and
when they are likely to be
achieved.</p><p><a name="06062269000078"><b><a name="06062269000608">Harry
Cohen (Leyton and Wanstead) (Lab):</b> The hon. Gentleman has
blown his own argument out of the water in a few sentences. First he
says that what happened was about democracy&#151;not about weapons of
mass destruction, incidentally, which was what the Tories and the
Government were saying at the time&#151;but then he says that it was
not about democracy. His argument is a bit
inconsistent.</p><p><a name="06062269000079">Does
the hon. Gentleman not realise that in a whole number of ways&#151;if
I catch your eye, Mr. Deputy Speaker, I will put them on
record&#151;it is worse for the population of Iraq now, under the
occupation, than it was under Saddam Hussein? I am no supporter of
Saddam Hussein; I am pleased that he has gone. However, the hon.
Gentleman should see that his argument would lead to occupations all
round the world, because there are plenty of Saddam Husseins in other
places.</p><p><a name="06062269000080"><b><a name="06062269000609"></b>Dr.
Fox: I was making the point&#151;although not sufficiently
clearly for the hon. Gentleman&#151;that a stable and sustainable
state is made up not simply by democracy, but by other elements. I can
only explain the argument to the hon. Gentleman; I cannot understand it
for him.</p><p><a name="06062269000081">Post-war
mistakes have clearly had several consequences, so we should accept
what they were. Both the British and American Governments failed to
plan successfully for the aftermath of the war. My right hon. and
learned Friend the Member for Devizes (Mr. Ancram) said time and time
again in the Chamber that although winning the war would be the easy
part, given the overwhelming firepower, the difficult part would be the
reconstruction. The Iraqi police and army were disbanded far too soon,
and I am afraid that the insufficient deployment of troops at the
outset has led to a situation in Iraq that means we are likely to be
there longer, and in more difficult circumstances, than might otherwise
have been the case.</p><p><a name="06062269000082">In
recent days, both Japanese and Italian troops have withdrawn from the
theatre of operations. The handover of al-Muthanna province to the
Iraqi authorities is a development to be welcomed, but that does not
mean that there is not still much to be done. Only this week the chief
of joint operations made it clear that it would be some time before an
area such as Basra could be handed over, although many of us already
took that for granted. The Minister himself admitted that things had
become worse, in that soldiers were in body armour rather than soft
hats when he last visited. Intra-factional fighting in Basra is on the 
<br><notus-date day="22" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>22 Jun 2006 : Column 1512</b><br>increase, and the Iraqi Prime Minister&#146;s declaration of a state
of emergency is a testament to that.</p><p><a name="06062269000083">I
hope that we will hear the answers to several unanswered questions at
the end of the debate. How prevalent are the militias on the streets of
Basra? Given the extent of the overstretch, how do the Government
intend to deal with any upsurge of violence in Basra, alongside the
increased involvement of Afghan forces that has been announced today?
How are the Government dealing with the shortfall in the availability
of Lynx helicopters? What are we doing to ensure that the basic rights
of Iraqis are protected in the areas that we control and for which we
are responsible? In particular, what guarantees can we give that Sunnis
will not be systematically intimidated and that women will not be
oppressed by fundamentalist groups, reports of which are increasingly
appearing in our press on an almost daily
basis?</p><p><a name="06062269000084"><b><a name="06062269000610">Bob
Russell:</b> When the Conservatives supported the Iraq
invasion, did the hon. Gentleman and his colleagues also put forward
the challenging questions about the post-war reconstruction that he is
now
asking?</p><p><a name="06062269000085"><b><a name="06062269000611">Dr.
Fox:</b> If the hon. Gentleman had been
listening, or if he took an interest in what is recorded in
<i> Hansard</i>, he would know that my right hon. and learned Friend the
Member for Devizes laid out our reservations on several occasions
during that time. Unlike my right hon. and learned Friend, I was
chairman of the party at the time, not the shadow Foreign
Secretary&#151;these things matter when one is in the official
Opposition. It is clearly on record that we laid out our reservations
and what we thought that the consequences of several mistakes that we
outlined would be. I wish that my right hon. and learned Friend had
been wrong, but he was right about many of the things of which he
warned. When we took the decision to back the Government, we set out
plenty of caveats, which are there for the hon. Member for Colchester
(Bob Russell) to read whenever he
wants.</p><p><a name="06062269000086">One
aspect of our deployment to Iraq is not mentioned very often. What we
are doing there is not simply a matter of grand geopolitical and
military strategy. There is a human cost, not merely to Iraqi citizens,
but among our serving British soldiers. According to parliamentary
written answers obtained by my hon. Friend the Member for Ludlow (Mr.
Dunne), 732 service personnel have been aero-evacuated from Iraq.
Almost one in 10 of those were diagnosed with some sort of mental
health problem. That is a fairly shocking figure, but after returning
from deployment a further 727 soldiers have sought treatment from the
MOD&#146;s community mental health departments, which raises the
question of how many soldiers there are out there who do not know where
to turn for help.</p><p><a name="06062269000087">It
is a matter of the utmost importance that those who risk life and limb
in our name are given the health facilities that they require. I hope
the Minister willgive a commitment to find out whether
sufficient information is available, so that those returning know where
to go for help, the help they get is appropriate to their service
background, and they are not simply treated in a civilian mental health
institution, which may not understand the effects of trauma in a
military setting.</p><br><notus-date day="22" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>22 Jun 2006 : Column 1513</b><br><p><a name="06062269000088">I turn to the other great
deployment&#151;that in Afghanistan, which also remains essential in
the wider regional strategic context. As I have said before, while we
could not have failed to act, we must not act and fail. The
consequences of failure would be calamitous. A failed state would
re-emerge, our enemies would be emboldened, and the hills and valleys
of Afghanistan would once more become incubators of global
terror.</p><p><a name="06062269000089">As a knock-on
effect, Pakistan, already a nuclear state, could become destabilised.
NATO&#146;s reputation would be sullied by one of its first
out-of-area operations, with the consequent dangers that the wider NATO
membership could restrict operations to the Euro-Atlantic zone in the
future. A loss of nerve within NATO, the emboldening of our enemies and
the denial to the people of Afghanistan of a better way of life is not
a legacy that Britain could or should
contemplate.</p><p><a name="06062269000090">It is a
source of great worry to many within and outside the military that our
deployment may be under strength for the many and varied tasks assigned
to it. Despite there being some 10,000 NATO troops in Afghanistan under
ISAF command, we still do not have enough support or troops to cover
the entirety of the areas of responsibility in the three regions that
NATO is supposed to be covering. There is excessive duplication of
logistics provision in particular, especially with regard to troop
movement. NATO needs to co-ordinate this aspect far more than it is
currently doing. With 71 separate caveats among more than 30
contributing nations, the effectiveness of ISAF is bound to be
compromised.</p><p><a name="06062269000091">We are
asking our troops to patrol one of the most dangerous provinces in one
of the most dangerous countries in the world, yet we often lack the
manpower and lift capacity to guarantee success. In particular, ISAF
still lacks a reserve quick response force to deal with sudden
incidents, such as when the Norwegians came under attack last
February.</p><p><a name="06062269000092">We
must acknowledge success when it occurs. Although there has been good
progress in the training of the Afghan army, training for the Afghan
police, the prime responsibility of the Germans, is at least two years
behind schedule, yet the police are crucial stakeholders in the efforts
of the peace and reconstruction teams and those helping to rebuild
Afghan civil
society.</p><p><a name="06062269000093">It
is worth pointing out that there are still major incompatibility issues
regarding the equipment of the major participating countries,
particularly radios and frequencies. Most disturbing is the failure to
agree to universal use of Blue Force Tracker, a system to allow HQs to
follow all NATO forces via SatNav, down to an individual vehicle. The
system is being used in Helmand, but the French and other countries
refuse to use it, preferring to wait for a rival system built by
Thales, which has yet to come off the shelf. That is not an acceptable
position for the NATO operation to be
in.</p><p><a name="06062269000094">The role of the
police has also become enmeshed in the wider strategic mismatch and
confusion of roles, of which many have spoken. The Afghan police are
not so much a national force, in the way that we would understand it,
as a large number of independent semi-militias. The border goes
unpatrolled, drug trafficking continues, and it is an open question to
what extent the police militias overlap with the forces of the warlords
and/or Taliban. The UN and other NGOs have withdrawn from Helmand,
claiming it is 
<br><notus-date day="22" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>22 Jun 2006 : Column 1514</b><br>too dangerous. I raise these points, and they all matter, because we are
in danger of losing the hearts and minds war among the local
population, which is so crucial to the success of the overall
mission.</p><p><a name="06062269000095">At the same
time as we face these logistical problems, the poppy eradication
projects have brought warlords and Taliban into coalescence on many
occasions. To varying degrees we are seeing what NATO calls
Talibanisation, where the Taliban pay local people for one-off strikes
against NATO forces. Given the amount of money involved, funded by the
drug trade, these incidents are, sadly, on the increase, as President
Karzai noted today.</p><p><a name="06062269000096">I
raise all these matters because there is still time to do something
about them. Our troops are committed, they are brave and intuitive, and
they will do almost whatever we ask of them, with whatever we give
them. But we need to ensure that they are given all that they need to
carry out the task demanded of them&#151;no shortcuts, no shortages.
The Government have a twin duty&#151;to maximise the success of the
mission, and at the same time to minimise the risk to our troops. We
strongly support British participation in the war on terror in
Afghanistan, as it is strategically in our national interest and our
membership of NATO commits us to it. However, it is questionable
whether our security footprint is large enough to achieve the goals
identified, in anything like the time scale envisaged. Having acted, we
absolutely cannot afford to
fail.</p><p><a name="06062269000097">Let me deal with
the issue that has dominated the newspapers and media coverage
today&#151;our nuclear deterrent. While North Korea threatens missile
tests and there is the continuing stand-off with Iran, and when we
cannot predict what new threats we may face by 2025, we cannot afford
to leave ourselves exposed and vulnerable. Given such uncertainty, it
is a strategic imperative that we replace our nuclear deterrent when
the time comes. I remain to be convinced that any alternative to a
submarine-based system is a credible option, but it is still an issue
that we will consider in our policy
review.</p><p><a name="06062269000098">All history
tells us that the outbreak of conflicts is seldom accurately
anticipated. The onus must therefore be on the nuclear abolitionist,
not on the believer in deterrence, to explain why one can be confident
that no nuclear or major chemical or biological threat will be posed to
the United Kingdom during the long period so far ahead. I doubt if any
such explanation will carry much
conviction.</p><p><a name="06062269000099">The
identification of a potential enemy once shaped the nature of our armed
forces&#151;the two power standard for the Navy, for example. With
our nuclear deterrent, we enjoy a much greater degree of versatility.
Intercontinental ballistic missiles such as Tridentare
sufficiently flexible, given their range and invulnerability, to deter
any state that may seek to use, or threaten the United Kingdom with,
weapons of mass destruction at any time in the future. In short, it
would not matter which potential enemy posed a real threat. Each would
face unacceptable retaliation from a modern strategic missile system
such as
Trident.</p><p><a name="06062269000100"><b><a name="06062269000612">Daniel

When we have deliberations in the House about the 
<br><notus-date day="22" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>22 Jun 2006 : Column 1515</b><br>replacement for Trident, does my hon. Friend agree that Members of

or one predominantly made in the United
Kingdom?</p><p><a name="06062269000101"><b><a name="06062269000613">Dr.
Fox:</b> If my hon. Friend will have a little patience, I will
shortly come to the process by which that should occur. Let me say one
final thing about the policy of deterrence. The versatility of a policy
of minimum strategic nuclear deterrence makes up for our inability to
anticipate future enemies or predict future threats. Conversely, any
decision to deprive ourselves of the deterrent would leave the country
open to future aggressors whom we would be able to identify only when
it was too late to try and rebuild our nuclear forces that had been so
recklessly
discarded.</p><p><a name="06062269000102">Needless to
say, any attempt to reacquire a nuclear deterrent once a threat began
to emerge would immediately generate a storm of political protest, on
the basis that it would constitute a new arms race and make a tense
situation even more febrile. We must act now on principle, because
those are powerful and substantive arguments, but the way in which they
have been handled in the past few days by the Government s
nothing short of disgraceful. Instead of an announcement to Parliament
about the Government&#146;s intention, there was a one-line mention
in an after-dinner speech, not by the Prime Minister or the Defence
Secretary but by the Chancellor of the Exchequer. The commitment itself
is not clear&#151;is it a commitment in principle or in practice?
Will it retain or replace the existing deterrent?</p><p><a name="06062269000103">The Minister said that a
decision to replace Trident has not been made &#147;in
principle&#148;, yet the newspapers are full of stories saying that
the Chancellor&#146;s people have briefed that a decision has been
made and that the Treasury will spend the money. The Chancellor, as the
Prime Minister in waiting, will oversee a new generation of nuclear
deterrence for the United Kingdom. If those newspaper reports are
wrong, if all those Treasury briefings did not take place, and if a
decision has not been made about the principle of replacing Trident,
when will the Chancellor publicly disown everything that has been said
in his name in the past 24 hours? This is a vital issue, so it is
utterly unacceptable that power politics should be at play in the
Cabinet, as the national interest must be put first.</p><p><a name="06062269000104">The place to debate major
issues is the House of Commons, and we must debate the principle and
practicalities of action on our nuclear deterrent. However, we must do
more than debate, as the House deserves a vote on those important
issues. If the Government do not allow the House the opportunity to
vote, the Conservative party will certainly ensure that all hon.
Members are given a vote on an issue of enormous importance to the
country.</p><p><a name="06062269000105">We will back
the Government when they act in the national interest, but the
professionalism of our servicemen and women stands in sharp contrast to
the Government&#146;s increasingly shambolic amateurism. What sort of
Government, for example, arrange a defence debate, in their own time,
knowing that the 
<br><notus-date day="22" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>22 Jun 2006 : Column 1516</b><br>Secretary of State cannot attend? Those who serve our country deserve so

Cohen (Leyton and Wanstead) (Lab):</b> I want to speak about
Afghanistan and Somalia, but principally about Iraq.</p><p><a name="06062269000108">In
Afghanistan, not enough aid was provided to lift and stabilise that
war-torn country after the initial takeover from the Taliban. We took
our eye off the ball when we invaded Iraq, so vital time and good will
were lost. Other forces are at work. Drugs are a driving force for
lawlessness and the resurgence of the Taliban, which is backed by
shadowy forces, probably from Pakistan or Iran and perhaps the
countries of the former Soviet Union that have an interest in
destabilising the foreign occupation of Afghanistan. That demonstrates
the limit of defence operations. We cannot occupy north-west Pakistan,
or go to war with Iran in support of our activity in Afghanistan, so we
must find other routes to achieve our goals, for example, by working
constructively with the United Nations and neighbouring countries. Our
aim should be to stabilise democratic governance, with an ensuing
reduction in drug production, which cannot be achieved peaceably
without tackling the security situation. Killing every member of the
Taliban is not possible, and trying to do so causes civilian casualties
and acts as a recruiting sergeant. I do not want the Taliban to return,
but we must be more politically proactive to incorporate moderate
Taliban sympathisers into the political process. If we are to do our
job in Afghanistan, the American troops should go, as their roaming,
killing role is not helpful and creates a climate of danger for our
troops. The exit of the American troops would be a sign that the
fighting should be brought to an end. There should be another push to
boost aid and the institutions of civil society, as Hamid Karzai
suggested today.</p><p><a name="06062269000109">In
Somalia, the Americans backed the wrong group when it chose to support
unpopular warlords. The popular Islamic Court Union is in the process
of coming to power and can unify the Somali people for the time being,
while the warlords cannot. America has encouraged the UN and the UK to
back the wrong horse and the position has been made worse by President
Bush&#146;s crude strategy of &#147;for or against us&#148;,
which means that Muslim groups that attain power are automatically
assumed to be supporters of al-Qaeda. We have worked constructively
with Muslim Governments all over the world&#151;for example, in Saudi
Arabia and Turkey&#151;so we can do so in Somalia, too.</p><p><a name="06062269000110">We must acknowledge that we
backed the wrong horse and start to engage properly and effectively
with Somalia to achieve stability. We should not back Ethiopia&#146;s
efforts to spread the conflict throughout the region, as that would be
detrimental for the people of both countries, leading to more poverty
and death, and an increase in the number of asylum seekers. We should
not become embroiled in such a conflict, because the 
<br><notus-date day="22" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>22 Jun 2006 : Column 1517</b><br>hon. Member for Woodspring (Dr. Fox) was right that failed states and
ongoing conflict offer the best opportunities for al-Qaeda to operate
and recruit. We should therefore encourage stability in countries such
as Somalia.</p><p><a name="06062269000111">Turning to
Iraq, on which I wish to concentrate, the weekly magazine,
<i> Tribune</i>, published a &#147;world cup&#148; of the worst
human rights abusers. It was a very good article and the final was a
high-scoring draw between Iran and the United States, which keeps
thousands of individuals in custody without charge in Iraq,
Afghanistan and Guantanamo Bay. It conducts rendition to undisclosed
locations and is guilty of torture at Abu Ghraib, as well as atrocities
and abuses, including the mass killing of civilians. The US is our
coalition partner and our Government offer apologia and gentle rebukes
for such activity&#151;for example, they refer to atrocities as
&#147;unfortunate incidents&#148; or say that such matters are
&#147;their responsibility, not ours.&#148; I strongly believe that
joint and several liability applies, because we are part of a
multinational force. The Government claimed credit for Saddam
Hussein&#146;s fall, even though it was mainly achieved by US troops,
so we should share the blame for US wrongdoing. A UK general is
second-in-command of the coalition forces in Baghdad, and we share
overall responsibility, whether or not we make representations, which
are often ignored. In my opinion, the UK should have been in the
semi-final of <i> Tribune</i>&#146;s world cup human rights abusers,
given its role in Iraq.</p><p><a name="06062269000112"><b><a name="06062269000616">Bob

which they operate. It is the political decision making that sent them
to Iraq of which I am fiercely critical.</p><p><a name="06062269000114">We have also been hostile to
Iran and Syria, which are neighbours of Afghanistan. In a private
sitting of the Defence Committee, the Minister of State discussed
Iran&#146;s alleged role in Iraq and the death of British soldiers,
although I suspect that he had very little evidence. Extending the war
to Iran should not be an option, so we need to obtain better relations
for mutual security. Threats, hostility and covert tit-for-tat killings
are not the way forward.</p>

<p><a name="06062269000115">I want to use
this debate to raise some difficult human rights issues. Mr. Abdul
Razzaq Ali al-Jedda is a joint British and Iraqi citizen on whose
behalf Amnesty International has been making representations. Amnesty
is concerned that, even after months of internment, the multinational
force is continuing to hold internees without providing them or their
legal counsel with substantive evidence to justify their detention. Mr.
al-Jedda has been detained since his arrest on 10 October 2004 in
Baghdad. He filed a case against the UK Secretary of State for Defence
challenging his internment in Iraq

imperative reasons of security, the claimant has not been charged with
any offence; and the Secretary of State acknowledges that, as matters
stand, there is insufficient material available which could be used in

therefore detained simply on a preventive basis.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06062269000116">Mr. al-Jedda continues to be
held without charge or trial by UK forces. When I tabled a written
question on the matter, the reply
stated:</p><a name="06062269000503"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Mr.
al-Jedda is being detained by the British contingent of the
Multi-National Force in Iraq for imperative reasons of security under

Council&#148;.&#151;[<i> Official Report</i>, 25 May 2006; Vol.

be a dangerous man&#151;I do not know&#151;but there should be a
proper process of law, including charges and evidence. That man is a
British citizen who is being held by British forces under a secretive
process, which is not satisfactory. The Government should deal with the
case properly.</p><p><a name="06062269000118">Then
there is the shooting of innocent Iraqi civilian motorists by employees
of the UK company Aegis Defence Services. Evidence of that happening
was posted on a website and broadcast on TV for all to see. The company
has immunity from Iraqi law under the decree of the then chief US
occupier, Paul Bremer, which was enacted with the support of the UK,
and it is seemingly above UK law. It has had the nerve to use British
law to shut up the whistleblower, an ex-Army man, Mr. Rod Stoner. The
situation is unsatisfactory and the Government should address
it.</p><p><a name="06062269000119">I want to discuss
inquiries set up by UK forces and the MOD when innocent Iraqis are
killed. For example, a helicopter went down in Basra recently and the
subsequent disorder led to the deaths of several Iraqis, including two
children. During the Secretary of State&#146;s statement in this
House, I asked whether the mothers of the children who were killed
would be able attend or put any evidence to the inquiry, but no answer
was provided. That raises a query in my mind about how such inquiries
are carried out. The excluded Iraqis who have lost loved ones will see
them as cover ups, which I suspect they are. We should hear a statement
about how such inquiries are carried out and whether Iraqis who have
lost loved ones can be
involved.</p><p><a name="06062269000120">We have been
in control of Basra for three years, so why has it ended up in a state
of emergency? The Stop the War organisation has e-mailed me to say that
public order in Basra has virtually collapsed and that one person is
being assassinated every hour. I have received an e-mail entitled,
&#147;Ethnic cleansing under the watchful eyes of the British
Army&#148;, from Mr. F. Sabri of the Iraqi Islamic party, which is
based in London. It
states:</p><a name="06062269000504"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Three
years of kidnapping, torture and assassinations by Shiite militias in
Basrah caused tens of thousands of Sunnis to flee the city. A healthy
Sunni population of 35 per cent. reduced to less than 15 per cent.
under British rule. The British government is responsible for the
protection of all Iraqis under its control in the south of Iraq yet it
failed its obligation under international law to curb the influence and
power of the Iranian backed gangs and militias. Last week leaflets were
distributed in the city asking the Sunni population to leave by the 3rd
of July otherwise they will be exterminated. We have asked the British
Government repeatedly to act and protect the civilians in Basrah, but
we never receive an answer. We hold the British government

the matter of the death squads. The UN&#146;s human rights chief,
John Pace, said that they were overwhelmingly linked to the Ministry of
the Interior. The then Minister, Bayan Al Jabr, said that it was not
down to him and that the death squads were from the facilities
protection service set up by the coalition. When I asked a
parliamentary question about the FPS, I was told that the UK trained
it. Why have we been training and unleashing the death squads that have
caused so much
damage?</p><p><a name="06062269000129">I could raise
plenty of other issues, such as Saddam Hussein&#146;s trial and the
killing of his third defence lawyer. He is not going to get a fair
trial in Iraq, and it should be moved to The Hague. If it is all right
for that to happen to Liberia&#146;s Charles Taylor, it should happen
to Saddam Hussein. President Bush is hell-bent on delivering the death

discussions.</p><p><a name="06062269000134">These are
important matters, because in recent months there have been many
developments in our overseas operational activities. In the past five
months, there have been announcements on major troop deployments to
Afghanistan and decisions on the reconfiguration of British troops in
Iraq. At the same time, the House has had to consider the Armed Forces
Bill, the Blake review, and a series of critical manning, readiness and
procurement reports. There are many other pressing issues that have
not, until today, been subject to the same level of parliamentary
scrutiny or debate, and I shall refer to some of those in a few
minutes.</p><p><a name="06062269000135">The defence
White Paper proposed key changes to cope with new planning assumptions,
reflecting the enhanced use of network-enabled capability,
effects-based warfare and force restructuring. Those measures were said
to create the circumstances for a reduction in future manpower
requirements, but I wonder whether that can possibly be considered
realistic now, when the demands on our forces in many different places
have increased so much.</p><p><a name="06062269000136">It must be of profound concern
that, although the National Audit Office and the Armed Forces Pay
Review Body have found that the services have been operating beyond
planning assumptions for at least seven years, the Government have
successively reduced armed forces strength requirements, leaving what
the Defence Committee describes as &#147;little if any fat&#148; in
the armed forces. I am sure that the Committee is right. When outflow
from the armed forces is at a high, recruitment is at a low and our
overseas commitments appear likely to increase, there cannot be any
justification in those reductions in numbers. What impact will that
have on our reliance on harmony guidelines and the extent of our
reliance on reservists?</p><p><a name="06062269000137">The latest Defence Analytical
Services Agency figures show an increase in the total annual outflow
from the armed forces. The figure is now 24,290 compared with 23,430 in
April 2005. Similarly, recruitment from civilian life into the UK
regular forces has dropped substantially to below 20,000 in the past
two years. It was reported earlier this year that the Army expects a 12
per cent. recruitment shortfall compared with its target. Will the
Under-Secretary confirm recent reports that the bounty offered to
soldiers who persuade friends to join up is to be doubled, from
&#163;650 to &#163;1,300? Does he acknowledge the serious
recruitment problems?</p><br><notus-date day="22" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>22 Jun 2006 : Column 1521</b><br><p><a name="06062269000138">The Armed Forces Pay Review

extensive drawing down of reservists&#148;.</p></ul><p><a name="06062269000141">The Armed Forces Pay Review Body
identified serious shortages in key trades and skills. The Government
have declined to make public, on what they describe as
&#147;operational grounds&#148;, the extent of the shortages in
specific areas, but the existence of several operational pinch points
is seriously
worrying.</p><p><a name="06062269000142">The report
identifies specific shortages in trades in the Royal Engineers, the
Royal Signals, the Intelligence Corps and the Army medical services and
asks questions about the prevalence and extent of the problems. What
progress has been made in filling those gaps?</p><p><a name="06062269000143">Questions are being asked about
the effect of operational strains on our armed forces, consequently
calling into question the feasibility of the revised defence planning
assumptions in the defence White Paper. The NAO readiness report warned
that a third of British forces had serious weaknesses in their state of
readiness, and of the cumulative effect of a series of minor risks. It
has also been said that 8 per cent. of our armed forces are medically
unfit for duty, which could get worse with strains on mental health
from over-deployment. The hon. Member for Woodspring(Dr. Fox)
made that point effectively. That is profoundly significant not only
for the individuals&#151;the hon. Gentleman was right to stress the
importance of making facilities available to them&#151;but it must
have an impact on the calculations of the extent of deployment that we
can sensibly undertake in future.</p><p><a name="06062269000144">I want to consider some current
operations. Understandably, there has been much discussion of
Afghanistan. In a memorandum to the Select Committee in February, the
Ministry of Defence stated that, despite manning shortages, deployment
to Afghanistan is &#147;manageable&#148;. However, in its report
today, the Defence Committee observes:</p><a name="06062269000508"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Overall we judge that
the impact on personnel of our deployment to Afghanistan is manageable,
but will inevitably constrain our capacity to respond
elsewhere.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06062269000145">The Committee
is quite right to make that very level judgment. I wonder what
assessment the Ministry has made of the fighting capabilities of the
Taliban and other illegally armed groups in the south of Afghanistan,
and what assumptions underlie its calculation of the kind of help that
we are going to get from the Afghans themselves.</p><p><a name="06062269000146">We support the deployment of
troops to Afghanistan. It is intrinsically the right thing to do, but
we are less certain of the extent to which it is do-able. I was in
Paris earlier this week for the meeting of the Western European Union,
which had received a report from a group that had been to Afghanistan.
The report concluded that there would be a need for overseas troops to
be present there for 15 years. I do not think 
<br><notus-date day="22" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>22 Jun 2006 : Column 1522</b><br>that political or public opinion in the many parts of the country that
are supplying those troops is in any way ready for that.</p><p><a name="06062269000147">It is in
everyone&#146;s interest to achieve the stabilisation and
reconstruction of Afghanistan, not least because it supplies 90 per
cent. of the world&#146;s opium. This concerted international effort
has come rather late in the day, however. For three years, not enough
progress was made. I fear that energy was being devoted to Iraq at the
expense of Afghanistan, and the task is now more difficult because of
that neglect. The Government have yet to explain how they can reconcile
the concurrent objectives of achieving security and making progress on
counter-narcotics. It has already been pointed out that the prevalence
of the connections of the drugs industry throughout Afghan society and
within its political institutions means that the drugs trade is the
foundation of the Afghan economy. Effective measures against the trade
are going to make the security situation even more
challenging.</p><p><a name="06062269000148">I hope that
our forces will find ways of overcoming that tension, but I am unclear
as to what role they will play in the counter-narcotics strategy. Does
NATO have sufficient numbers of combat troops in southern Afghanistan,
where the level of violence has reached a new high? What provision is
there to cope with any further escalation in hostilities? This is
undoubtedly a highly challenging mission, and we must be clear that an
enduring solution will not be achieved without comprehensive political
reform and serious reconstruction. Success will also depend on the
active and constructive engagement of Afghanistan&#146;s neighbours,
especially Pakistan.</p><p><a name="06062269000149">There needs to be clarity on
the co-ordination between the different national contingents serving in
the international security assistance force&#151;ISAF&#151;as the
hon. Member for Woodspring said. There have been examples of overlap,
and the co-ordination does not seem to have been as strong as it might
have been. With the forthcoming unification of ISAF and Operation
Enduring Freedom, there needs to be clarity on the counter-insurgency
role undertaken by NATO forces, and a recognition of the dangers of
mission creep. There is a real danger that Afghan society will see all
foreign troops in the same light, and come to view all of them as
unwelcome.</p><p><a name="06062269000150">Italy has
begun the withdrawal of its troops from Iraq, with a view to complete
withdrawal before the end of the year. As that involves the second
largest contingent in multi-national sector south-east, I wonder what
effect the withdrawal will have on our forces and commitments there.
The Secretary of State told me when he made a statement just a day or
two into his new post that the objective in Iraq was to reach a
situation where we could hand over security responsibility to the new
Government&#151;I think that everyone would agree with
that&#151;and that the strategy was to achieve the objective. A full
debate in the House on Iraq is overdue, and any such debate should be
led or shared by the Foreign Office rather than being viewed simply as
a defence matter.</p><p><a name="06062269000151">A new
strategy is needed in Iraq, central to which should be a peace process
led by the United Nations to achieve national reconciliation and the
internationalisation of support for Iraq. That process would need to
build on the policies that have been set out by the Iraqi Prime 
<br><notus-date day="22" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>22 Jun 2006 : Column 1523</b><br>Minister, and would work towards the agreement of an international
compact setting out the commitments of all sides and a comprehensive
security and reconstruction strategy. It would need to build on the
good work&#151;to which I pay tribute&#151;of coalition forces that
are busily engaged in the training, equipping, professionalising and
regularising of the Iraqi security services. But it would need to go a
long way beyond that.</p><p><a name="06062269000152">We
need a regional contact group to strengthen the engagement of
Iraq&#146;s neighbours. We need a comprehensive disarmament,
demobilisation and reintegration strategy comparable with those that
coalition forces have overseen elsewhere. As the hon. Member for Leyton
and Wanstead (Harry Cohen) rightly said, we need an end to systematic
and indefinite detentions by United States and, indeed, Iraqi forces,
with safeguards against abuses. We need an enhanced national programme
in Iraq to promote human rights and the rule of law. We need to
expedite the reconstruction process, do what is possible to eliminate
corruption, and increase the involvement of the United Nations and the
World Bank.</p><p><a name="06062269000153">As all
those components begin to progress, it will become feasible to start
talking about a programme for phased security transfer and the
withdrawal of coalition troops. To get anywhere near such an approach,
however, will require the United Kingdom to use its influence in
Washington to press for US support, and it will have to be developed
and implemented with the approval of, and in partnership with, the
sovereign Government of Iraq.</p><p><a name="06062269000154">Le me say something about
procurement. The defence industrial strategy has rightly received a
generally warm welcome, despite some concerns about its potential
impact upon smaller companies. How will the Ministry of Defence monitor
its impact over a period, and ensure that it is having a benign
effect?</p><p><a name="06062269000155">I will not
attempt a tour d&#146;horizon of procurement issues in one short
speech, but a few brief points are worth making. What progress is being
made on technology transfer in relation to the joint strike fighter?
Last week, discussions between Bill Jeffrey and Gordon England failed
yet again to achieve a statement of principles to facilitate the United
States&#146; sharing of technologies with Britain in the context of
the JSF programme. Does the Minister believe that a memorandum of
understanding between our two nations will be produced by December, as
previously planned? Does the recent publication of a report in the US
saying that the costs of the JSF could be better controlled if there
were competition to provide engines revive any hopes for
Rolls-Royce?</p><p><a name="06062269000156"><b><a name="06062269000626">Mr.
Arbuthnot:</b> Does the hon. Gentleman agree that it would be
a great shame if the Farnborough air show came and went without
clarification of the technology transfer?</p><p><a name="06062269000157"><b><a name="06062269000627">Nick
Harvey:</b> That is a very good point. The Farnborough air
show will soon be upon us. I hope that it will focus minds and produce
some agreements. That would be a realistic and sensible time scale in
which to try to conclude discussions that are vitally important. No one
wants to see the JSF programme fail, but British Ministers and
officials have&#151;rightly, in 
<br><notus-date day="22" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>22 Jun 2006 : Column 1524</b><br>my view&#151;taken a robust line with the Americans, and it is
essential for this thorny issue to be resolved as soon as
possible.</p><p><a name="06062269000158">Another
procurement issue that urgently needs attention is heavy lift
capability. My noble Friend Lord Garden has persistently raised the
issue in another place. What resources has the MOD with which to
address that urgent problem, and when does it plan to do
so?</p><p><a name="06062269000159">We must ensure
that the drive to meet planning assumptions does not lead us towards
reduced stock holdings and spares. There are obvious risks associated
with purchasing to meet urgent operational requirements, as we saw in
the case of Operation Telic. The readiness report from the National
Audit Office
states:</p><a name="06062269000509"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;The
department relies extensively on cannibalising
equipment&#148;,</p></ul><p><a name="06062269000160">and that
applies particularly in the fleet. What progress is being made to
reduce that dependency, which is often inefficient and
manpower-intensive and which restricts operational
flexibility?</p><p><a name="06062269000161">One issue
that has not had parliamentary scrutiny but deserves it has to do with
pre-emption and the Geneva conventions. In a speech in March, the then
Defence Secretary called for a reappraisal of the Geneva conventions
and an expansion of the doctrine of pre-emptive strike. Will the
Minister say whether that is Government policy? If so, what revisions
are proposed to those conventions, which form the bedrock of
international humanitarian law? In light of the catastrophic
consequences of the Iraq invasion, on what grounds should the
pre-emptive strike doctrine be expanded? The UN High-Level Panel
concluded last year that existing international rules on the use of
force are sufficient, but that they need to be respected.</p><p><a name="06062269000162">Finally, I turn to the matter
that has been referred to already and which has dominated this
morning&#146;s newspapers&#151;the replacement of our nuclear
deterrent. In February, the Prime Minister told the Liaison
Committee:</p><a name="06062269000510"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;I
do not know that we need, specifically, to have a vote...but I am
sure there will be the fullest possible Parliamentary debate and there
will obviously be that...it will probably be done in a far more
open way than these decisions have been taken
before.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06062269000163">That was a
welcome sentiment, but I wonder about it. The number of scientists
working on hydrodynamic testing at Aldermaston is being increased for
the first time in 20 years, and additional investment of more than
&#163;1 billion is being made in that facility, with more than
&#163;10 million allocated to preliminary work on Trident
renewal.</p><p><a name="06062269000164">I
have been rather surprised by some of the answers to parliamentary
questions that I have received in the past few weeks. Will the Minister
confirm that no work is currently under way at Aldermaston on designs
for a new nuclear warhead? It seems inconceivable that that can be
right. We need transparency from the Government about the process, and
they should actively provide information to Parliament and the public
so as to inform a full debate on the
matter.</p><p><a name="06062269000165">Last night, we
learned that the Prime Minister in waiting believes that the decision
must be taken next year&#151;although he seems to have made a
decision, despite the fact that key facts have not been made 
<br><notus-date day="22" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>22 Jun 2006 : Column 1525</b><br>public. Successive Defence Ministers have said only that a decision may
be required in this Parliament. Why the sudden urgency? Has the
Ministry of Defence changed its position and, if so, on what basis? The
former Defence Secretary said in a written answer in March that
Ministers had not yet begun to consider the position &#147;in any
detail&#148;, so what new analysis has taken place since then?
Exactly when will the &#147;fullest possible parliamentary
debate&#148; that the Prime Minister promised begin? The truth is
that the timetable for replacement seems to have more to do with
political considerations than technical
ones.</p><p><a name="06062269000166">The Americans
are proposing to extend the lifecycle of their Trident systems into the
2040s. I do not pretend that we could do that with ease, but it would
certainly be possible. In that case, why does the Chancellor suddenly
believe that a decision about replacement has to be made in the next
few
months?</p><p><a name="06062269000167"><b><a name="06062269000628">Dr.
Julian Lewis:</b> I am listening to the hon. Gentleman very
carefully, but I think that the problem is the life of the Trident
missile submarines rather than the missiles themselves. The
submarines&#146; lifespan will end between 2020 and
2025.</p><p><a name="06062269000168"><b><a name="06062269000629">Nick
Harvey:</b> I agree that the problem lies with the submarines,
which have a limited lifecycle, rather than with the warhead or the
missile. However, the Americans are proposing to eke some extra life
even out of their submarines. Although I do not see that we have a
great deal of scope to do the same, I do not believe that final
decisions need to be made by next spring. If we did everything that we
could to extend Trident&#146;s lifecycle, a number of years would
certainly pass before it had absolutely had to be
replaced.</p><p><a name="06062269000169">A decision
to replace Trident before all the options&#151;as well as their
costs, the strategic environment, proliferation implications and
security requirements&#151;are considered would be a dereliction of
public duty. This is a matter of essential national debate, and all
such factors need to be brought into the open. The decision should be
taken only after an informed debate and a slow and careful
consideration of the issues, not on a political
whim.</p><p><a name="06062269000170">In concluding, I
welcome the announcement in the Minister&#146;s statement that,
before the end of the year, a future strategic context for defence
policy will be published. That in itself may prove a useful step along
the way in our discussions of the possible replacement of Trident. I
did feel, however, that the Minister was at times in danger of painting
a slightly rosy picture of the 21st century context. There are very
great dangers; we live in a very uncertain world.</p><p><a name="06062269000171">Climate change could prove a
great threat to security, as many of the world&#146;s cities are
based on vulnerable coastlines. HIV/AIDS has been recognised by the UN
Security Council as a security issue that threatens to destabilise
parts of Africa. Competition for scarce resources is intensifying and
the US, China and India should certainly rein in, sit down and
participate in discussions about the problem. There is a growing
poverty gap between wealthy parts of the world and the developing
world, and trade barriers are being put in the way of the developing
world as it tries to improve itself. In addition, there is the spread
of 
<br><notus-date day="22" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>22 Jun 2006 : Column 1526</b><br>weapons of mass destruction and the constant threat of terrorism. All of
those are new challenges that require new policies. Talk of the peace
dividend seems a long way behind us now.</p><p><a name="06062269000172">It is welcome that we have a
chance to debate the new security contexts later in the year, and I am
glad that we have had the opportunity to look into the more current
issues now. I very much hope that the Government will shortly give the
House more information about the replacement of Trident so that we can
begin a rational debate about it as soon as
possible.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="06062269000547">3.1
pm</h5><p><a name="06062269000173"><b><a name="06062269000630">Mr.
Robert Flello (Stoke-on-Trent, South) (Lab):</b> Right hon.
and hon. Members will know about the armed forces parliamentary scheme.
I was delighted to be accepted into and to take part in it. For the
benefit of anyone observing our debate or reading <i> Hansard</i> later,
it is worth restating that the scheme was established to enable Members
here and in the other place to gain a feel for, and understanding of,
what our armed forces do. I venture to suggest that some who have
already participated in today&#146;s debate or who intend to later
would do well to think about signing up to the scheme to widen their
knowledge.</p><p><a name="06062269000174">One important
aspect of the scheme is the sharing with the House of any lessons
learned. I would certainly recommend last year&#146;s armed forces
parliamentary scheme booklet to anyone who wanted to get an idea of
what the scheme does and to get involved with it. Over the next few
minutes or so, I would like to give the House some of the information
that I have learned through participating in the scheme so far. I make
no apology for the fact that it is a personal view based on what has
been said to me and what I have learned. I also make no apology for the
fact that my speech is Army-centred, because that is the armed force
with which I worked. I make no apology either for failing to mention
any names&#151;it would be unfair for me to do so and it would send
out the wrong message to people who want the opportunity to talk to
parliamentarians when they are out and about with different units.
People should not feel inhibited in any way about speaking to
us.</p><p><a name="06062269000175"><b><a name="06062269000631">Mr.
Gray:</b> Perhaps the hon. Gentleman will
make one exception to that honourable self-denying ordinance and join
me in congratulating Sir Neil Thorne, the founder of the armed forces
parliamentary scheme and its mentor for many
years.</p><p><a name="06062269000176"><b><a name="06062269000632">Mr.
Flello:</b> I would be delighted to do so. The scheme has been
going for about 18 years and it has allowed something in the order of
170 or 180 Members to participate. In my relatively short period in the
scheme, I have undertaken a few visits. I kick off with the Army
presentation team. Again, I would recommend any interested Member to
take the opportunity to get a flavour and overview from the team of
what it does.</p><a name="06062269000497"><p>I also
visited Headquarters Land Command and met the commander-in-chief of our
land forces. The meeting was attended by three chiefs of staff, four
assistant chiefs of staff, the Command secretary and his deputy and the
director of Army infrastructure. Indeed, there were so many stars in
the room that I thought I was in 
<br><notus-date day="22" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>22 Jun 2006 : Column 1527</b><br>an episode of &#147;The Sky at Night&#148;. It was extremely
informative. We talked about the organisation of the forces, the
current operations, as have been mentioned in the debate, the major
issues that the Army is addressing and the major challenges that it
faces and, indeed, some of the issues that have been so eloquently
spoken about already, such as the commitment of forces and the new
equipment that is
planned.</p><p><a name="06062269000177">I
also attended Pirbright, spoke to some of the new recruits on their
phase 1 training and had an insightful briefing from the commander in
charge of that facility. I saw at first hand the high-tech shooting
range, where new recruits are taught how to use weapons in an extremely
safe environment. They can get used to the equipment in a way that
allows the trainers to correct any new recruit who needs some further
guidance, in a way what would not be possible traditionally because of
the accuracy of the training equipment that they have been given to
use. Throughout my experience so far, the quality of the training comes
through time and again. Perhaps other Departments could learn some
lessons about the quality of the training that the Army is able to
undertake. I stand in the House as a perhaps less-than-perfect example
of someone at his peak physical fitness, but the effort that goes into,
and the quality of, the physical training was also particularly
notable.</p>

<p><a name="06062269000178">I
was fortunate to spend some time with 1 Royal Anglian on its training
exercise. Give that yesterday was the longest day, the name of the
exercise&#151;Druids Dance&#151;seemed somewhat appropriate on
Salisbury plain. I also spent some time with a squadron of the
King&#146;s Royal Hussars. Again, that was insightful, and I hope in
the next few minutes to develop some of the information that was
provided to me during those three very informative days. Most recently,
I visited the armoured centre at Bovington with the Royal Armoured
Corps. Again, I gained first-hand experience of training and speaking
to recruits and soldiers at various stages of their Army careers, as
well as the leadership of those facilities.</p><p><a name="06062269000179">Later in the year, I hope to
visit Iraq to see it for myself. Unfortunately, my hon. Friend the
Member for Leyton and Wanstead (Harry Cohen) is not in his place, but
if he got himself on to that visit, we could both see for ourselves
what the reality of life is like for the troops in Iraq, by talking to
serving soldiers about their experiences and perhaps not relying
on&#151;dare I say?&#151;propaganda from possibly unreliable
sources that cannot be
corroborated.</p><p><a name="06062269000180">I have
had an opportunity to talk to soldiers at all levels, from a recruit
who was only a few weeks into phase 1 training to the
commander-in-chief of land forces. I spoke to soldiers all the way
through: captains, majors, lieutenant-colonels, colonels and all the
ranks. I had a particularly interesting conversation over a cup of tea
in a deckchair on Salisbury plain with a brigadier, who very kindly
hosted me at the headquarters of 12 Mechanised
Brigade.</p><p><a name="06062269000181">I want to get
to the meat of the major issues that were expressed to me, but this is
just a snapshot of some of them. The Bowman radio system has not been
mentioned specifically in the debate, but it has been alluded to. I got
very mixed views from professional soldiers&#151;the
signalmen&#151;to whom I spoke, but the vast majority of them were
impressed with the system. They said that it was fantastic and that the
secure 
<br><notus-date day="22" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>22 Jun 2006 : Column 1528</b><br>communications, the robustness and the whole set up was very good. Where
the problems still lie&#151;they are being resolved&#151;is in
rolling out the additional functionality of the Bowman
system.</p><a name="06062269000498"><p>A
number of outsiders have expressed concerns to me about the loss of
some knowledge and the encryption ability in relation to the use of
unsecured communications. Yet when I was with the Royal Armoured Corps
at Bovington recently, I saw with my own eyes recruits being trained to
use encryption if the secure communications system falls down. There is
a lot of hype and myth about the loss of trained skills and abilities,
but on seeing the situation for myself, it was clear that the reality
is completely different.</p><p><a name="06062269000182">Many people outside the
military have expressed to me their views about equipment levels and
availability. Being a member of the armed forces parliamentary scheme
has allowed me to see the situation for myself and to talk to serving
soldiers. On doing so, it became clear&#151;I hope that my
Front-Bench colleagues will take note of this message, and the spirit
in which it is intended; this was a learning experience&#151;that the
equipment provided on operational duty was excellent and of the highest
quality. Soldiers had what they needed where and when they needed it,
but time and again they expressed concerns about training. For example,
although the sights provided on operation in Iraq were superb, they
were not available in the UK training environment, so there was a delay
in deployment and in getting up to speed in the use of that equipment.
The thermal imaging sight for the Javelin 2 missile system is an
extremely capable piece of kit, but it is not cheap. One sight was
available for training use by a number of units, which was sufficient
to meeting training needs; however, we could do
better.</p><p><a name="06062269000183">Some of the
equipment used at the land warfare centre to train soldiers is
incredible, and a lot of thought has gone into developing the training
systems. One room there has desktop computers with training aids that
soldiers can use as part of a lesson or in their own time, in order to
get back up to speed. They can also take those aids back to their base
units, so that they can continue to upgrade their knowledge. There are
also gunners&#146; &#147;cabinets&#148;, which are used to train
gunners, and a wide range of other training equipment. Yet again, the
quality of training is absolutely superb.</p><p><a name="06062269000184">Turning to
the after-action review and my time spent with 12 Mechanised Brigade on
Salisbury plain, the training facilities, tools and equipment provided
there are absolutely superb. It is possible to identify whether
individual soldiers are standing or lying down, and moving in the right
or wrong direction. Such information can be gone through item by item
in a replay after the training session, which is incredibly
valuable.</p><p><a name="06062269000185">On asset
management of equipment, particularly the heavier equipment&#151;the
tanks&#151;it would be remiss of me not to mention the robust session
that I had with the King&#146;s Royal Hussars in the major&#146;s
tent at the end of one Wednesday. They expressed their views in a
forthright manner, pointing out that although central asset management
of tanks such as Scimitars is in principle a good idea in practice,
when on exercise troops have to spend a lot of time at the start
bringing such equipment back up to standard. Because the unit that has
used it previously does not own it and therefore has no personal pride
in it, the various niggles 
<br><notus-date day="22" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>22 Jun 2006 : Column 1529</b><br>are not sorted out before it is put back into storage. As a result, work
often needs to be done to bring it back up to standard when it is taken
out of storage. I hope that my colleagues on the Front Bench will take
note of that information.</p><p><a name="06062269000186">The KRH pointed out to me that
most of their vehicles have been switched over from petrol to diesel,
but my understanding&#151;I hope that the Minister can correct me if
I am wrong&#151;is that the fuel used is virtually of the type to be
found in the public garage down the road. It was duty-paid fuel, and it
seemed odd to me to use that for those vehicles and that some
arrangement has not been made. Perhaps more important, though, would be
taking a lead in looking at biofuels and alternative fuels, to see
whether there are ways for the services, and the Army in particular, to
set an example on the environmental impact of having a Saxon armoured
carrier sitting with its engine running so that tea can be boiled up in
the brewing vessel. There is a need for alternative
fuels.</p><p><a name="06062269000187">A lot of
comments have been made about soldiers having to buy their own kit,
especially if they want anything decent. My experience is that that may
have been the case a few years back, but the quality of kit is mighty
fine now. It is good stuff. It is good kit. I was issued a pair of
boots before going out to Salisbury plain, and only remembered them the
day before. So, I had three days out in these brand new boots, but
without a blister to speak of, and believe me that was not because I
was sitting down, because I certainly had to do a lot of
walking.</p><p><a name="06062269000188">What came
across to me was that soldiers do still buy some personal kit, but that
is for personalisation reasons and not because there is anything wrong
with the kit. One comment made to me was about a lightweight fleece
jacket. Someone had bought one, but two months on they are being issued
as standard, and he is looking for the receipt to try to take it back.
The quality of food has also come a long way. Napoleon said that an
army marches on its stomach, and the only comment made to me was that
an awful lot of soldiers carry their own bottles of Tabasco sauce to
spice things up a
little.</p><p><a name="06062269000189">Safety was
absolutely paramount on the exercise. Someone twisted an ankle and the
whole exercise on the plain was closed down while that was attended to.
The quality of the safety, like the training, was phenomenal. Loader
training at the Royal Armoured centre involved teaching loaders to get
away from the recoil of the Challenger 2 breech. Almost everything
seemed to be done, too, in terms of risk assessment. I started slightly
cynically, as a Member of Parliament, thinking that things might be
being talked about and done for my benefit. But when I sat back in the
middle of the exercise and could see things happening for real, I
started to realise that risk assessment is well and truly
embedded.</p><p><a name="06062269000190">Pay is never
too far from most people&#146;s minds, and soldiers are no exception.
One thing mentioned was that overseas troops tend to have tax-free pay.
What was not mentioned was levels of pay and how well troops are paid
now in comparison with some time
ago.</p><p><a name="06062269000191">I pay tribute to
the soldiers I met. Finally, I ask that veterans day should be not just
about ex-service personnel and that we should celebrate our current,
serving personnel, who do a tremendous
job.</p><br><notus-date day="22" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>22 Jun 2006 : Column 1530</b><br><h5 align="left"><a name="06062269000548">3.17

Malcolm Rifkind (Kensington and Chelsea) (Con):</b> I declare
an interest in regard to what I wish to say later about
Afghanistan.</p><p><a name="06062269000193">I have
some sympathy with the problems of the Minister of State and the
Ministry of Defence. I know as well as anyone that although the
Ministry has what appear to be vast resources&#151;&#163;32 billion
a year or whatever it is&#151;that does not enable it to do more than
a proportion of what it would like to achieve. The Ministry of Defence
is always treated with a lot of jealousy by other home Departments. I
recall Margaret Thatcher once saying to me that the problem with the
Ministry of Defence is that it has no friends. I suggested that the
Foreign Office was perhaps a friend, and she said, &#147;The Foreign
Office? They&#146;re not wet; they&#146;re drenched!&#148; And so
was the conversation brought to a premature
end.</p><p><a name="06062269000194">I hope that the
Minister of State will forgive me for saying that our discussion so far
illustrates why the Leader of the House was quite wrong to suggest that
a debate such as this one meets the Government&#146;s
responsibilities with regard to the House having an opportunity to
debate Iraq or other fundamental issues of defence policy. We have just
heard from the hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent, South (Mr. Flello) and
from others about many important topics, and we cannot go through
dozens relevant issues, which just happen to include Iraq and
Afghanistan, and then say that the House of Commons has fulfilled its
responsibilities and that Parliament has been able to agree or disagree
with the Government&#146;s policy. That is not acceptable. The United
States Congress has had many opportunities to debate Iraq and
Afghanistan, and I suggest to the Minister that his Department, and, I
hope, the Foreign Office, will impress upon the Leader of the House,
who ought to know better than most, why such a debate would be timely
and necessary in the wider public interest if the Government wish to
try to win back some support for their
policy.</p><p><a name="06062269000195">I shall not
detain the House long, but I want to make two kinds of comment. First,
I shall deal with the argument that the Government try to make, either
intentionally or subliminally, that the situations in Iraq and
Afghanistan&#151;the problems, opportunities and tasks&#151;are
broadly the same, and that they are pursuing a single strategy and
should have the support of the House and the country. Secondly, I want
to make specific comments about
Afghanistan.</p><p><a name="06062269000196">I support
what the Government are doing in Afghanistan; it is absolutely right.
The starting point was quite different. Al-Qaeda may be present in both
Iraq and Afghanistan, but it is in Iraq as a result of the British and
American invasion of that country. Before then, there was a secular
despot who had no more time for al-Qaeda than do the British
Government. Al-Qaeda has identified a big vacuum in Iraq and is there
in a big way, but the situation in Afghanistan is fundamentally
different. The British, American and other Governments were right to
intervene in that
country.</p><p><a name="06062269000197">The
second consideration is that the United States had genuine global
support. A few years on, it is easy to forget how unanimous that
support and sympathy was around the world; there was also recognition
of the 
<br><notus-date day="22" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>22 Jun 2006 : Column 1531</b><br>need to take swift action against the Taliban, because they were giving
al-Qaeda practical support. Another consideration is that there is not
the insurgency in Afghanistan that there is in Iraq. People express
great pessimism about Afghanistan going the wrong way, and talk about
mission creep and our being sucked into something insoluble. There are
indeed major problems, but they are of a quite different order. For
practical purposes, the whole of Iraq&#151;certainly in the areas
where the population is concentrated, in Baghdad, Basra and
elsewhere&#151;is convulsed by the insurgency. In Afghanistan the
Government&#146;s remit is relatively limited. However, that is not
because there is general insurgency, but because warlords and others
control individual provinces and deny respect for the central
Government. The situation is not
comparable.</p><p><a name="06062269000198">Furthermore,
40,000 Iraqis and others have died since the insurgency began. There
have been fatalities in Afghanistan, but they are of a different
order.</p><p><a name="06062269000199"><b><a name="06062269000634">Mr.
Gray:</b> My right hon. and learned Friend is right: there is
as yet no general insurgency in Afghanistan. Is he not concerned,
however, that the unpleasant coalition against us of poppy growers, the
Taliban, local warlords and local people, together with al-Qaeda and
others coming from Iraq and Iran, may lead to a more general insurgency
in the country if we do not do something about
it?</p><p><a name="06062269000200"><b><a name="06062269000635">Sir
Malcolm Rifkind:</b> My hon. Friend is correct; the situation
could deteriorate significantly, but at present there is no evidence of
such an unholy alliance materialising. There have been no major
military incidents of a comparable kind in
Afghanistan.</p><p><a name="06062269000201">In
Afghanistan, there is not the sectarian split that has so dominated the
Iraqi issue. Afghanistan is overwhelmingly a Sunni country and no one
suggests that that situation is likely to change in any meaningful way.
There is no equivalent of the Kurdish dimension; no part of Afghanistan
has aspirations to the total independence that would fragment the
country. Nor does Afghanistan have what is in one respect the curse of
oil, to create further division in that state. However, there are big
problems and we must look frankly at why the coalition forces of NATO
and others, including the Afghan Government, are finding it so
difficult to
cope.</p><p><a name="06062269000202">Part
of the problem is that the Taliban were never defeated in the
conventional sense; they simply faded away. They realised the
overwhelming strength of the United States, in particular, and its
allies, and withdrew to their villages, to the hill areas and the
frontier where they could regroup and continue, which creates a very
different situation. In addition, there is the inability of the western
forces to act in a coherent and united
fashion.</p><p><a name="06062269000203">Earlier,
I raised the question of the integration of the international forces
operating in Afghanistan. I appreciate and understand the difficulties.
Even within NATO, there are countries with different views on whether
they would wish to take part in the kind of work being carried out by
Operation Enduring Freedom. However, it is manifestly absurd to have a
situation in which many thousands of British, American and other NATO
forces 
<br><notus-date day="22" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>22 Jun 2006 : Column 1532</b><br>are all operating within the country, but with two separate command
structures for all practical purposes, two different rules of
engagement and with an attempt now being made to draw them closer
together. That is a wasteful use of resources and a wasteful way of
approaching these matters.</p><p><a name="06062269000204">The
Minister knows that perfectly well&#151;although he is not in a
position to say it in quite the blunt terms that I am using&#151;and
the United States knows it perfectly well. Most countries know it
well&#151;even if the only way in which we can get a single unified
command in Afghanistan, in order to maximise operations against the
Taliban and other elements in that country, is to say to the one or two
countries in NATO that do not want to go in that direction that they
should no longer take part in the operation. Most of NATO is willing to
work in a unified way. The United States, which is NATO&#146;s
leading member state, can hardly be expected not to be part of a
single, unified process.</p><p><a name="06062269000205">There is a
word of warning for the United States. It has seen the British and NATO
involvement in Helmand province as the beginning of a process that will
enable it to reduce its own troop complement in Afghanistan. Indeed,
Donald Rumsfeld, in his usual sensitive fashion, has said as much, and
has anticipated that the Americans will now be able to reduce their
commitment. That would be an incredibly foolish
mistake&#151;comparable to the mistake that the United States, and
indeed the rest of us, have been making since the beginning of the
Afghan operation.</p><p><a name="06062269000206">When the
Taliban were overthrown&#151;when Karzai&#146;s Government came
into effect&#151;the best estimate at that time was that Afghanistan
would need an international force of about 30,000 to provide real
stabilisation. In fact, we ended up with about a third of that number.
Against that background, it is not surprising that warlords in
individual provinces have been able to continue in control, and it is
not a matter for any particular astonishment that the central
Government in Kabul have not been able to extend their authority, even
in many of the areas where the Taliban are not remotely present, or not
present in any significant numbers. The problem is not just the south
and the east. It is the failure in Afghanistan&#151;in this sense it
is comparable to Iraq&#151;to realise that once the war is over, we
still need a major international military presence. I am afraid that
Mr. Rumsfeld is the guilty party, as he is in Iraq, for having decreed
that somehow the numbers needed were far more modest than has turned
out to be the case.</p><p><a name="06062269000207">The
Government are entitled to the support of this House. The United States
continues to have a considerable degree of international support for
what it is seeking to do in Afghanistan. All the warnings that have
been given by the Minister and others about what would happen if the
west simply withdrew from Afghanistan are entirely correct and
justified, but that should not be used as an excuse to maintain an
inefficient military command structure that cannot deliver the best
results and, most of all, it cannot be used to justify a reducing
American military commitment over the next few years.</p><p><a name="06062269000208">One of the
lessons that we should all have learned from history, over 100 years,
is that if one wants to make a profound change in countries of lower
economic and social development, which have major internal problems of
stability and cultural differences, one needs to be there for a long
time. If one is not prepared to do 
<br><notus-date day="22" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>22 Jun 2006 : Column 1533</b><br>that, one should not go there in the first place. That is particularly
true in Afghanistan at the moment. If the Government are able to pursue
such an approach&#151;not only in their own policy, but in the
recommendations that they make to other Governments, including the
United States&#151;they will deserve the support ofthe
House.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="06062269000549">3.29

McCarthy-Fry (Portsmouth, North) (Lab):</b> I begin by paying
tribute to the brave men and women of our armed forces, who risk their
lives every day to keep us safe and secure. My constituency is the home
of the Royal Navy and Portsmouth ships have defended our country in
many famous sea battles. Portsmouth itself suffered badly from bombing
during the second world war and we who live there are aware that our
city still remains a military target. My constituents and I owe a great
debt to the men and women who have defended and continue to defend the
city and our country.</p><p><a name="06062269000210">Up until fairly recently, our
defence policy was centred on keeping our borders and those of our
allies safe from attack by potential enemy states by preparing our
stand-by forces for traditional combat operations. However, things have
shifted dramatically since 9/11, and our country now faces threats from
not so much states, or even organisations with which we can negotiate,
but shadowy individuals who are not allied to any one state. Such
individuals can cross international borders and operate within our
borders. They have unprecedented access to technology and weaponry that
can cause destruction on a massive scale. They also operate without a
thought for preserving their own lives. The accepted conventions under
which defence policy was formulated for many years have thus
changed.</p><p><a name="06062269000211">We can no
longer adopt a mentality of sitting on top of a hill and fending away
the attackers and sheer force of numbers does not help much against a
chemical or biological attack. We must have a smarter and more agile
position in which we use the best equipment that technological advances
can give us. Such equipment must be able to move in quickly and perform
a multi-functional role, and the men and women who operate that
equipment need to be professionals who can exercise judgment. They must
be treated with the respect that they deserve, given the danger in
which we ask them to put
themselves.</p><p><a name="06062269000212">The
Ministry of Defence must prepare for all eventualities when it makes
policy. We owe it to the men and women of our armed forces to ensure
that they are trained for all types of conflict. We do not want them to
have to be put in a situation that has not been foreseen and for which
they have not been properly prepared. Of course, we cannot foresee
every eventuality, but we need to think outside the box and prepare for
as many scenarios as we can possibly envisage, no matter how unlikely
they might seem at the
time.</p><p><a name="06062269000213">We
need to consider not just conflict. Often the work of the armed forces
is not armed combat, but peacekeeping, peace enforcing and disaster
relief. The role of peacekeeping and peace enforcing becomes
intertwined with the international objective of sustainable economic
development in unstable countries. The role of the troop deployment 
<br><notus-date day="22" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>22 Jun 2006 : Column 1534</b><br>in Afghanistan is as much to curb the narcotics trade as it is to bring
security and stability to the area. That is a delicate role for our
troops to undertake. The more successful we are at curbing the traffic
in narcotics, the more danger our troops are likely to be in. How do we
win the hearts and minds of local people if we are viewed as removing
their livelihood? That must be balanced against the fact that
Afghanistan will not have security and stability in the long term while
the narcotics trade flourishes. We need to ensure that our troops are
fully trained for such a role and that we have troops who can exercise
their judgment and act professionally in such delicate
situations.</p><p><a name="06062269000214">I spoke
earlier about treating our troops with the respect they deserve. They
need to be treated with respect by not just the MOD and their
commanding officers, but politicians, the public and the media. A few
months ago, I had the opportunity to visit Iraq. I spoke to the men and
women who are doing a superb job helping the Iraqis to rebuild their
lives and helping to train the Iraqi security forces so that they can
take control of their own safety and security. They face danger every
day, but they keep their cool and behave professionally against extreme
provocation. However, one would not know that from the media coverage.
The only stories that are widely reported in the British press are the
negative ones, which are then relayed across the rest of the world.
That gives the armed insurgents the ammunition with which to arm their
followers, which thus puts our troops in even more
danger.</p><p><a name="06062269000215">I
spoke to many serving soldiers who told me about circumstances in which
they have faced insurgents who have known only too well the rules of
engagement under which our troops operate and goaded them to a point at
which they hoped that our troops would break. However, such is the
professionalism of our troops that they invariably do not do that.
Nevertheless, accusations are still made, and they are duly
investigated by our service police, contrary to what my hon. Friend the
Member for Leyton and Wanstead (Harry Cohen)
said.</p><p><a name="06062269000216">I
heard of instances of the security services being hampered in their
investigations by the unwillingness of alleged victims to give evidence
because they had been approached by agents of predatory lawyers who
told them not to co-operate with an inquiry, but to sue through the
courts for compensation. The Army investigators then stand accused of
failing to investigate properly, or covering up, when they are in fact
doing their best to investigate properly, but being prevented from
doing so. None of that gets properly reported by the British media. It
obviously has not reached the ears of my hon. Friend the Member for
Leyton and Wanstead. Is it any wonder that some people ask why we are
still in Iraq, when all they hear are the negative and unsubstantiated
rumours?</p><p><a name="06062269000217">The men and
women on the ground whom I met felt that they were still part of the
solution in Iraq, not part of the problem, but we all recognise that
there is a fine line that needs to be kept continually under review. We
have a job to do at the request of the elected Iraqi Government and we
need to stay until the job is done or the Iraqi Government wish us to
leave. There is an important task to do in training and helping the
Iraqis to take responsibility for their own security. From my own
observations, I believe that they have the training, experience and
expertise to perform that task well.</p><br><notus-date day="22" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>22 Jun 2006 : Column 1535</b><br><p><a name="06062269000218">It is not just the Army, the
Marines or the RAF. The Navy, too, is doing its bit. Representing, as I
do, the constituency that is the home of the Royal Navy, no one will be
surprised that I am speaking up for it, as it was a bone of contention
among sailors whom I met on HMS Bulwark in the Arabian Gulf that there
was never any recognition in the media back home of the important work
that the Navy was doing in Iraq, working with the Iraqi navy to protect
the oil terminals that are the lifeblood of Iraq and the economic key
to its
reconstruction.</p><p><a name="06062269000219">I
saw the professionalism and diplomacy of our modus operandi when
boarding unknown craft that had strayed into the exclusion zone. I was
shown the basket of gifts that the captain of the patrol vessel carries
with him, which are handed out to the crew while the marines search the
craft. That is how we win hearts and minds and how we gain the valuable
intelligence that we need in the fight against international terrorism,
not by going in with all guns blazing, although of course there may be
times when that is the appropriate
response.</p><p><a name="06062269000220">When we look
at defence policy, we must make sure that we consider how our troops
are viewed here at home and in other countries, because that has an
impact not only on our ability to defend ourselves, but on our ability
to recruit and retain high-quality professionals. We want to make the
armed services attractive to young people, to ensure that we recruit
people of the highest calibre. We also need to ensure that our armed
services are representative of our population. That means encouraging
recruitment of men and women from all ethnic backgrounds and reaching
out to the gay and lesbian community and encouraging gays and lesbians
to join up, rather than the shameful way in which they were treated by
the MOD for many years.</p><p><a name="06062269000221">I was encouraged by my right
hon. Friend the Minister of State when he told the House last year that
we had recruited our first Muslim, Hindu and Sikh chaplains, and I hope
we can continue to work with the Equal Opportunities Commission and the
Commission for Racial Equality to ensure greater
diversity.</p><p><a name="06062269000222">For
too long, our armed services have been a closed world, hidden behind a
cloak of secrecy, because of the fear that operational effectiveness
could be compromised. But all too often we have seen that secrecy
encouraging a culture of bullying. It goes without saying that junior
ranks must obey orders from senior officers without question, because
their own lives and those of their colleagues depend on it. However,
one thing above all else that came out of my visits to Iraq, Cyprus and
Oman is the tremendous team spirit among regiments, air crew and ships
companies. They all had a joint commitment to a common goal and they
were all fiercely protective of their fellow soldiers, sailors and
airmen. Time and again, these young men and women told me that what
they appreciated from their armed service was the training that enabled
them to operate as a team.</p><p><a name="06062269000223">Team work is much more likely
to be generated by trust, transparency and openness than by operation
as a secret closed group. We do not need to bully people into obeying
orders and we do not need to break people&#146;s spirit. We no longer
operate trench warfare 
<br><notus-date day="22" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>22 Jun 2006 : Column 1536</b><br>and we do not ask our troops to blindly go over the top in the knowledge
that not all of them will survive, but in the hope that some of them
will.</p><p><a name="06062269000224"><b><a name="06062269000637">Mr.

making a powerful speech. Of course the whole House would condemn
bullying, but having served in the armed forces, as have many other
hon. and gallant Members, I know that it is a different environment
from the normal nine-to-five job. It is tough and we cannot expect our
soldiers, sailors and airmen and women to go into combat unless they
have gone through thorough, vigorous training. We cannot be nice to
everyone on this side and expect them to stand up to the bullets on the
other
side.</p><p><a name="06062269000225"><b><a name="06062269000638">Sarah
McCarthy-Fry:</b> I have no argument with
the hon. Gentleman about the need for robust training and the need to
make sure that our troops are aware of what they will face when they go
into operation. But when one hears stories, as I heard from someone, of
a young recruit having a machete held to his head, that is not robust
training. That is bullying and that, to me, is not acceptable. In a
recent debate on Armed Forces Bill, there was a great deal discussion
of the possibility of establishing an independent commissioner as part
of a grievance redress procedure. Indeed, the Blake review of the
tragic deaths at Deepcut recommended the introduction of such a post.
Not all senior officers in the services accept the need for an
independent commissioner, as they believe that the internal grievance
redress procedures are adequate, but junior ranks to whom I
spoke&#151;incidentally, they told me that there is still a culture
of bullying in some parts of the services, although it has
improved&#151;did not have confidence that internal procedures would
be fair. We will not have the professional, committed, agile armed
forces we need to discharge either our responsibilities and duties in
defence of our citizens or our international obligations if we do not
tackle the issue. The Government agreed to defer consideration of an
independent commissioner pending the Blake report. Now that they have
had time to look at the recommendations, I hope there will be movement
on the issue as the Armed Forces Bill continues its passage through the
other
place.</p>

wide-ranging speech. I have responded to the Blake report and I clearly
stated that the complaints commissioner&#151;that is the title of the

representation on complaints panels. As she said, the Armed Forces Bill

agile fighting forces do not consist just of regular forces. To provide
the flexibility required by modern warfare we increasingly rely on
reservists&#151;either former regular servicemen or volunteer
reserves. In Umm Qasr, I met volunteer marine reservists who were
helping to co-ordinate the Gulf protection strategy. They greatly
welcomed the opportunity to play a responsible role in operations, as
their everyday lives were vastly different. One reservist was a
lifeguard, one a credit controller and another a quality inspector in a
biscuit factory&#151;a world away from the job they were doing in
Iraq. A recent report by the National Audit Office shows that the
desire to serve on operations is an increasingly important reason for
joining the volunteer reserves. Surveys show people who take part in an
operational deployment are more likely to want to be deployed
again.</p><p><a name="06062269000229">The
marine reservists whom I met would certainly welcome another
deployment. They were looking forward to serving in Afghanistan, but
when I asked how their families felt, it was a different story. In
theory, all reservists are subject to a compulsory call-up but, in
practice, the MOD asks individuals if they wish to serve, and that
informs call-up procedures. The NAO report, however, notes that
reservists do not all admit to their families or employers that they
have volunteered for an operation, which can cause problems.</p><p><a name="06062269000230">We must be
much more open about such problems and involve families at a much
earlier stage in a volunteer reservist&#146;s career, so that when
the call-up comes they understand what is involved and what support is
available. We should ensure that the support available to the families
of regular forces is available to reserve forces. We must work with
employers so that they recognise the valuable work that reservists do.
That is not just an altruistic point of view&#151;the training and
experience that reservists acquire on an operation is invaluable to
their employers when they return. Many members of 103 Battalion of the
Territorial Army, which is based in my constituency, served in
Operation Telic. The battalion is a Royal Electrical and Mechanical
Engineers unit whose job is to repair vehicles and return them to
action as quickly as possible. Like all TA units, it has experienced
problems with recruitment, but it was allocated additional funding last
year, which enabled it to adopt new methods to reach out into the
community and sign up new recruits. However, on a recent visit to 103
Battalion, I learned of a particular problem to which I should like to
draw the Minister&#146;s attention&#151;the matter of
qualifications. Young men in 103 Battalion get excellent training in
vehicle maintenance, but it is not recognised by an NVQ, so when they
try to get a job using those skills, they are not considered to be
qualified. Surely it is possible to make that training NVQ accredited
to allow those young people to get the recognition that they deserve.
Such practical steps can help to build links between the local
community and the armed services and to encourage more people to
volunteer for the Territorial Army. I want to see greater integration
between regular forces and reserve forces, because we need both in
today&#146;s modern armed services.</p><p><a name="06062269000231">As I have
said, I want all our servicemen and women to be treated with respect,
and I want the armed services to be a career of choice, not a career of
last resort. I believe that our armed forces are the best in the world
and our biggest asset, and an integral part of our defence policy must
always be to treat them as
such.</p><br><notus-date day="22" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>22 Jun 2006 : Column 1538</b><br><h5 align="left"><a name="06062269000550">3.45

James Arbuthnot (North-East Hampshire) (Con):</b>
It is a pleasure to follow another Hampshire Member,
the hon. Member for Portsmouth, North (Sarah McCarthy-Fry), because
defence is hugely important to the county. It was a pleasure to hear
her speak in support of the armed forces.</p><p><a name="06062269000233">I love these debates. Somehow,
they always take place on Thursday afternoons, when the defence geeks
turn out. We often say the same sort of things, but it gives us the
opportunity to complain. I am no different, and I shall make my
complaints.</p><p><a name="06062269000234">We must
remember the context in which we make our complaints. The background is
that the men and women of our armed services do the most extraordinary
things on behalf of this country. I met some of them in Iraq a couple
of weeks ago, and they were some of the finest men and women one could
possibly hope to meet, risking everything on our behalves and on behalf
of the ideals in which this country believes. We are lucky to be served
by people such as those who are working in Iraq, Afghanistan and
elsewhere.</p><p><a name="06062269000235">In order
not to take up too much of the House&#146;s time, I shall concentrate
on three issues&#151;the strategic nuclear deterrent, Afghanistan,
and Iraq. I do not feel in the least annoyed that the Chancellor has
discussed a matter on which the Defence Committee will issue a report
next week. The report considers the strategic context and timetable for
taking decisions about the strategic nuclear deterrent, and it is the
first of a number of reports that the Committee intends to produce in
this Parliament. Its purpose is to inform and encourage public debate
on that important issue, so I have no doubt that members of the
Committee were delighted when the Chancellor joined the debate last
night.</p><p><a name="06062269000236"><b><a name="06062269000642">Daniel
Kawczynski:</b> My right hon. Friend has been in the House far
longer than me, but I cannot recall a Chancellor of the Exchequer of
any political party making such fundamental pronouncements on defence.
I am surprised by how far the Chancellor has gone, because surely it is
for the Prime Minister or the Secretary of State for Defence to lead on
such issues, rather than the Chancellor?</p><p><a name="06062269000237"><b><a name="06062269000643">Mr.
Arbuthnot:</b> My hon. Friend has not read what the Chancellor
said, because the Minister and my hon. Friend the Member for New
Forest, East (Dr. Lewis) have rightly pointed out that the Chancellor
repeated the Labour manifesto. However, it is mildly irritating that
the Chancellor&#146;s people say one thing in private, while he says
something else in public, and the problem is that we have grown used to
such behaviour from the Labour Government.</p><p><a name="06062269000238">I welcome the fact that in last
night&#146;s remarks the Chancellor appeared to be a genuine convert
to the interests of defence. He
discussed</p><a name="06062269000511"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;the same
strength of national purpose we will demonstrate in protecting our
security in this Parliament and the long-term&#151;strong in defence,
in fighting terrorism, upholding NATO, supporting our armed forces at
home and abroad, and retaining our independent nuclear
deterrent.&#148;</p></ul><br><notus-date day="22" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>22 Jun 2006 : Column 1539</b><br><p><a name="06062269000239">I was delighted to hear that he is intent
on supporting our armed forces at home and abroad. If that implies that
the money for any replacement of the nuclear deterrent will come out of
new money, not current Ministry of Defence programmes, we will be
making some progress with the Chancellor of the Exchequer.</p><p><a name="06062269000240">My Committee has produced a
report on the deployment to Afghanistan, and we will undertake a second
inquiry fairly soon. That deployment has two elements that are
separate, but co-ordinated: the movement of the allied rapid reaction
corps from Rheindahlen to take over the international security
assistance force operation in Kabul; and the 16th Brigade doing a
slightly different job in Helmand. In our report, we concluded that we
fully supported the deployment to Afghanistan and considered it
essential in the interests not only of the economic and social
stability of Afghanistan but of the region and the world as a whole.
The attack on the twin towers demonstrated the consequences of allowing
states to fail, and we felt that it was right to take the action that
we did. In that, I fully echo the remarks made by my right hon. and
learned Friend the Member for Kensington and Chelsea (Sir Malcolm
Rifkind).</p><p><a name="06062269000241">Various
issues arise out of the deployment. It is essential to the credibility
of NATO that the mission should succeed. We are worried about the
national caveats that many members of NATO placed on the use of their
troops. When we visit Afghanistan as a Committee, as we will shortly,
we will need to satisfy ourselves that the rules of engagement, which
the Minister tells us are more robust than any that have operated
before, are a cohesive feature of NATO&#146;s operations. I am afraid
that I do not agree with my right hon. and learned Friend the Member
for Kensington and Chelsea that one can say to countries, &#147;If
you don&#146;t want to play by our rules of engagement, then
don&#146;t come.&#148; The method of collecting troops together to
go to Afghanistan was difficult and time-consuming enough, and too many
countries might simply say, &#147;All right then, we won&#146;t
come.&#148; We need a broad international coalition in a country such
as Afghanistan, given the difficult things that we are doing
there.</p><p><a name="06062269000242">Will the
Minister tell us whether the operational command and control between
ISAF and Operation Enduring Freedom has been fully worked out yet? That
is not entirely clear from the Government&#146;s response to our
report. I am grateful to the Government for providing that response
within two months, to the very day, of the report&#146;s
publication.</p><p><a name="06062269000243">Our report
refers to our worries about air assets and vehicles. We stated that we
were concerned that the Harriers would leave Kandahar in June, and we
were delighted to hear that the Government have decided now, perhaps
because of what we said, perhaps through pressure from NATO, to extend
the deployment of Harriers in Kandahar until at least March next year.
I hope that, by that time, the runway in Kandahar will be upgraded and
can take some of the F16 planes, which can then be brought in from
other countries.</p><p><a name="06062269000244">We were also
pleased when the Ministry of Defence announced in April that, as a
result of requests from commanders in the field, more than 60 Pinzgauer
armoured wheeled vehicles were being ordered for deployment in 
<br><notus-date day="22" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>22 Jun 2006 : Column 1540</b><br>Afghanistan. I was therefore a little surprised when the Minister, in
responding to a question from my hon. Friend the Member for Congleton
(Ann Winterton) about what vehicles would be available, did not confirm
that good news. I hope that he will confirm that the acquisition and
deployment will happen.</p><p><a name="06062269000245">We were unsurprisingly worried
about overstretch. The number of troops in Afghanistan is low and the
tasks that we ask them to perform are difficult. We need to be clear
about their remit. We made the point that there is a fundamental
tension between the aim of destroying the narcotics trade, on which a
huge proportion of the Helmand province relies in order to live, and
introducing security and stability to the area. The Government response
to our report states there is no such tension. I simply cannot
understand the logic of the Government&#146;s position. The tension
exists. That is not to say that the twin roles are wrong. They are
right because one cannot introduce long-term security in a drugs state.
We have to get rid of narcotics from Afghanistan and introduce
stability and security. However, there is tension between the two
roles, which British troops, having worked in Northern Ireland and
Iraq, will be well trained and equipped to
tackle.</p><p><a name="06062269000246">I said that I
was in Iraq a couple of weeks ago with the Defence Committee. We found
greater ground for hope than the media in this country would have us
believe. We were encouraged by the formation of the final building
blocks, which were put in place while we were in Baghdad, of the
Government of Iraq. We were pleased that the Minister for the Interior
and the Minister for Defence were appointed. That will produce some
hope for Iraq. We were encouraged by the fact that the Muthanna
province was close to being ready to be handed over. We were encouraged
by the extent of the training of the tenth division of the Iraqi
security forces. We were told that, in spite of the attacks on people
who tried to join the Iraqi security forces, the Iraqi army is
fundamentally full. It is being trained effectively by British troops,
among others.</p><p><a name="06062269000247">No one would
suggest that the whole picture is encouraging, however. There are
serious worries in Basra and elsewhere. We were not convinced that the
local government in Basra was working in the interests of local people
or the security of Iraq, or that there was any proper control over the
killings between the various power-seeking Shi&#146;a groups.
However, I do not believe that there is an insurgency in Basra. The
insurgency is happening in the north and west of Iraq. In Basra, there
is a power struggle between Shi&#146;a groups who see it as a rich
area that they can exploit for their own interests, and they are using
the most violent and awful means to do so. So there are real worries
about Iraq.</p><p><a name="06062269000248">We felt,
when we talked to our troops in Iraq, that their morale was high. They
are doing the most incredible work in the harshest possible conditions.
I remember travelling through the city of Basra in an un-airconditioned
Warrior armoured personnel carrier, and, when we reached a place of
comparative safety, the mortar cover being taken off. When 50º C
air came flooding in, we thought, &#147;Thank God, that&#146;s
cool!&#148; The working conditions in those vehicles are extremely
difficult, and the troops working in Basra are carrying 40 or 50 lb of
body armour, kit and ammunition, which is very difficult for
them.</p><br><notus-date day="22" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>22 Jun 2006 : Column 1541</b><br><p><a name="06062269000249">It is not just that there is no
fat in the operation. Our troops are not exactly penny pinching, but
they have to juggle all the time with the available personnel, and with
equipment that might be unavailable or going out of service. The number
of helicopters there is tiny, and the number of vehicles is too small.
To return to what the Chancellor has said, and to the support that he
has given to the defence of this country, I hope, now that he has said
those things, that he means them. I also hope that he will put our
money where his mouth
is.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="06062269000551">4.1

Bencher who follows two right hon. colleagues of such great distinction
in these areas as my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for
Kensington and Chelsea (Sir Malcolm Rifkind) and my right hon. Friend
the Member for North-East Hampshire(Mr. Arbuthnot). They know
what they are talking about. I shall therefore seek not to try to equal
their distinction, but to talk about rather different
matters.</p><p><a name="06062269000251">I wholly
agreed with my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Kensington
and Chelsea when he said that this debate should not be about
Afghanistan, Iraq or the renewal of Trident. Those subjects are
sufficiently large to warrant an entire day&#146;s debate or
more&#151;perhaps several days debate over the years to come. To
presume that those topics can be covered in this relatively short
debate this afternoon would be a mistake.</p><p><a name="06062269000252">I therefore
intend to keep off the subjects of Iraq and Afghanistan, apart from
mentioning in passing that my own strongly held opposition to what we
did in Iraq in 2003 is one of the perfectly sensible reasons why I have
ceased to be a Front-Bench spokesman on defence. I could not have
continued to perform that role, given that I did not entirely approve
of what my party was doing at the time. I also have some reservations
about whether we shall be able to look back, in 10 or 20 years time,
and say that what we have done in Afghanistan has been a success. I
very much hope that it will be&#151;it is a job that very much needs
to be done&#151;but whether we can be confident that that is the case
is a matter of some debate. However, Iraq and Afghanistan are matters
that we can debate at length on other occasions. Similarly, the whole
question of the renewal of Trident is a huge matter for debate in the
years to come. It is a matter for the nation, not just for party
politics.</p><a name="06062269000499"><p>I felt
slightly queasy about the Chancellor of the Exchequer&#146;s
intervention into the debate yesterday, not least because, if anyone
takes the opportunity to Google the words &#147;Gordon Brown&#148;
to check up on what the right hon. Gentleman has said on defence, they
will find that, over the past 10 years or thereabouts, he has said
nothing at all on the matter. So far as I am aware, he has never
visited a defence establishment. He took no interest in defence until
last night, when he reiterated what had been said in the Labour party
manifesto, but made it appear that he was making a spectacular
announcement on the &#163;25 billion of defence spending on renewing
Trident. I suspect that that has far more to do with his tactical
position in the Labour party than with a strategic approach to the
defence of the world.</p><p><a name="06062269000253">I want to
spend my time today commenting on something that I was greatly
encouraged to learn that the Government 
<br><notus-date day="22" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>22 Jun 2006 : Column 1542</b><br>are doing. The strategic defence review was, in its time, radical and
far-thinking. Given the 17-year time span, most people thought that it
represented a worthwhile approach, although we regretted the failure to
release the foreign affairs baseline on which the SDR was said to have
been based. A strategic defence review cannot be very good if the
foreign policy baseline is not known. In any event, that relatively
radical and forward-looking document was severely outdated following
one event on 11 September 2001, which made all previous thinking about
defence irrelevant. Defence thinking as a whole had to start again from
scratch.</p><p><a name="06062269000254">I
do not think that the subsequent so-called new chapter of the
SDR&#151;or indeed the defence White Paper, which one of our defence
chiefs described as being more about slogans than about
policies&#151;added much to the debate. I was pleased to hear from
the Minister today that a new strategic context White Paper would be
produced later this year. I hope that it will represent a fundamental
piece of thinking, founded solidly on a foreign policy baseline. It is
no good talking about defence in the abstract; we must talk about it
purely in the context of foreign policy and, nowadays, the context of
security at home. We must involve the Home Office&#151;and the
Department for International Development, in passing&#151;in that
consideration. We need to know what our defence forces are required to
do before deciding how to enable them to do
it.</p><p><a name="06062269000255">There
is a degree of confusion about that. Are our servicemen required to
defend the homeland against an aggressive outside attacker? I suppose
that that is theoretically the case, but it is probably very unlikely.
It is hard to imagine any third party attacking the nation, although of
course it is right for us to have the capability to put up a defence
should that become necessary.</p><p><a name="06062269000256">Is it our job to deter a
potential aggressor? I suppose that the question arises of what we do
if and when it becomes obvious that Iran is going to make use of its
enriched uranium for military rather than any other purposes. If that
becomes obvious, to what degree does international law allow us,
alongside the Americans, to take an aggressive stance of one sort or
another against Iran? At what stage do we believe that pre-emption
becomes a reasonable cause for the use of force?</p><p><a name="06062269000257">During the run-up to the Iraq
war in 2003, it was said that we must stop the Iraqis using their
weapons against our soldiers in Cyprus. That was one of the excuses in
the dodgy dossier. What was ignored for the moment was that Foreign
Office travel advice for tourists was that it was perfectly acceptable
to travel to Cyprus throughout the Iraq crisis, at the same time as the
MOD was telling us that we had to invade Iraq to prevent that from
happening.</p><p><a name="06062269000258">Surely our
armed services have a role to play in home defence. Perhaps the
Territorial Army or the reserve forces could be involved. Surely we
should be playing a significantly greater role in defending our nation
on shore from asymmetric terrorist attack. Is there a bigger role for
the TA than the role conferred on it in the new chapter of the SDR?
Might that bigger role be sorting out huge emergencies? At present, it
appears that we could do a pretty good job if a serious emergency
occurred in London&#151;probably&#151;but what if there were
simultaneous attacks on three of our cities? Would our forces be up to
dealing with that? Might there not be a role for the TA?</p><br><notus-date day="22" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>22 Jun 2006 : Column 1543</b><br><p><a name="06062269000259">Alternatively, is our role to
take part&#151;along with NATO and the United Nations, and possibly
even the European Union, although I doubt it&#151;in some form of
coalition, going around the world and suppressing tyrants? That is
often cited as the reason for what we did against Saddam Hussein in
Iraq&#151;and I am very glad that we did it; he is a bad man and I am
glad that he has gone. But will our role in future be to enter
willingly into coalitions, perhaps alongside the neocon element in the
United States, galloping around the world sorting out bad
men?</p><p><a name="06062269000260">I remember
Richard Perle saying in a notable speech that he believed that the US
was a sort of sheriff, galloping around the world at the head of a
posse sorting out the bad guys. One of the closest advisers to the US
President, he made it clear that anyone not in the posse was one of the
bad guys, and that he believed that we had to perform a type of
neo-imperialist policing duty around the world. Although there may be
some such role to play, we did not play it in Cambodia or Darfur, and
international law provides scant justification for that
approach.</p><p><a name="06062269000261">The Pentagon
has justified what is happening in Iraq, Afghanistan and elsewhere by
saying that a war is being fought against terrorism, but our defence
policy is different. We say that we do not want to engage in warfare
against terrorists, and that we want to prevent asymmetric attacks
being levelled against us. That difference between the UK and US
approaches is very important. In that context, there is one significant
gap in what this country otherwise does rather well, and that is that
we are not entirely clear about why we do some things. In particular,
there are discontinuities in the responsibilities undertaken by the
Foreign Office, the Ministry of Defence and the Home Office. For
example, is the Home Office or the MOD responsible for homeland
defence, or does DFID have a role in that? I believe that we should
consider introducing a sensible military stratagem planning mechanism,
as has happened elsewhere around the world. Another option might be to
establish a Government Department that deals with military planning,
which would consider such matters in very fundamental
terms.</p><p><a name="06062269000262">Moreover, we
need a fundamental discussion of the intelligence services. Should we
retain the present structure of three separate services, or is it time
for them to be amalgamated? My noble Friend Lord Hamilton asked that
very question in the other place only this week. Again, is it right to
retain our three services? Lieutenant-Colonel Tim Collins has said that
he believes that we should abolish the RAF. I hasten to say that I do
not agree with that at all, given that there is a substantial RAF base
in my constituency, but I believe that we should look at the
fundamentals of our defence policy. What are our people being asked to
do, and why? What sort of mechanisms is needed to ensure that they are
able to carry out what is asked of them? We need the sort of grand
strategic policy for the UK that we have not had since
1956.</p><p><a name="06062269000263">As many speakers
have said, our armed forces are very professional, but they suffer from
their own can-do approach. Almost regardless of what politicians ask
them to do, they will salute, turn to the right and march off and do
it. It is possible that they grumble 
<br><notus-date day="22" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>22 Jun 2006 : Column 1544</b><br>about it, in the dark corners of their messes, but they never do so in
public. They do what they are asked to do, and they are incredibly
professional. However, how long can we rely on that can-do approach? I
do not much like the word &#147;overstretch&#148;, but there are
real signs that our armed forces are being asked to do more and more
with less and less. Despite the Chancellor of the Exchequer&#146;s
comforting words last night about the comprehensive spending review
that is coming up shortly, there has been briefing going around to the
effect that the Army could be cut to 80,000 men. That is smaller than
the international definition of what constitutes an Army, and a British
Army of that size would be the smallest since
Waterloo.</p><p><a name="06062269000264">I accept
that all that may be the result of counter-briefing. The Chancellor may
well make it clear during the comprehensive spending review that the
80,000 figure is nothing to worry about, that the reality is not nearly
so bad and that the true figure will be a fantastic 85,000. That would
be a classic example of the sort of thing that the right hon. Gentleman
does. </p><p><a name="06062269000265">We do not need
an Army with 100,000 personnel&#151;we need one that is significantly
larger than that. Our Navy and Air Force also need to be larger, so
that they and the Army can perform all the tasks that this Government,
and all Governments in the foreseeable future, will require of them. In
addition, personnel need to be better paid. What incentive is there to
be an Army corporal, in charge of 10 people in situations of extreme
danger, when the pay is only &#163;14,000 or &#163;15,000 a year?
Police constables get much more. We must look at pay and conditions in
the armed forces, as well as at the equipment&#151;both personal and
on the larger scale&#151;that is provided. We must also consider
every aspect of how our armed forces personnel are sent into war. We
need a fundamental review of why we are doing things, how we can
encourage our people to do them and how to be certain that whatever we
do in the future is done well. One thing is for sure: the European
Union is not worth the paper it is written on with regard to defence.
The notion that we can have some sort of European Union defence force
in the future is laughable. The only countries worth talking about in
the defence world today, and the only people who can truly project
power for good around the world, are the United States and the United
Kingdom acting together in NATO. Without those two nations and NATO, I
shudder to think about the future of our great
globe.</p><p><a name="06062269000266">It is right to have a
fundamental look at what we are asking our armed services to do and
Opposition Members will co-operate with the Government in doing so.
Having done precisely that and published the results, they should look
fundamentally at how best to achieve them. They should look into
manpower and equipment, how our armed forces are structured and the
rules of engagement. They should look at human rights and health and
safety&#151;I was astonished to hear someone say that they were glad
that an exercise had been stopped because someone had twisted their
ankle&#151;the International Criminal Court and how people are asked
to act on the battlefield. All those things are fundamental to doing a
first-class job, which our people have always done, and to continue in
a fully professional way for years to come. If we do not do so, we will
not be able to play the role that we have 
<br><notus-date day="22" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>22 Jun 2006 : Column 1545</b><br>traditionally played&#151;the role of doing significant good in

what do the Government think of our armed forces? I shall give three
examples. First, in 2003, the Deputy Prime Minister&#151;still
hanging in there with his Office&#151;in front of a number of
witnesses, including some of our Doorkeepers, said, &#147;All
soldiers are boneheads.&#148; That is what he thinks of our armed
forces. Secondly, there is the disgraceful way in which the Government
refused to take any action to assist soldiers and others on operations
to register to vote before the last general election. I raised the
matter time and again, as did my hon. Friend the Member for Chichester
(Mr. Tyrie), but the Government took no real action. One can only
surmise why not.</p><p><a name="06062269000272">The
third indicator of the new Labour Government&#146;s view of the armed
forces is seen in a business news leader article, entitled &#147;Huge
cuts threat to defence industry&#148; in the <i> Evening Standard
</i>on 12 June this year. Written by Robert Fox, who is generally
pretty well informed, it
says:</p>

background.</p><br><notus-date day="22" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>22 Jun 2006 : Column 1546</b><br><p><a name="06062269000274">The major point that I should
like to make is about the politicisation and the responsibilities of
senior officers in the armed forces, and then I shall touch on the
situation in Afghanistan. First, on senior officers, last November I
was quoted in <i> The Daily Telegraph</i> as saying that the Chief of
the General Staff, General Sir Mike Jackson, lacked the courage to
stand up for his soldiers. I first discovered that that had been
quoted&#151;I had had a conversation with the journalist&#151;when
I got a telephone call and was asked to ring General Jackson, who had
rung the then leader of the Conservative party. I asked him why he had
phoned the then leader of the Conservative party instead of me, and he
did not really answer. He hectored me down the telephone for 30 minutes
in a somewhat bullying way.</p><p><a name="06062269000275">It is not my business to have
an argument with the Chief of the General Staff, so I am glad to say
that a mutual friend organised a meeting. We had a meeting for an hour
and three quarters. It was a convivial meeting and we discussed things
in a reasonable way. There was not much meeting of minds, but I
accept&#151;I promised him at the time that I would&#151;that I
have no knowledge that he lacks courage. It was quite wrong of me to
have said that he lacks courage, and I withdraw that unreservedly and
apologise to him. I said that I would do that at the first opportunity,
and this is the first opportunity that I have had. However, I did tell
him that I would not withdraw the bit about standing up for his
soldiers, and that is part of what I intend to discuss
today.</p><p><a name="06062269000276">Incidentally, I
have no personal problem with General Jackson, so I do not wish this to
counted as a personal attack on him in any way. He is a public servant
who has given good service to this country over a number of years.
However, I want to look at what has happened to the armed forces over
the past three years&#151;I shall stick to the past three
years.</p><p><a name="06062269000277">We had an
immensely successful Iraq war in March 2003, or whenever it was. We can
all be proud of our soldiers, sailors and airmen for the work that they
did then. Since then we have got immersed, as other hon. Members have
said, in a very difficult situation in Iraq. We have now deployed to
Afghanistan. We have had four battalions of infantry cut from the line
of battle. Notwithstanding what was said by the hon. Member for
Portsmouth, North (Sarah McCarthy-Fry), the TA is haemorrhaging
soldiers. Once they have been to Iraq, where they have an interesting
experience, most of them do not much want to go again. The
reorganisation of the infantry battalions is taking place, too.
Although the arms plot was imperfect, I do not believe that that
reorganisation will lead to a better system for the infantry.</p><p><a name="06062269000278">Demands are now growing for a
federation for armed forces personnel. We have to ask why are those
demands growing. Why are grass-roots members of the armed forces
demanding a federation? Soldiers are public servants. Politicians make
the orders and soldiers must obey politicians&#151;that goes for
field marshals, generals and the like&#151;but senior officers who
demand loyalty from those below them are expected in return to give
loyalty to those whom they command. That was certainly what I was
taught, and hon. Members who have done any form of military service
will know that.</p><br><notus-date day="22" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>22 Jun 2006 : Column 1547</b><br><p><a name="06062269000279">Loyalty goes two ways, and the
chiefs of staff who represent the armed forces in discussions with the
Government should not be seen as the Prime Minister&#146;s
representatives; rather, they should be seen as representing the armed
forces to the Government. I understand that the chiefs of staff have
access to the Prime Minister whenever they want it, but I have not
heard of that access being used during the draconian defence cuts going
on in all three services. What senior officer has resigned recently?
None that I have seen, and there is a growing feeling&#151;it may not
be fair&#151;that some senior officers are apparently more interested
in their careers, in knighthoods and in future cosy appointments than
in the good of the armed forces and the personnel whom they command. I
should like to turn to an example of that: the courts martial that have
been taking place in respect of Iraq.</p><p><a name="06062269000280">Tight
discipline is essential in the armed forces, especially in war, as
anyone who has been in battle knows, but discipline is being undermined
by a growing human rights culture&#151;fostered, I am afraid, by the
Government&#151;that is encouraging barrack-room lawyers. Anyone who
is guilty of a crime in the armed forces must be prosecuted, but we
have a very difficult and continuing war in Iraq. We expect our
soldiers to make split-second life-and-death decisions, while someone
is trying to kill them. That is not the same as being on parade outside
Buckingham palace or, indeed, policing a riot in Trafalgar
square.</p><p><a name="06062269000281">I will use one
case of court martial as an example, because it is completely out of
the courts now&#151;that of Trooper Williams. As hon. Members may
remember, in July 2003 Trooper Williams was part of a patrol that
stopped a handcart that was being pushed along, filled with mortar
bombs. Understandably, the Iraqis pushing the hand-cart scattered.
Trooper Williams and a corporal chased one Iraqi into a courtyard and
then into a house, where he fought with the corporal accompanying
Trooper Williams. Trooper Williams believed&#151;and who are we to
gainsay him, as we were not there?&#151;that the Iraqi was trying to
grab the pistol from the corporal, so he shot him, and he
died.</p><p><a name="06062269000282">Rightly, the
case was taken up by the commanding officer of the regiment to which
Trooper Williams was attached. He was arrested and investigated and
brought before that commanding officer, who, having taken legal advice,
dismissed the case, as was his right. He made a judgment that Trooper
Williams was not guilty.</p><p><a name="06062269000283">What happened next? Brigadier
Vowles and Major-General Howell&#151;both of whom, as I understand
it, are primarily lawyers, rather than soldiers by first
profession&#151;queried the decision. A memo dated March 2004, from
the then Adjutant-General&#151;I believe it was Sir Alistair
Irwin&#151;was sent to the Chief of the General Staff. It
states:</p><a name="06062269000513"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;With
the current legal, political and ginger group interest in the deaths of
Iraqi civilians...there is a significant possibility that this
case, our investigation and subsequent failure to offer for prosecution
could become a <i> cause c&#233;lèbre </i>for pressure groups
and a significant threat to the maintenance of the military justice
system. If the Attorney General became aware of it in the meantime, it
is possible that would himself order a review of the
case.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06062269000284">So this
prosecution was all about ginger groups and the possibility that the
case could become a cause c&#233;lèbre 
<br><notus-date day="22" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>22 Jun 2006 : Column 1548</b><br>for pressure groups. I ask the senior officers involved: does that
constitute standing up for Trooper
Williams?</p><p><a name="06062269000285">Following
that, Trooper Williams was charged with murder under the civilian
system and was to be taken to the Old Bailey. He was 18 years old when
the incident took place, and for a year and a half he was under threat
of trial at the Old Bailey. I suggest that that is a pretty serious
matter for anybody.</p><p><a name="06062269000286">On 7 April last year, at the
Old Bailey, the Crown offered no evidence. I have been told by a senior
officer that Williams should be grateful to the Army because, now that
he has been tried at the Old Bailey, he cannot be tried again. I wonder
what he thinks about
that.</p><p><a name="06062269000287">What was the
role of the Attorney-General,Lord Goldsmith, in all this? The
trial judge, Mrs. Justice Hallett, believed that this was possibly a
novel intervention by Her Majesty&#146;s Attorney-General. One of her
judgments
says:</p><a name="06062269000514"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;No-one
in the Army has apparently thought to advise Trooper Williams that
although his commanding officer had found in his favour he might still
face a civilian prosecution. That is apparently because this is the
first time&#148;&#151;</p></ul><p><a name="06062269000288">the
first time&#151;</p><a name="06062269000515"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;to
the knowledge of those appearing before me and called before me, that
her Majesty&#146;s Attorney General has sought to exercise the powers
accorded to him.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06062269000289">In a written answer to my noble
Friend Lord Astor of 10 November 2005, the Attorney-General, speaking
about the five members of the 2nd Royal Tank Regiment whose case was
dismissed last year,
said:</p><a name="06062269000516"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;I considered the
matter and...I decided that the case should be referred to the CPS
because...while there is no suggestion that the court martial
would not deal with it impartially, justice would be seen to be done by
ventilating the issues in the civilian
courts&#148;.&#151;[<i> Official Report, House of Lords,</i> 10
November 2005; Vol. 675, c.
111W.]</p></ul><p><a name="06062269000290">Are this Government and
their senior officers standing up for soldiers, or ventilating issues
in civilian courts?</p><p><a name="06062269000291">I
do not expect anything better from a commercial lawyer who happens to
be a Minister of the Crown because of his friendship with the Prime
Minister, but these people have no idea of the pressures on soldiers,
who have to take life-and-death decisions in such situations. Their
senior officers should stand up for them, and they should expect better
from them. This Government have politicised senior officers in a way
that has not happened before. Let me give two examples. I have in my
hand an edition of <i> The House Magazine</i>&#151;one cannot get much
more political than the in-house magazine of this place&#151;that
contains a big interview with the Chief of the General Staff. He also
did the Andrew Marr programme, which is the BBC&#146;s major
political programme on a Sunday morning.</p><p><a name="06062269000292">Too often, senior officers are
seen as apologists for Government policy, rather than as those who are
obliged to carry out Government policy. If they disagree with me they
are very welcome to say so, but I hope that they will consider my
words, and whether there is some truth in what I am
saying.</p><p><a name="06062269000293"><b><a name="06062269000648">Mr.

soldiers of junior, and not so junior, rank to whom I have spoken. Nor
is it just retired soldiers who think so, but a large number of serving
soldiers and officers. I ask that senior officers consider whether
there is anything right in my words. If I am wrong, they will dismiss
me and ignore me, I am sure, as the Minister surely will.</p><p><a name="06062269000298">Let me turn
to Afghanistan. A good debate was instigated yesterday by my hon.
Friend the Member for Gravesham (Mr. Holloway). I counsel caution. The
situation is difficult, and although I supported the action to oppose
the Taliban in 2001, and since&#151;we cannot just run away&#151;we
should none the less consider the history of the Afghan wars.
Yesterday, my hon. Friend

&#147;Bugles and a Tiger&#148;, John Masters describes British
soldiers still being flayed alive within the lifetime of some Members
still serving in this House. I do not want to dwell on that, but shall
perhaps quote
Kipling:</p><a name="06062269000520"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;When
you're wounded and left on Afghanistan's
plains</p></ul><a name="06062269000521"><ul><p class="tabletext">And the women

soldier.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06062269000300">There
is no easy solution to Afghanistan, but I suggest we look at more
recent campaigns, such as Dhofar, in which small numbers of soldiers
supporting local troops did fantastic work. I view the campaign with
great foreboding, and urge caution. I thought the points made by the
shadow Secretary of State about how we need more helicopters and
support if we are to expect our soldiers to work there were quite
excellent.</p><p><a name="06062269000301">Our
soldiers, sailors and airmen deserve our support, and they deserve
reasoned decisions from the Government. They expect a Government to
respect them and look after their interests in a way that I do not
believe this one does. They also expect their senior officers to show
loyalty to their subordinates. I hope that they will, notwithstanding
the examples that I have given.</p><p><a name="06062269000302">Finally, I am sure everyone
knows that Julius Caesar said that soldiers are not as other men, and
when they think they are, they cease to be our guardians. Our soldiers,
sailors and airmen are our guardians, and we should support them to the
best of our
ability.</p><br><notus-date day="22" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>22 Jun 2006 : Column 1550</b><br><h5 align="left"><a name="06062269000553">4.33

Kawczynski (Shrewsbury and Atcham) (Con):</b>
It is a great, if daunting, pleasure to follow my
hon. Friend the Member for Blaby (Mr. Robathan) who has a great deal
more knowledge on this issue than I have. I have rarely heard such an
impassioned speech in the House of Commons. If only more people in the
Labour Government had had such direct experience of the armed forces,
we might not have so many foreign military
interventions.</p><p><a name="06062269000304">I shall
hone in on Muthana, the Iraqi desert region on the borders of Saudi
Arabia and Kuwait from which it has been announced that British troops
will pull out. That is very good news and I applaud the Government for
having managed to secure that withdrawal.</p><p><a name="06062269000305">There are many service
personnel in Iraq from my constituency. I have been in the Chamber all
afternoon in order to have the opportunity to pay a personal tribute to
and to applaud service personnel from Shrewsbury and Shropshire who are
serving their country in Iraq.</p><p><a name="06062269000306">Recently, James Holt, a
journalist on our local newspaper, the <i> Shrewsbury Chronicle</i>, was
sent to Iraq and has been sending back photographs and stories about
our servicemen and their experiences. Those reports in our local paper
have really brought home to me and my constituents the fact that real
people from our community are out there fighting for their
country&#151;our neighbours, brothers and sisters. I am always in awe
at the sacrifices that they
make.</p><p><a name="06062269000307">I cannot call
for a withdrawal from Iraq at this stage; it is not my party&#146;s
policy and I am a loyal Back Bencher. However, I want to say two things
about which I feel passionately&#151;I hope they do not get me into
too much trouble with the Whips. Last week,Mr. Ken Tyrell led
a large delegation of people from Shrewsbury to see me to discuss the
war in Iraq. They passionately wanted to know when our troops would be
withdrawn. They feel desperately sad when they tune into Prime
Minister&#146;s questions week after week to hear the Prime Minister
and the Leader of the Opposition expressing condolences to the families
of British servicemen who have been killed. That is a very emotive
issue for my constituents. They applaud the Government for withdrawing
our troops from Muthana and hope that soon we will be able to leave
further provinces in the capable hands of the
Iraqis.</p><p><a name="06062269000308">My second
point will stay with me for as long as I am a Member of Parliament. It
is the most emotional thing I have ever come across, certainly from a
political perspective. In January and February 2003, in the run-up to
the war in Iraq, I received more than 200 letters from Shrewsbury
women&#151;but not one man&#151;to tell me that they were worried
that our country was going against the wishes of the United Nations,
the Secretary-General of the UN, Hans Blix and every other opinion.
They said:</p><a name="06062269000524"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;We
are worried and concerned that our country is going to war in these
circumstances.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06062269000309">Those 200
Shrewsbury women, and my wife, convinced me that I should be against
the war in Iraq. Week after week, I wrote in my local newspaper that
the war was wrong. At the time, I was merely a parliamentary candidate,
so it was much easier to express those views, 
<br><notus-date day="22" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>22 Jun 2006 : Column 1551</b><br>but now that I am an MP it will be interesting to see what happens in
the future when I have to follow the party Whip. However, our
experience in Iraq makes me cautious about our engaging in future wars
in Iran and other countries.</p><p><a name="06062269000310"><b><a name="06062269000653">Mr.
Mark Harper (Forest of Dean) (Con):</b> Perhaps I can help my
hon. Friend. Regardless of his views before the Iraq war, does not he
accept that, as he became a Member of Parliament afterwards, and given
the situation that we face in Iraq, we need to make sure we leave only
when the situation is stabilised and that we leave a stable country
behind when the job is done? Despite the fact that he may have been
against the war at the beginning, I am sure that he wants our troops to
leave with honour a stable country with a functioning liberal
democracy.</p><p><a name="06062269000311"><b><a name="06062269000654">Daniel
Kawczynski:</b> I thank my hon. Friend for that intervention
and I entirely agree. That is why I am not calling for the withdrawal
of our troops. As I said to Mr. Tyrell and my other constituents, it
would be wrong for us to pull out prematurely; our international
reputation would suffer even more if we did so.</p><p><a name="06062269000312">I am
concerned about the lack of assistance in these situations from other
permanent members of the Security Council. China and Russia are two
huge military powers with extraordinary military spending and military
capability, but they are mute on international problems and situations
such as Sierra Leone, Iraq and Afghanistan. If we are successfully to
police the world, those important members of the Security Council have
to become more involved, as do other NATO countries and other European
Union countries that have not fulfilled their roles properly in sending
enough peacekeepers to Iraq. We simply have too few troops ourselves to
police the whole world in conjunction with the Americans.</p><p><a name="06062269000313">At some stage, we may have to
reorganise the permanent members of the Security Council of the United
Nations. They were drawn up immediately after the second world war. We
now face a very different world. Perhaps countries such as Germany,
although I have mixed views on
Germany<i> &#151;[</i><i> Interruption.</i><i> ]</i> My grandfather was
Polish. Perhaps countries such as Germany, which are increasingly
economically and militarily powerful, should be included as permanent
members to get them to participate in these issues.</p><p><a name="06062269000314">Trident should be replaced and
we should have a modern version of a nuclear defence capability. I am
amazed by statements by certain Labour Members calling for us to scrap
the replacement of our Trident system. In this dangerous world, a
United Kingdom without Trident, or a replacement for Trident, would be
held to ransom by countries such as Iran. Nuclear weapons have kept the
peace in Europe for more than 60 years and we must retain a nuclear
arms capability. I am pleased that Gordon Brown has supported
replacement&#151;</p><p><a name="06062269000315"><b><a name="06062269000655">Mr.

in an earlier intervention, it is important to have parliamentary
scrutiny of the replacement of our nuclear capability. My vote will
certainly be influenced by the options. If one option is simply to buy
something from the Americans, to me that is nowhere near as attractive
as having a nuclear capability primarily designed and primarily
manufactured in our own country. When we have the debate, I hope that
the Minister and the Government will give us the opportunity to decide
between two or three options, rather than merely to vote yes or no to a
new modern version of Trident.</p><p><a name="06062269000318">Very little
has been said about veterans, but, for me, veterans are of great
importance. I draw the Minister&#146;s attention to Polish veterans,
in particular. One in six airmen in the battle of Britain was Polish. I
am extremely proud of the role that my ancestors played in that. I know
that people from many countries&#151;countries that were occupied by
the Germans&#151;came and sought sanctuary in Britain in 1940 and we
have to respect all of them. However, I argue&#151;I put this point
to the Minister as forcefully as I can&#151;that the Poles have a
unique and special role when it comes to foreign veterans in this
country. I hope that, on future Remembrance days, those people will be
acknowledged as unique, and quite apart from the French, Czechs, Dutch
and others, because of the huge number who came and the courage and
valour that they showed in the battle of

must use our armed forces far closer to home. We have heard today about
the interventions around the world in which our dedicated British armed
forces are involved, but I delicately and gently suggest to the
Minister that we have to use the expertise of the military to deal with
some of the critical problems that we experience as an island nation in
Europe. We need to try to deal with the things that matter to
people.</p><p><a name="06062269000322">I make no
apology for raising this matter. I speak following one of the most
difficult weeks that I have had as a Member of Parliament because one
of my constituents&#151;a young Shrewsbury girl&#151;was raped by a
failed asylum seeker from Africa. I am the chairman of the all-party
group on Mauritania. I am appalled by the lack of financial assistance
and expert training that we are giving to Mauritania and other west
African countries to help them to deal with the thousands of illegal
immigrants who pour from west Africa, via the port of Nouakchott in
Mauritania, to the Canary Islands and ultimately the United Kingdom.
Many people die on the perilous journey to the Canary Islands. There is
an appalling and tragic situation right on our doorstep, but despite
all the questions that I have tabled, all that has happened so far is
that the European Union has sent a couple of dinky tug boats to help.
Surely the Government should be doing more 
<br><notus-date day="22" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>22 Jun 2006 : Column 1553</b><br>about such a grave matter and using the expertise of our armed forces to
help the Mauritanians to train their navy to police their waters more
efficiently and thus stop the terrible human tragedy of immigration
from west Africa to Europe, which causes great suffering. I make that
point strongly to the Minister.</p><p><a name="06062269000323">The
Territorial Army is in crisis. Many personnel are leaving due to the
huge pressures that are imposed on them. My right hon. and learned
Friend the Member for Devizes (Mr. Ancram) recently stated that
recruitment to the TA is in crisis, and I totally agree with him. Other
hon. Members have commented on the parlous state of the TA. During a
debate on defence a few months ago, the then Minister rejected our
concerns about the TA and assured us that numbers in the TA were
rising, but that is not the case. Anyone who examines the figures will
see that there is a tremendous outflow of members, so we need to do
something about
that.</p><p><a name="06062269000324"><b><a name="06062269000659">Mr.
Ellwood:</b> I am sorry to interrupt my hon. Friend&#146;s
flow because he is making a powerful speech. I went to a briefing at
the Ministry of Defence about the TA and its numbers. Does he agree
that it is upsetting to hear that members of the university officer
training corps are now being included as part of the overall numbers
for our TA, which is distorting the figures that show our true
strength?</p><p><a name="06062269000325"><b><a name="06062269000660">Daniel
Kawczynski:</b> I agree with my hon. Friend. That practice
shows how desperate the situation is. The Government will spin it in
any way they can to make the situation look better, but I have spoken
to loyal members of the TA in my constituency, who have been extremely
forthright&#151;more forthright than I would have
imagined&#151;about their
concerns.</p><p><a name="06062269000326">Lastly,
there are huge dangers in European defence co-operation across the
board. The European Union wants a common defence force that would act
almost as one across the entire European Union. We are the strongest
military nation in the EU and we should cherry-pick our closest
collaborators and partners. The Europe of 25 nation states has widely
varying levels of capability. If I may say so, rather controversially,
we can rely on seven countries in the European Union far more than on
others to support us in combat. One of those&#151;I do not apologise
for mentioning it&#151;is Poland. We should cherry-pick our partners
and not have a common European defence
force.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="06062269000554">4.51
pm</h5><p><a name="06062269000327"><b><a name="06062269000661">Mr.
Lee Scott (Ilford, North) (Con):</b> I open
my remarks by paying tribute to the men and women of our armed forces.
Their determination, courage and sheer professionalism ensure that the
quality of Britain&#146;s armed forces is second to none in the
world. It should be remembered that large numbers of the personnel
deployed are members of the Territorial Army. Their involvement is
vital to the scale of the commitment of British forces overseas. Our
military continue to do a tremendous job, serving their country both
here in the United Kingdom and in many deployments
overseas.</p><p><a name="06062269000328">I am sure
the House will join me in acknowledging the debt we owe to all our
service personnel who have lost their lives in the most recent
conflicts. We owe them a debt of gratitude, and our thoughts and
prayers must go to their families and friends.</p><br><notus-date day="22" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>22 Jun 2006 : Column 1554</b><br><p><a name="06062269000329">It is vital to
remember the harsh fact that the UK spends just 2.2 per cent. of its
gross domestic product on defence. That is the lowest figure committed
to our armed forces since 1930. In addition, we must remember the high
cost of modern high-tech weapons systems. A modern naval destroyer may
be a formidable combat asset, but no amount of high-tech wizardry can
get the vessel deployed to two separate locations at the same
time.</p><p><a name="06062269000330">Our spend of
2.2 per cent. of GDP on defence may be low by Britain&#146;s historic
benchmark, but it is higher than that of our European partners. For
example, Germany spends 1.4 per cent. of its GDP on defence, Spain 1.3
per cent. and Austria only 0.7 per cent. on defence, although it must
be remembered that those nations have very limited overseas
deployments. The United States of America, however, spends more than 4
per cent. of its GDP to fund its
military.</p><p><a name="06062269000331">We all
recollect the reports of equipment shortages suffered by our troops in
Iraq in 2003. Those were caused by the decision to hold off any
preparation until late November 2002, four months before the start of
the conflict. Ammunition, body armour and radios were among the
equipment in short supply. During the war, members of 7 Parachute
Regiment, Royal Horse Artillery were forced to use captured AK47s
because their own SA80 rifles jammed. That was a direct result of
insufficient supplies of oil to keep them
functioning.</p><p><a name="06062269000332">The
American soldiers and marines in Iraq have access to RG-31 Nyala
mine-protected vehicles which enable the crew to survive the blast of
an improvised explosive device. Canadian troops deployed in Afghanistan
also use RG-31s. British soldiers and Royal Marines need to make do
with lightly protected Land Rovers. That is not acceptable. Shortages
of vital spare parts mean that tanks, armoured personnel carriers and
other vehicles are being cannibalised to keep other vehicles
operational. Similar practices are used to keep aircraft operational
and ships seaworthy.</p><p><a name="06062269000333">Military
equipment wears out, it is damaged, or it becomes obsolete, so it must
be replaced. In Portsmouth, for example, there are 19 redundant
warships. In too many cases, their replacements&#151;we have heard
that equipment will be replaced&#151;have not been built or, in the
case of aircraft carriers, have not even been designed. Too often in
recent years, new equipment has been delivered late or over budget. In
a speech at the 2001 Labour party conference, the Prime Minister
promised a &#147;strong defence capability&#148;. The reality,
however, is that the Government have delivered cuts in service
personnel, aircraft, tanks and ships. There are fewer trained personnel
in the British Army, the Royal Navy and the Royal Air Force than in
1997, despite a significant increase in defence commitments.</p><p><a name="06062269000334">According to
Lord Guthrie, the former Chief of the Defence Staff, in <i> The Sunday
Telegraph</i> on 12 September 2004, the Army is &#147;dangerously
small&#148;. Cuts have been made to the Territorial Army, which is at
its lowest strength ever, as my hon. Friend the Member for Bournemouth,
East (Mr. Ellwood) said. Current operations rely on the men and women
of the TA, but the frequency and length of deployments discourage
people from signing up to the TA, the Royal Naval Reserve and the Royal
Auxiliary Air Force. Government cuts in manpower and extra commitments
mean that our armed forces are dangerously overstretched. In April this
year, the Select 
<br><notus-date day="22" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>22 Jun 2006 : Column 1555</b><br>Committee on Defence report on the MOD&#146;s annual accounts
identified the overstretch in our armed forces as a cause of concern.
The rules for minimum gaps between tours are breached in the Army, Navy
and Air Force, and critical shortfalls in manpower have had a severe
impact on specialist units.</p><p><a name="06062269000335">Our
military forces are being asked to do more than at any time since the
second world war, as major operations have taken place almost every
year since 1997. There have been new peacekeeping deployments,
including one to Kosovo, and lengthy, ongoing operations in Iraq and
Afghanistan have increased our commitments. In addition, the armed
forces have had to assist in civil operations, tackling the foot and
mouth outbreak in 2001 and providing services during the
firemen&#146;s strike of 2002-03. It is unfair and self-defeating to
keep taking personnel away from their families, and to provide
unreasonably short breaks between operational tours, as that imposes an
intolerable strain on family relationships and results in a far higher
failure to retain experienced recruits.</p>

<p><a name="06062269000336">Finally, I should like to touch
on some personal issues. In the first Gulf conflict, I was in Israel
when Saddam Hussein launched his Scud missile attacks on Tel Aviv and
other Israeli towns. The hon. Member for Leyton and Wanstead (Harry
Cohen) was concerned that Saddam Hussein would not receive a fair
trial. Did Saddam Hussein give a fair trial to the tens of thousands of
people he massacred or to the people he gassed? He could not care less
about any of his citizens. He is receiving a fairer trial than he gave
anyone in his country. Iraq is a better place without Saddam Hussein,
who was no great philanthropist.</p><p><a name="06062269000337">I was not a Member of
Parliament when the decision to go to war in Iraq was made. We must
weigh up the situation. The loss of civilian life is terrible&#151;I
do not believe that anyone in any part of the House would say
otherwise&#151;but democracy allows the people to decide their own
future. It is pointless to pretend that there will not be troubles
along the way. Our involvement could have been better thought out, but
that does not mean that it was wrong to remove a vile dictator who
could not care less about his own people.</p><p><a name="06062269000338">I do not pretend that my
constituency is a military one, but many people have contacted me about
Afghanistan and the vile trade in drugs that end up on the streets of
my constituency. Charitable organisations try to stop our youngsters
getting on to drugs, and if youngsters are unfortunate enough to get on
to drugs, they help them with rehabilitation. The situation can only be
helped by Afghanistan not exporting drugs to Europe, America and
elsewhere.</p><p><a name="06062269000339">Too often,
we hear people condemn our troops for their actions. As has been said,
however, we must recognise the tough job that our troops are doing. We
are not talking about policing the streets of my constituency, although
given the antisocial behaviour that sometimes takes place, perhaps that
is what we need. Our troops are in an area in which they are being
attacked daily. People are blowing themselves up to kill innocent
civilians, and many of the deaths involve innocent civilians being
killed by insurgents, who also attack our troops. I, for one, think
that our troops are doing a wonderful job and that we should be proud
of everything that they do rather than condemning
them.</p><br><notus-date day="22" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>22 Jun 2006 : Column 1556</b><br><p><a name="06062269000340"><b><a name="06062269000662">Mr.
Ellwood:</b> My hon. Friend is making a passionate speech and
pointing out some of the concerns, which many of us share, about
Afghanistan. We have not covered the responsibility of
Afghanistan&#146;s neighbours to challenge the trade in narcotics. My
hon. Friend has mentioned China, but does he agree that Pakistan has a
role to play in preventing narcotics from being moved into the United
Kingdom?</p><p><a name="06062269000341"><b><a name="06062269000663">Mr.
Scott:</b> My hon. Friend has made a valuable point, and he is
correct. I watched this Chamber before I was a Member of Parliament,
and I have watched it since I became a Member of Parliament. I have
seen politicians of all parties score political points at the expense
of our wonderful troops, who protect us and defend our lives. No one
wants to see civilians, whether they are in Afghanistan or Iraq, being
killed, but what is done is done, and we are duty bound to make sure
that Iraq and, indeed, Afghanistan are better places when we leave than
when we went in. I think that we will achieve that goal, and I pray
that we will. Have wrongs been committed? It is alleged that they have,
and if they have, they must be looked into and rectified, but that does
not make everything
wrong.</p><p><a name="06062269000342">In a previous
life, I worked for an international charity with which I visited
Ramallah. When I went into houses there, the people wanted a roof over
their heads, food on the table and a peaceful existence&#151;it is
never the majority who cause the problem; it is always the minority. We
can all make a difference, whether or not we agreed with the war in
Iraq, and whether or not we think that we should be in Afghanistan. The
people expect us to make a difference, and if we let them down, perhaps
we are betraying what we are here for.</p><p><a name="06062269000343">In my year in Parliament, I
have not made that many speeches in this House, because I believe that
unless one has something relevant to say, one should not say
anything&#151;perhaps I am unique in thinking that. However, this
matter is important, which is why I am proud to speak in this
debate.</p><p><a name="06062269000344">In
conclusion, our troops are doing a marvellousjob. I hope that
they are home soon for them andtheir families, and I hope that
there are no more announcements expressing condolences to the families
of troops who have lost their lives doing our work. I am proud of our
troops&#151;I am sure that everyone else is, too&#151;and I send
them my good wishes and wish them a speedy return

Tobias Ellwood (Bournemouth, East) (Con):</b> It is a pleasure
to be called towards the end of this debate and to follow my hon.
Friend the Member for Ilford, North (Mr. Scott), who spoke thoughtfully
and passionately about our debt of gratitude to our armed forces. I am
sure that we all share those
thoughts.</p><p><a name="06062269000346">I join my
right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Kensington and Chelsea
(Sir Malcolm Rifkind) in saying that we have had an interesting,
thoughtful and provocative debate, but I am afraid that it has been far
too wide ranging. We have managed to cover subjects as diverse as Army
barracks, the joint strike fighter, operations in Iraq and the nuclear
deterrent, not to mention all the other issues that are so important to
us as individual Members or to the nation as a whole. We 
<br><notus-date day="22" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>22 Jun 2006 : Column 1557</b><br>cannot go into all those areas in sufficient depth in the course of one
afternoon&#146;s debate. I hope that the Minister and the usual
channels will bear in mind that we need properly to analyse the
decisions made by Government and scrutinised by
Parliament.</p><p><a name="06062269000347"><b><a name="06062269000665">Mr.
Ingram:</b> The hon. Gentleman and I have exchanged comments
on this before. I take on board his general sentiments, but remind him
that this is the third in a series of defence debates, with another one
still to come. We try to separate out the various subject headings so
that we can concentrate on one at a time. Personnel will be the next
subject, while equipment was the previous one. Policy is a very
wide-ranging subject. If we do not specify certain topics, Members will
mention them anyway, because they talk about the things that they want
to talk
about.</p><p><a name="06062269000348"><b><a name="06062269000666">Mr.
Ellwood:</b> I am grateful to the Minister
for that helpful comment. I have a huge amount of respect for him, as
he knows, but he must be aware of my views given my intervention on him
at the start of the debate. The proposed subject of today&#146;s
business is defence policy and the fifth report from the Defence
Committee on the UK deployment to Afghanistan. Afghanistan is not
solely a military topic, so representatives from the Department for
International Development and the Foreign and Commonwealth Office
should be here as
well.</p><p><a name="06062269000349"><b><a name="06062269000667">Mr.
Ingram:</b> The hon. Gentleman makes useful contributions, but
I think that he has misunderstood the title of the debate, which is
about defence policy. The Defence Committee has tabled its report on
Afghanistan&#151;it could have tabled any of its reports&#151;so
that becomes a subject for discussion, but the debate is about defence
policy
overall.</p><p><a name="06062269000350"><b><a name="06062269000668">Mr.
Ellwood:</b> Either way, I think that the Minister understands
my point. If we are to do justice to the important subject of
Afghanistan, I should like to see not just him on the Front Bench, but
his colleagues from DFID and the FCO.</p><p><a name="06062269000351">One of the major topics that we
have discussed this week is our nuclear deterrent capability. That came
about because of the comments that the Chancellor made in his Mansion
House speech last night. I found those comments very unhelpful. He sent
a confusing message as to what the Government mean by long-term
strategy, and a patronising message to the House of Commons about how
and when debates on such subjects should occur. A decision has to be
made on this important subject, and I am pleased that my hon. Friends
on the Front Bench have said that we will demand a vote on it. The
nation expects us to debate and to vote on it. It is sad that the
Government are putting out messages here and there to satisfy&#151;or
agonise&#151;Labour Back Benchers, instead of promoting the debate on
this country&#146;s nuclear deterrent.</p><p><a name="06062269000352">We have already heard confusing
messages on the subject. As the Minister will be aware, we design and
make our own nuclear deterrent. The bombs are British; the American
component is the delivery vehicle&#151;the D5 missile. Without that,
we obviously do not have the ability to deliver. Without the nuclear 
<br><notus-date day="22" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>22 Jun 2006 : Column 1558</b><br>submarines, we do not have the capacity to move the missiles. All those
issues are up for debate because they have a shelf life and therefore
need to be discussed in the next year or so. Perhaps the
Under-Secretary will give us some idea in his winding-up speech of the
official timetable, bearing in mind the Chancellor&#146;s comments
last night.</p><p><a name="06062269000353">The
Minister said that the debate was wide ranging and I want to consider
missiles and missile capability. We talk about the subject with
passion, whether or not it involves our constituents. We speak about
the Royal Air Force, the Navy and the Army, but the advent of new
missile technology is changing the conduct of warfare. For example, the
radar systems that we now use mean that an aircraft-borne rather than a
ship-based radar is required to keep our battleships safe. That is a
fundamental change from the time of the Falklands war.</p><p><a name="06062269000354">The Storm Shadow missile can be
fired from 350 km away. If a missile can be fired from such a position,
that changes warfare. It perhaps calls into question the existence of
the artillery. I realise that, with that sentence, I have upset a
massive chunk of the British Army, but it is a major question that we
need to answer. What is the role of the artillery, given that an AS90,
which is the standard artillery weapon, can fire only 15 miles, yet
requires a battery of troops to provide the facility? Storm
Shadow&#151;indeed, any of the weapons systems that now
exist&#151;has changed the operational nature of what we
do.</p><p><a name="06062269000355">We have not held a
debate about where we are going in the next five to 10 years because of
changes in technology. That is the sort of debate for which I am asking
the
Minister.</p><p><a name="06062269000356"><b><a name="06062269000669">Mr.
Ingram:</b> The hon. Gentleman should examine the debates on
the consideration that we have given to future Army structure. That
consideration is about restructuring the Army away from heavy into
medium and light. Much re-roling is happening to deal with some of the
issues that he mentioned and, importantly, to return to the Army some
3,000 posts in the specialist pinch points. Those key enablers will
strengthen the Army&#146;s capacity. That takes time, but we are
investing in
it.</p><p><a name="06062269000357"><b><a name="06062269000670">Mr.
Ellwood:</b> I am grateful for that intervention, which
provides some clarity. I hope that the debate will not be confined to
the Army, but extend to the military as a whole.</p><p><a name="06062269000358">A comment was made about
disbanding the RAF. I hope that that does not happen but we must bear
in mind that aircraft have been divided into two huge sections. A small
or medium-sized helicopter is under the umbrella of the Army, whereas a
large-scale helicopter or a fixed-wing plane is under that of the RAF.
However, a commander wants to have the full array of assets under his
command. He does not want to go through another operational level or a
separate cell to call on those assets. We need to consider such command
structures.</p><p><a name="06062269000359">I want to
consider the Typhoon&#151;the Eurofighter. The first tranche is due
now&#151;I believe that there are55 aircraft, but I stand to
be corrected if that is not the case. However, they were procured
during the cold war 
<br><notus-date day="22" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>22 Jun 2006 : Column 1559</b><br>and they are air-to-air combat aircraft. I do not know with how many
nations we shall have dogfights. Again, the technology has moved on, as
has the enemy. We need to be ready for any scenario&#151;for any
development or future threat&#151;but to devise an aircraft that has
only air-to-air capability limits our ability to defend our
nation.</p><p><a name="06062269000360">The Typhoon
has great missile capability: ASRAAM and AMRAAM are medium-range and
short-range missiles but, again, they are air-to-air. We need them,
especially to deal with threats such as 9/11, but we also need the
capability to support our troops in Iraq and Afghanistan, where there
is a ground threat. We therefore need to be able to take out ground
targets.</p><p><a name="06062269000361">The armoury
of the missiles in our portfolio is not compatible with all our
aircraft. Storm Shadow, Maverick, Brimstone and Paveway are our ground
attack missiles, but none of them can be used on the Eurofighter. I
wrote to the Secretary of State to ask what air-to-ground missile
system the Eurofighter would employ. The reply
was:</p><a name="06062269000525"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Integration
of air to ground missile systems onto RAF Typhoon, including the Storm
Shadow cruise missile and the Brimstone air-launched anti-armour
weapon, is being considered as part of the Typhoon Future Capability
Programme.&#148;&#151;[<i> Official Report</i>, 17 May 2006; Vol.
446, c. 954W.]</p></ul><p><a name="06062269000362">That is not good
enough. We simply cannot spend millions of pounds on 230 aircraft that
are unable to share the array of missiles that we need because the
technology and the way in which we conduct warfare have changed. Our
Jaguars are disappearing, our Harriers are being sold off and our
Tornadoes are coming to the end of their shelf life, but there is no
sign of the joint strike fighter coming on line. Our ground attack
capability is therefore questionable, yet that is the very capability
that we need in Afghanistan and Iraq.</p><p><a name="06062269000363">Afghanistan
has been the focus of many hon. Members&#146; contributions today. I
had the honour to visit Afghanistan last week, and it was quite an
eye-opening experience. The openness of the country was the first thing
that struck me. Of course, there is a handful of major cities, but
beyond them much of the mountain and desert terrain is inhospitable.
Every so often, there is a river basin&#151;such as that of the
Helmand river&#151;that is heavily concentrated with villages and
towns. Such places are widely spread apart. A tiny village in Helmand
province, for example, is extremely remote from what is happening in
Kandahar or Kabul. That means that the people there do not hear the
advice, the directions or the words of support that are coming from the
Afghan Government. They are very much looking after themselves. These
villages consist of tribal communities, and their loyalties are to the
families and to the tribes of which they are part, rather than to the
country of Afghanistan as a whole. Indeed, the word
&#147;country&#148; should perhaps be used advisedly in that
location. It is clear that, in that atmosphere, the Taliban and
al-Qaeda are able to dominate and to work almost without feeling a
threat from the NATO or ISAF forces.</p><p><a name="06062269000364">While I was
in Afghanistan, I had the opportunity to visit the ISAF headquarters
and see the co-ordination between the Department for International
Development and other international organisations. I am pleased to 
<br><notus-date day="22" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>22 Jun 2006 : Column 1560</b><br>say that our operations are working very closely together. There is no
doubt about that. However, we are now spending about &#163;45 million
a year from the DFID budget and about &#163;50 million from the
military budget. Where is the accountability? Where is the
co-ordination? I called for more than just one Minister to come to the
debate today to explain what is happening in that regard.</p><p><a name="06062269000365">I also had the opportunity to
meet General Jones, the NATO commander, and Sir David Richards, the
general in charge of ISAF. Both expressed concern that mission creep
was taking place in Afghanistan. On page 25 of its report, the Defence
Committee
states:</p><a name="06062269000526"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;We
remain uncertain of the exact role which UK forces will be asked to
play in support of the counter-narcotics strategy and call on MoD to
provide
clarification.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06062269000366">That call
has been echoed by other hon. Members today, and I hope that the
Minister will be able to clarify where the line is to be drawn and what
our involvement with that strategy will be. Will he explain how the
division of labour is to be determined and who will take responsibility
for these matters? If we do not solve these problems now, the move from
stage 3, which involves taking over three quarters of NATO&#146;s
responsibilities, will be threatened when we move into the final stage
to take over all responsibility for co-ordination in
Afghanistan.</p><p><a name="06062269000367">Caveats
have been mentioned, in which the Governments of countries providing
NATO troops say that their troops cannot go into combat, for example.
Too many countries are doing that and, as my hon. Friend the Member for
North Wiltshire (Mr. Gray) said, many countries are limiting themselves
simply to providing troops in non-combat roles. That is not good enough
if we want Afghanistan to work as a nation.</p><p><a name="06062269000368">I was impressed by what ISAF is
doing. Unfortunately, the footprint that it is creating is extremely
limited. It cannot cover the entire country. We have spent a lot of
time focusing on Helmand, but it is only one of 30 provinces. The
neighbouring province of Nimroz does not contain one international
soldier. Where does a member of the Taliban go if things start to get
hot in one province? Obviously, he moves next door to the other. Unless
there is a larger commitment on the part of other NATO countries, we
shall not be able to fulfil our
mission.</p><p><a name="06062269000369">The mission
is likely to come under more question&#151;not because of what we are
doing with NATO but because of what is being done under the umbrella of
security that we are creating in the reconstruction and development
programmes. As I told the Minister during our debate in Westminster
Hall yesterday or the day before, there is clearly no co-ordination
between the myriad international organisations&#151;the United
Nations, the European Union, the non-governmental organisations, and
all the counter-narcotics agencies that have gone into Afghanistan.
Their hearts are in the right place, but unfortunately the money is
being spent as those agencies compete with their overlapping projects,
and the lack of co-ordination means that a great deal of money is
wasted. Although more than $400 million has been spent on challenging
the narcotics trade, last year saw the biggest bumper crop ever:
400,000 tonnes of poppies were produced. That shows that our
international effort is failing, and unless 
<br><notus-date day="22" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>22 Jun 2006 : Column 1561</b><br>we do something about it our mission in Afghanistan will be brought into
question.</p><p><a name="06062269000370">Our debate
has been far reaching and useful, but there are many questions that I
should like the Minister to answer. We have not really talked about the
Sea Harriers, and the gap that will be created in air cover. We have
not talked about the F-35 and the limitations imposed by the United
States Government&#151;or, to be fair, a corner of Capitol
Hill&#151;on the repair and upgrade of that project, which threatens
our purchase of the joint strike fighter in the long term. We have not
really touched on what will happen to the aircraft carriers, although
there seems to be delay after delay with the announcements. We have not
discussed the future rapid effect system. We have not even discussed
the A400M, which was once called the future large aircraft, but now
that it is so far in the future that we are not going to see it, that
name has been dropped. We have certainly not discussed the NATO
deterrent to the extent that the nation would
wish.</p><p><a name="06062269000371">The
Minister mentioned policy and I was pleased to hear about some of it,
but we could do with an entire debate on the overlap of the EU mission,
from a military perspective, with what is happening with NATO. A clash
will come, if it has not come already. We need a debate on the
procurement of equipment in general. There are also concerns about the
future, on a wider and more serious
note&#151;</p><p><a name="06062269000372"><b><a name="06062269000671">Mr.

I have to say that it was none of those. It was, in fact, the
Chancellor of the

that was some years ago, at a time when we faced an extremely visible
nuclear threat from the then Soviet Union. I am delighted to note that

the Armed Forces has claimed that the Chancellor said nothing new but
was merely repeating what was in the Labour general election manifesto.
My hon. Friend the shadow Secretary of State was prepared to give him
the benefit of the doubt, but nevertheless I detected a straw in the
wind in the words that the Chancellor used last night. He talked about
retaining our nuclear deterrent, but he also used the
words</p><a name="06062269000529"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;in this
Parliament, and the long term also&#148;.</p></ul><p><a name="06062269000382">It is hard to see how the phrase
&#147;the long term also&#148; could apply if he was talking only
about retaining the present
deterrent.</p><p><a name="06062269000383">However, we
do not have to rely on that exegesis, as <i> The
Guardian</i>&#151;which knows about these
things&#151;reports:</p><a name="06062269000530"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Treasury
sources made it clear that although Mr. Brown talked about retaining
the nuclear deterrent rather than replacing it, the chancellor was
giving his personal backing to a new generation of
missiles.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06062269000384">That is a
clear answer to the question that my colleagues and I have asked
Ministers on many occasions: are they talking only about retaining the
existing deterrent, or about a decision to replace
it?</p><p><a name="06062269000385">If
the Minister&#146;s interpretation of the Chancellor&#146;s
comments is correct, why has the Chancellor not been rushing to the
media today to say, &#147;Chaps, sorry, you&#146;ve got it all
wrong. All those headlines are wrong, and I was merely saying what
we&#146;ve said all along&#151;that we&#146;re not going to scrap
the weapons that we already have. I have no thought in my mind about
replacement.&#148;</p><p><a name="06062269000386">The
Prime Minister&#146;s spokesman has been doing his best to clarify
matters&#151;not in respect of replacement, but on whether there will
be a vote on the issue. Much to the satisfaction of people like the
hon. Member for Leyton and Wanstead (Harry
Cohen)&#151;</p><p><a name="06062269000387"><b><a name="06062269000675">Harry

want that or not.</p><p><a name="06062269000389">The

asked whether any vote in the House of Commons would be a
&#145;straight yes/no vote&#146; or would there be a series of
options. The spokesman said, &#145;What the Prime Minister said
yesterday, echoing what he has said before, is that there will be a
proper discussion. &#145;But would there be a vote?&#146; he was
asked again. &#145;There will be a proper discussion,&#146; he
replied.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06062269000390">Defence
Ministers have said today that no decision has been taken, either in
detail or in principle, but I believe that they are trying to plug the
hole in the dam that the Chancellor has opened up. There is no real 
<br><notus-date day="22" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>22 Jun 2006 : Column 1563</b><br>excuse for a delay in making a decision in principle. My hon. Friend the
shadow Secretary of State outlined with his customary elegance and
eloquence exactlywhy there is a need for a nuclear deterrent
in the21st century. It hinges on one simple concept: the
unpredictability of any outbreak of war in the future&#151;and I
think that I detect the Minister nodding in some form of agreement with
that proposition.</p><p><a name="06062269000391">However, we are talking about
having a nuclear deterrent between 2020 and 2050. Given that the real
justification for that is that we cannot anticipate what threats might
materialise from countries armed with weapons of mass destruction, why
delay deciding the question of principle? The principle will be
unaffected in a year, six months or three months from now. If we are
going to decide then that we need to keep a nuclear deterrent because
of the unpredictability of future threats, we might as well as do so
now. It is interesting that the Chancellor has decided on it now, even
though the Secretary of State for Defence and his colleagues who are at
least here today are still trying to pretend that he has
not.</p><p><a name="06062269000392">If I had to
summarise the themes that have primarily emerged in the debate, I would
say that they are three: Trident and the principles behind it;
Afghanistan and the tactics involved in dealing with that issue; and
Iraq and what is best described as the political will to win. I have
already addressed the first of those issues, and I want to say a word
or two about Afghanistan.</p><p><a name="06062269000393">My hon. Friend the Member for
Shrewsbury and Atcham (Daniel Kawczynski) mentioned in passing the
practice of reading out at Prime Minister&#146;s Question Time
condolences for individual members of the armed forces who have lost
their lives. That is honourably motivated, but it is worth remembering
that it would have been quite impracticable in most of the wars that we
have fought in the past, because there were many more casualties in
those wars than are being incurred among British service personnel in
the campaigns today.</p><p><a name="06062269000394">In a strange way, therefore,
the country has perhaps lost sight of the fact that when we engage in
armed conflict, there are very heavy prices indeed to be paid. One of
the reasons why the country has lost sight of that is that the longest
war that we successfully fought and concluded in recent times was the
50 years of the cold war, and it ended without a shot being fired. All
those countries that had been held under dictatorship and suppression
were able to come out into the sunlight and pick up the reins of
democratic practice. That was an exception to the rule of history, and
we delude ourselves if we think that we can engage in conflicts, such
as those in Afghanistan and Iraq, and expect that they will be as
simple as that involved in substituting a democracy for a
dictatorship.</p><p><a name="06062269000395">We must
look back to the successful counter-insurgency campaign&#151;I have
made this point from the Dispatch Box before&#151;that was waged over
12 years in Malaya. That is how long it took. Whether that campaign,
which has been widely taken as the model of winning hearts and minds,
could be fought to a successful outcome today, with legalistic
supervision and 24-hour media coverage, is open to question. As well as
winning hearts and minds, the tactics involved 
<br><notus-date day="22" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>22 Jun 2006 : Column 1564</b><br>were to send armed patrols out to find the enemy and eliminate them
ruthlessly, while isolating them from the population at
large.</p><p><a name="06062269000396">I am relieved
that the new Secretary of State for Defence seems to have consigned to
the wastepaper bin the absolutely nonsensical description and
distinction that his predecessor, whom I much admire&#151;I make no
secret of that, but I did not admire him for doing this&#151;tried to
draw between counter-terrorism and counter-insurgency. In any such
campaign, if we wait for terrorists or insurgents to come to our armed
forces before we react, we will lose. The only way in which such a
campaign can succeed is to follow the aggressive strategy against the
insurgents that is now being followed, and in which British forces are
clearly engaged, whereby they are seeking out the enemy. As a
commanding officer, Brigadier Nick Pope, has just
said:</p><a name="06062269000532"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;We have
put the terrorists on the back foot and seized the
initiative.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06062269000397">That is what
must be done, and I welcome the fact that the politicians are catching
up with the military&#151;in so far as they are doing
so.</p><p><a name="06062269000398">I will come to
Iraq in my final remarks, but I now wish to turn briefly to the
contributions that hon. Members have made from the Back Benches. There
were 10 of them&#151;three from Government Back Benchers and seven
from Opposition Back Benchers. All of the latter contributions were,
for some reason, from Conservative Members, rather than from Members of
the self-styled &#147;real&#148; Opposition: the Liberal
Democrats.</p><p><a name="06062269000399">The hon.
Member for Leyton and Wanstead, to whom I have already referred a
couple of times, made a consistent speech in which he talked
thoughtfully about the dangers of failed states. He also made a remark
that should give all of us pause for thought when, in speaking about
the situation in Somalia, he said that one must not react intrinsically
against any new Muslim administration without being absolutely certain
that they intend to ally themselves with militant Islamism that is
hostile to freedom. Such a group might be a potential enemy of that
sort, but we must be very careful before we decide that; otherwise, we
are playing the game of the terrorists and creating allies for
them.</p><p><a name="06062269000400">The hon. Member
for Stoke-on-Trent, South(Mr. Flello) is a living example of
the value of the armed forces parliamentary scheme. I am delighted to
say that I am on my fourth incarnation in that scheme. I pay tribute to
the patience and hospitality of the commandant at the Royal College of
Defence Studies, Sir Ian Garnett, and his colleagues, in welcoming me
and several other Members on to this year&#146;s course. It is
greatly to the credit of the hon. Gentleman that so soon in his
parliamentary career, he decided to undertake the major commitment of
doing the AFPS course. His contribution made clear the great benefit
that he has derived from
it.</p>

<p><a name="06062269000401">My right hon. and
learned Friend the Member for Kensington and Chelsea (Sir Malcolm
Rifkind) touched once again on his concerns about the decision to
invade Iraq, but he was absolutely resolute on the vital importance of
not reducing our military commitment in Afghanistan. He said that once
we decide to go somewhere we must stay, and that sending 
<br><notus-date day="22" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>22 Jun 2006 : Column 1565</b><br>signals about withdrawals and timetables would be the worst possible
thing that could be done for the welfare and safety of our

Member for Portsmouth, North (Sarah McCarthy-Fry) made a very strong
speech. She made a robust defence of the armed forces in Iraq and
touched on the role of the media&#151;an issue to which, if I have
time, I shall return at the end. My right hon. Friend the Member for
North-East Hampshire (Mr. Arbuthnot), who is Chairman of the Defence
Committee, said that the Chancellor had repeated the Labour manifesto
commitment on defence. He also raised the important issue of whether
the Chancellor proposes to put his money where his mouth is, if he does
indeed intend that the nuclear deterrent should be replaced, by funding
it separately.</p><p><a name="06062269000403">My hon.
Friend the Member for North Wiltshire (Mr. Gray) asked a series of
penetrating questions; I am glad that I do not have time to attempt to
answer them all. My hon. Friend the Member for Blaby(Mr.
Robathan)&#151;I was sorry not to be present when he made his
speech&#151;stressed, typically robustly, the need for senior
officers to stand up for their troops.</p><p><a name="06062269000404">My hon.
Friends the Members for Shrewsbury and Atcham (Daniel Kawczynski) and
for Ilford, North (Mr. Scott) illustrated something that is very true
about life in this Chamber: when Members put aside their prepared
speeches and speak from the heart about a topic that really excites and
inspires them, they can hold the House in the palm of their hand. My
hon. Friend the Member for Bournemouth, East (Mr. Ellwood) is a
persistent campaigner on defence issues and&#151;be it votes on
Trident, roles for Typhoon or narcotics in Afghanistan&#151;today was
no exception.</p><p><a name="06062269000405">My final
point relates to the situation in Iraq, where a process of competing
political will is being undertaken. I return, as I said I would, to the
reference that the hon. Member for Portsmouth, North made to the media.
Over the 50 years of the cold war, we saw that political will was as
important as actual military capability. The attempts that are being
made in Iraq to break the political will of coalition forces are indeed
being fuelled by selective media reports. There is an answer. The
Government need a media strategy to ensure that propaganda from those
who sympathise with the insurgents and the terrorists is matched by
hard facts from the coalition forces, ably disseminated. I am not yet
convinced that the Government have fully got their act together. I
shall be interested to hear whether the Minister can reassure
me.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="06062269000557">5.40

about service accommodation in Colchester, but since he is not here, I
will not give the House a detailed response. I am sure that he will
catch me at some appropriate point so that I can fill him in on the
detail.</p><p><a name="06062269000410">My good and
hon. Friend the Member for Leyton and Wanstead (Harry Cohen)
distinguished himself, as ever, by standing out against the crowd.
Nothing has really changed in that he and I probably disagree on
absolutely everything he said, except when he quoted President Karzai
saying that we need to support the institutions of civic society in
Afghanistan. President Karzai has also said we need to deal with
narcotics and terrorism, which are the biggest threats to those civic
institutions, a theme echoed in the considered contribution of the
right hon. Member for North-East Hampshire (Mr. Arbuthnot).</p><p><a name="06062269000411">My hon. Friend the Member for
Stoke-on-Trent, South (Mr. Flello) has distinguished himself by making
a big impact in the House in just 12 months. He talked about the armed
forces parliamentary scheme. Like others, his experience on the scheme
has clearly given him an idea of the front-line issues that our forces
face. Tribute was paid to Sir Neil Thorne and we would all agree he
does an excellent job in administering boththe armed forces
and the police schemes. When I completed the police scheme, I gained
some understanding of the pressures gone through by people on the front
line in the forces and the police. So much of what they do involves
split-second decisions, and we can understand that mistakes are made.
The schemes assist all Members, particularly those with civilian
backgrounds, on the common problems faced by our three
services.</p><p><a name="06062269000412">My hon.
Friend also talked about improvements in our service people&#146;s
kit. I was pleasantly surprised to visit Chilwell last week, where we
prepare our reservists for mobilisation. The difference over even the
last five years in the kit with which they are issued is remarkable. It
would be a great fashion item in West Bromwich high street&#151;the
services need to keep an eye on where the stuff goes&#151;because it
is so well designed now, not just to be practical but to be quite
fashionable.</p><p><a name="06062269000413">The right
hon. and learned Member for Kensington and Chelsea (Sir Malcolm
Rifkind) made his usual wise contribution. Much of what he said about
what we have to do in Afghanistan was endorsed by many Members. He made
a point about the Ministry of Defence having no friends, but I am not
quite sure that was the case in the debate, although the hon. Member

transfer those skills to civilian life. Sometimes, however, we cannot
commoditise those skills into the certificates needed for particular
jobs. She raised a good point about the mechanics and I invite her to
talk to me about it to see if we can apply some clarity to the
situation.</p><p><a name="06062269000424">Our service
personnel are extremely employable. I was amazed to read that 95 per
cent. of them find jobs within six months of leaving the services. Our
challenge is to make sure that the remaining 5 per cent. have as much
support as
possible.</p><p><a name="06062269000425">The
hon. Member for North Devon (Nick Harvey) put a large number of
questions, so I hope he will allow me to canter through just some of
them. He talked about harmony and pinch points. Over the last year, the
number of regular armed forces deployed on operations has fallen to
about 18 per cent., but there are pinch 
<br><notus-date day="22" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>22 Jun 2006 : Column 1568</b><br>points and we are trying to deal with them. We are trying to target
recruitment in particular areas, and we are looking at financial
retention and re-engagement incentives, flexibility in the rank
employed for some posts and how we mobilise reservists, as well as some
contractualisation.</p><p><a name="06062269000426">The right
hon. Member for North-East Hampshire made a characteristically wise and
assured contribution. He raised many wise points. I look forward to his
report on strategic nuclear defence next Friday. If it has already gone
to the printers, I wonder whether there will be any addendums. I was
delighted that he is delighted with the Chancellor&#146;s commitment
reported in the press today. I shall be joining the Chancellor at a
veterans event this evening and I will make forcefully the right hon.
Gentleman&#146;s point about the need for adequate resources to cover
the demands. I am sure that, given the Chancellor&#146;s recent
pronouncements, he will want to listen to the Chairman of the Defence
Committee with great interest. The right hon. Gentleman asked about the
Vector vehicle. It is not planned to be available until next March, but
it is planned to be deployed with 12 Mechanised Brigade.</p><p><a name="06062269000427">The hon. Member for North
Wiltshire (Mr. Gray) fired off 30 or 40 points that the MOD should be
considering over the next few years. It was a powerful contribution. He
raised some serious questions that the UK will have to address in
future years. In particular, there were his ideas for a department of
military planning, the question of whether we are best
servedby three intelligence services and, perhaps most
controversially in the Department, the question of whether we need
three services. He commented that someone had suggested that we should
abolish the RAF. There are no plans to do
that&#151;</p><p><a name="06062269000428"><b><a name="06062269000684">Mr.
Gray</b><i> indicated dissent.</i></p><p><a name="06062269000429"><b><a name="06062269000685">Mr.
Watson:</b> I know that the hon. Gentleman did not say that we
should abolish the RAF. He said that someone else had said it. There is
a point about how we deal with some of the service issues on a
tri-service basis. One of the key challenges that we will have to take
on in the next few years is to how we train our personnel. The defence
training review will look at how we can provide basic training and
specialist training on a tri-service basis.</p><p><a name="06062269000430">The hon. Member for Blaby (Mr.
Robathan) made an uncharacteristically unfair contribution, although a
characteristically robust one. I expect nothing less of a revered Whip.
The position that he holds in the Whips Office suggests that perhaps he
should engage a little less with such allegations. The comment that he
made about the Deputy Prime Minister when the Deputy Prime Minister was
not in the Chamber was simply disgraceful, particularly given that he
had to apologise to General Jackson for a previous allegation that he
made.</p><p><a name="06062269000431"><b><a name="06062269000686">Mr.
Robathan:</b> What I said earlier was not an allegation; it
was a statement of fact and I can back it up with witnesses. If the
Deputy Prime Minister wishes to say&#151;as he has&#151;that all
soldiers are boneheads, that is a substantial accusation that he should
answer. That should not result in an accusation against me for stating
a fact.</p><br><notus-date day="22" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>22 Jun 2006 : Column 1569</b><br><p><a name="06062269000432"><b><a name="06062269000687">Mr.
Watson:</b> The hon. Gentleman has made that
allegation twice and the Deputy Prime Minister is not here to defend
himself<i> &#151;[</i><i> Interruption.</i><i> ]</i> He is not here to
defend himself. Given that the hon. Gentleman is an Opposition deputy
Chief Whip, I thought that the comments that he made on the Chiefs of
the Defence Staff were frankly outrageous. I am sure that they do not
reflect the view of Opposition Front-Bench Members.</p><p><a name="06062269000433">The hon.
Member for Shrewsbury and Atcham (Daniel Kawczynski) spoke up for his
constituents in his usual way. He spoke honestly and movingly about
their views. He made a particular point about our Polish veterans and I
was pleased that he did, because I come from Kidderminster, which is
not too far away from his constituency and has a strong Polish
community. Many members of that community served in the war and have a
distinguished record. I am glad that he has given me the opportunity to
get my thanks to them on the record. I am going to come out with a
world first and praise a Liberal councillor, Mike Oborski, who has been
a powerful advocate for Polish veterans over many decades. I glad that
we can recognise the work that he does in Kidderminster and in
England.</p><p><a name="06062269000434"><b><a name="06062269000688">Daniel
Kawczynski:</b> He must be the only gentleman of Polish origin
who is a Liberal Democrat.</p><p><a name="06062269000435"><b><a name="06062269000689">Mr.
Watson:</b> He is not actually a Liberal Democrat. He is a
Liberal&#151;just to reassure those on the Liberal Democrat Front
Bench&#151;who was formerly a Liberal Democrat.</p><p><a name="06062269000436">The hon. Gentleman talked about
the Territorial Army and said that it was in crisis. I do not want to
spend too much time focusing on the TA. There is a debate in two
weeks&#146; time on personnel issues and perhaps we can explore the
matter in more detail then. The TA has undergone great change in recent
years. The Duke of Westminster, whom I did not know before I was
appointed to my post, is a really inspiring leader for the
organisation. He is literally thinking some unthinkable thoughts about
how we can take on some of the challenges that the TA faces in the
years to come.</p><p><a name="06062269000437">The
speech made by the hon. Member for Ilford, North (Mr. Scott) reminded
me of England&#146;s first game in the World cup, albeit in reverse,
in that the second half was inspirational. He made powerful points and
held the attention of the House, especially when he spoke about Saddam
Hussein and the way in which he treated his people and the people of
Israel. The hon. Gentleman made the point that if Iraq is a better
place when we leave than it was when we went in, our job will have been
done. I think that we can all agree on
that.</p><p><a name="06062269000438">The hon. Member
for Bournemouth, East(Mr. Ellwood) made a wide-ranging
contribution and I shall try to capture all his comments if I can. I
take his point about the need for the Typhoon aircraft to have an
air-to-ground capability. The redesign is taking place, although we
have to work with our partners to get that done as quickly as
possible.</p><p><a name="06062269000439">Like several
hon. Members, the hon. Gentleman talked about the need to win the
propaganda war in Afghanistan. I absolutely agree with him. We need to
ensure that our outreach programmes in Helmand province are right and
that they have an Afghan front-facing
approach.</p><br><notus-date day="22" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>22 Jun 2006 : Column 1570</b><br><p><a name="06062269000440"><b><a name="06062269000690">Mr.
Ellwood:</b> I was not so much talking about the propaganda
war&#151;perhaps another hon. Member mentioned that&#151;but trying
to point out that there is no co-ordination on infrastructure,
rebuilding and development. There is a call for an administrator to
govern all that and oversee the money that comes
in.</p><p><a name="06062269000441"><b><a name="06062269000691">Mr.
Watson:</b> We need to build up ties with the leadership of
the provincial government there, so I understand the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s
point.</p><p><a name="06062269000442">The hon.
Gentleman also asked about how the counter-narcotics operation will be
conducted. Several hon. Members touched on the need to get that
operation right, because if we get it wrong, the area will become more
insecure than secure. If the operation is going to be right, it will
need an Afghan lead. We must be careful about the way in which we
implement the strategy, as many hon. Members
said.</p><p><a name="06062269000443"><b><a name="06062269000692">Harry
Cohen:</b> When I quoted Stop the War as
saying that a death occurs every hour in Basra, the Minister intervened
to ask where it got its figures&#151;he was casting aspersions on
Stop the War with that comment. I have looked it up. The information
came from an article in <i> The Independent </i>of 17 May by Patrick
Cockburn, who was in Arbil, which
said:</p><a name="06062269000533"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Majid
al-Sari, an adviser to the Iraqi Ministry of Defence, describing the
situation in Basra to the daily al-Zaman, said that on average one
person was being assassinated every
hour.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06062269000444">Will my hon.
Friend apologise to Stop the
War?</p><p><a name="06062269000445"><b><a name="06062269000693">Mr.
Watson:</b> When I intervened on my hon. Friend, I simply knew
that he would leave the Chamber and spend night and day trying to find
the source of the quote. However, he will know that it is almost
impossible that I am going to apologise to Stop the War, given the
campaign that it is running to undermine our British forces abroad. Its
behaviour undermines confidence in our services, so I will not take up
his offer to apologise on this
occasion.</p><p><a name="06062269000446">In
closing the debate, I want to make two points, although I will have to
cut them down. First, we need to ensure that our people, who do a
magnificent job, are properly looked after. Secondly, we need to ensure
that they have the equipment that they need to do the difficult and
dangerous things that we ask of them. Our success depends above all
else on our personnel. I am sure that hon. Members will wish to join me
in once again paying tribute to the courage and professionalism of the
men and women of our armed forces&#151;both regulars and reserves.
Those extraordinary people are doing extraordinary things in the most
challenging circumstances. They are making a unique and valuable
contribution to help to bring peace and security to Afghanistan, Iraq,
the Balkans, Northern Ireland and elsewhere in the world. I know that
our debate will have reassured them that we have their best interests
at heart and are all working to ensure that they have the finest
support from the British
Parliament.</p><p><a name="06062269000447"><b><a name="06062269000694">Lord

that the Petitioners are extremely concerned about the scale of debt in
the Oxfordshire NHS. The existing Thames Valley Strategic Health
Authority receives one fifth less than the national average of NHS
spending and if Oxfordshire was simply funded halfway towards the
national average there would be no debt. This means the NHS in
Oxfordshire has one fifth less to spend on acute hospitals beds, drugs
provision and
staff.</p></ul><a name="06062269000536"><ul><p class="tabletext">Further
declares that of all Trusts in England, it is Oxfordshire which
receives the lowest funding for treatment per patient. Government
Ministers, including the Prime Minister and the Secretary of State for
Health, will be benefiting by funding above the national average to the
tune of sums by which Oxfordshire PCTs will be
underfunded.</p></ul><a name="06062269000537"><ul><p class="tabletext">Further

John Whittingdale (Maldon and East Chelmsford) (Con):</b> I am
grateful to have the opportunity to hold a short debate on the subject
of occasional sales. At the beginning of the Session, I was fortunate
enough to be drawn in the private Members&#146; ballot and although,
like all who are successful in the ballot, I received a large number of
approaches suggesting many worthy measures, I agreed to introduce a
Bill to strengthen the law to help trading standards officers and the
police tackle the problem of pirate and counterfeit goods being sold at
occasional sales, which in the majority of cases are perhaps better
described as car boot sales. Unfortunately, because I was relatively
low in the ballot&#151;I was 14th&#151;and because of the
controversial nature of the some of the Bills that precede mine, I have
not had an opportunity to debate the Bill, and I accept that it is
unlikely that I shall be able to do so. I should therefore like to use
this opportunity to set out the case for such a measure and, more
importantly, to obtain a response on behalf of the Government from the
Minister for Trade.</p><p><a name="06062269000458">I was keen to
introduce the Bill for two reasons. First, as Chairman of the Select
Committee on Culture, Media and Sport, I am extremely conscious of the
importance of the creative industries to the United Kingdom. They
contribute an estimated 8 per cent. of our national income, but because
they depend on the protection of intellectual property, rather than on
a physical product, they are particularly susceptible to piracy and
counterfeiting. The protection of intellectual property is the biggest
and most important challenge that they face, and I welcome the fact
that that has been recognised by the Government through the creation of
the creative industries forum and the setting-up of the Gowers review
of copyright.</p><p><a name="06062269000459">Secondly, I represent an Essex
constituency, and I suspect that I do not have to tell you, Mr. Deputy
Speaker, that Essex hosts a large number of car boot sales. I do not
wish to criticise or impede in any way the operation of car boot sales
which, as a Conservative, I regard as an extremely good demonstration
of the free market in operation, because they bring together buyers and
sellers to mutual advantage. They are a source of pleasure and
enjoyment, too, for many of my constituents, for whom a visit to a car
boot sale is an essential part of the weekend. However, they are
subject to abuse by a small number of operators, who take advantage of
them to engage in illegal sales of counterfeit and pirate goods,
including branded products such as watches, jewellery, handbags,
trainers and polo shirts. The most common products on sale are CDs and
DVDs, which can be produced extremely cheaply and are easy to transport
and, indeed, to hide.
</p><p><a name="06062269000460">We are not talking
about a small number of dodgy dealers who flog a few DVDs from the back
of a van but about a vast industry run by international organised
criminal gangs whose profits are huge and whose activities threaten the
survival of our creative industries. It is estimated that the total
cost to industry is more than &#163;11 billion a year, and there is
an additional cost to the Government of about &#163;2 billion 
<br><notus-date day="22" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>22 Jun 2006 : Column 1574</b><br>in lost VAT. Last year, an estimated 77 million pirate CDs were sold in
the UK, representing a criminal gain at street prices of &#163;278
million.</p><p><a name="06062269000461">The trail
often begins on the other side of the world, in countries such as
Russia, Pakistan and particularly China. I recently visited Beijing
with the Select Committee to discuss the problem of piracy. A report in
the <i> People&#146;s Daily </i>three years ago suggested that
China&#146;s legal production lines could produce 600 million discs,
but there was a total of 5 billion disc sales in the country. The China
Audio and Video Association recognises the problem of piracy in Hong
Kong and Macau, and it is doing everything that it can to stop imports
from those countries into China. Disappointingly, however, it does not
appear to recognise that there is huge pirate DVD manufacturing
capability in mainland China. Many of those DVDs are sold in China, but
many more flood into western nations, where they are distributed by
organised gangs. Evidence that the Triads, the Russian mafia and the
IRA are all involved in the trade was highlighted in a recent threat
assessment by the National Criminal Intelligence Service and the
Northern Ireland Organised Crime Task
Force.</p><p><a name="06062269000462">Although the
trail may begin a long way away, it ends with pirate DVDs and CDs being
sold in pubs, on street corners and, in particular, at car boot sales.
It has been estimated that more than a quarter of pirate goods are sold
through car boot sales. I have first-hand experience of the problem as
a result of having visited several car boat sales and bank holiday
markets in and around my constituency, and I want to thank Essex
trading standards and, in particular, its operations manager, Mr.
Trevor Simpson, for their help in researching it.</p><p><a name="06062269000463">Last year, I accompanied Mr.
Simpson&#146;s officers in an undercover visit to a car boot sale in
Boreham, where we identified two stalls selling pirate CDs and DVDs.
Among the DVDs on sale were films such as &#147;War of the
Worlds&#148; and &#147;Batman Begins&#148;, which had just gone
on general release in cinemas in the high street and which were
certainly not legally available on DVD. Beyond that, there were also
films which had not yet been released in the UK but which were somehow
on sale as pirate copies. I was later told by the cinema industry that
there were an estimated 2.25 million illegal copies of &#147;War of
the Worlds&#148; circulating in the UK within a few days of the film
going on general
release.</p><p><a name="06062269000464">A few weeks
after my visit in September last year, I returned to the Boreham car
boot sale with trading standards officers and the police in what they
kindly labelled Operation Parliament. Although we expected to find two
stalls selling illegal goods, we found four, and, as a result, around
750 DVDs were seized along with more than 200 CDs, 150 watches, 80
handbags and 33 pairs of trainers. The most worrying point was that as
the officers were putting the goods into bags, members of the public
criticised them and said that they should leave the sellers alone
because they were not doing any harm. That illustrates the huge
challenge in educating the public on why piracy is damaging and why
they should not buy counterfeit
goods.</p><p><a name="06062269000465">Although
trading standards officers are doing their best to tackle the problem,
the powers available to them are limited, which is why I agreed to
introduce the Occasional Sales Bill to strengthen their ability to
counter that menace. The Bill is not intended to curtail 
<br><notus-date day="22" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>22 Jun 2006 : Column 1575</b><br>legitimate sales, which comprise the vast majority of activity at car
boot sales. However, there are examples of irresponsible organisers,
and there is anecdotal evidence that some organisers are taking
substantial payments from those selling illegal goods. In one case, an
organiser even sounded a loud horn that echoed around the entirety of
the sale at the first sight of the police and trading
standards.</p><p><a name="06062269000466">The Bill
is designed to tackle rogue organisers. It is based on existing
legislation that covers Kent and the Medway towns, and it contains
three simple measures. First, it places a duty on organisers of
occasional sales to give notice of an intention to hold a sale to
trading standards at least 21 days ahead of the sale taking place,
which will give the authorities a chance to reach a considered view on
whether they want to attend and to plan accordingly. Secondly,
organisers will be required to keep a record of the names and addresses
of sellers, together with a general description of the goods and their
car registration number, which will be available to the authorities on
demand. Thirdly, where there is repeated evidence of illegal sales
taking place, the organiser can be required to take action to prevent
them and can be held liable if they fail to do
so.</p><p><a name="06062269000467">As I have said,
those provisions are already in place in Kent, and they have proved
very effective in reducing the amount of pirate goods sold at car boot
sales. Indeed, one of the consequences of that legislation is that it
has transferred the problem to the other side of the Thames to my
county, Essex. My Bill is supported by organisations such as the
British Video Association, the British Phonographic Institute, the
British brands group and many other trade bodies. It is also backed by
Front Benchers of both Opposition parties and by Government Members,
such as the hon. Members for Rhondda (Chris Bryant) and for Rossendale
and Darwen (Janet Anderson).</p><p><a name="06062269000468">I recognise that it is unlikely
that the Bill will become law. However, I was encouraged by the answer
that I obtained from the Minister last week, in which he said that the
Government is seeking further evidence from the police, local
authorities and others on whether the regulatory aspects of the Kent
legislation have a wider application. I would be grateful if the
Minister were to say whether the Government are willing to consider
introducing legislation in that
area.</p><p><a name="06062269000469">I also want to
draw the Minister&#146;s attention to one very promising development.
In April, I participated in the launch by Essex trading standards of a
voluntary code of practice for markets and boot fairs. It requires
organisers to agree to a number of measures, including providing
trading standards with details of events to be held and the contact
with whom to liaise. They must also endeavour to prevent the sale of
any illegal goods by excluding anybody suspected of doing so and
reporting them to the authorities, display notices warning the public
against pirate goods, and provide a guide to all sellers who are
attending.</p><p><a name="06062269000470">This
afternoon, I spoke to Trevor Simpson at Essex trading standards, and he
told me that so far 26 out of 31 organisers in Essex have signed the
code of practice and only one has refused to do so. As a result, there
has been a noticeable decline in illegal sales. Organisers are
co-operating with recent examples in Clacton, Weeley 
<br><notus-date day="22" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>22 Jun 2006 : Column 1576</b><br>and North Weald, where market organisers have banned some sellers whom
they know to have been selling pirate goods. There is no doubt that
most organisers are responsible and wish to work with the authorities.
Indeed, one recently pointed out the difficulties that he had in
spotting fake goods and asked for the brand owners to help him to do
so. I hope that even if there is not legislative time to bring in the
measures in my Bill, the Government will encourage all local
authorities to establish codes of practice such as the one in Essex and
to persuade all organisers to sign up to
them.</p><p><a name="06062269000471">There are new
challenges facing the creative industries, with the explosion of
high-tech piracy through illegal file sharing and home burning of CDs,
to give two examples. However, physical piracy remains a serious threat
to these industries, which are increasingly important to the economic
future of the UK. I hope that the Minister will recognise that and set
out the Government&#146;s plans to tackle
it.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="06062269000562">6.16
pm</h5><p><a name="06062269000472"><b><a name="06062269000699">The
Minister for Trade (Mr. Ian McCartney):</b>
I thank the hon. Member for Maldon and East Chelmsford (Mr.
Whittingdale) for introducing this debate. In his role as Chairman of
the Select Committee on Culture, Media and Sport and vice-chairman of
the all-party group on intellectual property, he has done valuable work
in raising awareness of intellectual property issues, particularly
intellectual property crime. Everything that he said was not only well
researched but well founded. I hope that during this short debate I am
able to reassure him that we are travelling in the same direction. We
understand the effects on one of our major and growing industries in
the global economy and the importance of our working to provide the
appropriate tools to deal with organised crime at whatever level it
seeks to intervene in the marketplace.</p><p><a name="06062269000473">Like the hon.
Gentleman, I pay tribute to Essex trading standards for introducing a
voluntary code of practice in April. I am advised that it is working
well at the moment. We will monitor its effectiveness and encourage
other trading standards officers to use such codes. I hope that this
debate helps to raise awareness and understanding and gives the subject
wider
coverage.</p><p><a name="06062269000474">Today&#146;s
world is moving from an industrial age to a new age where creativity
and innovation are the primary fuel of our economy. As a result, we are
increasingly dependent on the development and distribution of creative,
technical and intellectual products. The UK is undeniably a world
leader in innovation, and it is clear that intellectual property is
propelling our economy as never before. The intellectual property
system must remain relevant and address the challenges of the
knowledge-based economy of the 21st century. That is why my right hon.
Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer announced in December that the
Government had commissioned Andrew Gowers to undertake an independent
review of the intellectual property framework. The Gowers review is due
to report later this year. I will ensure that the hon. Gentleman
receives a copy.</p><p><a name="06062269000475">Our creative
industries, which include publishing, software, design, advertising,
electronic games and fashion, as well as music, films, television and
radio and the performing arts, accounted for 8 per cent. of gross value

<br><notus-date day="22" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>22 Jun 2006 : Column 1577</b><br>added in 2003. The creative industries grew by an average of 6 per cent.
per annum between 1997 and 2003. In the summer quarter of 2004,
creative employment totalled 1.8 million jobs. Creative employment is a
major element in our economy. The recent BBC announcement of the
proposed move of some of their production departments to Salford, in my
own region of north-west England, is a powerful way of stimulating the
national and regional media industry.</p><p><a name="06062269000476">Innovation is vital to the
economy and our future. We therefore need to ensure the existence of a
safe and robust environment, which not only helps our creators to
thrive, but protects their inventiveness. A key part of that
environment is a strong and fair intellectual property system with
effective enforcement provisions.</p><p><a name="06062269000477">Major progress is often
accompanied by major challenges and, like any valuable product,
intellectual property has become much sought after by those who are
less honest. During recent years, the scope and scale of intellectual
property crime, counterfeiting and piracy has grown at rates that were
previously unknown. For example, it is widely estimated that 7 per
cent. of all world trade is now in counterfeit goods&#151;a total
annual value of more than &#163;250 billion. There is no doubt that
that phenomenal growth is due to several key factors. Ironically,
globalisation and new opportunities in technology have contributed
strongly. However, a lack of general understanding and stretched
enforcement resources have also played a part.</p><p><a name="06062269000478">While crimes such as drug
dealing and trafficking are viewed with great concern, the perception
of the seriousness of intellectual property crime has been much lower.
The hon. Gentleman said that when he described the public reaction to
the crime that he witnessed. United Kingdom enforcers have been
unfamiliar with the laws and, consequently, enforcement priorities have
been absorbed elsewhere. As a result, that &#147;high profit, low
risk&#148; factor has meant that intellectual property crime has
become an attractive criminal enterprise. That is an important point.
It is an enterprise&#151;a business&#151;with a board of managers
and driven on the ground by thousand of key workers, from their
perspective. We must deal with it effectively.</p><p><a name="06062269000479">Our trading standards
authorities have traditionally been at the front line of intellectual
property crime enforcement in the UK. Working in the local authority
system, trading standards officers play a key strategic role in
providing UK local government services. However, enforcement against
counterfeiting and piracy is only part of a trading standards
officer&#146;s work. Fair trading activities involving labelling
food, licensing, weights and measures and safety are only a few of the
other activities that are carried out regularly.
</p><p><a name="06062269000480">Depending on the
authority, between 60 and 120 pieces of primary and secondary
legislation are overseen by trading standards departments. It is widely
recognised that the UK has one of the most robust intellectual property
legislative structures in the world. However, the Government are
acutely aware that legislation needs to change with shifting demands.
That is why we have introduced changes to our intellectual property
legislation to combat the growing threat of intellectual property
crime.</p><br><notus-date day="22" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>22 Jun 2006 : Column 1578</b><br><p><a name="06062269000481">Furthermore, the Government have
already supported a number of legislative changes in recent years, such
as stronger penalties for copyright crime in the Copyright, etc. and
Trade Marks (Offences and Enforcement) Act 2002. We updated copyright
law to reflect the digital age by introducing the Copyright and Related
Rights Regulations 2003, which implement the European Community
copyright directive. Those regulations introduced new offences relevant
to the most damaging online distribution of copyright material. In
making those changes, we have sought both to promote better public
protection and improve enforcement against counterfeiting and piracy.
We are well aware of the threat that intellectual property crime poses
and that it is a worldwide problem, as the hon. Gentleman said. In
response, the Government have taken action in a number of key areas,
which I shall set out.</p><p><a name="06062269000482">First, in July 2004, with the
full support of the Prime Minister, the Department of Trade and
Industry, in partnership with the Department for Culture, Media and
Sport, established the creative industries forum on intellectual
property. Several work streams have emerged from that group. Raising
consumer awareness and enforcement are two on-going issues. Secondly,
we have implemented the Patent Office&#146;s national intellectual
property crime strategy. A multi-agency intellectual property crime
group was set up involving the Government, the police, trading
standards, Her Majesty&#146;s Revenue and Customs, the National
Criminal Intelligence Service, which has now been subsumed by the
Serious Organised Crime Agency&#151;that came into being on 1 April
this year&#151;and key industry sectors.</p><p><a name="06062269000483">The objective of the
intellectual property crime group was to deliver better targeted
enforcement action. Our achievements so far include: the creation of a
new creative industries focus group under the intellectual property
crime group to ensure that concerns can be fed directly into the
intellectual property crime strategy; a new intellectual property crime
intelligence database; better training for enforcers&#151;trading
standards officers already receive practical training with the help and
support of the Patent Office; greater collaboration between national
and international Government agencies; annually updated assessments of
intellectual property crime; and progress reports overseen by
Ministers, which will ensure accountability and continuing delivery on
the matter.</p><p><a name="06062269000484">Thirdly,
I am pleased to say that, in June last year, we published our consumer
strategy, &#147;A Fair Deal for All&#148;. One of our commitments
is that, from 1 April this year, all asset recovery agencies including
the trading standards service in England and Wales will be able to get
back 50 per cent. of what they recover under the Proceeds of Crime Act
2002. This will take time to dig in, but it represents a major advance
not only in relation to the proceeds of crime, but to the damage that
it will do to the heart of the capacity of criminal businesses to
continue trading. It will also allow assets rightfully to be returned
to the community and provide support for the activities of the
enforcement agencies. The assets recovered could include monies related
to the confiscation of pirated goods, and the scheme will be
administered by the Home Office.</p><br><notus-date day="22" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>22 Jun 2006 : Column 1579</b><br><p><a name="06062269000485">In addition, we highlighted the
importance of intellectual property as part of our EU presidency
programme by supporting the creative economy conference in London in
October 2005. As part of our presidency of the G8, we agreed a specific
tasking statement with our G8 colleagues on action to reduce
intellectual property crime by improving enforcement. That statement is
available from the Foreign and Commonwealth Office website, but I will
send a copy to the hon. Gentleman. I would welcome his comments on what
more we could do in this regard.</p><p><a name="06062269000486">Tackling
counterfeiting and piracy is vital and I agree that an essential part
of the solution will involve building respect for creators&#146;
rights. Failure to respect creators&#146; rights is ultimately
self-defeating for consumers. The Government recognise that there have
been inconsistencies in the response to intellectual property crime
across the country in the past. That was often due to competing
priorities and the lack of a cohesive approach between all the
enforcement agencies.</p><p><a name="06062269000487">The national intellectual
property crime strategy seeks to provide a co-ordinated approach to
combating counterfeiting and piracy. We are piloting 11 regional teams
whose priority will be to tackle the most urgent issues for their
locality. They will be cracking down on the real criminals, and
&#163;3 million, which will be available over the next two years,
will get the teams up and running and provide for the network of
regional intelligence teams essential for the focus on intelligence-led
enforcement. If the hon. Gentleman or his Committee wish to meet
members of those teams, once they are operational, I will arrange that
for him.</p><p><a name="06062269000488">The aim is
to encourage a more joined-up enforcement network and to spread best
practice among the trading standards services around the country. The
Government are committed to improving Britain&#146;s consumer regime.
To do that, we need to foster an environment that empowers and protects
consumers while supporting open, competitive and innovative markets. I
think that that is how the hon. Gentleman described car boot fairs. He
might like to know that my wife goes to boot fairs regularly. She
raises money for my election campaigns through them. I can assure him,
however, that it is all
&#147;legit&#148;.</p><p><a name="06062269000489">We
are also committed to reducing crime. In short, we want to remove the
market for counterfeit and pirated goods and to make it harder, riskier
and less appealing for thieves to steal other people&#146;s
creativity and deprive them of their due livelihoods. There is
undoubtedly a need for better co-ordination and shared intelligence
between local authorities, rights owners, enforcement agencies and the
Government to help to fight the growing threat of counterfeiting and
piracy. However, we feel that that can best be achieved through a
structured intelligence-led approach and a co-ordinated response from
within the national intellectual property crime group. Again, if the
hon. Gentleman&#146;s Committee wishes to discuss this matter with
the Home Office or with the new criminal intelligence agency, such a
request would be met with an enthusiastic response.</p><br><notus-date day="22" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>22 Jun 2006 : Column 1580</b><br><p><a name="06062269000490">The first enforcement operation
carried out by the national intellectual property crime group occurred
over four weekends last December. Wembley market was raided and more
than &#163;1.5 million worth of illicit goods were seized. However,
that was not the only significant outcome of the operation. Further
intelligence about the method of supply of counterfeit goods was
uncovered from seized trader documents. Other intelligence was also
uncovered and passed on to the relevant Government agencies. As a
result of this operation, it is estimated that 34 people will be
prosecuted, and at least two cases will be the subject of Proceeds of
Crime Act 2002 investigations. There was support for this operation
from the legitimate stall holders at Wembley market, who had been
struggling to compete with the illegal traders. The operation
demonstrates&#151;as have the operations in Essex that the hon.
Gentleman mentioned&#151;that shared intelligence and co-operation
between enforcers gives excellent results using the existing
legislation.</p>

<p><a name="06062269000491">In
conclusion, proposals to improve and provide consistent and workable
enforcement regulations across the country are always welcome. However,
all new recommendations on legislative change must be carefully
considered, and not all of them can be introduced quickly. The hon.
Gentleman mentioned the Kent County Council Act 2001 and the Medway
Council Act 2001, and the Home Office consultation. A report was laid
before the House in December 2004. The Under-Secretary of State for the
Home Department, my hon. Friend the Member for Bradford, South (Mr.
Sutcliffe) has confirmed, in a written answer to the hon. Gentleman on
19 June, that he will consult on this issue. I will write to my
ministerial colleague at the Home Office and ask him to write to the
hon. Gentleman about when the consultation will take place and to
ensure his involvement in it.</p><p><a name="06062269000492">I say that for two reasons.
First, I think it pretty unlikely that the hon. Gentleman will be able
to get his occasional sales Bill up and running and secure a proper
debate on it. Secondly, the issues that he has raised are serious, and
we must grapple with them. I hope that the consultation will give the
hon. Gentleman an opportunity to put his
case.</p><p><a name="06062269000493">As
for whether I, as consumer Minister, will consider further legislation,
I shall view the matter in the light of the result of my hon.
Friend&#146;s consultation. I shall be happy to meet the hon.
Gentleman at a later date if that will help. We have a common cause. We
may sit in different parts of the House, but one thing is certain: we
believe in legitimate business and the growth of the United
Kingdom&#146;s creative industry. We are also anti-criminal and
anti-crime, and opposed to the ripping off of our intellectual
property. We are opposed to the ripping off of our constituents by
organised crime.</p><p><a name="06062269000494">I
hope that my response has been sufficient to give my hon. Friend an
indication of my willingness to work with him to produce some effective
results. I thank him again for raising the
issue.</p><p><a name="06062269000495"><i> Question put
