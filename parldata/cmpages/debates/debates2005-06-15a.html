<p><a name="st_o2"><a name="50615-01_spmin0"><b>The Minister of State, Northern Ireland Office  (Mr. David Hanson): </b> 
 My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State meets regularly with his security advisers, including the Chief Constable and the General Officer Commanding, to discuss the security situation in Northern Ireland. However, as I am sure the hon. Gentleman will understand, the details of troop deployments undertaken by the Army in fulfilling its role of supporting the Police Service of Northern Ireland are operational issues and therefore matters for the GOC.


<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>15 Jun 2005 : Column 244</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br></p>








<p><a name="st_o3"><a name="50615-01_spnew2"><b> Mr. Donaldson: </b> 
 Speaking as someone who previously served with the regiment, I take the opportunity to salute the courage of the Royal Irish Regiment Home Service battalions in discharging a service to the people of Northern Ireland for some 30&nbsp;years. Is it not time, however, that we gave those soldiers the clarity and certainty that they desire about their future? The current doubt and uncertainty is definitely causing morale problems among the soldiers. I understand what the Minister said about the operational requirements, but is it not time that the Government clearly announced that the Home Service battalions will continue to fulfil an important role in providing security to the people of Northern Ireland for now and for the future?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o4"><a name="50615-01_spnew3"><b> Mr. Hanson: </b> 
 I join the hon. Gentleman in paying tribute to the work that the battalions have undertaken, for which there is considerable support in the community. I also pay tribute to the work that the hon. Gentleman himself has done. I hope that I can reassure him by saying that the Government have no plans to disband the Royal Irish Regiment in general or the three Home Service battalions in particular. They remain an essential component of the Army&#039;s support to the Police Service of Northern Ireland and will continue to be so as long as the terrorist threat remains. I hope that that reassures the hon. Gentleman. The situation is fluid and may change, but for now, as I said, those battalions provide an important and essential component of the Army&#039;s support services.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o5"><a name="50615-01_spnew4"><b> Mr. Andrew Robathan  (Blaby)</b> 
 (Con): I am delighted to hear that the Government have no plans to disband the Home Service battalions of the Royal Irish Regiment, but does the Minister agree that at a time when the Government are deploying extra troops in Afghanistan and Iraq and disbanding four infantry battalions, the Royal Irish Regiment&#039;s role is even more important? Is the Minister confident that, should there be a resumption of violence in Northern Ireland, sufficient troops will be available to deploy there to assist the Police Service of Northern Ireland?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o6"><a name="50615-01_spnew5"><b> Mr. Hanson: </b> 
 I can give the hon. Gentleman a categorical yes on that question. He will know that the Royal Irish Regiment plays a strong supportive role to the PSNI and I have given a commitment today, on behalf of the Government, that so long as the security situation remains difficult, the battalions will remain in position. As I have already made clear, that is our commitment and we believe that those battalions will remain an essential component of the Army support service in Northern Ireland.

<p><a name="st_o7"><a name="50615-01_spmin1"><b>The Secretary of State for Northern Ireland  (Mr. Peter Hain): </b> 
 First, I would like to pay tribute to my predecessor, my right hon. Friend the Member for Torfaen (Mr. Murphy). As I have travelled throughout Northern Ireland and, indeed, across the border during 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>15 Jun 2005 : Column 245</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>this past month, I have not been surprised to find that he is viewed with considerable respect and affection for all that he has done.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50615-01_para5">
<a name="stpa_o0">I have had good meetings with the main parties and, provided that the Provisional IRA commits itself to ending all paramilitary activity and criminality, I remain hopeful of restoring the devolved institutions.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o8"><a name="50615-01_spnew6"><b> Mr. Harris: </b> 
 I welcome my right hon. Friend to the Dispatch Box as the new Secretary of State for Northern Ireland. The whole House will agree with the principle that democratic parties should not share power with parties that continue to balance the ballot box in one hand with the Armalite in the other. When he next meets representatives of Sinn Fein, will my right hon. Friend remind them that total decommissioning is not a concession, but a basic requirement for any party that hopes to establish its democratic credentials?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o9"><a name="50615-01_spnew7"><b> Mr. Hain: </b> 
 My hon. Friend makes his point eloquently, as always. There is now a cross-party commitment to insisting that paramilitary activity and criminality are banished from Northern Ireland, particularly in respect of its politics. That is vital if progress is to be made and we await the forthcoming statement from the Provisional IRA to see how it measures up against that important yardstick.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o10"><a name="50615-01_spnew8"><b> Dr. William McCrea  (South Antrim)</b> 
 (DUP): Does not the Secretary of State understand that recent events have proved beyond doubt that Sinn Fein-IRA are totally incapable of making the move to exclusively democratic means? Surely it is time to move on. The Government must proceed without Sinn Fein-IRA. No amount of IRA verbiage will move Unionists to support anything less than the total demolition of IRA structures and the total end of all criminality.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o11"><a name="50615-01_spnew9"><b> Mr. Hain: </b> 
 I certainly agree that there has to be an unequivocal commitment to ending criminality and paramilitary activity. Moreover, given the events of the past year or so, that commitment must be validated and verified. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman will agree that that is the important principle. If we are able to secure such a commitment and make sure that it has taken root, we will then be able to establish the basis for inclusive government, involving all parties committed to exclusively democratic and peaceful means. I hope that that will include Sinn Fein in the future.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o12"><a name="50615-01_spnew10"><b> Mr. Eddie McGrady  (South Down)</b> 
 (SDLP): On behalf of my party, may I welcome the Secretary of State and two of his ministerial colleagues to their new Front-Bench posts? I also welcome the return of another colleague to her position, and I hope that there will be great co-operation with them all.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50615-01_para6">
<a name="stpa_o1">The Secretary of State has said in public that all democratic and political progress in Northern Ireland depends on a statement from the army council of the IRA, and that that statement must be acceptable and represent no hindrance to political progress. How would the right hon. Gentleman define the acceptability of such a statement in respect of decommissioning and the cessation of criminal activity and operational capacity? Is he not concerned that such a statement would allow groups such as Sinn Fein to participate in policing and 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>15 Jun 2005 : Column 246</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>other institutions of law and order? Does he accept that a very close analysis of such a statement would have to be made to ensure that it contained no potential blocks to political progress?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o13"><a name="50615-01_spnew11"><b> Mr. Hain: </b> 
 My hon. Friend has put that question very well, and I pay tribute to the role of the Social Democratic and Labour party in the peace process over very many years. It has shown tremendous courage and vision, for which it has not necessarily received credit or recognition at the ballot box. History will show that the SDLP&#039;s courage and leadership have been vital components in establishing an unparalleled period of prosperity, stability and political progress in Northern Ireland.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o14"><a name="50615-01_spnew12"><b> Lembit &#214;pik  (Montgomeryshire)</b> 
 (LD): The right hon. Gentleman is the fifth Secretary of State with whom I have had the pleasure to work. In the light of our shared responsibilities, I have little doubt that he would agree that the future looks bright for Northern Ireland, and for Wales as well.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50615-01_para7">
<a name="stpa_o2">The Secretary of State will have seen the 10&nbsp;benchmark measures set out by the Alliance party to evaluate the robustness of statements made by paramilitaries, including the IRA. Does he agree that it is necessary to have objective measures to assess the paramilitaries&#039; commitment to peace? Is he willing to accept an invitation to meet the Alliance party&#039;s leader, David Ford, to discuss those 10&nbsp;measures and the rationale behind them?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o15"><a name="50615-01_spnew13"><b> Mr. Hain: </b> 
 First of all, I thank the hon. Gentleman for his welcome. I note that he is my shadow in Wales as well as Northern Ireland, so I shall have to watch out for him. However, if he invites me to fly from Wales to Northern Ireland in his aircraft, I do not think that I will accept. He does the flight regularly, but he is the pilot and I am not sure how safe the journey might be.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50615-01_para8">
<a name="stpa_o3">Certainly, I will give a commitment to meet David Ford again. The Alliance party has put forward an interesting set of proposals, which contains a lot of common sense. I have met him before, and his Alliance party leadership colleagues, but of course we want to maintain close contact.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o16"><a name="50615-01_spnew14"><b> Dr. Nick Palmer  (Broxtowe)</b> 
 (Lab): Does my right hon. Friend accept that many of us are concerned that peace processes tend either to move forward or roll backwards? In the light of what the hon. Member for South Antrim (Dr. McCrea) said earlier, will he stress that we reject the tendency of some parties to rule out concession or compromise even before they have heard what the other side has to say? Is not the only way forward to work with those parties that are willing to reach a compromise?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o17"><a name="50615-01_spnew15"><b> Mr. Hain: </b> 
 It is important that we all work together, according to the principles of inclusive governance and power sharing established in the Belfast agreement. My hon. Friend will recognise, however, that it is equally important that we banish the bullet, the bomb and all criminality and paramilitary activity from Northern Ireland&#039;s politics. Progress has been made, but it is still not good enough and we must move forward.

Member for St. Helens, South (Mr. Woodward), to their new responsibilities. I should also like to take this opportunity to pay tribute to the right hon. Gentleman&#039;s predecessor, the right hon. Member for Torfaen (Mr. Murphy), with whom I much enjoyed working when we had the responsibility of speaking for our respective parties on Northern Ireland. There is no doubt about his dedication and commitment to the welfare of all the people of Northern Ireland. Does the Secretary of State agree that before an inclusive Executive can be established in Northern Ireland, the Provisional IRA will have to disband?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o19"><a name="50615-01_spnew17"><b> Mr. Hain: </b> 
 I thank the hon. Gentleman for his welcome and, especially, his tribute to my right hon. Friend the Member for Torfaen (Mr. Murphy). On the final question, it is important that we banish paramilitary activity and criminality from Northern Ireland&#039;s politics. I do not want to get stuck on words, because&#151;as he will know from shadowing my predecessors&#151;it is important to achieve the objective rather than to erect an obstacle. Sometimes words erect obstacles.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o20"><a name="50615-01_spnew18"><b> Mr. Lidington: </b> 
 Words can erect obstacles, but I would hope that the Secretary of State would agree that we are now at the stage where ambiguity about language becomes an obstacle to agreement rather than something that facilitates agreement. If he does not want to use the word &quot;disbandment&quot;, I invite him to go further than his earlier response when he talked about the need for Sinn Fein-IRA to commit themselves to ending all paramilitary involvement and all criminality. Does he agree that a commitment is not enough? What is required is that paramilitary organisations actually end their involvement in crime, cease to be organised paramilitary forces, and can be shown to have done so permanently?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o21"><a name="50615-01_spnew19"><b> Mr. Hain: </b> 
 I agree with the hon. Gentleman to the extent that a commitment is not enough, although a commitment in clear and unequivocal terms is important. We will now need, in view of what has happened in the past months and years, to see the Independent Monitoring Commission playing its role to verify what is going on. That is important and I hope that the hon. Gentleman will work with me to achieve that objective on a bipartisan basis.

 (UUP): What action he is taking to increase public confidence in the Parades Commission. [3013]
</p>



<p><a name="st_o22"><a name="50615-02_spmin0"><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Northern Ireland  (Mr. Shaun Woodward): </b> 
 Ministerial colleagues and I are engaged in a series of meetings with all interested parties and institutions, including the Parades Commission, to discuss this year&#039;s parades and processions. In a climate that can give rise to tension and, regrettably, disorder, the commission deserves the 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>15 Jun 2005 : Column 248</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>full support of everyone in Northern Ireland for carrying out its important task impartially and working in the best interests of the whole community.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o23"><a name="50615-02_spnew0"><b> Lady Hermon: </b> 
 I am most grateful to the Minister for that reply, although I think that it will fall on deaf ears in Northern Ireland. I take this opportunity to welcome the Minister and his colleagues not only to the Dispatch Box, but particularly to the Northern Ireland Office. Is it the Minister&#039;s view that the Parades Commission is being deliberately provocative in refusing permission for parades simply because the names of individual Orangemen are not actually listed on the application forms? It is perceived as deliberately provocative.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o24"><a name="50615-02_spnew1"><b> Mr. Woodward: </b> 
 I am grateful to the hon. Lady for her comments. The specific form to which she refers is known as the 11/1&nbsp;form. There is a statutory requirement for parade organisers to notify the police at least 28&nbsp;days in advance of a parade and they have to complete an 11/1&nbsp;form. It also includes a statutory requirement to identify the person organising the parade. Since the commission was established, all parade organisers have satisfied the requirement to complete the form. This year, a handful of forms&#151;some earlier in the year and some recently&#151;have been submitted without completion of the specific box to identify the name of the person organising the parade. My understanding is that discussions are now taking place&#151;even today&#151;about whether the parades that took place and will take place on the basis of technically incorrectly completed forms are, while challenging to the commission, none the less still legal. We would of course like all groups to co-operate with the commission to ensure a peaceful season. We are therefore hopeful and confident that a solution is now being found to that specific problem.
</p>








<p><a name="st_o25"><a name="50615-02_spnew2"><b> Mrs. Iris Robinson  (Strangford)</b> 
 (DUP): The Minister will agree that confidence in the Parades Commission is virtually nil in the Unionist community. Does he accept that the situation will not have been improved by legislation that increased the powers of the Parades Commission and granted it the authority to make determinations about not only those seeking to parade, but those viewing a parade?
</p>








<p><a name="st_o26"><a name="50615-02_spnew3"><b> Mr. Woodward: </b> 
 I absolutely accept that there is a dispute about the Parades Commission at the moment, especially among some members of the Orange Order. I remind the hon. Lady of the comments made by the Northern Ireland Affairs Committee about the good job that the Parades Commission has done. Indeed, no one has come forward with alternative proposals for such a commission.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50615-02_para0">
<a name="stpa_o4">There will of course be the opportunity for us to examine the commission&#039;s composition at the end of the year, after its current chairman retires. I am well aware that all seven members of the commission are currently men. If we want it to be representative of the community, it would be nice to see some women members. The commission itself has acknowledged that there will be an opportunity in the autumn for its processes to be examined, which will include all the forms involved in parades.

 In welcoming the Secretary of State to his post, does he recall writing in the early 1970s that all sensible people were demanding that troops be taken out of Northern Ireland?

 In light of the fact that a majority of the people in Northern Ireland voted for parties that had specific manifesto commitments to oppose the Government&#039;s current plans to change the rating system in the Province, will the Minister consider delaying any legislation on that until there is a consensus among the people on whom it will have a direct impact?

 We have to recognise that although we take on board as much public opinion as possible, we must press ahead with rating reform and proposals on water charges. Households in Northern Ireland contribute less than half the taxes and charges than those paid in similar circumstances in England, Wales and Scotland. If we are to sustain and improve public sector investment, we have to ensure that the money comes in.

<p><a name="st_o53"><a name="50615-03_spmin5"><b>The Prime Minister:</b> 
 As I said yesterday, the sensible thing in the light of the no votes in France and Holland is to have a pause for reflection and to consider the right way forward for Europe, because the constitution obviously cannot proceed until a way is found round those France and Holland votes, or we decide to proceed in a different way. That is a decision that has to be made collectively. What is important to realise is that, as a result of the way in which we have approached it, there is a clear understanding in Europe that there needs to be a far more fundamental debate about the future of Europe. Fortunately, as Britain has a Government who are not Eurosceptic but who believe in Britain at the centre of Europe, we are in the right position to play a good part in that debate.

</p>








<p><a name="st_o55"><a name="50615-03_spmin6"><b>The Prime Minister:</b> 
 The fact is that, as we have said, there is no point in proceeding with our referendum until the situation changes. If it does not change, the right hon. and learned Gentleman is quite right that the constitution cannot proceed, but that has to be a decision taken by the whole of Europe. At this moment, the important thing is for us to sit down and think, in Europe, about how we make sure that Europe is more relevant to the concerns of people in the early 21st century. As I said, this country, in its presidency, is well placed to lead that debate.

 I agree with the Prime Minister that we should use this as a great opportunity to think hard about the future of the European Union.

 That is precisely why subsidiarity is a major part of the new constitution. But that is not the right hon. and learned Gentleman&#039;s position. His position is to renegotiate the existing terms of Britain&#039;s membership. Let me quote something else to him, from someone now back in the House as the Member of Parliament for Kensington and Chelsea and a Conservative leadership contender, although it is true that that does not put him in a very exclusive group.

 The Dutch Foreign Minister says that the Prime Minister is keen to talk about everyone else&#039;s views. I want to remind him about his views. He is the man who, in order to get into the House, told voters that he wanted to get out of Europe. He is the man who signed away our opt-out from the social chapter and now complains about EU red tape. He is the man who said we did not need a constitution at all, then he said we had to have it, and now he cannot make up his mind one way or the other. He is the man who said a referendum would be a gross betrayal of the British national interest, and then promised we would have one. He has wriggled on Europe like a worm on a fish hook.

We have joined the social chapter and we have 2&nbsp;million more jobs in this country. Our approach&#151;being willing to fight for Britain&#039;s interests, but from a pro-European position&#151;is the right one for the country, and that is the approach we will continue to adopt.

 We certainly support better scrutiny of European proposals here in this House. I know that my right hon. Friend the Leader of the House will bring forward some proposals on that in due course.

<a name="stpa_o10">To be absolutely blunt, although opening up the deliberations of the Council to public view would obviously be a democratic step forward, it would not in the end answer the real questions in Europe. One can see clearly with the referendum results that there is a debate going in Europe about two things. The first is the right response to globalisation and the rise of countries such as China and India, which have low labour cost production and will compete on a very tough basis with Europe and the rest of the world. We need to decide on the attitude towards globalisation. We are in favour of a free and liberal approach.

<a name="stpa_o14">In respect of the clean-burn technique and ensuring that we use fossil fuels in a more environmentally sustainable and beneficial way, I do agree with him.

<a name="50615-03_para9">
<a name="stpa_o15">In respect of nuclear power, there are, as I have said before, no current proposals to build new nuclear power stations, though, as we said in the energy White Paper, we cannot rule out the possibility of doing so at some point in the future. What is needed now is to accept, particularly after the papers signed by the academy of science in all the G8&nbsp;countries, that there is now little doubt that climate change and global warming are major issues for us to confront and deal with, and this type of clean coal energy policy will be a vital part of the future.

 I do not know the precise proportions but the only reason why people know how much money is given to political parties, including the hon.

Will he lead the call for a worldwide ban on asbestos? There are good reasons for doing that. The manufacturing focus has shifted to the developing world and the disease, disability and deaths that will be caused by exposure will add to poverty and continue adding to poverty unless we can bring in a ban that is similar to that which has been introduced throughout the industrialised world.

 I entirely agree with my hon. Friend. We all recognise that asbestos can have serious effects on people&#039;s health and he is right that we should aim to achieve a global ban. We are working towards that through the United Nations environment programme. At the risk of unduly and unnecessarily provoking Conservative Members, I say the EU has already introduced a ban on the use of asbestos in the Union.

Under the previous Conservative Government, funding per pupil was cut. Under this Government, it has risen. Yes, a lot remains to be done on truancy and other issues, but the education system in this country is going places and getting better as a result of a Labour Government who believe in education, not a Tory Government who used to cut it.

<a name="50615-04_head0"><h3 align=center>Welsh Governance</h3>

<a name="time_0">
<a name="50615-04_time0"><h5>12.32&nbsp;pm</h5>




<p><a name="st_0"><a name="50615-04_spmin0"><b>The Secretary of State for Wales  (Mr. Peter Hain): </b> 
 With permission, Mr. Speaker, I should like to make a statement on the publication today of the White Paper, &quot;Better Governance for Wales&quot;.

</p>

<p>
<a name="50615-04_para0">
<a name="stpa_0">Devolution has proved to be a success, both for Wales and the rest of the United Kingdom. By establishing the National Assembly for Wales in 1999, following the endorsement of a referendum, the Government have moved the decision-making process closer to the people.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50615-04_para1">
<a name="stpa_1">Six years on, the benefits can be clearly seen: record levels of employment, rising standards in education, and groundbreaking initiatives such as the Children&#039;s Commissioner, free bus travel for the over-60s and disabled, and Assembly learning grants. With equal numbers of male and female Members, and pioneering&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;commitments to open government, sustainable development and equal opportunities, the Assembly has been a progressive institution attracting interest from around the world.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50615-04_para2">
<a name="stpa_2">After the experience of six years of devolution and two full sets of elections, it is now appropriate to review and improve the working of the Assembly, not to make change for change&#039;s sake but to ensure that it continues to meet people&#039;s needs in Wales and remains accessible and accountable to them.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50615-04_para3">
<a name="stpa_3">The White Paper therefore covers three key issues, which the Government believe need to be tackled to deliver better governance for Wales. It addresses the response of the National Assembly to the report of the commission on its powers and electoral arrangements, chaired by Lord Richard of Ammanford, and the commitments made in the Labour party&#039;s general election manifesto.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50615-04_para4">
<a name="stpa_4">First, the White Paper contains the Government&#039;s proposals for legislation to effect a formal separation between the Assembly and the Welsh Assembly Government. The lack of a clear separation between the Assembly itself and Assembly Ministers and the civil servants working for them has generated confusion about who is responsible for decisions. Under the corporate structure, Ministers are in the contradictory position of sitting as members of subject Committees meant to scrutinise their decisions.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50615-04_para5">
<a name="stpa_5">Secondly, the Government propose to give the Assembly, gradually over a number of years, enhanced legislative powers in defined policy areas where it already has executive functions.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50615-04_para6">
<a name="stpa_6">As a first step, the Government have decided, from now onwards, to draft parliamentary Bills in a way that gives the Assembly wider and more permissive powers to determine the detail of how the provisions should be implemented in Wales. That will not require any change to the Government of Wales Act 1998, but it will require a more consistent approach to drafting legislation for Wales.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50615-04_para7">
<a name="stpa_7">As a second step, we propose to put in place a streamlined procedure enabling Parliament to give the Assembly powers to modify legislation or to make new provision on specific matters or defined areas of policy within, and only within, the fields in which the Assembly currently exercises functions.


<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>15 Jun 2005 : Column 264</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>

<p>
<a name="50615-04_para8">
<a name="stpa_8">Orders in Council conferring those powers would be made at the request of the Assembly Government, and would be laid by the Secretary of State and be subject to specific authorisation by both Houses of Parliament through the affirmative resolution procedures. That means that more legislation will be made in Wales and that the Assembly Government will be able to secure more effectively and more quickly the legislative tools they need to get on with the job of building a world-class Wales with a globally competitive economy and high-quality public services.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50615-04_para9">
<a name="stpa_9">Those enhanced legislative powers are adaptations of the current settlement and do not require a referendum. However, it may prove in the future that even those additional powers and streamlined procedures are still insufficient to address the Assembly&#039;s needs.

</p>

<p>
<a name="50615-04_para10">
<a name="stpa_10">The Government have therefore agreed to provide the option of further enhanced law-making powers. This would mean transferring primary legislative powers over all devolved fields direct to the Assembly. But, as a fundamental change to the Welsh devolution settlement, that option would require the support of the electorate through a post-legislative referendum, triggered by, first, a two-thirds majority of Assembly Members, and secondly, a vote in Parliament. The Government envisage no particular timetable for this, as it would be dependent on a consensus, which certainly does not exist at present.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50615-04_para11">
<a name="stpa_11">The history of Welsh devolution referendums is salutary. The big No vote in 1979&nbsp;showed the dangers of conducting a referendum before sufficient consensus had emerged, and the Government remain conscious of the narrow majority in 1997, when it appeared that there was indeed such a consensus.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50615-04_para12">
<a name="stpa_12">I note that the Richard commission itself saw the acquisition of primary powers as a process that would take a number of years to achieve, and not before 2011. My view is that the new Assembly arrangements should be allowed to bed down through the next Assembly term&#151;between 2007&nbsp;and 2011&#151;and that there is no case for considering a referendum until at least the following Assembly term of office.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50615-04_para13">
<a name="stpa_13">The people of Wales will wish to be convinced of the reasons for going beyond the new enhanced law-making powers before being invited to vote in a referendum. We therefore need some years&#039; experience of the new system before we can make a proper assessment of when that might occur.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50615-04_para14">
<a name="stpa_14">Finally, we propose to deal with a weakness in the existing additional-Member electoral system for the Assembly. There is widespread concern that the current operation of the regional list system in Wales is damaging the vital relationship between Members and their constituents, and indeed causing unnecessary tensions between Members themselves.

</p>

<p>
<a name="50615-04_para15">
<a name="stpa_15">Losing candidates in constituency elections being able to become Assembly Members through the regional list, and thus claim to act as a Member for that very same constituency, both devalues the integrity of the electoral system in the eyes of the public and acts as a disincentive to voting in constituency elections. We therefore propose to amend the provisions of the 1998&nbsp;Act to prevent individuals from simultaneously being candidates in constituency elections and eligible for election from party lists. Candidates will have to make a choice.


<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>15 Jun 2005 : Column 265</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>

<p>
<a name="50615-04_para16">
<a name="stpa_16">I believe that the proposals in the White Paper provide a practical, common-sense road map to sensible, staged improvement of the existing arrangements. One of the key reasons why the transition to devolved government in Wales has been smooth is that we have moved at a pace determined by the people of Wales.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50615-04_para17">
<a name="stpa_17">The White Paper reflects that guiding principle. It will provide a reformed structure that is more accountable, more participatory and more effective, giving more powers to the Assembly and leading to better governance for a better Wales. I commend it to the House.
</p>








<p><a name="st_1"><a name="50615-04_spnew0"><b> Bill Wiggin  (Leominster) (Con):</b> 
 May I thank the Secretary of State for advance sight of the statement, although I regret that I did not have quite as much time to read it as the BBC, which was quoting him at 6.43&nbsp;this morning? Given that he is a former Leader of the House, I was surprised by that, but I do not wish to be discourteous.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50615-04_para18">
<a name="stpa_18">The Secretary of State referred to the three key areas in the White Paper in which changes are proposed. We welcome the proposal to separate the legislature and the Executive and to improve effective scrutiny, but the bulk of his statement dealt with the enhancing of legislative powers and changes to the electoral system, about which we have profound concerns. Why did he say that there is no consensus for a referendum today, and that it would be lost? Why has he made it clear that the White Paper proposes moves that would lead to full legislative powers for the Assembly? Why is he not interested in the views of the Welsh people after six years of Assembly government?
</p>

<p>
<a name="50615-04_para19">
<a name="stpa_19">It would seem that the Secretary of State has recognised the need for the referendum, but why is he determined to put the cart before the horse? Why has he proposed to empower the Assembly in areas such as health and education? Is he pleased with their record? Is he pleased that waiting lists have increased by 80&nbsp;per cent. under Labour, and that 61&nbsp;schools have closed since 1997? Is he pleased that Wales will not have tuition fees? It seems odd that he has chosen to enhance powers in the areas that are failing the people of Wales the most. Is that because the White Paper is really intended to empower Labour in Wales, rather than the people of Wales?
</p>

<p>
<a name="50615-04_para20">
<a name="stpa_20">How does the Secretary of State square all this with condensing consideration of a Bill and all its stages into a one and a half hour debate? What does he expect will be the impact on the role of Welsh MPs? What opportunities will there be for them to amend an Order in Council, or to comment on Welsh legislation? Does he therefore propose to address the size of Welsh constituencies, as a result of their inability to determine Welsh legislation, or would that not be in the interests of the Welsh Labour party? Welsh MPs are elected by the people. Has the Secretary of State learnt from his friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer to go for stealth empowerment of the Welsh Assembly? If so, why has he increased the number of Wales Office staff in London?
</p>

<p>
<a name="50615-04_para21">
<a name="stpa_21">I now turn to probably the most spiteful part of these proposals&#151;the changes in the electoral system. How many Labour Assembly Members will be standing as 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>15 Jun 2005 : Column 266</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>first-past-the-post candidates, considering that all of them stood as such candidates, and as list candidates, at the last election? Why did he not see the anomalies when he fought for this system in the first place? Will list Members be able to stand as first-past-the-post Members in other constituencies? Does he not agree that his comments on the Assembly electoral system are equally applicable to any proportional representation system?
</p>

<p>
<a name="50615-04_para22">
<a name="stpa_22">The Secretary of State said that he has moved at a rate determined by the people of Wales, but the reality is that he has not asked them about this issue because he knows that they will regret this stealthy empowerment, spun as further powers semi-skimmed. In fact, this is simply a way of avoiding a referendum. Why has he rejected the increase in Assembly Members advised by the Richard commission? He has given the impression of providing semi-skimmed legislative powers, but this White Paper is the full-fat proposal, stuffed with E numbers and leading to all the attendant health repercussions. I can understand why he said what he said. This is the man who called the EU referendum a tidying-up exercise, so the whole House will understand why he is afraid of referendums.

<p><a name="st_2"><a name="50615-05_spnew0"><b> Mr. Hain: </b> 
 That was a spiffing performance, if I may say so. The hon. Gentleman asks about a referendum, but he wants to abolish the Assembly altogether. The Tory leader in the Assembly wants it to have more legislative powers, so he will presumably back the White Paper. Moreover, the Leader of the Opposition is apparently unable to make up his mind&#151;he does not know what to say about this issue. I can tell the hon. Gentleman, since he asked, that we will call a referendum only if there is a consensus for one. There is no consensus for one now, and it would be lost. There is no case for holding a referendum until at least into the next decade&#151;if a consensus exists then. I can tell the hon. Gentleman that a multi-option preferendum, which is the policy of the Tory party, may be the best way of sorting out the party leadership contest, but is not the best way of determining the future governance of Wales.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50615-05_para0">
<a name="stpa_23">The hon. Gentleman asked what was the difference between an Order in Council and a Bill. I should have thought that, as an experienced parliamentarian who has served in at least one Parliament, he would understand that. The Order in Council will of course be able to be subject to scrutiny in advance. There is a period during which it can be laid before both Houses of Parliament. The Assembly will bid for a particular policy or modification of legislation, and will have to specify in great detail what its legislative modifying effect might be. The House will then have an opportunity to vote under the normal affirmative resolution procedure. I think that this is a much more streamlined procedure, which will be better for the House of Commons with its crowded legislative programme, and better for the Assembly as well.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50615-05_para1">
<a name="stpa_24">The hon. Gentleman asked whether there were any proposals to change the number of Welsh Members of Parliament. The answer is no, and I will explain why.

</p>

<p>
<a name="50615-05_para5">

 During the general election the people of Wales, I believe, indicated to us that they were more concerned about the delivery of good-quality public services than about endless talk of constitutional change.

May I also say that we greatly support the statutory division of responsibilities between Welsh Assembly Ministers and the National Assembly for Wales? Does the Secretary of State agree that that is both sensible and overdue because it makes it easier to hold the Welsh Assembly Government to account, instead of always blaming the Assembly as a whole for errors of government?

Why is the Secretary of State placing so many barriers between where we are now and where we should be in the future, particularly when the Scottish Parliament secured all the powers that it sought on the basis of a single referendum? Does he not see that by placing so many barriers between now and the future, it looks as though he is trying to make significant reform impossible?

Given his transformation on the road to Damascus on the issue of democracy, does he agree with the rest of the country that securing 36&nbsp;per cent. of the poll certainly does not give his party the authorisation to govern the country as a whole? Can he give me an assurance that he will look further into the wider issue of electoral reform across the country?

Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy (Mr. Llwyd) to become the leader of the opposition in Wales. I am rather puzzled by his question on the referendum, however, because the leader of the Liberal Democrat group in the Assembly believes that there should be a referendum immediately, whereas the hon. Gentleman told the Welsh Grand Committee that he did not believe in a referendum at all. So what is the Liberal Democrat policy on holding a referendum on primary powers? I think that we should be told.

The whole structure of the Assembly will be reformed and I am grateful that the hon. Gentleman welcomed the abolition of its present corporate status, which is confusing and denies accountability. The Assembly will acquire enhanced powers and a new method of streamlined bidding for legislation from the House, so it will have to assume greater responsibilities. As I said, all that will take time to bed down. I see no case whatever for any movement ahead of the Richard commission timetable of 2011&nbsp;and we shall have to see what happens after that.

<a name="stpa_37">I would say to the hon.

We could do worse than reflect on the referendum in the north-east of England. We were told, and many of us faithfully believed, that there was support for such a referendum. I also remind the hon. Gentleman of the all too painful experience of many of us, including himself, in 1997. Before the 1997&nbsp;referendum&#151;only a couple of days before&#151;I recall that the opinion polls showed, as they had consistently throughout the campaign, that the yes vote was about 2:1&nbsp;ahead. What happened on the day? It was a narrow, hair&#039;s-breadth victory for the yes side. In 1979, there had been a 4:1&nbsp;defeat for the idea of having an assembly. We must therefore be very careful on this matter of referendums.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50615-06_para2">
<a name="stpa_38">It is not a question of me imposing obstacles in the way of further referendums. It is right that we in Westminster are aware of a clear two-thirds majority in the Assembly in favour of having primary powers&#151;if or whenever that might be in the next decade&#151;but we should also recognise that Parliament has the final say. After all, Parliament is the sovereign body of the United Kingdom. It is not a question of imposing barriers, but of finding a sensible way forward.

In Caerphilly, a Conservative candidate was elected on just 10.1&nbsp;per cent. of the vote; and in Clwyd, West, a Liberal Democrat was elected on a mere 7.9&nbsp;per cent.

 That is very unlikely, given the Labour party&#039;s massive popularity in Wales and in Britain as a whole. The hon.

Many of his Plaid Cymru colleagues are demanding a referendum this year, but he cannot argue seriously that that can be won without the support of Labour. As I said earlier, the Labour party in Wales, Plaid Cymru and the Liberal Democrats all supported a yes vote in 1997, when only the Conservative party really opposed that. Even so, there was only a hair&#039;s breadth margin of victory. It is for all parties to determine, on a cross-party basis, whether a consensus on this matter exists and we must make that judgment as the process unfolds.

I advise him not to believe polls: he should trust the people when it comes to how they are likely to vote and make a serious judgment on that basis. We trust the people, and that is why we are putting these proposals forward and setting up a post-legislative referendum. If a consensus existed, that referendum would trigger primary powers for the Welsh Assembly.

However, it would be very unwise of the House of Lords to override the House of Commons in respect of the legislation that will follow this White Paper, and to seek to deny what the people of Wales have asked for. I do not think that the problem is likely to arise but, if it did, the Parliament Acts could come into effect.

Is he aware that what he has said today on behalf of the Government could have severe implications for voting systems in Scotland?

<p><a name="st_43"><a name="50615-08_spnew5"><b> Mr. Hain: </b> 
 I do not accept that. I can confirm that my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Scotland is behind these proposals, which are for Wales, not Scotland. The present electoral arrangements in Scotland are different from those in Wales and so are the powers and, in fact, the whole devolution settlement. Therefore, what we do in Wales does not prejudge anything that might come from the independent commission&#151;which my right hon. Friend set up&#151;that is considering electoral arrangements in Scotland. The point about devolution is that things can be done differently in the different nations of the UK. That has already happened in the past six years and can continue to happen in the future. I am sure that it will.

They include the Labour Minister for Education and Young People, Peter Peacock, who was soundly beaten into third place in the SNP-held seat of Moray but elected through the list. The Secretary of State describes that as indefensible in Wales, but is that also the case in Scotland? If the Secretary of State for Scotland agrees with him, what are the plans for Scotland?

However, I know that most Members of Parliament&#151;certainly on this side of the House&#151;work more than that.

 My right hon. Friend the Prime Minister and I will represent the United Kingdom at the European Council in Brussels tomorrow and on Friday. We will fortunately be joined there by my right hon. Friend the Minister for Europe, who earlier received such a ringing endorsement in the House. Today the House has its customary opportunity to debate the Government&#039;s priorities. I shall deal first with the agenda of the European Council itself and secondly with the wider question of the European Union&#039;s future direction and priorities that has been raised by the referendums in France and the Netherlands. The two main items on the European Council&#039;s agenda are future financing&#151;that is the EU&#039;s revenue-raising mechanism and its budget&#151;and the constitutional treaty and the related issue of enlargement.

<a name="stpa_52">The United Kingdom wants an EU budget that is better geared to meeting the challenges of this century, which means one that has a responsible level of spending and allocates money more fairly, effectively and efficiently, with a focus on helping the poorest nations and supporting good-quality research and innovation. The European Commission had proposed setting the EU&#039;s budget between 2007&nbsp;and 2013&nbsp;at 1.26&nbsp;per cent. of European gross national income, or GNI, which would have represented a real-terms spending increase of 35&nbsp;per cent., or &#8364;260&nbsp;billion. Along with Germany, France, Sweden, the Netherlands and Austria, we have made it clear that such an increase is completely unacceptable and that the EU&#039;s objectives can be fully achieved within a budget that represents no more than 1&nbsp;per cent. of the gross national income of its member states. As I have explained, not least to fellow Foreign Ministers, the difference between 1.26&nbsp;per cent. and 1&nbsp;per cent. sounds small, but as the denominator is huge, the difference is more than &#8364;200&nbsp;billion, which is more than the gross national income of Poland, which is a medium-sized member state.

Can the Foreign Secretary confirm that the UK Government&#039;s position would lead to such a loss?

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>15 Jun 2005 : Column 279</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>

<p>
<a name="50615-08_para2">
<a name="stpa_53">Our clear statement of the need for budget discipline has shifted the centre of gravity of the debate. The result of that pressure was a shift from the European Commission&#039;s original 1.26&nbsp;per cent. proposal to a 1.09&nbsp;per cent. proposal from the Luxembourg presidency, which is less than half the Commission&#039;s proposed increase. Although that represents a significant advance, it is still not good enough.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50615-08_para3">
<a name="stpa_54">On the spending allocations themselves, there are two key areas of concern. First is the structural and cohesion funds, which are the EU&#039;s support for the poorest regions. As the proposals now stand, the member states of the old EU-15&nbsp;would get almost as much from the structural and cohesion funds as the 10&nbsp;new members, plus Romania and Bulgaria, which are, on average, far poorer. As well as being unfair, that is wasteful because much of the funding represents simply recycling money between richer member states that could more efficiently pursue their own national programmes of regional aid. The structural and cohesion funds should thus be focused on the EU&#039;s poorest member states, with others doing more to finance their own regional policies. If our proposals for reform are adopted in full, the British Government have given a commitment to domestic funding for the United Kingdom&#039;s nations and regions to ensure that they do not lose out as a result.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50615-08_para4">
<a name="stpa_55">The second question of expenditure concerns the common agricultural policy, which still accounts for far too high a proportion of the EU&#039;s expenditure. About one euro in 12&nbsp;of the whole EU budget is spent on French farmers alone. As a whole, expenditure on the CAP represents more than 40&nbsp;per cent. of the total EU budget, which is odd as it goes to just 5&nbsp;per cent. of the population. Only further reform of European agricultural support will begin to address those imbalances.

 If the Foreign Secretary is saying that the UK will replace the regional funding currently paid from the EU with money coming directly from the British Government, is that not effectively the same as increasing the EU budget? Would we not be paying for something for which the money previously came back from the EU?
</p>








<p><a name="st_53"><a name="50615-09_spnew1"><b> Mr. Straw: </b> 
 I am sorry for the hon. Gentleman, but he needs to understand the fundamental difference between money that we choose to spend ourselves, which is approved by the House, and money allocated centrally by the European Union. One proposal on the table to which we can certainly give some support is the nationalisation of part of CAP spending. In other words, individual member states would be given greater responsibility for financing their spending on agriculture. That would not amount to fundamental reform, but it would be a step in the right direction.

<p><a name="st_54"><a name="50615-09_spnew2"><b> Lembit &#214;pik  (Montgomeryshire) (LD):</b> 
 I am interested by the Foreign Secretary&#039;s assurance that the Government would ensure that nations and regions would get compensatory investment to replace the European money that they stand to lose.

<br>&nbsp;<br>because it is crucial, especially for rural and deprived areas in Britain, to know what we will need to compare that investment with.

 I understand the hon. Gentleman&#039;s concern. My area has benefited from European Union funding, so I confess that I am not without a constituency interest in the matter. I cannot answer his question because we do not know the denominator about which we are talking. We do not know how the overall budget will come out, or what the balance of spending for the structural and cohesion funds will be. However, I have put my statement on record.

<p><a name="st_56"><a name="50615-09_spnew4"><b> Rev. Ian Paisley  (North Antrim) (DUP):</b> 
 The Foreign Secretary will no doubt be aware that an announcement was recently made to farmers that the CAP had been secured after a mid-term review. Is he suggesting that the process will be reopened and that the farmers will not know their future, bearing it in mind that agriculture is the mainstay of our economy in Northern Ireland?
</p>








<p><a name="st_57"><a name="50615-09_spnew5"><b> Mr. Straw: </b> 
 Of course I appreciate that agriculture is one of the mainstays of the economy of Northern Ireland. I was actually present at the October 2002&nbsp;European Council. The decisions about the mid-term review for the current financial perspective did not set in concrete the CAP for the next financial perspective, as is made clear in the text. The conclusions on direct payments begin with the words:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_8">&quot;Without prejudice to future decisions on the CAP and the financing of the EU after 2006&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="50615-09_para0">
<a name="stpa_56">The European Council set a ceiling for total annual expenditure for market-related expenditure and direct payments under category 1.A, but did not set a floor. It is thus entirely consistent with what was agreed in October 2002&#151;and with common sense&#151;for us to push for further reform of the CAP, if we can achieve it.

 The House will welcome the last passage of the Foreign Secretary&#039;s speech, in particular the justification that appears to exist for those issues to be reopened.

<p><a name="st_59"><a name="50615-09_spnew7"><b> Mr. Straw: </b> 
 I entirely agree. In the rather quaintly named Foreign Ministers conclave on Sunday and three weeks ago, there was a lot of smoke and mirrors, but we were not locked in and there was no conclusion. In both discussions, I made the point to my Foreign Minister colleagues that our proposals for 1&nbsp;per cent. GNI were in no sense inconsistent with the European Union being more effective&#151;in other words, seeming to do more for its citizens. It is unacceptable for the European Commission to propose, as it did in its 1.26&nbsp;per cent. budget proposals, a real-terms 5&nbsp;per cent. increase in administration costs when we all know from our experience&#151;this is a cross-party issue&#151;that we get greater efficiency and better delivery if we turn the screw on costs. It is amazing what can be achieved. That is why

<a name="stpa_57">As one of the European Union&#039;s richer nations, the United Kingdom makes a net contribution to the EU budget, helping to support poorer member states, particularly new members in central and eastern Europe. The rebate that the UK receives on that contribution corrects for the fact that we are the lowest net recipient per capita of any member state, in part because of the small size and the efficiency of our agricultural sector. Without the rebate, our contribution would be out of all proportion to the UK&#039;s relative prosperity and economic weight within the European Union. Without the rebate, from 1995&nbsp;to 2003&nbsp;we would have paid 15&nbsp;times more than France and 12&nbsp;times more than Italy.

Surely it is unwise to accept at this stage that we are prepared to pay 1&nbsp;per cent. because if we get drastic cuts, as we should, in the CAP, the budget will decrease at a much greater rate.

<a name="stpa_63">Obviously, I cannot anticipate the conclusions of the Council, but in the meetings of EU Foreign Ministers that I attended earlier this week, there was emerging consensus that at least decisions on whether to proceed with ratification should be left to individual member states. There is also growing recognition of the need for&#151;to use the now well-worn phrase&#151;a period of reflection. As I told the House on 6&nbsp;&nbsp;June, Britain&#039;s position is that currently it would not be sensible to proceed with Second Reading of the Bill providing for our ratification of the treaty by referendum, given the current uncertainty over its future following the referendums in France and the Netherlands.

Due to the sentiments in countries that voted no, there have been suggestions that there are questions about the enlargement process. We need to be clear about that. First, the EU&#039;s commitments on enlargement are categorical and were made under existing treaties, not the new constitutional treaty. Secondly, although, in our judgment, the process of enlargement would have been assisted by the constitutional treaty, it is taking place under the existing acquis, the EU&#039;s current rules and treaties, and not those of the constitutional treaty. We shall be pursuing those commitments, as the EU presidency, from next month. Lastly, when Foreign Ministers discussed the matter, the general sentiment in the room, which I hope will be translated into formal conclusions on Thursday and Friday, was that the European Council should recall the December European Council conclusions and underline the need to implement in full the commitments in respect of enlargement for Turkey, Bulgaria and Romania and the other countries involved.

<a name="stpa_71">In seeking reform within the EU we must recognise the benefits of the Union and the importance of the United Kingdom&#039;s engagement within it. When we have engaged, the UK has shaped to our benefit the rules that allow British citizens to travel, work and live freely anywhere in Europe, and to receive welfare benefits, health care and fair legal protection while they are there. We have secured European liberalisation, which has slashed air fares and brought the cost of telephone calls down by half. UK and other European businesses once had to fill in 60&nbsp;million customs forms a year simply to trade with Europe, with all the attendant bureaucracy and delay. Today, however, they can trade directly to the same standards and rules as local firms in a market of over 450&nbsp;million consumers. EU police and justice co-operation is bringing drug smugglers, people traffickers and fraudsters to book.

 It is doubtful whether the individuals who organised the forthcoming summit foresaw that, following the decisive rejection of the proposed constitution by the Dutch and the French, it would become an historic event. After those two referendums, there has been much gnashing of Eurocrat teeth in the past few weeks, including by our new Commissioner, Peter Mandelson, who has set a new record for going native in Brussels. However, even diehards are starting to acknowledge the inevitable and bow to the fact that in a democratic Europe the clearly expressed wishes of voters must be respected and that the constitution is dead.

</p>

<p>
<a name="50615-11_para2">
<a name="stpa_73">Others are in denial, pretending that nothing material has happened and that the process of ratification can still continue. The argument is that if people voted yes, they clearly understood the issues surrounding the constitution; but if they voted no, they did not understand the complexities and were voting against Chirac, Turkey, Polish plumbers or anything but the constitution.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50615-11_para3">
<a name="stpa_74">We have been treated to a virtuoso performance by the EU political elites, who have shown how out of touch they are with the people whose interests they are supposed to serve. Today, the Foreign Secretary told us that there will not be a collective decision on the future of ratification. What a lack of leadership by European politicians. In the past week, we have been subject to the ritual brandishing of that favourite red herring, the British rebate. If one is in trouble in Euroland, why not indulge in ritual Brit-bashing, which is designed to deflect attention from one&#039;s own domestic political disaster and one&#039;s catastrophic misjudgment of one&#039;s own voters? We have read a huge amount of nonsense&#151;how gullible much of the European media has been.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50615-11_para4">
<a name="stpa_75">The real issue in Europe is the collapse of the constitution. There has never been a serious prospect of Britain unilaterally ditching the rebate, and even less chance of France negotiating away its common agricultural policy advantages to reopen the debate. Any British Prime Minister who voluntarily comprised Margaret Thatcher&#039;s hard-won veto would be treated with utter contempt by the British people. We know that, they know it, the Prime Minister knows it and President Chirac knows it. We are all knowledgeable, but it does not get us very far.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50615-11_para5">
<a name="stpa_76">The summit comes not at a time of crisis for Europe, but at a time of enormous opportunity. French and Dutch voters have done us a great favour, as they have stopped in its tracks a constitution that would have taken Europe in entirely the wrong direction. As I said last week, perhaps the signing of the constitution by the Prime Minister and its other authors was the high-water mark of European integration. We now have a chance to develop a more flexible Europe that is more outward looking, less centralised, less bureaucratic, more trusting of national identity, and which is designed to be the servant, not the master, of its citizens. The House and the country need a realistic and balanced assessment of two key relationships&#151;the relationship between the United Kingdom and the European Union, and the relationship between the European Union and the rest of the world.

<br>&nbsp;<br>the European Union has had the effect of encouraging less stable aspirant countries to settle their differences. We have been able to welcome states from eastern Europe. We have also welcomed states, as the Minister for Europe said in a recent speech, with a different political history, such as Spain, Greece and Portugal&#151;which suffered under right-wing tyrannies&#151;into the family of European nations. The progress of the single market, albeit too slow, takes us in the right direction, but there is a terrible malaise in the European Union that cannot be ignored.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50615-11_para7">
<a name="stpa_78">Too many European leaders still have a Eurocentric view of the world that is a generation out of date. As the Foreign Secretary noted, while the European Union gazes inwards, China, south Asia and the Americas continue to take an increased share of world markets, eroding opportunities for European prosperity and influence. It is not a coincidence that many more jobs have been created in the United States than in the European Union, or that the United States is still increasing its share of world trade. Social democratic policies on the continent are making Europe ever less competitive in an ever more competitive global economic environment. On a rapidly ageing continent, the omens are not good. As was said in our debate last week, by 2010&nbsp;the EU&#039;s working-age population will begin a long-term decline. Over the next 40&nbsp;years, the working-age populations of Germany, Italy and Spain will fall by about a third, which will have a major impact on the European economy. The EU&#039;s own financial projections are worse than the Foreign Secretary said, as they suggest that economic growth in Europe will be only half that of the United States between now and 2050. Projections show that the EU&#039;s share of global GDP will slump from 18&nbsp;per cent. to just 10&nbsp;per cent. by 2050, while America&#039;s share will rise from 23&nbsp;per cent. to 26&nbsp;per cent.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50615-11_para8">
<a name="stpa_79">The problems are exacerbated by the willingness of too many European leaders to blame someone else for their country&#039;s economic woes. There is no point in French or German politicians blaming external factors for the dreadful performance of their economies. Unless they are willing to have the courage and commitment to introduce the supply-side economic reforms that Britain undertook under the Conservatives in the 1980s, they will consign yet another generation of young Europeans to structural unemployment, which is not an acceptable price for keeping European politicians inside their comfort zone.

 What we can do is ensure that we are not discriminating against efficient farmers. The UK has an extraordinarily efficient farming sector. The problem with so much of the CAP is that it is formulated in a way that helps inefficient farming.

 The hon.

<a name="stpa_98">The charter of fundamental rights is one of the most essential elements of the constitution. It would be the bedrock of constitutional law in the EU. Judges in Europe would accrue new powers over legislation in this country. The Government have said that the charter is sufficiently explicit about limiting its own application. That has been one of the Government&#039;s central arguments about why we should not fear that part of the constitution, but I draw the Foreign Secretary&#039;s attention to a paper by Richard Wilkins and Marya Reed on the subject, which is in the Library. They compared the development of law in the United States to what is happening in the EU, saying:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_14">&quot;Comparative constitutional history suggests that, despite its own proclamations to the contrary, the Charter may well alter substantially the respective powers of the EU and its nation states. Like the Charter, the Bill of Rights appended to the United States Constitution was initially intended to apply only to the federal government, not the member states. Over time, however, and precisely because the requirements of the Bill of Rights were deemed to be &#039;fundamental to the American scheme of justice&#039;, constitutional provisions that were initially drafted to apply only to the federal government became generally applicable to all government entities, federal or state.&quot;</p>

I am entirely in favour of that particular treaty, but we must accept that we joined the single market in the belief that we would get a market of mutual recognition, but we have moved almost inexorably into a market of harmonisation, which inevitably means an increased body of law.

The treaty may be as dead as the proverbial dodo, but we need to have processes in the EU that make decision making more transparent and closer to the people. As we have heard today, there were proposals in the draft treaty that did not need treaty changes&#151;for example, the subsidiarity early warning system and the requirement on the Council of Ministers to legislate in public. Since I came into the House this afternoon, I am sure that I heard the Leader of the Opposition support that, and I believe that the shadow Foreign Secretary was supportive as well. I got the impression that he was even supportive of qualified majority voting, which was a boost for those of us who support such progressive changes.

 I am afraid that I cannot resist an historical reference. I apologise to those, including the hon. Member for Buckingham (John Bercow), who has just left, who may have heard it before. It is this: there was an opportunity during the Committee stage of the Maastricht Bill to vote for a referendum. It was provided by new clause 51, which was tabled by Mr. Bryan Gould, who was then a Labour Opposition Member. There was a vote, and if my memory serves me right 50&nbsp;or 60&nbsp;Members voted in favour of a referendum. I do not offer that as an effort to establish virtue on my part or on the part of my right hon. and hon. Friends but to point out that there was an opportunity for those who felt that the treaty of Maastricht went so far that a referendum was required to express that preference by way of a vote. It is notable that the treaty of Maastricht was the origin of the common foreign and security policy about which we have had so many discussions in this House, and which envisaged the possibility of a common defence. That has not proceeded for reasons that are doubtless intelligent and sensible. However, it is worth re-examining Maastricht when people feel concerned about the extent to which&#151;they claim&#151;powers would be transferred unnecessarily and illegitimately to Brussels as a result of the constitutional treaty, which has been the subject of negative votes in France and the Netherlands.

It makes no sense to reject qualified majority voting on principle in all circumstances unless one is willing to accept that, in all circumstances, every country can have a veto, and that all progress and development in the European Union, for example, on strengthening the single market, should be subject to the veto of one aggrieved country.

<br>&nbsp;<br>treaty of Rome most certainly was not perfect, and whatever claims were made for the Single European Act in 1986&nbsp;by the then Government, I do not suppose that it was perfect either. Nor was Maastricht perfect, nor Amsterdam, nor Nice. All, however, in due course, passed the test of this House. However sympathetic one might have been to the treaty, one must now accept that we cannot afford to ignore the most recently expressed political will of two countries of Europe. We should also recognise that the likelihood of the people of France and the Netherlands reversing their vote is remote, and that the likelihood of the Governments of France and the Netherlands asking their citizens to vote again is even more so.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50615-16_para4">
<a name="stpa_126">The harsh, practical fact is that without Dutch and French assent this treaty cannot be enacted. I therefore do not believe that it would make any sense to have a referendum of the British people. I have described that previously as being quixotic, and it would be bizarre to ask the British people to endorse a treaty that could not be enacted. One needs only to ask oneself, as the right hon. and learned Member for Rushcliffe (Mr. Clarke) did to some effect on a previous occasion when we discussed these matters, what sort of turnout we would achieve in a referendum designed to vote yes or no to a treaty that could not be enacted. I suspect, being rather partisan, that only the zealots who are opposed to Europe in all circumstances would feel motivated to come out and vote.

If one were in a political party in Holland, perhaps one&#039;s attitude would be conditioned to a large extent by what had happened there. We are a little more detached and we are entitled to take our own view. I most certainly do not think that it would make any kind of common sense to seek a referendum on a treaty that cannot be enacted. In that regard, I find myself not for the first time wholly at one on these matters with the robust views expressed by the right hon. and learned Member for Rushcliffe.

<a name="stpa_133">There is no doubt that the European Union will need to evolve. Further changes may be necessary to ensure that it works more effectively and efficiently. I believe fundamentally that change should be incremental, not convulsive.

</p>

<p>
<a name="50615-17_para2">
<a name="stpa_135">At Prime Minister&#039;s questions, the Prime Minister talked of two particular areas on which I want to touch briefly. The first was the impact of globalisation and he identified rightly the economic significance of the rise of India and China. We would do well, however, to consider not just the economic advance but the political advance. One does not have to go far among Indian politicians to find an overwhelming conviction that they are now entitled to a permanent seat on the United Nations Security Council. In relation to China, we do not have to accept the official figures for defence spending. Rather, we should look behind those figures to see that, in addition to the quite remarkable economic growth that China is enjoying, there is equally a growth, which is perhaps not quite so spectacular, in China&#039;s defence posture.

<a name="stpa_136">It is inevitable, if those countries expand economically in the way we have seen and in the way we predict, that they will exercise greater political influence, or seek to do so. That, I believe, is an overwhelming argument in favour of the European Union being not just a free trade area, but an institution that has a political purpose and, so far as possible, a unanimous common foreign and security policy.

<p>
<a name="50615-17_para4">
<a name="stpa_137">The Prime Minister pointed to a second area, and he is quite right to do so, particularly against the background of the last two or three years in our relationship with the United States and Iraq. He said that it is important to consider the relationship between the European Union and the United States. That is absolutely right. I have some criticism, which I have voiced in the past, about the nature of the current relationship between our Government and the American Administration. I would prefer what I have described previously as a partnership of influence.

Many of the problems that France and Germany have experienced are structural. Indeed, there is a compelling argument for saying that it is easy to blame Europe and the single currency for a failure by some Governments to take decisions domestically that would otherwise prove unpopular. Anyone who has followed the election result in North Rhine-Westphalia will see that Mr. Schr&#246;der&#039;s efforts along those lines have proved extremely unpopular politically, and of course have precipitated a German general election in September.

That the EU remains one of our strongest supporters of the peace process and the move towards stability in Northern Ireland was established beyond doubt only one week ago, when, despite last June&#039;s verdict, the European Commission announced a further &#163;97&nbsp;million of Peace II funding. We in the Social Democratic and Labour party, along with my colleagues in this House, recognise and welcome that support, and we remain equally strong in our commitment to Europe.

<a name="stpa_152">In a maiden speech, it would be remiss of me not to mention some of my local interests. Although I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak in this august Chamber and to contribute to today&#039;s debate, the truth is that I would much prefer to be back on the ground in Belfast, working in the local devolved Assembly to bring peace and to strengthen the peace process that has been working there. I would prefer to be in Belfast, delivering real change for my constituents and making the Good Friday agreement work, but it is here that I must be, because of the intransigence, cynicism, lack of imagination and insecurities of other political movements in Northern Ireland. Because of the absolute absence of any democratic accountability in Northern Ireland, it is here that I must be. Because the Government have shirked from their commitments under the Good Friday agreement and have at times chosen the way of shady side deals and secret promises, it is here that I must be.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50615-18_para6">
<a name="stpa_153">I am here without apology as an Irish nationalist. Like many Irish leaders before us down the centuries, my party and I choose to stand here and to fight our corner honestly, and to argue an honourable case. With no other forum in which to hold the Government to account, and no other way to address the many serious issues facing my constituents, we stand up for them and fight for their needs. It saddens me deeply that five out of Northern Ireland&#039;s 18&nbsp;MPs do not have the courage to do the same and to be here to argue their case.

</p>

<p>
<a name="50615-18_para7">
<a name="stpa_154">I stand here and fight for a better deal for my constituents because all the people of Belfast, South&#151;nationalists, Unionists and those of neither persuasion&#151;deserve no less from me. In Belfast, South, I am privileged to serve a constituency that encapsulates much that is good, and which perhaps better than any other illustrates the many and varied issues that are holding Northern Ireland back. It is the home of some of the most successful 

<br>&nbsp;<br>

<br>&nbsp;<br>business and professional people in the country, and it also includes some of the areas of greatest deprivation and social need. It contains some of the most fiercely loyalist, and some of the most staunchly provo, districts in Northern Ireland.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50615-18_para8">
<a name="stpa_155">Some of my constituents have enjoyed the benefits of relative economic success, while many more live under the yoke of paramilitary crime syndicates and are brutalised daily by gangs of one hue or another. The malaise that hangs over much of Belfast, South is the same one that hangs over Northern Ireland. It is a malaise born of economic stagnation, cynicism about our politicians and a general disillusionment with the breakdowns and the stop-start methods of the peace process. It is a malaise that is exacting a terrible human toll. I give a simple example. A generation of young men has been cut down by one of the highest suicide rates in Europe. In my constituency alone, we can treat only one third of those presenting with mental illness, an issue which we discussed earlier today. The development of mental health services in Northern Ireland has fallen well behind the rest of the UK. This is particularly so in, for example, certain inner-city areas in my constituency that have levels of deprivation and poor social cohesion that are among the highest in Northern Ireland. Inner-city deprivation results in higher mental health needs, but community mental health services in Belfast, South are inadequately developed, and staffed far short of the levels required to meet the range of mental health needs.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50615-18_para9">
<a name="stpa_156">The disillusionment with our political process to which I referred has been encouraged by&#151;and, in turn, encourages&#151;parties whose strength comes from fear and division. It is an attitude that has served those parties well, but it serves no one else. As the parties of division have succeeded, our shared public services&#151;the bread-and-butter issues that reflect the needs of our ordinary people&#151;have failed. Be it the health service, schools, the infrastructure or the economy, we are seeing the direct and devastating effects of political failure. While the extreme loyalists and provos play their political games, everybody else suffers.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50615-18_para10">
<a name="stpa_157">It might not be entirely clear to the House what a failure direct rule can be for us at times, but I would like to give two simple examples of what happens when accountability slips and is removed&#151;examples that should be close to the heart of this Government. In Northern Ireland we have good schools and excellent teachers who are struggling to educate a new generation of our children to practise reconciliation, to build a future, to break the cycle of underachievement, resentment and violence, and to dare, perhaps, to hope for a better future. I am aware that the Government were once elected on a platform of education, education, education, but I regret that in Northern Ireland our education budget has been cut.

</p>

<p>
<a name="50615-18_para11">
<a name="stpa_158">At times we hear of difficulties across Britain, and criticism of the Government that I often do not accept: I support the Government and most of what they do, and I do not like some of the allegations that are made. Let me, however, give a second example. Our region struggles with planning policy perhaps more than any other. We have a city, Belfast, that needs a co-ordinated urban regeneration policy. Perhaps I could refer briefly to what Sherlock Holmes might historically have described as the

<br>&nbsp;<br>Sprucefield John Lewis case. Developers sought permission for a massive 500,000&nbsp;sq ft development 11&nbsp;miles from the city. I was satisfied that it would never go through&#151;that the application would be thrown out&#151;as was the chief executive of our planning service. Unfortunately, our new local Environment Minister had other plans. Barely a fortnight into the job he called a press conference and announced that the project would go ahead, devastating the heart of the city and Belfast, South in particular. My constituents are bewildered, to say the least.

</p>

<p>
<a name="50615-18_para12">
<a name="stpa_159">Various factors have combined to bring the SDLP to this point. I have already mentioned the parties of division, but I am sad to say that at times another factor has been the attitude of Government. Last year, Government decided to sideline the SDLP in negotiations. Much time and energy was devoted to the parties of division. By sidelining the SDLP, Government sidelined the party of inclusivity and pluralism. It was never going to work, and when it failed the SDLP was expected to throw out the Good Friday agreement and cobble together a shady deal. We are not interested in a shady deal. We believe that there is a future in Northern Ireland. That is what we are working for here, and that is what we are prepared to fight for here.
</p>

<p>

<a name="stpa_160">We in the SDLP have shown, I think, that we will not be ignored. We stand up to militant thugs on the ground at home, and we will stand up politically everywhere else for what we believe in. For centuries Irish Members of Parliament have been returned to this House to make a case for justice, equality and peace in Ireland. The SDLP is proud to have three Members here, and to continue that honourable tradition.

<a name="stpa_161">Our party has played a major role in bringing the region to where it is today, bringing about the peace process, and bringing about the stability&#151;or relative stability&#151;that has been created. We stand closer today to achieving the goals that have been sought for centuries, the goals of justice, equality and peace, than at any other time in our history. I must warn the House, however, that Northern Ireland stands on the verge of something much less positive.

<p>
<a name="50615-18_para15">
<a name="stpa_162">My colleague and great friend, the former Member of Parliament Seamus Mallon, has talked of the balkanisation of Northern Ireland. That is a nightmare for all of us. If the parties of division have their way, we will all live in single-community ghettos. I assure the House that the SDLP will stand up to those who would seek to establish such an apartheid society.

<a name="stpa_163">When we began our struggle 35&nbsp;years ago, marching for civil rights&#151;it continued until the time of the Good Friday agreement, as we sought justice, equality and fairness&#151;we wanted to create a pluralist, tolerant society where every child would be cherished equally and our towns and cities would be shared places welcoming all. In that struggle, we will continue to fight for justice on behalf of families such as the family of Pat Finucane. We will continue to stand beside families such as the McCartney sisters as they resist mob rule and thuggery, and provide an example for all of us of decency, a high profile and courage.

<p><a name="st_156"><a name="50615-19_spnew0"><b> Mr. William Hague  (Richmond, Yorks) (Con):</b> 
 It is a great pleasure to be the first to congratulate the hon. Member for Belfast, South (Dr. McDonnell)&#151;although I see that the Foreign Secretary is competing with me&#151;on his excellent maiden speech. He spoke eloquently about his constituency. He mentioned his predecessor, the Reverend Martin Smyth, whom many of us counted as a friend. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will enjoy as many friends in the House as his predecessor, and that his constituents will enjoy the benefits of peace, of which he spoke eloquently as well. He also showed that he has understood from the beginning that it is not necessary to shout in the House in order to be heard. That is a new insight for some Northern Ireland Members in particular, and I hope it will set a continuing example to many other Members.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50615-19_para0">
<a name="stpa_166">The hon. Gentleman referred&#151;this is relevant to today&#039;s European debate&#151;to the old saying &quot;Fog in Channel, continent cut off&quot;. That may not be a fair comparison with the situation today. A closer analogy would be &quot;Fog in Brussels, people of Europe cut off&quot;. One of the disappointments of the debate so far is that the Front-Bench speeches&#151;with the exception of the speech of my hon. Friend the Member for Woodspring (Dr. Fox)&#151;have not quite lived up to the drama of what has happened. I know that this is the third parliamentary occasion on which the subject has been discussed in the past nine days, and that may partly explain it; but the right hon. and learned Member for North-East Fife (Sir Menzies Campbell) is still cheerily clinging to the view that Germany&#039;s economic problems have nothing whatever to do with the euro. He was right to point out that those problems had other origins, but it may now be time for the advocates of the euro to recognise that it may be one of the factors making economic conditions in the eurozone substantially worse.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50615-19_para1">
<a name="stpa_167">Even German Ministers now seem to think that. Apparently, Germany&#039;s Economy Minister, Mr. Clement, said at the beginning of the month:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_18">&quot;We&#039;re exporting stability within monetary union, and for the good of monetary union. We&#039;re paying for that, and it has to be said that the price is not negligible since we&#039;re losing the comparative advantage of lower real interest rates&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="50615-19_para2">
<a name="stpa_168">So even German Ministers are beginning to say that the euro is having an adverse effect on their economy. It is time for advocates of the euro in Britain to recognise that as well.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50615-19_para3">
<a name="stpa_169">It was also disappointing to hear the Foreign Secretary continue to defend some of the supposed innovations in the European constitution as an 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>15 Jun 2005 : Column 312</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>improvement in democratic procedures. There should be a bigger role for national Parliaments, he said, quite rightly. Many of us throughout the House would agree with that. However, are we to believe the procedures outlined in the constitutional treaty, whereby if we get a third of all the other Parliaments in the European Union to object to something the Commission will deign to give it a second thought&#151;and not necessarily change it? Can anyone imagine telling the parish councils of Britain that only if a third of them passed a resolution objecting to a Government White Paper would we consider thinking about it again in the House? That would be regarded as extremely arrogant, yet we are meant to accept it in the national Parliaments of Europe as a democratic crumb from the Brussels machine. We are meant to rejoice in the idea that our views may be considered if we can get other Parliaments to come along with us. If the Government are to champion the role of national Parliaments in European democracy, they will have to be far bolder and more radical than that.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50615-19_para4">
<a name="stpa_170">It was also disappointing to find evidence in the Foreign Secretary&#039;s speech that the Government&#039;s negotiating position for the European Council may not have been fully thought through. My right hon. Friend the Member for Skipton and Ripon (Mr. Curry) asked him about the implications of the Government&#039;s proposals at the Council for existing policy on the common agricultural policy and for the transition to a new system of farm payments over the next five or seven years, and it has to be said that the answer was roughly along the lines that the Government &quot;haven&#039;t the foggiest&quot; about those implications. Those, however, will presumably be among the first questions that French and German Ministers will ask when the UK rebate is discussed in the Council.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50615-19_para5">
<a name="stpa_171">Nevertheless, I want to heap some praise on the Foreign Secretary today. Much ironic praise, no doubt deserved, has already been directed at the Minister for Europe, but it was the Foreign Secretary&#151;or so it is said in press reports&#151;who persuaded the Prime Minister during the course of last summer to commit this country to a referendum, and it was the Prime Minister&#039;s commitment, according to other press reports, that prompted President Chirac to hold a referendum in France. It just may be that if any one individual is to be thanked more than any other for the destruction of the European constitution, it should be the Foreign Secretary, who threw the pebble that created the avalanche. If that is the case, many of us would like heartily to congratulate him on doing so today. He has been a democratic catalyst and I hope that he will be one again.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50615-19_para6">
<a name="stpa_172">Unfortunately, as a catalyst, he put the Prime Minister&#039;s policies on these matters through yet further changes. I believe that the Prime Minister is now on his seventh policy in 18&nbsp;months on the question of holding a referendum on the European constitution. My right hon. Friend the Member for Chingford and Woodford Green (Mr. Duncan Smith) compared it at Prime Minister&#039;s Questions to the Kama Sutra, but even with all the Prime Minister&#039;s skills of ambiguity, his endemic contortions and U-turns, he is not quite in that category. Nevertheless, there have been seven different policies so far.


<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>15 Jun 2005 : Column 313</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>

<p>
<a name="50615-19_para7">
<a name="stpa_173">First, the European constitution was nothing more than a tidying-up exercise, clarified, when I asked the right hon. Member for Neath (Mr. Hain) some months ago, into a three-quarters tidying-up exercise, which was not important enough to justify a referendum in the UK. Then the policy changed, when the Prime Minister decided that it was too important to be put to a referendum in the UK. Holding such a referendum, apparently, would have been a gross and irresponsible betrayal of our national interest because parliamentary scrutiny was required.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50615-19_para8">
<a name="stpa_174">The third policy was that a referendum was not ruled out, after all. The fourth was that it was an excellent idea&#151;this was after the Foreign Secretary had done his handy work of persuasion&#151;and the Prime Minister stood at the Dispatch Box last summer to declare in ringing terms:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_19">&quot;Let those of us who believe in Britain in Europe&#151;not because of Europe alone, but because we believe in Britain and our national interest lying in Europe&#151;make our case, too. Let the issue be put and let the battle be joined.&quot;&#151;[<i>Official Report,</i> 20&nbsp;April 2004; Vol. 420, c. 157.]</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="50615-19_para9">
<a name="stpa_175">Astonishingly, after that he refused to join in the battle at all and spent the next 12&nbsp;months totally evading that battle. It is as if Henry V had said before Agincourt that there were


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_20">&quot;gentleman in England now abed should think themselves accursed they were not here&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="50615-19_para10">
<a name="stpa_176">and then gone off for a nap himself. That was the position of the Prime Minister.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50615-19_para11">
<a name="stpa_177">Having failed to join the battle and having been understandably quizzed in the general election campaign on whether a referendum would happen, we were then assured by no less than <i>The Sun</i> on 20&nbsp;April that Blair had given


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_21">&quot;an unequivocal promise to The Sun that he will allow the people to vote in a referendum on the constitution, even if the French vote No on May 29&nbsp;and effectively kill the treaty.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="50615-19_para12">
<a name="stpa_178">That unequivocal promise, then, became the fifth Prime Minister&#039;s policy the issue.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50615-19_para13">
<a name="stpa_179">Now, however, we have a sixth policy, which is a period of reflection. After a lengthy such period, we are told, we should take a leadership role in Europe. That is not exactly a stirring call to battle. A seventh policy is no doubt on the way&#151;after that period of reflection or perhaps after the European Council meeting.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50615-19_para14">
<a name="stpa_180">It is clear that the European constitution is dead. Of course, it is right for the Government not to hold a referendum if other countries recognise that the constitution is dead, but we should not believe that there would not be a large turnout in a referendum or that a referendum should not be held in this country because people would not find it interesting enough. They would find it interesting and they would turn out in large numbers. The real reason for the decision not to hold a referendum is that the Government know full well that there is not an earthly chance of winning such a referendum in this country. As I said, however, if the European Council is to consign the constitution to where it belongs on the scrapheap, the policy would then be acceptable.


<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>15 Jun 2005 : Column 314</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>

<p>
<a name="50615-19_para15">
<a name="stpa_181">It seems to be taking some European politicians a long time to realise what has happened. One French Minister on European Affairs said last week, in advocating that other countries should proceed with ratification:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_22">&quot;It is a question of democracy. It is not for one member of the EU to decide for the others, or to block the process of ratification of a treaty signed by 25&nbsp;countries.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="50615-19_para16">
<a name="stpa_182">That is a remarkable statement. Surely, in a treaty that requires unanimous agreement, it is indeed for one member to decide for the others. If that country wishes to do so, it can block ratification. It merely adds to the bizarre nature of the remarks that I quoted that it is that Minister&#039;s own country that has blocked ratification. I hope that the Foreign Secretary will ram those points home&#151;albeit in a diplomatic style&#151;when he attends the Council in a few days time.

: I am following the right hon. Gentleman&#039;s argument closely, but was it not Conservative policy to campaign for a no vote so as to renegotiate a better agreement? Has not France adopted the same approach in an attempt to secure a better deal for itself?
</p>








<p><a name="st_158"><a name="50615-20_spnew1"><b> Mr. Hague: </b> 
 The French voted no emphatically, and they no doubt had many reasons for doing so. No doubt, some people were dissatisfied with their Government, and I believe that many felt that they were losing control of their own affairs. We can all believe in a better agreement, but what better agreement is available? For a long time, we have been told that there was no plan B if any country voted no, and no possibility of anything being agreed in place of the original proposals. We shall see from the actions of the European Governments whether that was a correct statement of the position.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50615-20_para0">
<a name="stpa_183">Many of us would like better arrangements in Europe, and I shall use the minutes remaining to me to say what I think they should be. However, I believe that three great tensions in respect of the future development and policies of the EU have been thrown into sharp relief by the no vote in France and Holland. Notwithstanding their period of reflection, the Government must be very clear about where they stand on each of those tensions.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50615-20_para1">
<a name="stpa_184">The first tension is the one emerging between enlargement and integration. It is said that an EU of the present size cannot be run without much closer integration. There is a danger that people will say that enlargement must pay the price now that integration is not immediately possible. Yet Turkey, Bulgaria and Romania ought to be entitled to join the EU. More than most, they have suffered from disunity in Europe over the centuries. If enlargement is not possible on the current model of how the EU is run, it is time to change that model. The Government must become the advocate of a looser and more flexible Europe, as suggested by my&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Folkestone and Hythe (Mr. Howard) and others over recent years.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50615-20_para2">
<a name="stpa_185">The second tension is that between democracy and centralisation. Decisions in a democratic society are taken at the level at which people gladly accept governance at other people&#039;s hands, and it is often 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>15 Jun 2005 : Column 315</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>obvious what that level should be. For example, we in Yorkshire would not accept that decisions about streetlights should be taken in Lancashire, and heaven forbid that any such thing would ever be proposed in this House.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50615-20_para3">
<a name="stpa_186">Equally, it is clear that people in France and Germany&#151;and even more so in the Netherlands&#151;do not want their taxes to be determined in other EU countries, but increasingly that is what is happening. We are meant to have a veto over taxation in the EU, yet some of this year&#039;s biggest decisions concerning the tax revenues of this and other EU countries have been taken not in the Treasury, but in the European Court of Justice.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50615-20_para4">
<a name="stpa_187">The ECJ uses single-market anti-discrimination rules to expand the powers of the EU in affairs of taxation, and it rules against national laws in between 80&nbsp;and 90&nbsp;per cent. of cases. That shows that there is a creeping loss of democracy through the operation of the European Commission and the ECJ. It is time that the Government took a robust approach and said that the&nbsp;European Commission should be stripped of the right to initiate legislation as it is not a democratic body, and that the powers of the ECJ should be curtailed.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50615-20_para5">
<a name="stpa_188">We are not going to be able to develop a single European democracy. It is almost 50&nbsp;years since the foundation of the EEC, but even now the original member countries have not become a common political entity or developed a common political ethos. There is no European polity.

<p><a name="st_160"><a name="50615-20_spnew3"><b> Mr. Hague: </b> 
 No, I believe in the European Union, but I wish it to develop in a new way. The opportunity to advocate that new way is now presented to the Government and to the Governments of those countries whose peoples have shown that they are seriously concerned by, and strongly opposed to, the current trends in the European Union.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50615-20_para6">
<a name="stpa_189">The third tension is between economic reality and political goals, and the euro is the outstanding example of that. Many of us have patiently explained for a long time that a single currency area created without a true single labour market, or without massive budgetary redistribution within that area&#151;as in the US&#151;will not work effectively. We have been denounced over the years as little Englanders and opponents of progress, but now we see from the comments by German Ministers&#151;and Italian Ministers&#151;which have been well publicised in recent days, the immense pressures that are building up as a result of adopting for political reasons an economic policy that is now destroying the jobs and livelihoods of hundreds of thousands of people across Europe. As unemployment rises in Europe, we await the apology from the people who put the euro in place. When will the problem be recognised by the Government and when will we get the formal abandonment of the now ludicrous notion that it is in this country&#039;s interests in principle to join the euro?

This weekend, the Government could put us in the vanguard of change, instead of the rearguard on every occasion. From what the Foreign Secretary said, I suspect that the Government will not take that opportunity, and it is a tragedy that they will not.

 It is a real pleasure to follow the right hon. Member for Richmond, Yorks (Mr. Hague), the former leader of the Conservative party.

<a name="stpa_191">As a result of the votes in France and the Netherlands, we face a serious crisis in the European Union and there is no getting away from that. The European Union is a magnet not only for economic progress and prosperity, but for democracy and uniting the peoples of the former Soviet Union and of countries that were occupied as a result of the Yalta agreement in a common European home. Those countries now act as a beacon to neighbours further to the south and east, and it would be a disaster if that process were put into reverse&#151;if enlargement were put on hold or we returned to the squabbles and conflicts that made Europe an area of war for much of the first 50&nbsp;years of the last century.

<a name="stpa_192">It was claimed earlier by the hon. Member for Woodspring (Dr. Fox) that it would be inconceivable to have a war in Europe now. People have very short memories. In the Balkans, we still have the potential for conflict and war. If the situation in Kosovo went wrong, the consequences could spill over into neighbours throughout the Balkans. We still have an unresolved historic territorial anomaly in Kaliningrad and we do not yet know how it will be resolved. If the process of Europeanisation does not continue in Turkey, who knows what might happen in 20&nbsp;or 30&nbsp;years? There are still issues relating to the break-up of the Ottoman empire and Turkey&#039;s relationship with Greece.

There are still significant minorities in countries that are now members of the European Union of a Russian ethnic background. Such issues have been dealt with calmly so far, and due to the enlargement of the European Union and the fact that we send out signals to the east that there is hope for people in the countries of the former Soviet Union, we have been able to provide the possibility of a peaceful transformation out of the ashes of the former Yugoslavia and the former Soviet Union. However, it would be ridiculous and dangerous to assume that if we get a renewal of nationalism and a breakdown of the European institutions, it still somehow means that Europe will be a continent of peace for all time.

 The hon. Gentleman is the first person today to make the important point about countries that are not members of the European Union. In that context, does he acknowledge that the role of the Council of Europe and the European convention on human rights is increasingly important, and that the European Union cannot deliver peace and democracy to the whole of Europe because we need other agencies, too?

 That is true, but organisations such as NATO&#151;I am a member of the NATO Parliamentary Assembly&#151;are also important, as is the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe.

We, as a Parliament and a country, can be proud of our work on democracy building, which has been done on an all-party basis since it was established in 1992&nbsp;by the John Major Government.

India should be a permanent member of the Security Council as part of the enlargement package. However, we also need a democratic Muslim country on the Security Council because it is important that the UN is not seen as a group of countries that is somehow against the Islamic world.

<p>
<a name="50615-20_para13">
<a name="stpa_196">A similar argument applies to the enlargement of the European Union and Turkey.

However, we should not say as a result of the crisis that we are putting a block on the process. If Turkey is pushed out because the French Government get their way and say that they do not want to let it in, or because the rejection of the constitutional treaty in the Netherlands is blamed on globalisation or the threat of Islam, it will damage the European Union&#039;s relations with its Islamic neighbours.

 As someone who also strongly believes in enlargement, does the hon. Gentleman agree that Turkey is unlikely to be admitted to a tightly integrated union, as foreseen by the European constitution, and is more likely to join a disaggregated and looser association of sovereign states? Surely advocates of enlargement should be against the constitution.
</p>








<p><a name="st_165"><a name="50615-21_spnew1"><b> Mike Gapes: </b> 
 I do not think that those two statements follow. I agree that when the time comes for Turkey to be admitted, which will probably be in at least two decades&#039; time, and its accession is on the agenda, we will have to face up to the need to make other arrangements. I assume, however, that intergovernmental conferences will take place between now and then. The current arrangements deal with the accession of the 10&nbsp;countries that recently joined, plus the planned accession of Romania and Bulgaria in two years&#039; time.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50615-21_para0">
<a name="stpa_198">I take the point, however, that the EU as structured is not an efficient way to deal with an enlarged 25-member EU. We need to deal with that not just in terms of subsidiarity, which is correct, the powers of national Parliaments, which I support, and the scrutiny role, but in terms of sheer efficiency and competency in how we deal with things. Anyone who goes to Brussels will see the interpreters in booths and hear them translate different languages from, for example, Greek to Finnish to something else. The sheer cost of that is not an efficient use of resources for any organisation.

<a name="50615-21_para1">
<a name="stpa_199">There are no easy answers because of national interests. Every country has its own national interest and will fight hard for it. I agree that we need to change the attitude taken. Although I would have voted for and supported the constitutional treaty, the fact that the French and Dutch rejected it gives those of us who believe in Europe, in dialogue, in co-operation and in an outward-looking enlarged EU the historic opportunity to move away from the narrow debate and to get into the wider issues of what Europe stands for and what it represents.

<a name="stpa_200">The world in which we live increasingly faces demands for intervention&#151;in terms of pre-emption and prevention, or on a humanitarian basis&#151;to deal with internal conflicts or interstate conflicts. We have to recognise that the EU needs to develop its capability to do more. We have seen developments in co-operation based on our European experience, including the important development of the British-led EUFOR taking over from SFOR in Bosnia. We can do more together. Despite difficulties on other issues, Britain and France can work well on some things, especially in Africa. We have been involved in the conflicts in the Congo, and we are already discussing the enlargement of the African Union&#039;s mandate and what support should be given to the AU with regard to Darfur. In some quarters, there have been discussions about how NATO can assist the AU, but the EU, too, could in different ways provide assistance on a more coherent basis to AU regional security structures, to deal with conflict prevention and conflict resolution.

<p><a name="st_166"><a name="50615-21_spnew2"><b> Mr. Drew: </b> 
 My hon. Friend must be aware that there was conflict between NATO and the EU over the airlift to Darfur, which caused considerable difficulty. There is a problem when two organisations overlap. What the people of Darfur want is clarity, not argument.
</p>








<p><a name="st_167"><a name="50615-21_spnew3"><b> Mike Gapes: </b> 
 My hon. Friend is right. Turf wars between NATO and the EU do not help anyone. In general, we have avoided such situations, but there is still the potential for them. Some people want to drive the Americans out of our security structure and build an alternative, which is completely unrealistic. Others, who live in the past, believe that we should do nothing unless the United States is in the lead. Neither position is correct. We need to build on what the Government agreed with the French at St. Malo in 1998, so that, incrementally, we can develop effective capabilities for the EU to act when NATO is not engaged. We should call on NATO assets for assistance when the United States itself does not want to participate.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50615-21_para3">
<a name="stpa_201">We are doing that slowly and incrementally, but we need to get away from the rhetoric, especially some of the Gaullist rhetoric&#151;a belief in Europe&#039;s capability that is not matched in reality by the contributions of the member states. Only the UK and France have forces that could seriously make such a contribution, and until the German Government take seriously their national defence responsibilities and reform their defence structures to move away from the cold war legacy of territorial defences, we shall never, either in western Europe or the EU, have a serious defence capability.

<a name="stpa_202">To be fair, the Germans have moved to some extent. They are part of ISAF&#151;the international security assistance force in Afghanistan&#151;where they are playing a positive and leading role.

</p>

<p>
<a name="50615-21_para5">
<a name="stpa_203">My final point is that we must recognise that what the EU does and says internationally matters. It is important that we ensure that the Doha round succeeds and that the meeting in Hong Kong later this year is successful. We in the EU have a responsibility both through our approach to the third world and the developing world and in our relationship with the group of 22&nbsp;countries in the negotiations, led by Brazil, India and China. If we are not flexible, there could be no agreement. Similarly, the Americans must move. Their Farm Bill and their attitudes towards some of the farm issues are as bad as the CAP that we criticise.

<a name="50615-21_para6">
<a name="stpa_204">Together, in western Europe and in Europe as a whole, we can, with the enlarged EU, have a significant voice in those international negotiations.

Failure will not be forgiven by future generations&#151;either in our continent or the rest of the world.

<a name="stpa_206">The wrangling over the future of Europe has spilled over into a debate on the European budget. The calls by some countries for the United Kingdom to give up its rebate have more to do with certain European Governments beating their breasts after electoral defeat than with the details of European finances. The rebate does not have anything whatsoever to do with the constitution and it was never part of the round of debates on the constitution. If certain Governments and countries are still smarting because the people have rejected their vision of Europe, that is their affliction, and the British people should not be told, &quot;You have to give up something, because we have had a no vote on the constitution.&quot;

I was one of a number of MEPs, including John Hume, who secured well-deserved money for a peace programme. However, when I looked across the border, I saw that the southern Government was receiving &#163;6&nbsp;million a day. To keep my seat, I was supposed to say nothing about it. However fair play is fair play, and the British people should not be told that, because two nations have said no to the constitution, they must look at the rebate. I hope that the British Government stand firm on the rebate. The Prime Minister said that they will, but his resolve is growing a little weaker every day.

<br>&nbsp;<br>British Government&#039;s position is absolutely correct. At the 2002&nbsp;summit meeting, all the Heads of Government reached an agreement on the rebate, so there is absolutely no reason why we should enter into discussions or negotiations. If the rebate were tied to a fundamental review of how the European Union budget is constructed, the issue would be different, but the short period before the discussions in Brussels at the weekend does not allow sufficient scope for such a review.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50615-22_para14">
<a name="stpa_223">We should maintain our position, which we adopted a long time ago and which was agreed by member states as far back as 2002, that the rebate remains intact. It should remain intact for the reason mentioned by all hon. Members who have contributed to this afternoon&#039;s debate: the inherent unfairness of the common agricultural policy means that 40&nbsp;per cent. of expenditure goes on 5&nbsp;per cent. of the population. It does not serve the British people&#039;s interests and British farmers&#039; interests for the agricultural budget to continue on that basis, and the Government should continue with their policy.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50615-22_para15">
<a name="stpa_224">It is very unusual for the Eurosceptic media to support the Government&#039;s position. Normally, no matter what is decided at European Council meetings and no matter whether it is in the best interests of the British people, those sections of the media who do not like the EU always criticise it. At the moment, of course, they are firmly on the Government&#039;s side because they believe that the stand that we have taken is the right one&#151;that it is positive and results in the rest of Europe being on the other side. Despite the fact that the Government have the support of the leader writers, Mr. Trevor Kavanagh and all the other people in the Eurosceptic media, we should proceed along this course of action, because if we were to give in at this stage it would create enormous problems for the way in which we wish to continue with our discussions on the budget.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50615-22_para16">
<a name="stpa_225">An essential part of our discussions on the CAP must also relate to economic reform. In just fourteen days&#039; time, we will take over the presidency of the European Union. It is important that we take up the challenge of the vacuum that currently exists and provide leadership to the rest of Europe. That means pushing forward with the Lisbon agenda. Lisbon was different because, for the first time, we had a series of benchmarks against which all European countries were to be measured. The Kok report, which was published at the end of last year, gives us, for the first time, a scorecard that sets out exactly what each country has achieved as regards the Lisbon benchmarks. In some areas, we are doing very well because of the stewardship of the economy by my right hon. Friend the Chancellor. We are doing well on the liberalisation of utilities, but we are doing badly on social protection.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50615-22_para17">
<a name="stpa_226">The difference between Lisbon and all the other summits before it and since is that those economic indicators have been vital in relation to the progress of the European economy. This is not about the euro. The right hon. Member for Richmond, Yorks was keen to suggest that the reason why the German economy is going badly and that we are doing well is that we are not in the euro and the Germans are. There is no wavering, in my view&#151;perhaps the Minister can confirm this when he winds up&#151;in the Government&#039;s commitment to join the single currency. Our principled position, which was set out in our manifesto at three successive elections, is 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>15 Jun 2005 : Column 325</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>that as a Government we are in favour of the euro but in practice will join only if the economic tests that have been set by the Chancellor are met. That remains our position, and it is the position that we have had since 1997. The right hon. Member for Richmond, Yorks is&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;annoyed because in 1997, when the Labour Government were elected, he wanted to save the pound, and got on the back of a lorry and went round the country to do so. Then the Prime Minister announced that the pound was saved, and the Conservatives&#039; cause c&#233;l&#232;bre was taken away from them, as is the case with the constitution.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50615-22_para18">
<a name="stpa_227">The fact remains that we have to meet the benchmarks that have been set by the Chancellor. We have not met them. As soon as they are met, we will put this in a referendum to the British people, who will thereby have a chance to make the decision themselves.

 I am pleased to participate in this debate with my hon. Friend. During the election campaign, the Prime Minister said that he does not expect a referendum on the euro in this Parliament but there might be one in a future Parliament.

 If the conditions are met and the Chancellor announces that we have met the tests that he clearly set out in 1997, we will have a referendum. If the tests are not met&#151;it is a matter for the Chancellor&#151;we will not have a referendum. There is a danger in trying to see too far into the future. These are issues of fact that have to be reported to the House before a decision is made.

<p>
<a name="50615-23_para0">
<a name="stpa_228">My hon. Friend the Member for Normanton (Ed Balls) observed in a thoughtful article in the <i>Financial Times</i> this week that the danger that we face in the forthcoming European Council meeting and in terms of the priorities for our presidency is that we may get so hung up on constitutional reform that we forget about the need to push forward the economic reform agenda. Without adopting the policies that were clearly set out by the Heads of Government at Lisbon in 2000, we cannot achieve the economic reforms that are necessary for us to do what all right hon. and hon. Members would like Britain in Europe to do&#151;that is, to compete on equal terms with the United States of America.

</p>

<p>
<a name="50615-23_para1">
<a name="stpa_229">I know that India and China have been suggested as global competitors for the United Kingdom and Europe in future but, at the moment, our biggest competitor is the United States of America. In the past 10&nbsp;years, 10&nbsp;million jobs were created in the USA compared with 1&nbsp;million in the EU area. It is therefore vital that, in all the discussions, even those on the rebate and the constitution, we do not lose sight of one of the Government&#039;s key priorities&#151;pushing forward the Lisbon agenda.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50615-23_para2">
<a name="stpa_230">As we begin considering what we will do in our presidency, I hope that we will acknowledge the genuine and important progress that has been made under Tampere and The Hague agenda. The hon. Member for Woodspring complained about the appointment of the single prosecutor for the whole of Europe, but several important aspects of the justice and home affairs agenda will help British people&#151;for example, the mutual recognition of decisions taken by courts. British citizens

<p>
<a name="50615-23_para3">
<a name="stpa_231">I appreciate that people do not want to be reminded of statistics because they believe that they are simply mantras spoken by pro-Europeans. However, eight of our top 10&nbsp;trading partners are members of the EU. Of course, there is a world outside and, as a trading nation, we have to trade with nations outside the EU. However, our trade is based on that with EU countries and we need to ensure that that is enhanced and developed. Lisbon is important, but, as we move forward, we need to examine other matters on which we can co-operate.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50615-23_para4">
<a name="stpa_232">I am not in favour of a single judicial system, but I support the exercising of our judgments in different parts of the EU. Switzerland voted only last week to ensure that its citizens joined Schengen. The Swiss people have decided that they want better and closer links with the EU because they realise what happens when one is not part of it or takes only some of the benefits that are on offer: one suffers not only economically but in terms of missed benefits for the people of the country.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50615-23_para5">
<a name="stpa_233">I listened carefully to the comments of the leader of the Democratic Unionists about the Poles being after our strawberries and, indeed, our raspberries, but enlargement has hugely benefited our country and the whole EU. It is worth remembering that Conservative Front-Benchers predicted mayhem when the 10&nbsp;new countries joined on 1&nbsp;May 2004. They claimed that Poles and Slovaks would rush to London, take our jobs, benefits, strawberries and raspberries and cause chaos in the UK. They said that the Home Office would be inundated with applications. That did not happen. Enlargement has been good for the UK and the EU. Few people have gone on benefits. I therefore hope that Ministers will remember to push forward the enlargement agenda because it benefits not only the EU but the other countries that will join.

 Thank you, Madam Deputy Speaker, for allowing me to make my maiden speech.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50615-23_para7">
<a name="stpa_235">It is a great privilege to follow the hon. Member for Leicester, East (Keith Vaz) with all his expertise on European matters. I shall stick more carefully to the parameters of a maiden speech. One of my illustrious predecessors, the former Speaker Jack Weatherill, once said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_23">&quot;A good speech will not be remembered; a bad speech will not be forgotten&#151;or forgiven.&quot;</p>

<a name="stpa_236">I hope that the speech that I deliver this afternoon will be speedily forgotten.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50615-23_para9">
<a name="stpa_237">Certainly, one thing that I do not forget is just how conscientious Jack Weatherill was as a Member of Parliament. I remember being summoned to the Speaker&#039;s House when I was chairman of the education committee in Croydon, to negotiate with people who were unhappy about a new city technology college that 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>15 Jun 2005 : Column 327</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>was to be introduced in the London borough of Croydon. It was certainly Jack&#039;s style to bring people together, and he was most conscientious in pursuing constituents&#039; concerns and always writing back, in green ink, with a personal note. That is the style of constituency Member to which I would like to aspire.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50615-23_para10">
<a name="stpa_238">I am sure, however, that I have made more mistakes in the House in a few weeks than Jack ever would have made. The conviviality and friendliness of the House, however, ensures that such mistakes are easily forgiven. As a new Member of Parliament, I have been most impressed that the House&#039;s supposed reputation for not welcoming new Members is entirely untrue.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50615-23_para11">
<a name="stpa_239">The way in which Officers of the House have inducted new Members has impressed me a great deal. I learned that it is important to be careful about where one goes and what one says. During one of the induction procedures in which we were shown around the House, and shown how Members put marks on the back of their seats in the Chamber to reserve a seat at Prayers, I made the mistake of referring to Germans and towels. Unfortunately, another Member&#039;s partner happened to say, in a Germanic accent, &quot;What is this about Germans and towels?&quot;
</p>

<p>
<a name="50615-23_para12">
<a name="stpa_240">It will also disturb the Whips Office to hear that I found myself sitting in a hot desk area reserved for Labour Members. Only when I heard a large number of Scottish accents, and reflected that there were probably not many Conservative Members elected to the House who had Scottish accents, did I realise that I was in a Labour party room.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50615-23_para13">
<a name="stpa_241">Before I talk about Croydon, I would like to refer to my predecessor, Geraint Davies, who was both a diligent local councillor and Member of Parliament for Croydon, Central. He took a particular interest in the provision of healthy food for school children and the damage to our local environment, including the loss of many birds, which is an important issue in our locality. Obviously, I am delighted to be elected to the House, albeit with a majority of only 75&nbsp;votes. I am sure, however, that that is mirrored by the disquiet and upset that Geraint must face, having lost by only 75&nbsp;votes. I wish him the very best in his future career, and no doubt he will return to the House&#151;not at my expense, I hope. Croydon has a history of close election results. John Moore had a majority of 164&nbsp;votes, and the hon. Member for Walsall, North (Mr. Winnick), back in 1966, had a majority in Croydon, South of just 81&nbsp;votes.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50615-23_para14">
<a name="stpa_242">It is a great privilege to represent the town in which one was raised and educated. I am a councillor of 23&nbsp;years&#039; standing in Croydon, and know very well how important the expansion of the European Union is to Croydon in terms of the businesses pursued. Businesses have been particularly keen to look for opportunities in the Czech republic and Poland, and Croydon already has a substantial Polish community. It is important that Europe is a free trading community, with Nestl&#233; having its headquarters in Croydon.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50615-23_para15">
<a name="stpa_243">It is also important that Croydon as a town has looked out to other European cities that are at the edge of metropolitan communities&#151;so-called edge cities&#151;to try to share experiences. Towns such as Croydon, which have seen significant changes, not necessarily to our advantage, in our social, demographic make-up, face many challenges in terms of serving the needs of our community.

<a name="stpa_244">Also with a European theme, it is fair to say that we welcome to our town many eastern Europeans from beyond European Union borders. I was very pleased when I attended a recent Turkish-Kurdish event to find many from those communities, when they welcomed me to speak, chanting, &quot;Croydon! Croydon!&quot;. No one had ever chanted &quot;Croydon! Croydon!&quot; like that before, but it is a sign of how migrants to Croydon have identified very quickly and positively with that community. It is important, I feel, to reach out to all communities, and I am so pleased that the al-Khair school, which is based in Croydon, Central, has also been successful. A real example of a great success from Croydon and a way that one can prove it is important to welcome migrants to our shores is the story of Katie Melua, who came from Georgia and was educated in Croydon at the BRIT school.

Thus, it is very good news that Croydon is likely to be connected to the London underground&#039;s East London line and possible that the successful Croydon tram link will be extended to Crystal Palace.

<a name="stpa_246">Croydon is also an important retail centre. Indeed, its retail centre dates back to the Surrey street market founded in the 13th century, although people can shop until they drop at many other places, such as the Whitgift centre, the Drummond centre and the new Centrale centre. But Croydon is not just retail heaven. Indeed, we compete with other important centres when it comes to culture. The creation of the Croydon Film Commission&#151;which competes with Prague for sites for films and, in particular, adverts&#151;is important because we can provide not only 1960s brutalist chic through our skyscrapers, but many attractive heritage items and open spaces.

<a name="stpa_250">It is a pleasure to speak in this debate. I had hoped to speak in last week&#039;s earlier incarnation of it, but I was at least able to hear the speeches of the various Front Benchers, so I had some forewarning of what we were likely to hear today. Interestingly, in his opening remarks during that debate, the hon. Member for Woodspring (Dr. Fox) came as close as any Conservative Member has yet come to saying that if the Single European Act were debated today, the Conservatives would be much warier of enshrining it in statute. From my perspective, that is a jolly good move&#151;albeit not far enough&#151;in the right direction. If we get an apology for Maastricht as well, we can begin to think much harder about the Europe that some of us on the Labour Benches would like to see.

That shift may have been led by the French and the Dutch, but it is the people of the whole of Europe who have spoken. They have completely ripped up the Euro project, and they want a very different sort of Europe to be taken forward. The reasons for that can be interpreted in many different ways, but I like to think that my favourite economist, Anatole Kaletsky, put his finger on it in a series of articles in which, in simple terms, he took the view that, &quot;It&#039;s the euro, stupid, what done it.&quot; Trying to force together all the various currencies has created great resentment among the peoples of Europe. In his article of 9&nbsp;June, he drew parallels between the no votes in France and Holland and our own, in a sense voluntary expulsion from the exchange rate mechanism in the early 1990s. Perhaps those votes will prove to have the same value.

<a name="stpa_254">The growth and stability pact is what is really doing the damage. At the very time when we need to grow the economies of Europe to deal with increasing worries about employment and all that comes on the back of that, we have a pact that insists on the opposite.

<a name="stpa_255">We are not talking just about economics in the pure sense, though. This is not just about some economists playing with various theories; it is about the direction in which the European project was going. Worryingly, we have learnt nothing from the destruction of manufacturing on the mainland of Europe, followed, I dare say, by our destruction of it here. Under the Bolkestein directive, we have been moving towards the disruption of public services as well in the mad pursuit of even more privatisation. We must wonder whether we have learnt anything from what has been going on. If we followed the same route as the rest of Europe, we would have even more unemployment and a further detachment and disengagement of the European peoples. We hope there will be an opportunity for us to think again about what is happening. Perhaps countries will start listening to their people, rather than trying to believe that it is the people who are out of touch and what they really want is more and more euro-centralisation.

<a name="stpa_256">I have been playing a game with the Table Office, trying to find out whether it is possible to ask the Treasury whether it has carried out analysis to establish what will happen if the eurozone breaks up. Could the lira be recreated? Perhaps in the interim prices could be quoted in pounds; a stable currency might be more desirable than the euro in its current state, which is causing all sorts of problems. I tried to table a question to that effect, but it was not allowed. Sadly, it seems that it is not possible to work on the basis of supposition, although according to Kaletsky and Larry Elliott of <i>The Guardian</i>, the other economist who appears to know what he is talking about, the situation is becoming daily more realistic and less a matter of pure speculation.

<a name="50615-24_para7">
<a name="stpa_257">It is not just a question of economics, however. It is also about what else the European project implies. There is a political and social argument that needs to be had. Sadly, because of the various defeats faced by my party during the 1980s and 1990s, we were somewhat seduced by the views of Jacques Delors 17&nbsp;years ago, when he made a memorable speech to the Trades Union Congress. Much of what he said was laudable; the problem was that people saw all the answers in terms of ratcheting us even further towards&#151;linking us even more directly to&#151;everything European. There were good things that we could take from the EU, but there were also bad things that we should avoid.

Irrespective of its impact on producers and consumers here, that policy is bereft of any moral justification in respect of its impact on the less developed world. We have to put our hands up about that. We need to understand that some producers&#151;not only in this country, but in France and Germany where the CAP has been part of a protectionist rump&#151;face tougher times ahead. I do not want further neo-liberalism, but the re-establishment of local food chains through which producers can have greater say over what consumers really want. That can now begin to happen.

<a name="stpa_261">We need to rethink the best way for Europe to proceed. There are Europeans in my party and, as in other parties, there are friendly disagreements about how best to take Europe forward. We need to have a proper debate about that and it is wrong to give the public the impression that there is uniformity in the Labour party about the European project. There are some benefits from European social arrangements, such as the charter of fundamental rights, but it is desperately dangerous to buy into Europe wholesale because of the neo-liberal aspects, which might lead to further deterioration in our industries and harm our labour relations. We have a strong history of collective bargaining in this country, which is alien to the European model. There are dangers in viewing European social engagement as an alternative, as it might further weaken the structures of our trade unions and our labour relations. We need to think hard about that problem.

<a name="stpa_264">In conclusion, I repeat that it is important for both left and right to produce a rationale in respect of how we take Europe forward. I believe that we should aim for a very different sort of Europe, one that is entirely at odds with what has happened over the past 10&nbsp;to 15&nbsp;years. I am sure that we will enjoy putting across our point of view in debates like this in the future.

<a name="stpa_265">Enthusiasts for the European constitution have tried to play down the importance of the results of the referendums in France and Holland by arguing that many of those who voted no did so for reasons not directly related to the constitution. My simple point is that people voted no because the treaty&#039;s advocates 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>15 Jun 2005 : Column 333</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>could not produce convincing and positive reasons for voting yes. They were unable to do that because there are no convincing reasons for voting yes that appeal to the ordinary populations of Europe. Without a good reason to vote yes, people had every freedom to vote no. They may have done so for trivial reasons but, had there been a positive reason to vote yes, they would have set aside domestic and unrelated factors and voted for the treaty.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50615-25_para5">
<a name="stpa_266">In the absence of positive reasons to vote yes, the treaty&#039;s supporters came up with all sorts of negative reasons and threats, ranging from the vague and incredible to the insulting and absurd. For example, they said that voting no would mean a loss of influence, and that investment would be repelled. At the insulting and absurd end of the spectrum, people in Holland were told by that country&#039;s European Affairs Minister that a no vote would mean a return to the holocaust and the gas chamber. Other treaty enthusiasts in both France and Holland said that a no vote would open up the prospect of war and an end to peace. Happily, the peoples of both countries realised that those were insulting and absurd arguments and gave them no credence.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50615-25_para6">
<a name="stpa_267">Those who supported the European constitution made clear its appeal to the elites. They believed that it would make it easier to take decisions centrally and override the objections of member states. However, that was precisely what did not appeal to the electorates in France and Holland.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50615-25_para7">
<a name="stpa_268">Constitution enthusiasts have a second excuse to explain why we should disregard the no votes returned in France and Holland. They say that different arguments against the constitution were used in those countries, which conflict with the no arguments presented in this country. They add that that incompatibility and inconsistency means that both arguments cannot be right. However, I believe that they can both be right, because the treaty offered a one-size-fits-all constitution that would have imposed one-size-fits-all policies on member countries. If only one size of suit was available in the shops, it would be tight on my hon. Friend the Member for North Essex (Mr. Jenkin) in some places and tight on the hon. Member for Cambridge (David Howarth) in others. The imposition of one-size-fits-all policies would have been facilitated by the European constitution, and it was that to which the people in Holland and France objected.

<a name="stpa_269">An hon. Member earlier complained about a resurgence of Gaullism. I remember when General de Gaulle stood up for the rights of France and French sovereignty against the combined establishment in France. He bemoaned the fact that the media were against him, the unions were against him, the patronat was against him, the Church was against him and the intelligentsia were against him. He said, in his sardonic fashion, &quot;Only the people of France are on my side.&quot; We are now in the unique position that the people of France and Holland are on our side.

<br>&nbsp;<br>power from member states to the European institutions&#151;to one that accepts that there can be some return traffic. We should actively seek with our partners in Europe to ask what powers have been unnecessarily transferred to European institutions that could be repatriated to the member states to allow them to take decisions and tailor policies to their own needs. That is clearly what lies behind the malaise in Europe and it is an opportunity for us to seize the agenda. Sadly, although we may have the people of France and Holland on our side, we do not seem to have our Government on our side, and that is most regrettable.

<a name="stpa_271">On the subject of one&#150;size-fits-all policies, I come to the rebate, which was designed to correct the adverse consequences of a one&#150;size-fits-all financing mechanism. We call it a rebate, but it is well described in the relevant European document:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_24">&quot;The United Kingdom shall be granted a correction in respect of budgetary imbalances.&quot;</p>
</ul>

<p>
<a name="50615-25_para11">
<a name="stpa_272">As the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; says, a correction is a change that puts right something that was wrong. That is what the rebate does and it is right therefore that it should be maintained.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50615-25_para12">
<a name="stpa_273">To obtain the rebate, Margaret Thatcher had to obtain unanimous approval for a change, which was very difficult, but she succeeded because she argued persuasively that a wrong needed to be corrected. However, the present Prime Minister has reversed the situation so that member states are unanimously against the rebate. Fortunately, one veto can maintain the status quo. Unfortunately, he has invited pressure by moving from saying that the rebate was not negotiable to saying that we would not negotiate it away entirely. He indicated clearly that he was in the market for altering the rebate&#039;s terms and conditions, thus reducing its value. That is a sad and dangerous step, which has made his life more difficult and will make it more difficult to uphold the correction mechanism in future.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50615-25_para13">
<a name="stpa_274">I hope that the Prime Minister will manage to do so, but he will have to regain control of the agenda. He should ask the French for their explanation of what happened in the referendum and what we do next. We should also follow the French, who have ruled out firmly and adamantly any discussion of their benefits from the agricultural policy, by firmly and adamantly refusing to discuss the correction mechanism and the British rebate. If he does so, we can uphold our position. It is necessary to have a Government who recognise that different countries have different interests. Britain has different interests from countries on the continent&#151;perhaps more than any other. It has different structures and ways of doing things that must be accommodated.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50615-25_para14">
<a name="stpa_275">I was first elected in the same year as the Prime Minister. He was elected on a pledge to leave the Common Market, but unlike him I have always been, and remain, an unwavering supporter of British membership of the European Community. However, I understand the concerns of Dutch, French and British voters that the ratchet mechanism that allows transfers of power and the one-size-fits-all approach to policy making are not acceptable and have gone far enough, if not too far. We should look in the opposite direction, return powers to the United Kingdom where possible and allow greater diversity and the tailoring of policies to the needs of individual countries, not least our own.

 I am pleased to follow my near neighbour, the right hon. Member for Hitchin and Harpenden (Mr. Lilley). I agreed with much of what he said, although I disagreed here and there. There is a consensus among hon. Members of all parties&#151;even, perhaps, including one or two Liberal Democrat Members&#151;that we need a different Europe.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50615-26_para0">
<a name="stpa_276">Harold Wilson suggested that a week in politics is a long time. It certainly seems like a long time since our last debate on Europe a week ago because a lot has happened. Could we have believed that there would have been such a serious falling out between the Prime Minister of Britain and the President of France, between the Prime Minister and the Chancellor of Germany, or even between the Prime Minister and his erstwhile friend Peter Mandelson, who has said that we should not use our Thatcherite handbag in Europe? Such events initially sound amusing, but they are rather worrying because we want to build a future Europe that is friendly and in which we can co-operate with our neighbours. It is a sad irony that the European Union was ostensibly designed to ensure that there was not war between the nations of Europe, yet it is currently creating friction between member states. I believe that that is happening because of inherent faults in the arrangements of the European Union.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50615-26_para1">
<a name="stpa_277">It is also said that nothing happens for years in politics, but then the world changes in a day. The day of the French referendum was such a day. Europe looked different after the referendum, so the day will be referred to again and again as a remarkable point in history. The no votes show that there has been a profound psychological shift in the attitude of the peoples of Europe to the European Union. Working people and socialists, especially, have rejected liberalisation. The banners of the people marching in the streets showed that their decision was about liberalisation. They did not want a liberal Europe and neither do I. They wanted to retain the social democracy of post-war Europe that worked so well and gave full employment, redistributive taxation, properly funded welfare states and public services, a degree of public ownership of essential utilities and a more equal and fairer world than that which went before. That was a world that worked, but we have started to give it away due to the European Union&#039;s arrangements&#151;or has it been undermined?
</p>

<p>
<a name="50615-26_para2">
<a name="stpa_278">There has been a drive to impose a supernatural&#151;I mean supranational&#151;neo-liberal construct and to dismantle post-war social democracy, but the working people of Europe are rejecting it. That rejection happened first in Sweden because the Swedes were extremely well informed and, after many months of thorough debate, they voted no to membership of the euro. I am a board member of the Centre for Social Europe. We have many colleagues with similar views in other countries and met Swedes who were involved in the campaign. It was very much the left, the trade unions and working people who voted no in that referendum. The same was true of the recent referendums in France and Holland, and if we had a referendum in Britain, working people would naturally vote along with Labour and Conservative Members who support the no campaign. Clearly, there will be no referendum because there would be a massive vote against the constitution.

I agree with much of what he said. He rightly congratulated the Foreign Secretary on persuading the Prime Minister to have a referendum. I do not want to claim too much for myself, but I tabled the first early-day motion, signed by many Labour Members, that called for a referendum. I should, perhaps, have a small footnote somewhere.
</p>

<a name="50615-26_para4">
<a name="stpa_280">We have to consider what has happened. The European Union has been failing because there has been slow growth in major countries and economic contraction in some, particularly in big countries such as Germany, Italy and France. The economic model is clearly not working. The growth and stability pact has been shot full of holes and is being ignored. We have had dead as a dodo, dead parrots, and now a dead duck. So the birds are all dead, whatever they are. The growth and stability pact has caused difficulties and it is right that it is ignored.

<a name="stpa_281">There is a possibility of the euro unravelling in Italy and Germany in particular. People in Italy are gathering signatures for a referendum on whether they should leave the euro. It will not be difficult for them to get the 500,000&nbsp;signatures they need. Behind the scenes, the Germans have been discussing how they could or would leave the euro. There is a prospect of the whole euro arrangement unravelling. There is certainly no prospect of any member state joining the euro at this stage. It would be daft to join an arrangement that is so shaky and performing so badly. We are obviously not thinking of that for the foreseeable future.

<a name="50615-26_para6">
<a name="stpa_282">The budget is also in crisis. The problem is not just the UK rebate, but the whole common agricultural policy. I have called many times for the CAP to be abolished. The presidency gives us the opportunity to have a serious debate on the future of the European budget. As I said last week, when Ministers go to the Council meeting they should say, &quot;If you want to talk about our rebate, let us discuss the whole CAP&quot;, because it is the CAP that brings about the necessity for a rebate. If there is no CAP, we do not need a rebate.

<a name="stpa_283">Let us suggest how we might return to an arrangement under which individual member states have their own agricultural policy and can choose to subsidise, or not, their agricultural sectors. We could easily subsidise our agricultural sector as we chose in appropriate ways. I always mention Welsh hill farmers. We want to preserve certain traditional farming areas and their local cultures. There is no reason why we should not do that. It would not cost that much&#151;certainly not as much as our contribution to the European budget.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50615-26_para8">
<a name="stpa_284">Other aspects of the budget do not work either. Structural funding will be withdrawn from Britain. Many poorer countries are coming into the EU and money should be directed towards them rather than us. We believe and hope that Ministers have committed themselves to substituting state national funding for EU regional and structural funding so that we get the funding that we have lost. That means, however, that we have another net loss in the EU budget contribution.

Yet DFID has a justified good reputation for directing aid efficiently, fairly and transparently to the poorest nations, where it is most needed. Let us give aid through DFID rather than through the EU.

<a name="50615-26_para10">
<a name="stpa_286">If we remove the CAP, structural funding and international aid, not much of the budget is left. However, as I said last week, if we do have a budget, let us have one that redistributes money to the EU countries that need it. Let us have contributions according to ability to pay and receipts according to need. If Slovakia is poor and we are rich, let us make sure that the whole EU budget is distributed according to the relative prosperity of the nations of Europe. That would be a fundamental change, but a much better arrangement, and I hope that my hon. Friends on the Treasury Bench will discuss that during our presidency.

<a name="50615-26_para11">
<a name="stpa_287">Last week, I said that the appointment of Dominique de Villepin as French Prime Minister marked an interesting change; it was a move to someone who is much more Gaullist than liberal. Even as I spoke, he was addressing the Assembl&#233;e Nationale, saying the sort of things that I would say if I were in his position. He suggested that there should be a more relaxed fiscal policy nationally to bring down unemployment. Very sensible, but hardly in the spirit of a Europe-wide, eurozone, neo-liberal, deflationist approach to economics. He was saying, &quot;French people are unemployed, so let&#039;s spend more money and give them jobs&quot;. If individual member states of the EU controlled their economic policy, that is what they should be able to do. We should return to an arrangement whereby macro-economic policy is a matter for the member state and not for the EU. Those things are fundamental and I hope we can at least discuss them. They may be heresy to some people, but they are common sense to others.

<a name="stpa_288">There have been calls to abandon UK controls on imports of tobacco and alcohol. That has been proposed, I think, by Liberal Democrat MEPs, but I think that it would be completely unacceptable&#151;it would be madness. The Treasury obtains substantial revenue from taxes on alcohol and tobacco, which pays for hospitals and other public services. If there were unlimited imports of cheap tobacco and alcohol the effect on Treasury revenues would be devastating. Even more important, it would bring in floods of cheap alcohol, exacerbating our already serious alcohol problems. We are trying to persuade people to drink more sensibly and not to smoke, so to allow in mountains of cheap tobacco and floods of cheap alcohol would take us in completely the wrong direction.

<a name="stpa_291">In the wake of the constitution, it is certainly appropriate that we should have a rethink, even a reinvention, of the EU, but some Members appear to think that that is an opportunity to unravel the EU, to bring everything back home, with merely a loose treaty arrangement. If we were to do that, we should throw away the huge amount that has been achieved over the years, which we take for granted and would realise that we had lost only after it had gone. After all, as my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for North-East Fife (Sir Menzies Campbell) pointed out, the fact that countries have queued up to join the European Union is proof of huge success. In spite of the difficulties over the working arrangements that that change has brought about, no one is suggesting that they should leave or that another arrangement should be adopted. I remember standing outside the Polish embassy and talking about the support for Solidarity and the case for Polish democracy. Some people have short memories, as they now complain about the fact that, almost by accident, the Poles belong to a free and democratic country, with the freedom to come and work here and with their own place in a democratic common market that we helped to create. We should not deplore that but welcome it. We should not throw that achievement out just because we find it difficult to work out the decision making.

In other words, every member would need to agree the framework for such work. That could be an acceptable way of delivering moneys instead of delivering them through the European Commission. We still need a mechanism, however, for making agreements and, if I may say so, we would probably find that qualified majority voting was the best way to achieve efficient decision making.

Surprisingly, one Frenchman in Paris told me this week that he had voted no because he thought that France was too dominant in Europe. He wanted a renegotiation of the constitution to give more power to the smaller countries. We should therefore not presume that we know why the French voted as they did, but we must live with the consequences of their vote. In the long term, the CAP must be reformed. A perfectly reasonable British position would be that we negotiated a rebate, so if it is to be renegotiated the whole budget, of which the CAP constitutes the lion&#039;s share, must be renegotiated. There is common agreement that that is a proper and legitimate argument, although there is disagreement about strategy and outcomes.

<a name="stpa_294">There are anxieties about structural funds. My local council has sent me a communication expressing its worries about the British position, and whether those funds would be brought back home. In some cases, local authorities have a more constructive and objective arrangement with the European Commission than with the British Government. That is not an argument for the arrangement&#151;it is simply a practical reality. Aberdeenshire council operates a number of projects supported by European Union funds which it believes are at risk. Many of those projects tackle the consequences of agricultural and rural decline. A large rural council such as Aberdeenshire requires assistance with such problems, and it has benefited from European structural funds over the past four years to the tune of &#163;8.691&nbsp;million. The loss of that money would be extremely damaging to the regeneration of our fishing and rural communities. I am not suggesting that the British Government cannot achieve success, but any change is bound to create concern. My council has been able to secure funding for various projects across Aberdeenshire, and would like an assurance that if there is any change, it will have continued access to such funding.

<a name="stpa_296">It is therefore particularly regrettable that given our good record on human rights, we have experienced some pretty sharp criticism by the Council of Europe Commissioner for Human Rights on a number of pieces of legislation introduced by the Government, to which my own party has vigorously objected. In his report, Alvaro Gil-Robles substantially echoed the criticisms that I and my Liberal Democrat colleagues have been

<a name="stpa_298">The Commissioner is even more outspoken on the role of evidence that may have been secured through torture, even in other countries. He puts it in pretty direct language:

<a name="stpa_299">The British Government response to that is inherently mealy-mouthed, unsatisfactory and unacceptable. As an architect of the European convention on human rights and as a country that tries to encourage others to apply high standards of human rights, we should take the report seriously. Criticism to which we do not respond constructively undervalues our ability to lead and influence other countries.

<a name="stpa_300">In my capacity as a member of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, I am the rapporteur on political prisoners in Azerbaijan. In one way or another, Azerbaijan has probably experienced 200&nbsp;years of external oppression and has become an independent state only since the collapse of the Soviet Union, and only after a fairly violent war against the Russians and a subsequent civil war in Azerbaijan, which went remarkably unreported in the British media. The idea that we have had peace in Europe since the second world war is not borne out by many of those small wars that have had devastating consequences for people. There has, in addition, been the war between Azerbaijan and Armenia, leading to the occupation of Nagorno-Karabakh and a million displaced refugees, with whom Azerbaijan has had to deal. Yet we are trying to lead countries like Azerbaijan&#151;Georgia has found its own way&#151;Armenia and others to some kind of democratic future.

<a name="stpa_301">I have two further points to bring to the attention of the House. The first concerns the plight of British citizen Almas Guliyeva, who was arrested in Baku on 3&nbsp;June. She is a constituent of the hon. Member for Finchley and Golders Green (Dr. Vis), who I know has made strenuous representations on her behalf and I am supporting him in that. Mrs. Guliyeva is the niece of a former speaker of the Azerbaijan Parliament currently living in exile in the United States who wishes to be a presidential candidate or a parliamentary candidate. There is no doubt that her arrest is directly connected to that relationship.

<a name="stpa_302">Mrs. Guliyeva is in hospital, having suffered a heart attack as a result of the inquisition that she underwent on her arrest.

The background to the situation is that the authorities claim that they found a gun in her luggage as she was leaving the country. Is it

<br>&nbsp;<br>realistic to believe that any international traveller today taking luggage through any international airport and putting it through an X-ray machine would put a gun in their luggage? That does not seem to be a rational or credible piece of behaviour. Indeed, circumstances suggest that the authorities asked for the luggage to be run through a second time, when, mysteriously, the gun was found. We must be aware that this kind of thing is happening and that a British citizen has been subjected to it.

 Thank you, Mr. Deputy Speaker, for the opportunity to make my first speech in this House. In doing so, I am conscious that in their very different ways the hon. Member for Belfast, South (Dr. McDonnell) and my&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hon. Friend the Member for Croydon, Central (Mr.&nbsp;Pelling) have raised the bar to an ambitious height. Although both are no longer in their places, I congratulate them on their contributions to a debate that ought to be addressing one of the great political challenges of our time: how does the European Union reconnect with its people and what role does Britain play in that process? I speak from the delicate position of being both the son of the Foreign Secretary who negotiated the Maastricht treaty and the successor of John Wilkinson, who fought that treaty tooth and nail through the Lobby. It is a genuine pleasure to pay tribute to John, and in so doing I beg the indulgence of more seasoned Members of the House who are waiting to contribute to the debate.

They simply trusted him to speak his mind. Over 25&nbsp;years of service, John was a dedicated local champion who helped many people with endless supplies of courtesy, good humour and patience. Every week I meet individuals and groups who lose no time in reminding me of that. I am sure that the House will join me in wishing John and Ceci a very happy retirement.

Few constituencies are more regularly visited by the royal family or senior members of the Government, although I should point out that their journeys rarely extend beyond the mile that it takes them to travel from the A40&nbsp;to RAF Northolt. That famous airbase celebrates this year its 90th anniversary and the proud distinction of being the oldest continually operational RAF station in the country.

<a name="stpa_311">The story of Ruislip-Northwood is one of evolution from sleepy rural hamlets to thriving suburban towns, which are determined to maintain their identity and quality of life. The key agents of change were the railwaymen and the property developers who followed in their wake. The extension of the Metropolitan line opened up rural Middlesex and the opportunity for people to pursue the dream of a better quality of life, more space, better air and a greater sense of security, and those aspirations remain as valid today as they were in the late 19th century. Northwood is separated from Ruislip by magnificent ancient woods that once provided sport for kings. Harefield stands apart, surrounded by precious green belt, and it is proud to be the last village in Middlesex and home to the world-famous Harefield heart hospital.

In the 1930s, Ruislip residents took decisive action in saving their woods from being turned into houses, which meant going to Cambridge and persuading the then bursar of King&#039;s college Cambridge, one J Maynard Keynes, to sell the land to them rather than to the developers.
</p>

<a name="50615-28_para7">
<a name="stpa_314">In 1983, local residents took the drastic step of physically occupying Northwood Pinner hospital for three months until the bureaucrats saw sense and abandoned plans to close it. Today that spirit lives on in organisations such as Heart of Harefield, which has been so effective in exposing the folly of trying to move Harefield hospital to Paddington. The tradition of civic pride is rooted in a strong conviction that the quality of life in Ruislip, Eastcote, Northwood and Harefield is worth fighting for. I strongly share that conviction, and it is my privilege and responsibility to give those communities a strong voice in this place.

<a name="50615-28_para8">
<a name="stpa_315">The clearest message that I heard in the general election was one of frustration and lack of confidence in politicians. People feel less able to control what is important to them, and the big decisions seem to be taken by remote, unaccountable bureaucracies. For example, the public consultations on the future of Harefield hospital and Mount Vernon hospital were widely seen as shams conducted by an increasingly arbitrary and remote NHS. Few issues arouse more local passion than planning, not least because local planning departments seem so toothless in the face of central Government directives. People are deeply worried about increased antisocial behaviour and want to see more police on the streets, but their voice appears to have little weight in shaping local police priorities. My concern is that communities that do not feel empowered quickly lose their sense of community.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50615-28_para9">
<a name="stpa_316">You may well ask, Mr. Deputy Speaker, what relevance that point has to the future of the European Union. The EU has begun to symbolise what people feel is wrong with politics: it is too elite, it is too remote and it is seen as too self-interested and too corrupt. Over the past decade, the British people have recognised the degree to which Europe meddles in their lives, and they want less interference rather than more.

<a name="stpa_317">The current European leadership reminds me of the board of a grand multinational company that has lost contact with its customer base over many years. The decision by the French people has prompted a crisis in the boardroom and a vacuum of leadership. It is time for someone to stand up and make the case that this is the opportunity to save the company, if the board accepts the need for a new strategy.

<p>
<a name="50615-28_para11">
<a name="stpa_318">Instead of appearing to focus endlessly on its own workings and the allocation of power, the EU must prove its value to a new generation. I argue humbly that it must first explicitly ditch the principle of ever-closer political union and focus instead on re-establishing the EU&#039;s credentials as a force for prosperity, growth and jobs. That means winning the argument for the Anglo-Saxon model of economic liberalism, which is the only sustainable response to the new competitive age. That means focusing minds on extending the single market, breaking down external tariffs and strengthening the economic ties that will do more to bind us together than any artificial political structure. It also requires a fundamentally different approach to regulation. As my

<a name="stpa_319">The second priority, I would suggest, is to prove that the EU can deliver an effective lead on some of the issues that we cannot tackle on our own, because that is a large part of what it is for. Take climate change, for example. The science has moved on, and there is an urgent need to look beyond the first, very small step that was Kyoto. It is clear that the world is not going to get a lead from the superpower. In this vacuum, the EU has a chance to play a constructive and possibly decisive role in building a coalition of the willing around a post-Kyoto framework. It can certainly take practical steps to put words into action. If, for example, we have to live with the common agricultural policy, is not there a case for using it to incentivise the production of biofuels? A robust EU emissions trading scheme could be, and must be, a template for a global scheme.

<a name="stpa_320">In short, it is time for the EU to be seen to be taking a lead on the difficult issues that matter to people. It is time for radical reform to replace a culture of power grab with one of delivering tangible benefits to people. In truth, real progress will require new leadership, and in the short term only Britain can supply it until a new generation of leaders takes the stage in France and Germany. While the old regime struggles to respond to the impudence of the French and Dutch people, it is time for Britain to find a bold, positive voice on the EU&#151;one that steers the Community towards better defining its role, setting its limits much more clearly and, above all, proving its relevance and value to the people who pay for it.

 It is a particular pleasure to follow the maiden speech of my&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hon. Friend the Member for Ruislip-Northwood (Mr. Hurd). He introduced himself as the son of a former distinguished Foreign Secretary. I suppose that he thought that he had better do so before anybody else referred to it. If I may say so, he has no need whatsoever to lean on his genes, as it were, because he has immediately shown that he is eloquent and informative in describing his constituency, generous and indeed accurate in praising the work of his predecessor, John Wilkinson, and intuitive and perceptive in describing the attitude of his constituents towards the European Union.

<a name="stpa_324">There has been a lot of visionary talk this afternoon. Coming from much further up the A1&nbsp;than Ruislip-Northwood, I am going to be rather less visionary and, I hope, a little more practical.

<p>
<a name="50615-29_para2">
<a name="stpa_325">I wonder to what extent the Government do any competent preparation and planning on European issues at all. Two years ago, they walked into a meeting to find that Chirac and Schr&#246;der had stitched together a package on agricultural financing. The Government made the best of a bad job, but the fact is that it was put together in their absence and they have been unable to unstitch it. Now, I get the impression that the Government did no real planning as to what the consequences of a no vote in France or elsewhere might be. Again, it looks as if they have been caught on the hop by a French counter-offensive on the rebate. Perhaps we did not anticipate trouble on that. Perhaps the Chancellor, with his well-known and well-advertised impatience with Europe and all its works, his anxiety to take the last flight to and first flight from Brussels, his reluctance to engage in what the French call les rondes de jambes&#151;a necessary part of European negotiations, which goes better with alcohol than without&#151;and preoccupied with G8&nbsp;issues, took his eye off the ball.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50615-29_para3">
<a name="stpa_326">A month ago, no one in Government was talking about a fundamental change in the balance of EU funding. During the general election campaign, I did not detect anyone telling me that a fundamental decision to change the orientation of Europe would happen, however much we might have welcomed that. We appear to have stumbled into a demand for a fundamental revision of European finances almost by accident and as a reaction to coming under attack about the rebate.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50615-29_para4">
<a name="stpa_327">We were already at the beginning of a major change in the common agricultural policy. The first transitional period in the move to the single farm payment is this year. There are years to come. It applies differently to different parts of the United Kingdom, but it represents a fundamental change and the other EU countries have timetables in a broadly similar framework. If the Government now say that we will start from scratch and that we need a new reform, the sooner we know about it, the better.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50615-29_para5">
<a name="stpa_328">Do we have any idea of the change that we want? I do not believe that we do. I have heard nothing from the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs about the future shape of the CAP. I congratulate the Secretary of State on negotiating the single farm payment reforms, which was a significant achievement and a fundamental break with the past of the CAP. However, I have not heard that it is the aperitif before a much bigger change later.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50615-29_para6">
<a name="stpa_329">Are the Government aware that CAP funding will be cut significantly and that that the sword will fall precisely on the most useful parts&#151;the environmental and rural development elements? It is already clear from

<p>
<a name="50615-29_para7">
<a name="stpa_330">The best hope of reforming the CAP is for the British Government to pursue vigorously the World Trade Organisation round and ensure that Europeans do not lapse on their way to the ministerial meetings at the end of the year. The demands of the marketplace and the WTO have always been more effective drivers of change in fundamental policies such as agriculture than self-generated demands. It will take all the skills of the British presidency to ensure that Ministers arrive in Hong Kong in December still determined to strike a deal. It would be a significant win simply to ensure that the farm support of Bulgaria and Romania falls in the envelope that is currently envisaged when they join the EU.

<a name="50615-29_para8">
<a name="stpa_331">As I said to my Front Benchers, the stuff about horrible, miserable, inefficient French farmers, ghastly peasants and how we should stop them getting more money is tedious. First, it is inaccurate. The French have some of the most efficient farmers in the world. East Anglia has little to teach the French cereal farmers in the Paris basin and northern France about agricultural productivity. The Dutch, the Danes and other European nations are as efficient as us in other sectors of agriculture. We do not help ourselves by perpetuating some of the little British myths because it means that we sometimes fool ourselves about the genuine needs of our farmers.

<a name="50615-29_para9">
<a name="stpa_332">We need to examine the current politics of the EU. I am a well-known Francophile, sometimes to my cost. However, President Chirac is undoubtedly the empty man of European politics&#151;l&#039;homme vide de l&#039;Europe. He brought about his own misery. He has made a series of heroic miscalculations in his political career and the latest is probably the most fatal. That is not our fault. At the moment, he appears almost to want to take revenge on his people, but there is no reason for the United Kingdom to help him. We helped him before the referendum on the services directive and I see no reason for continuing that help.

<a name="50615-29_para10">
<a name="stpa_333">It is ironic that, in many ways, the vote in France was to stop the world and get off, whereas some of the most efficient multinational companies in the world, in the insurance, aerospace, nuclear and motor industries, are based in France. Some French companies are world-beaters, so we should not characterise the whole of France as some backward industrial society hiding behind a luddite exterior.

<a name="stpa_334">Chancellor Schr&#246;der is going for an early election in September, which we hope profoundly that he will lose, and which I am sure that the Prime Minister also hopes that he will lose. He will be much more comfortable with a Christian Democrat regime than with a Social Democrat regime, as the Prime Minister is much more a Christian Democrat than a Social Democrat. Angela Merkel would be a much more effective partner in sharing a vision of the sort of economic society that she wants in Europe than Chancellor Schr&#246;der. I hope that there will be no last-minute electoral dashes to Germany to help the Chancellor, although, on second thoughts, perhaps I would like that, as it will no doubt reinforce the determination of the German people to get rid of him.

If we believe in our own liberalising agenda, and that the geometry of Europe has changed because of enlargement, we look to precisely those states to be our allies in delivering that liberalising agenda. As the Prime Minister has said, albeit belatedly, we need to address not merely the rebate but its causes, to coin a phrase. Perhaps we need a wider mechanism to address legitimate concerns of countries such as the Netherlands, Sweden and Germany, and we need a long-term shift in the balance of European spending.

We will not do anything at the European level that will solve France&#039;s economic problems with the labour market, or stop the German problems, which stem as much from the terms of reunification as the exchange rate of the euro. There is no single Anglo-Saxon model, and no single continental model and nor, we should remember, is the UK always supremely better and different from everybody else in its economic performance.

<a name="stpa_338">I agree that we must maintain the course for enlargement, which is the European Union&#039;s greatest achievement&#151;the creation of a civil society, with a functioning democracy and accountability, through member states from very diverse dictatorial or totalitarian backgrounds having to subscribe to certain civil liberties criteria in order to be part of the European Union. The changes that they bring about to do that are much more fundamental than they would achieve autonomously, as we are seeing in Turkey at the moment. The final prize would be Turkey. The ability to demonstrate that an Islamic society can be part of a much wider association that is predominantly, but far from exclusively Christian, would be an enormous contribution of soft power by the European Union to geopolitical stability.

<a name="50615-29_para16">
<a name="stpa_339">Europe faces two huge tasks. The first is that we need to discuss properly how the European Union works in the new world of global investment and trade. Issues such as education, training, research and development, and market-based culture will become much more important, because globalisation will not go away and we cannot close the frontiers again. We will have to deal with that incredibly competitive society, and Europe has a role in ensuring that we can do it.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50615-29_para17">
<a name="stpa_340">Secondly, there is the question of connection with citizens. The problem is that the European Union has lots of institutions, but they do not have the legitimacy with which citizens endow the institutions of member states. In other words, they do not have demos, unlike the institutions of a nation state, which draw directly on the people.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50615-29_para18">
<a name="stpa_341">That means that we need to find mechanisms to draw national bodies&#151;not just governmental, civil society bodies, but national Parliaments&#151;much more closely into the working of the European Union and the decision-making processes, so that people can find in those institutions and bodies geometry with which they are familiar. They will see shapes, functions and procedures with which they are familiar and that they can relate to until we can create a marriage of institutions that are necessarily supranational, but which draw to the maximum on familiarity with institutions in which people have invested a certain trust and faith&#151;although perhaps not always deservedly, considering the history. None the less, they are what people have chosen. If we can do that, it will be a significant help.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50615-29_para19">
<a name="stpa_342">Finally, I want to make one little point. It would be awfully helpful if Europe could occasionally dismantle something instead of creating it. May I recommend the Economic and Social Committee? The European Parliament is the international democratic body of the European Union, so I cannot for the life of me see what the residual function of the Economic and Social Committee is. I am not a great fan of the Committee of the Regions either. We must be able to say, &quot;This has served its purpose, but it has been superseded. Europe can be more efficient and slimmed down.&quot; That would give a great lesson to everybody. We talk about devolution: let us do it at home and do it in Europe. Then, perhaps, we will be able to show the citizens that we have listened to them.

<a name="stpa_343">The hon. Member for Luton, North (Kelvin Hopkins) mentioned, I think with a slip of the tongue, the supernatural element of the European Union. I certainly hope that there will be no false effort to resuscitate a constitution that is well and truly dead. 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>15 Jun 2005 : Column 349</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>Representing as I do the first party in the House to call for a referendum on the constitution, I nevertheless believe that a corpse is a corpse. It would be odd to hold a referendum on a constitution that is as dead as Monty Python&#039;s parrot. That may not be pining for the Norwegian fjords, but, as the new Minister for Europe knows&#151;I welcome him to his place&#151;Norway&#039;s advantages from being outside the common fisheries policy reflected the SNP&#039;s main objection to the constitution.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50615-30_para1">
<a name="stpa_344">Despite our objections on the incorporation in the draft constitution of the common fisheries policy as an exclusive competence, we believe that there is much to merit further consideration. I strongly warn against the tabloid approach taken in some quarters, which seems to rule out any change to the European Union that may have been within the draft constitution. For example, the idea that we should not think about proposals to open up the Council of Ministers and make it meet in public because the draft constitution is dead and almost buried has been raised a number of times and the same applies to pursuing an enhanced role for national Parliaments. Not considering those things would be folly. We need to consider all these proposals on their merits and not paint them as discredited. They are not.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50615-30_para2">
<a name="stpa_345">I firmly believe that we should regard where we are as an opportunity to redefine the European Union that we want. We do not want a negative, anti-European attitude, but one that recognises the need for a confederal European Union that reflects a very real, 21st-century independence. Such independence is not the same as the 19th-century, outdated idea of autarkic independence, but it none the less constitutes independence. The idea that the Slovaks and the Slovenes, who regained their independence from larger incorporating unions, have thrown it out the window within 10&nbsp;years by joining a supranational united states of Europe was folly before and it is folly now. We have, and should continue to have, a confederal Europe. However, we need to look hard at what does need reforming, and I want briefly to talk about our responsibilities in this House in that regard.
</p>








<p><a name="st_196"><a name="50615-30_spnew1"><b> Mr. Andrew Turner  (Isle of Wight) (Con):</b> 
 Can the hon. Gentleman first clarify what he means by a confederal Europe, compared with the one set out in the constitution?
</p>








<p><a name="st_197"><a name="50615-30_spnew2"><b> Angus Robertson: </b> 
 A confederal Europe resembles the constitution definition, which describes the EU as a union of states that decides to pool sovereignty in various areas, while retaining the principle of subsidiarity. I firmly believe that powers should be handed back. Someone asked what should be handed back, and first on my list would be the common fisheries policy. That has been an absolute disaster, yet no mention has been made of it today.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50615-30_para3">
<a name="stpa_346">I return to what we in this House should be doing about reform. The esteemed Chairman of the European Scrutiny Committee, the hon. Member for Lanark and Hamilton, East (Mr. Hood), who spoke at the beginning of the debate, talked about the important role that it plays in ensuring that this House is properly informed about proposals from the European Commission, the 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>15 Jun 2005 : Column 350</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>Council of Ministers and elsewhere, and about important regulations, directives and communications. Every week, the Committee goes through as many as 30&nbsp;to 40&nbsp;documents, some of which are profoundly important. Yet for the past two months, it has not met. There has been no scrutiny whatsoever of European business during this Parliament. Does that mean that the Council of Ministers was not meeting&#151;that it was not deciding whether such regulations and directives should be introduced? Of course not. Such regulations and directives were introduced. What happened to the scrutiny reserve, or has everything been put on hold? I do not know, but if we want to reform the EU we must lead by example. I am sorry to say that we have failed in that regard.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50615-30_para4">
<a name="stpa_347">We also failed in terms of turnout. During the debate on the draft constitution, a Standing Committee that brought together Members of this House and of the other place had twice to be declared inquorate because Conservative members did not attend. That is extraordinary. We can take European business seriously or choose to grandstand once or twice a year on our hobby-horse subjects. We need to get on with the nitty-gritty work and to take our scrutiny function much more seriously.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50615-30_para5">
<a name="stpa_348">Another issue that has not been touched on is the role of devolved Administrations and institutions. Some 60&nbsp;to 70&nbsp;per cent. of the European legislation that gets handed down to the United Kingdom relates to shared sovereignty with the Scottish Parliament, not to this House, yet no mention has been made of how we might choose to improve that situation. Members might not be aware that the relationship between the UK Government and the devolved Administrations is currently secret. Concordats on intergovernmental relationships between the central authority and devolved Administrations say that Ministers should not talk about their discussions on important policy issues. How can we talk about an improved EU when scrutiny Committees do not meet, interrelationships are secret within UK governmental structures and the European Scrutiny Committee itself, on the most important times that it meets, does so in secret? That is indefensible. The Dail Eireann can work out a way to meet in public and go through the various issues, so why cannot the European Scrutiny Committee do the same?
</p>

<p>
<a name="50615-30_para6">
<a name="stpa_349">I am mindful of the time, so I will be brief in discussing my final point. I am concerned that, in the current climate of megaphone, gunboat diplomacy on the rebate, we might be missing out a very important element of the budgetary debate that is of profound importance to UK areas that receive EU funding. I do not know whether, given the large amount of paper in his in-tray, the new Minister for Europe has had a chance to examine what is known as statistical effect. Let me try to explain a rather complicated development.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50615-30_para7">
<a name="stpa_350">Because of enlargement, money needs to go from the older, richer EU states to the poorer, new member states, but 17&nbsp;regions throughout the old EU are very much at the margins of EU funding, and may lose it.

That is confirmed by a document drawn up two days ago by the Scottish Executive. When I asked the Foreign Secretary about it, he said that he was not aware of the exact numbers. I should be grateful if the Minister for Europe could confirm that that would be the position. The document says:

He said that the UK Government had given a commitment to the regions and nations that they would not lose out. I should be grateful if, when summing up or indeed now, the Minister could confirm that the UK Government will cover&#151;as a minimum&#151;the nigh on &#163;1&nbsp;billion that will potentially be lost from the Scottish economy, given the detrimental impact that that would have on the highlands and islands in particular.

The bases on which the numbers can be calculated rely on European statistics that are not yet available to this or any other EU Government.

 I am surprised, because the Scottish Executive seem to have the figures. The Scottish Executive, run by the Labour Government together with the Liberal Democrats, say that the amount is &#163;710&nbsp;million.

<a name="stpa_355">We must of course accept that structural funds are for the poorest regions.

The Foreign Secretary has conceded that mechanisms will be available to plug the gap, and I await the Minister&#039;s guarantee that the Government will indeed plug a gap in the Scottish economy that amounts to at least &#163;1&nbsp;billion.

 I want to be reasonably brief this evening and concentrate my remarks exclusively on the consequences for Britain of the referendum decisions in France and Holland. Before doing so, however, I join my right hon. Friend the Member for Skipton and Ripon (Mr. Curry) in congratulating my hon. Friend the Member for Ruislip-Northwood (Mr. Hurd) on a very distinguished maiden speech. He opened his remarks by saying that another new colleague, my hon. Friend the Member for Croydon, Central (Mr. Pelling) and, indeed, the hon. Member for Belfast, South (Dr. McDonnell) had set a high hurdle for him to jump over, but everyone who heard his speech would conclude that my hon. Friend jumped over that hurdle and made it look easier than we all know it truly was. I congratulate him again on an excellent speech that came over extremely well.

</p>

<p>
<a name="50615-31_para1">
<a name="stpa_356">I unreservedly welcome the rejection of the constitution in the referendums of France and Holland and it is important to be clear why. I am not one who thinks that the constitutional treaty was the finishing touch or keystone for a new superstate. Such a presentation of the constitutional treaty is grossly overblown. I welcome its rejection because I have always thought that the treaty that emerged from the process was a major lost opportunity for Europe and I am delighted that the political classes in Europe have a second chance to produce a new constitutional arrangement that addresses the needs of the whole of Europe at the beginning of the 21st century. If we are to achieve that, we must be specific about the nature of the problems that we currently face and how best to take the opportunity to deal with them.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50615-31_para2">
<a name="stpa_357">I am not one who believes that the problems that Europe has encountered as the European Union has grown and as the world has become more complex should lead us to the conclusion that we should give up on the European project. I am an unapologetic Europhile and I believe that the motivation that led us first to join and then to develop the EU is still correct, but we must be clear about precisely which objectives are achievable. Some of the objectives that were written into the treaties as we have gone along have proved, in the light of experience, to be over-ambitious, so we should consciously drop them. My hon. Friend the Member for Ruislip-Northwood suggested that we should consciously drop the commitment to build an ever-closer union. He is almost certainly right about that.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50615-31_para3">
<a name="stpa_358">As a former Secretary of State, I used to be responsible for health and, from my point of view, there was no reason for that policy area to be included in the various treaties. I would now delete any reference to an EU angle on health from them. I also used to be responsible at one time for what was then called national heritage. There were some minimalist EU functions attached to that, but again I would now drop them because they are over-ambitious and do not focus on the core of the common interest that should, in my view, be at the heart of the European project.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50615-31_para4">
<a name="stpa_359">Let us be clear about that. First and foremost, I agree with my right hon. Friend the Member for Hitchin and Harpenden (Mr. Lilley) that the European project has to be about creating a competitive market economy that brings together all the EU member states. Some people 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>15 Jun 2005 : Column 353</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>talk as though that means no more than a commitment to a customs union, but I believe that it runs very much deeper than that. A successful market economy is not a state of nature. It depends on a very intricate collection of regulations and commitments that are enforced on all the participants in that market economy.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50615-31_para5">
<a name="stpa_360">The EU was established for a central purpose&#151;to deliver the political objectives of neo-liberalism. That is greatly to the UK&#039;s advantage. I fundamentally disagree with the hon. Member for Luton, North (Kelvin Hopkins), who says that we should reject the neo-liberal agenda. I am very strongly in favour of that agenda, and the EU&#039;s institutions should be designed to deliver it.

 The right hon. Gentleman is offering a plausible and principled case for getting rid of the EU&#039;s superfluous power and concentrating on its core business. However, voters in France rejected the constitution for being too minimal and Anglo-Saxon. Would not renegotiation of that text give rise to a document even more shrunken than the one already rejected by French voters?
</p>








<p><a name="st_202"><a name="50615-31_spnew3"><b> Mr. Dorrell: </b> 
 The hon. Gentleman makes an important point, which I shall address later in my remarks. It goes to the heart of what I consider to be the constitutional treaty&#039;s failings.

<p>
<a name="50615-31_para6">
<a name="stpa_361">The second policy area in which the EU must engage much more effectively than has been the case so far&#151;the environmental agenda&#151;was also mentioned by my hon. Friend the Member for Ruislip-Northwood and by my right hon. Friend the Member for Skipton and Ripon. As the latter said, the environment is rising up the political agenda very quickly. Member states have a real common interest in it, and there is a real requirement for a common policy. In contrast, the areas in which I am not in favour of deepening co-operation include security, defence and foreign policy. They are outside what I understand to be the common interest among EU states in ensuring an effective delivery mechanism.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50615-31_para7">
<a name="stpa_362">Why have the existing constitutional arrangements, and the treaty proposals that we can now consider to be dead, been found wanting in respect of delivering the policy agenda that I have set out? I believe that the answer is that the present system is insufficiently flexible for the world in which we now live. It was consciously designed that way by the people who put the arrangements in place in the 1950s. At that time, the concern was to agree a common purpose and make it difficult for countries to resile from it. Therefore, the EU&#039;s designers built in the provision that only the European Commission could initiate new proposals, and they also built in the principle of the acquis communautaire.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50615-31_para8">
<a name="stpa_363">However, the dangers that we face today are fundamentally different from the ones that the European institutions were designed to address. In the face of globalisation, those institutions make change too difficult: they slow down the change that is essential to the economic survival and success of the EU&#039;s member states. Furthermore, a Europe of 25&nbsp;states has an institutional resistance to change that makes change more difficult to manage than was the case with the original six member states.

<br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>

<p>
<a name="50615-31_para9">
<a name="stpa_364">The balance has therefore shifted fundamentally and we need to ensure that in future the EU&#039;s institutions are much more effective drivers for change. As proof of that, one need only list the items on the change agenda about which the liberals among us, at least, broadly agree&#151;excessive social costs, misplaced agricultural expenditure, wasteful expenditure in the rest of the budget, the important elements in the world trade round that were mentioned earlier, and the sensitivity surrounding enlargement, especially as it relates to Turkey. All those hugely sensitive items are on the change agenda.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50615-31_para10">
<a name="stpa_365">On the point raised by the hon. Member for Sheffield, Hallam (Mr. Clegg), the second problem with the existing institutions is that they do not allow the process of change to be driven through. Supporters of the constitutional treaty say that that is exactly why they wanted to extend qualified majority voting and make it easier for the EU to reach decisions. Let us consider that. The changes that I have listed are hugely controversial. One need only consider how the French electorate reacted to the introduction of Turkey, the case for the Anglo-Saxon model or liberal change. However, we need to introduce those changes because power is already seen to be remote. If we streamline the institutions and make them more powerful, it might make it easier for the institutions to introduce unpopular and controversial change, but it will divorce them even further from the electorates to whom they are responsible and build up an even bigger bow wave of resistance to the changes that are essential for the success of the societies of the member states.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50615-31_para11">
<a name="stpa_366">The central point is that if one wants to introduce change&#151;especially unpopular, difficult change&#151;in a democracy, it has to be based on a public dialogue. We cannot expect our electorates to come with us on a journey that is uncomfortable if, to put it crudely, it is explained to them, literally, in a foreign language. Change requires explanation and a public dialogue, and the institutions of the EU as currently constituted do not allow sufficient dialogue to take place to include&#151;a fashionable word these days&#151;the electorates of Europe in the change process that is essential for our survival.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50615-31_para12">
<a name="stpa_367">I support the need for radical change to the institutions of Europe, but the defining characteristics of those changes must be that they allow us to embrace a faster driven change process. If that is to be successful, the changes must be based on a more effective public dialogue and increased accountability by the decision makers to those who elect us. That means that the institutions must be more firmly rooted than the existing ones in the successful democracies based on the nation state, instead of trying to create a European demos. If we have to wait until we have a successful European public dialogue, the Chinese, the Indians and the Americans&#151;indeed, all our competitors around the world&#151;will have left us standing. We do not have time and nor, in my mind, do we have the will to create a European political debate to support that process. That leads to the conclusion, which I find acceptable, that we should engage the member states and their institutions in supporting the change process. If we do not do that, we shall find that our institutions have become dangerously ossified. We shall also come to regard the European Union as like the pre-Reformation Roman Catholic Church, and that is not a world in which I want to live.

 I listened to&nbsp;the earlier speeches in the debate today and I listened to much of the debate last week.

 I said in the United Kingdom. Therefore, for the Conservative party to argue that a single vote on a particular issue by French electors is a justification of their position is the triumph of hope over experience. The logic of their position is that they should abandon the attempt to win support for their anti-European views in the United Kingdom and simply export themselves to France or the Netherlands.

<p>
<a name="50615-32_para1">
<a name="stpa_369">I reiterate the point made by the right hon. Member for Skipton and Ripon about French farmers. It is ludicrous and self-defeating to delude ourselves into thinking that all United Kingdom agriculture is superbly efficient, but all French agriculture is immensely inefficient. Anyone who compares the range, quality and diversity of food production in France with what we produce and the circumstances in which we produce it would draw that conclusion. Equally, when considering the strength of the French and German economies, we must compare the number of British consumers who choose to purchase motor cars manufactured in those countries with the number of French and German consumers who purchase motor cars manufactured in Britain. That comparison provides us with an important comment about the relative strengths of our manufacturing economies.

However, that was significant because the people to whom I was talking were strong Europeans. They believed in the European Union and probably believed in ever closer union. They certainly managed to combine a strong sense of their French identity with a sense of European identity.

<a name="50615-32_para3">
<a name="stpa_371">Those people did not vote against the constitution for the reasons outlined by Conservative Front-Bench spokesmen today and during last week&#039;s debate. They were not voting against the single currency because they strongly supported it, and nor were they voting against the precise constitutional changes proposed in the treaty. They were not necessarily against a directly elected President, a common foreign policy, or even the changes to qualified majority voting. They were voting on the grounds of anxiety, fear and security. I cannot speak for people in Holland because I suspect that there were one or two slightly different issues there, although many were the same. However, the theme of everyone to whom I spoke, every newspaper article that I read and every television and radio programme that I watched or listened to was economic, rather than constitutional, although it was certainly nothing to do with the single currency. That fact is really important, so our Government and all European Governments must take it on board.

<a name="stpa_372">The supreme irony&#151;the hon. Member for Sheffield, Hallam (Mr. Clegg) made this point&#151;is that the Conservative Opposition here believe that the result of the French and Dutch vote was a vindication of their economic policy. That is a delusion of a high order. The minimalist state&#151;the ultra-deregulated economy and free movement of capital&#151;is precisely what French voters voted against. They voted against the kind of economic policy that is dear to the heart of the Conservative party in Britain. We have to recognise that the vote was about economic insecurity as much as it was about the detailed text of the constitution. I think that my experience on that was widely shared.

 I am interested in the hon.

We can have an interesting debate about what went on in the minds and hearts of the French people and what motivated them, but that is rather academic. We are now in a constitutional crisis in Europe which obliges us to reconsider our future role in Europe and the direction of the Community as a whole.

We also have to recognise that 45&nbsp;per cent. voted for a 191-page document of densely printed text. It is odd that the Conservative party can say that a 33&nbsp;per cent. share of the vote in the recent general election represents a historic vindication of their leadership and an end to the terminal decline of their party, but that a 45&nbsp;per cent.

<a name="50615-32_para6">
<a name="stpa_374">There is something else to consider. On the way to the Chamber, I called in at the House of Commons Library to get a copy of the constitutional treaty, not because I expected to read the 191&nbsp;pages before the start of the debate, but because I wanted to see how accessible it was. There is no copy in the Library. There is an excellent research paper, but I could not access the treaty from the Library Desk. [Hon.

The document was circulated to every household in France, but if we expect people to take a considered view on a 191-page document, we are deceiving ourselves.

<a name="stpa_377">I am conscious that time is short and I hope to allow one more Member to speak, so I shall draw my remarks to a conclusion. First, it is important that the treaty adapts to the new reality of the EU, and takes into account the fact that it is a Union of 25&nbsp;nations and that the rules have to be changed. It is entirely reasonable that the leadership of nation states can choose to ratify such a treaty without a referendum.

We must give reassurance about those insecurities, and I hope that our Prime Minister will take that message to his colleagues at the European Council later this week.

<p><a name="st_212"><a name="50615-33_spnew0"><b> David Howarth  (Cambridge) (LD):</b> 
 In view of the lateness of the hour, I shall make only one point. There is something odd about the EU budget: 80&nbsp;per cent. of it is made up of items whose main motivation is redistribution&#151;CAP, regional structural funds and regional development. Only about 10&nbsp;per cent. of the EU budget provides any sort of public service, and that includes the 6.6&nbsp;per cent. proposed for research and development in the 2007&#150;13&nbsp;financial framework. That is very different from a normal national budget. In the UK, for example, the Budget contains about 55&nbsp;per cent. for redistributive measures and about 30&nbsp;per cent. for public services. If the EU is to be popular with the population of Europe, there must be some change in the balance between public services and redistribution.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50615-33_para0">
<a name="stpa_379">It could be argued that some public services are best provided to some degree at European level. For example, environmental questions such as alternatives to air travel need to be dealt with at European rather than national level. Similarly, the kind of equipment and capital investment needed for vast scientific research programmes is plainly beyond the reach of many nation states and that, too, needs to be dealt with at supranational level.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50615-33_para1">
<a name="stpa_380">As many Members have pointed out, we must also consider the balance within the redistributive part of the budget. Forty per cent. of the whole budget&#151;half the redistribution element&#151;goes to agriculture and rural development. Whatever the situation might have been in the 1950s, do we really believe that the major redistribution problem in Europe at present is between urban and rural areas? No one believes that. Nowadays, 76&nbsp;per cent. of the population of Europe is urban, and the figure is closer to 90&nbsp;per cent. in countries such as Britain. There must be a change in the balance of redistributive budgets that better reflects our current problems.

 Leaving aside the hon. Gentleman&#039;s remark about the rural and urban split&#151;he would not argue that the importance of rural areas depended solely on the number of people who live there&#151;on public services and spending, he is implying that as well as spending money the EU would have competence for the areas of public spending that absorb the greater part of 

<br>&nbsp;<br>

<a name="stpa_381">Finally, we need radical change, not just incremental change, in the distribution of the budget among different projects.

Britain has an absolute veto on the removal of the rebate. If the Government had just been firm, this week&#039;s discussions would have been so much more productive. The only conclusion that can be drawn is that discussion of the rebate has been convenient for the British Government, as it has been for the French. President Chirac has been able to bash the British, and the Prime Minister can swing his handbag and grandstand about his battle to save the rebate.

 I agree with the hon. Gentleman&#039;s final point about the need for a wider debate on the future of Europe, but I disagree with his initial point about the treaty ratification process across Europe. I would have thought that he supports the principle of subsidiarity and recognises that it is for individual member states within the EU to determine their own ratification processes. The Spanish people have already ratified the treaty by referendum, and nine other countries have also ratified it, but two founding member states have rejected the draft constitutional treaty by referendum. I take the view that in the first instance it is for each member state to determine the means by which the ratification process can be taken forward.

 I am very pleased to be able to speak on the Adjournment on the absolutely crucial issue of what is still happening in Darfur in Sudan. Because of things called elections, it has been some time since we have had the opportunity to raise the subject. I pay tribute to my hon. Friend the Minister and welcome him to his new position. He listened to part of the previous debate, but I am sure that he is now much more at home with the issue of Africa, and Darfur in particular.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50615-35_para0">
<a name="stpa_413">My premise is that, sadly, there is little evidence to suggest that things have improved since we last debated this terribly serious situation, which is probably, at the moment, the world&#039;s worst humanitarian disaster bar none. I do not have to use my own words&#151;I will read a quote from Kofi Annan from the Addis Ababa pledging conference of 26&nbsp;May:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_35">&quot;We are running a race against time. The rainy season and the hunger gap are approaching fast making now relief operations more difficult, just as they need to expand even further. If violence and fear prevent the people of Darfur from planting and growing their crops next year then millions will have to be sustained by an epic relief effort which will stretch international capacity to the maximum.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="50615-35_para1">
<a name="stpa_414">I hope that I come to this debate with some experience. I think that I am about to be anointed as the chair of the all-party group on Sudan. I have a considerable interest in the subject, as does my hon. Friend, in this context, the Member for Buckingham (John Bercow). We visited Khartoum and Darfur last year, and he went subsequently with the International Development Committee. We have seen first-hand the depths of the crisis.
</p>

<p>

<a name="stpa_416">I do not have time to go through the history of this tragedy, which we have considered in various debates. I want to go right to the nub of what is happening and what&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;needs to happen. The fact that so many organisations have written to me shows that it is a live&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;issue. Thankfully, it has not been forgotten by the non-governmental organisations&#151;the International Committee of the Red Cross, the International Crisis Group, Unicef, Protect Darfur and Waging Peace, among others. In the past couple of days I have had enormous wodges of paper showing that representations are still going on.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50615-35_para4">
<a name="stpa_417">In explaining the point that the crisis has now reached, I make no apology for starting with the humanitarian problems. The rainy season is about to start in Darfur. That will affect mainly the southern parts; sadly, much of the north gets hardly any rain. This huge area has great disparities of climate. Chad, which has similar climatic features, has many refugees and internally displaced persons. The big problem is that there will be yet another season throughout which people are unable to plant, and the agricultural background of many of these people will start to be

<p>
<a name="50615-35_para5">
<a name="stpa_418">The World Food Programme announced a shortfall of $167&nbsp;million, which makes it difficult to feed an estimated 2.5&nbsp;million people in 2005. Inevitably, there is some process of catch-up, but those figures give an idea of the depth of the crisis. It is believed that at least another million people will need food aid from May to September.

</p>

<p>
<a name="50615-35_para6">
<a name="stpa_419">We are two years into the crisis and, although proposals have been made and the world has engaged in various ways, it remains huge and is getting worse. The world has yet to break the back of it. That is the responsibility of us all, not only the United Nations or those who are on the ground. To be fair, this country has taken a strong lead. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for International Development said in a letter that the position in Darfur was worrying and ascribed it to the continuing insecurity. He emphasised the particular worry of the harassment of non-governmental organisations, which adds to the humanitarian crisis.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50615-35_para7">
<a name="stpa_420">The first of several questions to my hon. Friend the&nbsp;Minister for Trade is: what preparations have the British Government put in place to deal with the internally displaced persons crisis, not only in terms of food, but shelter, health and&#151;dare I say it&#151;even some education for the children?
</p>

<p>
<a name="50615-35_para8">
<a name="stpa_421">On 9&nbsp;June, the United Nations mission in Sudan&#151;UNMIS&#151;declared that the town of Muhujariya in south Darfur was a no-go area for UN staff following a conflict between rebel forces and Government troops. Again, that bears out my comments about the problems of the security situation. Such events are a regular occurrence. Although there has been greater stability in some places, sadly, trouble is breaking out in many others and there are insufficient people on the ground to deal with that.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50615-35_para9">
<a name="stpa_422">There is no evidence that the Janjaweed has been reined in. I was present when the hon. Member for Buckingham asked whether the Janjaweed was not being reined in because the regime could not control it&#151;if that is the case, we need to put troops on the ground, with the backing of the Government in Sudan&#151;or whether the Sudanese Government were complicit in the actions of the Janjaweed because it is that Government&#039;s secret militia, albeit no longer so secret. If the latter is the case, we must deal with the Government of Sudan. We did not get an answer to that question. I gather that there is no answer. However, the position is unacceptable. The Janjaweed must be tackled. We are not only considering what happens in the rural areas, but all the pressures in the camps, with allegations of the rape of the women and attacks on the men.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50615-35_para10">
<a name="stpa_423">What is the British Government&#039;s assessment of the security position? Do they perceive any improvements on the ground? What are they doing to put in place ways in which to provide greater security? I was pleased to read in the past couple of days that we are sending some RAF personnel to help the African Union as it ratchets up the number of troops from 3,000&nbsp;to more than 7,000. Sadly, such action appears to be too little, too late but at least it is happening. Our support is needed for the logistics involved in getting people where the trouble is quickly and moving the food around so that we can feed people.

<a name="50615-35_para11">
<a name="stpa_424">I have already mentioned the specific problem of sexual violence in and around the camps. According to the Sudan Organisation against Torture&#151;SOAT&#151;which comprises an incredibly brave group of people, whom the hon. Member for Buckingham and I had the opportunity to meet in Khartoum, rape and sexual violence are being used as tools to frighten the population. Again, what measures do her Majesty&#039;s Government believe are necessary to deal with that specifically? Given the threat to non-governmental organisations, with personnel feeling themselves to be at risk, the most vulnerable people are women and children. If fewer people are out there supporting indigenous groups, there is a self-fulfilling prophecy if outrages still take place. What are the Government doing with the UN, the African Union and others to protect those most vulnerable of people? What representations are Her Majesty&#039;s Government making to the Government of Sudan to make it clear that this must be dealt with today? The matter cannot be pushed away, as a tragedy is unfolding, and the security situation must be addressed.

<a name="stpa_425">I have already mentioned the African Union. Clearly, it has been argued, across the House, that there were too few troops and that they needed much more logistical support. In the previous debate&#151;I make no apology for mentioning this again&#151;I said that the apparent turf war between NATO and the EU about who is responsible for some of the airlift and new troops is not helpful. We have got to make sure that such squabbles do not get in the way of what needs to happen now. What efforts are we making to try to overcome those squabbles?

<a name="stpa_426">I want to examine quickly the role of the African Union. Clearly, Africa is taking responsibility, which is pleasing, but it cannot take responsibility in isolation.

Does he agree that what is really needed is a chapter VII United Nations peace enforcement mandate, which, with replenished and increased African Union troop numbers, could allow for the disarmament of the Janjaweed, as well as allowing for the erection and maintenance of a no-fly zone?

<p><a name="st_224"><a name="50615-36_spnew0"><b> Mr. Drew: </b> 
 I agree with the hon. Gentleman, and it is a tragedy that we have not at least had that debate. It is wrong that that issue has apparently always been just pushed away. It is about time that we had that debate, and if it is not to be pursued, we need to know why not.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50615-36_para0">
<a name="stpa_427">It is good that the situation has now been referred to the International Criminal Court. Some of the people whom we met in Khartoum should be a bit more fearful, rather than swanning around Khartoum with no thought that anyone would ever chase them for the outrages for which they have been at least partly responsible. What leverage are the Government putting on the Government of Sudan to make sure that the 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>15 Jun 2005 : Column 369</b>

</p>

<p>
<a name="50615-36_para1">
<a name="stpa_428">In the remaining minutes, I want to move slightly away from Darfur to the wider situation in Sudan, although that backwashes in terms of the peace negotiations. Clearly, it would be good to know what the Government think is happening with regard to the two sides in Darfur, but also how that fits within the comprehensive peace agreement. The good news is that the CPA between the north and the south seems to be holding, notwithstanding Darfur. Some would say that the events in Darfur are a consequence of peace in the north and the south. I do not want to get into that debate, but I want to know that we are still actively engaged. It is very pleasing to hear, for example, that Alan Goulty has been reappointed as the special envoy after his period elsewhere, but how can he play an active part both through the CPA and in trying to bring peace to Darfur?
</p>

<p>
<a name="50615-36_para2">
<a name="stpa_429">My final points relate to the amount of aid and other assistance that we are providing. It would be good to know what finance we are putting into the relief effort, but also into trying to bring some security to Darfur. Are we looking to increase the number of personnel in an expert role being moved into that theatre of conflict? There is also the question of how the CPA is not being allowed to wither. Are we ensuring that the CPA timetables are being adhered to? Darfur takes people&#039;s eye off that and, as my hon. Friend the Minister will know, there are worrying examples of conflict in eastern Sudan, around Port Sudan in the Red Sea state. Again, it would be interesting to know the Government&#039;s engagement with that.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50615-36_para3">
<a name="stpa_430">I make no apology for yet again bringing the issue of Darfur back to this place. It is right that we, through the Government and through Parliament, play our part in urging an early conclusion to the conflict and, more particularly, those desperately sad scenes, which should be coming to an end. It appears, however, that that is far from the case.

<p>
<a name="50615-36_para4">
<a name="stpa_431">Sudan is at a critical juncture. The opportunities presented by the signing of the comprehensive peace agreement on 9&nbsp;January are clear: the agreement ends more than 20&nbsp;years of terrible civil war and paves the way towards a more democratic and inclusive system of governance.

My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for International Development has just completed a further visit to Sudan and is in Addis Ababa, talking to the African Union about its efforts to resolve the crisis.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50615-36_para6">
<a name="stpa_433">During the visit, my right hon. Friend travelled to Darfur, the south of Sudan and Khartoum. In Darfur, he had the opportunity to see for himself the situation of those living in the camps, and to hear their stories, when he visited Abu Shouk and Kalma camps. He also spoke to United Nations and non-governmental organisation representatives in Darfur. It is clear that humanitarian agencies in Darfur face considerable constraints on their activities because of the security situation. As my hon. Friend the Member for Stroud pointed out, continued harassment by the local government, and attacks by the rebels and Arab militia, are limiting the activities of the aid agencies and restricting access.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50615-36_para7">
<a name="stpa_434">Our embassy in Khartoum regularly presses the Government of Sudan on the need to ensure unfettered access for humanitarian workers, and we are also pressing the rebel leaders to stop attacks by their forces on aid convoys. During his visit, my right hon. Friend pressed the First Vice-President on this issue and urged him to prevent intimidation of aid agencies by local authorities. In particular, he raised the case of the two M&#233;decins sans Fronti&#232;res workers&#151;my hon. Friend also referred to it&#151;who were detained following the MSF report on rape in Darfur. We expect the issue to be resolved shortly.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50615-36_para8">
<a name="stpa_435">Access for humanitarian agencies will become increasingly difficult during the rainy season, which has just started. The UN and humanitarian agencies are preparing for this by pre-positioning food and non-food items. They are giving particular priority to areas that will become inaccessible by road. Supply of food remains precarious and the UN is reviewing requirements. It faces major challenges in increasing its response and enhancing its distribution and logistics capability. To meet those challenges, there is a need for timely and significant contributions from the international community. The UK has contributed &#163;75&nbsp;million to the humanitarian programme for Sudan for this financial year, and we are pressing others to do more. Despite the problems faced by the agencies, they are reaching more and more people, thanks to the phenomenal effort of humanitarian workers on the ground. I am sure that the whole House will want to pay tribute to their work.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50615-36_para9">
<a name="stpa_436">My hon. Friend asked about our assessment of the security situation more generally. Insecurity remains unacceptably high, but its causes have changed. The majority of attacks by the rebels and armed militias appear increasingly to be motivated by economic, rather than political, gain. Banditry is on the rise and, against the background of the annual cattle migration from south to north Darfur, tribal tensions are mounting. In recent months, the situation in Darfur has been generally calmer, with a substantial reduction in clashes between the parties, considerably fewer ceasefire violations and a welcome reduction in the number of attacks on civilians. This has been reflected in the UN Secretary-General&#039;s monthly reports.

<a name="stpa_439">For their part, during this period the rebels also launched fewer attacks against Government forces, although they continued to attack police stations. Recent weeks, however, have seen an increase in activity by the parties involved, particularly the rebels, who are responsible for a number of attacks on aid convoys and for the detention of humanitarian workers. Our assessment is that the increased rebel activity may have been an attempt to strengthen their negotiating position ahead of the resumption of the Abuja talks. Whatever the reason, we have made it clear that it must stop immediately. Attacks on aid convoys are totally unacceptable and seriously damage the delivery of humanitarian assistance.

 If there are grounds for genuine optimism, that is to be welcomed, but I put it to the Minister in all sincerity that there is another interpretation of the reduction in violence that he described.

However, the impact of the AU&#039;s 3,000&nbsp;troops is of course limited, and it has faced management and logistical constraints as well as a lack of capacity.

<a name="stpa_442">The Government announced on 13&nbsp;June an increase in our contribution to the expansion of the mission to &#163;19&nbsp;million, from the &#163;6.6&nbsp;million that we announced at the AU donor conference on 26&nbsp;May. That brings our total contribution to the African Union mission in Sudan since its inception to almost &#163;32&nbsp;million. We will use the money to purchase up to 500&nbsp;additional vehicles and further rapid deployment equipment for the AU.

<a name="stpa_443">Other international partners have also announced considerable support for the AU, including an additional $133&nbsp;million from Canada and $50&nbsp;million from the United States. Both NATO and the EU have also been asked to provide assistance, and they are discussing how they can help to present a clear and co-ordinated package of support for the AU. As part of NATO&#039;s efforts, and subject to requirements and efforts by other donors, we have allocated funding to provide airlift for up to three battalions to Darfur. Through the EU&#039;s efforts, we are also keen to support the civilian policing part of the mission. Civilian policing will be vital to long-term peace and stability in Darfur.

<a name="stpa_444">My hon. Friend asked about the AU&#039;s mandate. The current mandate calls on the AU to contribute to a secure environment for the provision of humanitarian assistance, which includes allowing it to protect civilians under imminent threat of attack. A detailed military assessment mission to Darfur in March looked at the AU&#039;s current performance and at the possibility of expanding the mission and extending the mandate still further. This assessment mission concluded that the mandate was sufficient to help promote peace and security in the region, but that more troops were needed to deliver it effectively. However, the AU has said that, within its current mandate, the expanded mission will focus more on the provision of security, and the increased number of troops will allow it to do that.

<a name="50615-37_para3">
<a name="stpa_445">Of course, a peace support mission by itself will not solve the crisis in Darfur. There can be no military solution, which is why we welcome the resumption of the AU-mediated peace talks in Abuja. We also welcome the news that all the parties are attending the talks at a high level. A UK observer is present, and will provide support and advice, as required, to the parties and to the AU mediation. We are pressing all sides to negotiate in good faith at the talks, and to reach agreement on the declaration of principles on which the AU has been working with the parties over recent months before moving on to discuss issues of power and wealth sharing. Talks are expected to last until the first week of July, although while progress is being made no formal restrictions will be placed on their conclusion.

The UK strongly supported the latest three Security Council resolutions on Sudan: resolution 1590, on deploying a peace support operation to southern Sudan; resolution 1591, on extending sanctions to the Government of Sudan and imposing targeted sanctions; and resolution 1593, which we sponsored, referring the grave violations of human rights and international humanitarian law that have taken place in Darfur to the International Criminal Court.

<a name="stpa_447">The international community showed the strength of its support for the comprehensive peace agreement, and for Sudan, at the Oslo donor conference in April, where $4.5&nbsp;billion was pledged.

<a name="stpa_448">The Prime Minister has put Africa at the top of the UK&#039;s agenda for its EU and G8&nbsp;presidencies. The parties in Darfur and across Sudan are now faced with a clear opportunity to achieve a much-deserved peace for the people of Sudan, and for the region as a whole. There is much to do, including implementing the CPA, creating a secure environment in Darfur for people to return to their homes, and negotiating a peace agreement. The UK Government are committed to helping the Sudanese people to achieve those goals. We will continue to work hard, with the AU&#151;
