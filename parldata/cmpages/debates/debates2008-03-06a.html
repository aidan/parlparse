As I said, it will publish its plan fairly shortly and everyone will then have an opportunity to see what it proposes.</p>

 I welcome the appointment of Ron Sandler to his new post. One of the first initiatives that he undertook was to abolish the Together mortgage&#151;the 125 per cent. loan to value. That was a good move, because I considered that mortgage an example of irresponsible lending. However, does the Chancellor appreciate that there are genuine issues of competition at stake? A number of banks and others have been on to me, and at the moment the spread between the inter-bank rate&#151;the LIBOR rate&#151;and base rates is considerable. That may be causing problems for companies. In advance of Ron Sandler&#146;s appearance before the Treasury Committee, would the Chancellor discuss those issues with him so that he can put our minds at ease on that competitive advantage, which others in the market have seen?</p>

 My right hon. Friend raises two matters. First, with regard to Northern Rock&#146;s competitive position, he is absolutely right that Ron Sandler and the board will want to look at what it is selling and offering. I understand that the board is looking at that now with a view to ensuring that whatever products it has on the market are priced appropriately. Everyone recognises that it would be unfair for the bank to rely on those guarantees for anything like a short period, and it would not be possible in terms of the Government&#146;s objectives of reducing and removing their guarantees in due course. On his second point, the Bank of England keeps the spread of interest rates and the LIBOR rate under constant review.</p>

 The whole point of asking the board to produce a business plan is to plot a course for the future to enable the bank to continue to trade. Our objective has always been twofold: to ensure that we obtain value for the taxpayers on repayment of the Bank of England loan and to secure financial stability. Both elements have been met. We have been consistent in our objective throughout, and that will continue.</p>

 Given that the national statistician has ruled that Northern Rock, as a public company, should count as part of the public sector net debt, surely excluding it from the sustainable investment rule is nothing other than a straightforward political fiddle. Nobody is suggesting cutting public spending, only that the figures should be accurate.</p>

 The figures will be accurate. As the hon. Gentleman said, the national statistician has classified Northern Rock as part of the public sector. That is hardly surprising in view of the legislation that we passed a couple of weeks ago. However, the proposition that I put to the hon. Member for Gosport (Peter Viggers) is that the Conservatives appear to argue that, because it is now on the books, we should take account of it in ensuring that we meet our fiscal rules. The code for fiscal stability, which is underpinned by legislation, makes it clear that we can accommodate a period of temporary public ownership, and that would be properly accounted for. To suggest that, by extension, we should take action that would be bad for the economy is ridiculous.</p>

 Does my right hon. Friend agree that when Northern Rock got into difficulties the primary responsibility of Government was to ensure that the banking system as a whole would not be undermined?

 My hon. Friend is right. The justification for our intervening to provide facilities for Northern Rock was the genuine risk of the problems affecting it spreading to other financial institutions. That is why we took the decision. As I said a moment ago, one of our central objectives is to maintain the financial stability of the system. I expect that if we had not intervened the terms of the debate in the past few months would have been different. I remind the House that the decision that we made last September had all-party support at that time, precisely because it was the right thing to do.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman is right to raise the matter, which is, of course, of concern to Northern Rock employees.

 Since the Government are so keen at present on European treaties, may I draw the Chancellor&#146;s attention to the fact that his proposals are a clear breach of the budget deficit procedure imposed on Britain by the Maastricht treaty?

 I know, as does the House, about the hon.

 No, as we have made repeatedly clear, Northern Rock has been taken into temporary public ownership; Granite has not.

The ONS approach is to look at issues of control, and it is right that it should do that. However, we have to take these decisions in the interest of the taxpayer. Safeguarding those loans and guarantees  by taking Northern Rock into temporary public ownership was the right decision for the taxpayer. It would not have been the right decision to buy out Granite&#146;s bond holders. They take risks, and it is right that they should do so. Frankly, this is becoming another day, another policy from the Opposition. Now they want us to fork out to buy up Granite as well.</p>

At the previous meeting of the G7 countries in Tokyo, we reached agreement with Japan and the United States&#151;other countries indicated their support&#151;for setting up a fund to help tackle climate change, particularly in developing countries.

 My hon. Friend raises two important points. We need to ensure that more young people have skills as well as academic qualifications and training, and we need to have more young people involved in politics. That is why it is important that we should have young councillors, as well as young Members of Parliament. I strongly support the action that we took to reduce to 18 the age at which people can stand for elected office in council and parliamentary elections.</p>

 In 1997, when the Labour Government sadly came to power, there was a consultant-led maternity unit in Hemel Hempstead hospital. That unit was quickly closed.

There is no doubt that in today&#146;s House of Commons, there is not only a band of strong women but even some men who could justifiably be seen as honorary members of the sisterhood&#151;although we will have to wait until we hear them speak before we form a final judgment on that point.</p>

 In this debate, as we mark international women&#146;s day, I want us to recognise the transformation that women in the House of Commons have brought about. Women MPs have not only changed the face of British politics, as they&#151;we&#151;have also changed its agenda, which needed to change because women&#146;s lives are changing. The world of work is changing and family life is changing, too. If we are to back up families as they bring up children, earn a living and care for older relatives, we need to understand and represent women as well as men.</p>

He said that we were going to set up a review under Imelda Walsh&#151;not into whether we should increase the age of children whose parents can have flexible working, but into how we will go about doing it.

 I see that the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government is sitting on the Front Bench. Can the Minister assure us that the Department for Communities and Local Government has a policy on local authority and other social housing that allows people who move, perhaps to their first home, to stay near members of their family with caring responsibilities? For far too long people have been allocated homes away from parents or grandparents, or others whom they need and want to look after. If we really want to liberate women, young and older, so that they are able not only to work but to bring in family members to fulfil caring responsibilities, housing policy will be a crucial element in the equation.</p>

 Policy on the allocation of council and social housing is very important in enabling families to stay together and support each other; so is the design of individual homes allowing people to remain independent and in their own homes as they age. Just as we have ensured that new housing developments include access to facilities for children such as schools, playgrounds and open spaces, we seek to ensure that sustainable communities include the granny flat, the day centre, the sheltered housing and the community centre.

 I welcome the opportunity to speak on this 97th international women&#146;s day. In the past 97 years, the role of women in politics, business and society has progressed beyond recognition. Women did not even have the vote 97 years ago, but now as many women turn out to vote as men, and we now have 126 female representatives sitting in this House. Women were almost non-existent in the business sphere 97 years ago, but today there are about 620,000 majority women-owned businesses in the UK generating about &#163;130 billion in turnover, and at long last businesses have realised that employing a woman is not a hindrance, but an asset to the running of the business&#151;although perhaps they would all like to tell Sir Alan Sugar that. Only a handful of universities admitted women 97 years ago, but there are now more women than men at university in the UK, and that trend is set to continue. Those three examples show that in politics, business and education women have not simply waited for men to give them rights; we have gone out and achieved tremendous progress for ourselves. We must, of course, use international women&#146;s day to look ahead to the many complex challenges that women face, but we must also use it to look back and celebrate how far we have come.</p>

It can take the form that we have adopted for selections for Westminster or the form we have adopted for selections of European parliamentary candidates.

 No, I do not. I look forward with interest to the Government&#146;s review on prostitution. There is a debate to be had about the measures that can be taken. Again, enforcement is an issue, because the enforcement of kerb-crawling laws varies across the country.

We have made a simple set of proposals to tighten the legislation, which the Government could, if they chose, adopt today.

About 880,000 people in Britain have been the victims of stalking or harassment, but the authorities are all too often ill-equipped to deal with that problem. We must look at police training to support victims of stalking, so that the police can recognise the problems that stalking brings and the damage it does to someone&#146;s life.</p>

The first is to give rape crisis centres a longer, three-year funding package, which would give them greater certainty about their future. Sadly, too many have closed because of funding problems and uncertainty. We also need to consider the low figure of rape convictions, but approaching that subject is not just about legislation or the criminal justice system. A wider, strategic approach is needed, which is why we would make it compulsory for the sex education curriculum to include the teaching of sexual consent. It is shameful that many young people believe that it is okay for a boy to expect to have sex with a girl if she is being flirtatious, or if he has spent a lot of money on taking her out that evening. It is also shameful that many young people think that it is okay for a boy to hit a girl at some point in their relationship. Those problems cannot be dealt with in legislation; they can be dealt with only with a wider, more strategic approach.</p>

Friend the Member for The Wrekin (Mark Pritchard)&#151;I see that he has moved again, so his patience obviously ran out&#151;made it clear that forced marriages are quite different from arranged marriages. We must make it absolutely clear that forced marriages are wrong. They often involve abuse of the girls who are forced into them, who are sadly often very young. Although 300 cases of forced marriage are reported to the Government&#146;s forced marriage unit each year and many more come to the attention of the authorities, even more sadly go unreported. We have recently made a number of suggestions on the matter, including making local authority children&#146;s services departments registered third parties that could apply for protection orders. We must ensure that information is available in schools to young girls who may find themselves victims of pressure to marry and ultimately victims of a forced marriage.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o80"><a name="80306-0010.htm_para4"><a name="08030641000510">There is a debate to be had on whether a criminal offence should be introduced, because there are differing opinions. Once the Forced Marriage (Civil Protection) Act 2007 is in force, we must see how the civil offence operates. It is valid to argue that fewer people will report forced marriage if it is made a criminal offence, because it will mean reporting members of their family. On the other hand, a group of women in Bradford who support the victims of forced marriages made the point at a recent meeting that they wanted a clear message to be sent that forced marriages were wrong. They said that that would happen by making such marriage a criminal offence. We must consider the matter seriously and then do whatever will reduce the number of young girls forced into marriages against their will.</p>

 My hon. Friend is absolutely right, and that was my next point. Forty-seven per cent. of Assembly Members are women. We had to battle hard for that against a lot of opposition, as my hon.

When Labour was in opposition I spoke on employment matters, so I know how much opposition there was from big business to the minimum wage. The same arguments were made then as are being made now in relation to legislation on agency workers&#151;that the measure would cost hundreds of thousands of jobs. However, in my Cynon Valley constituency, workers are now guaranteed a fair wage and thousands of women have been lifted out of poverty. The minimum wage was an important step forward, and I welcome the recently announced increase to &#163;5.73 an hour. I am also proud to support the Temporary and Agency Workers (Equal Treatment) Bill, which I hope will ensure fair conditions for thousands of men and women on temporary contracts or working through agencies.

There are still no prisons for women in Wales, so women are imprisoned hundreds of miles from their children, their families and their loved ones. This week, a report from the Sainsbury Centre for Mental Health shows that short spells in prison, even on remand, damage women&#146;s mental health and family life, yet do little or nothing to stop them reoffending. The damage is made much worse when women are imprisoned a long distance from home and they receive inadequate health care during and after their time in prison. There are more than 4,400 woman in 17 prisons in England. Four women prisoners in every five have mental health problems, most commonly depression and anxiety, and almost half have been the subject of abuse. I welcome the recent report by Jean Corston, a former Member of this House, and very much hope that the Government will take up its recommendations, including the replacement of women&#146;s prisons with smaller local  <br>

 I entirely agree. I want to come on to the issue of carers, which the Minister mentioned. The issue is often raised in the House, with good reason. I know that the right hon. Member for Maidenhead has a particular view on carers, which I think we all share. There are 6 million carers in the UK, and they are estimated to save the economy &#163;87 billion a year through their unpaid work. The burden of caring falls disproportionately on the shoulders of women, with  58 per cent. of carers being female. The Government have done a lot to support carers and look after their needs, but a lot more needs to be done to protect that growing section of society as the population age.</p>

education to claim the allowance. The links between disability and poverty are crystal clear, and we must do all that we can to break them. It is hard enough for people who provide care for more than 35 hours a week to continue their education, without having to worry about financial arrangements. If women are being put off education because they cannot afford to go to school or university while caring for friends and family, there is little hope of their ever escaping the cycle of poverty.

wrong with them. That is true of their appearance, too. They are judged to be too fat, too thin or too old, but they are never just right. I got involved in the issue of cosmetic surgery some years ago; the trend is of long-running concern to me. A constituent came to me who had had silicone implants, which were all the rage at one time. The silicone implants exploded inside her. They had both ruptured, and she had to have a double mastectomy. As a result of that case and the fact that such implants were fashionable at the time, we set up a group called Survivors of Silicone. I was contacted by many women who had had experiences similar to my constituent&#146;s. When the Labour Government came in 10 years ago, we managed to introduce a regulation to ensure that whenever there was a silicone intervention, people had to register it, so that there was some tracking of those who had had such implants.</p>

Last year alone, 32,453 surgical cosmetic procedures were carried out, compared with just 28,000 the previous year; that represents a 12 per cent. rise in cosmetic operations. Some 91 per cent. of the patients were women, and the rest were men; the trend is growing among men as well. Research from various groups has pointed out some of the dangers. More and more women and men are opting for non-surgical treatments. By the way, if something goes wrong during private cosmetic surgery&#151;and many people still contact me about things that have&#151;the national health service very often has to pick up the problem; unfortunately, the patients cannot get it put right in the private sector.</p>

It is suggested that people can walk in and walk out for such procedures, and that because of that they must be okay and safe. However, most of us know that that is just not right. Things very often go wrong, particularly with laser eye surgery, which has not yet reached perfection. Things go wrong with it and, again, the NHS has to pick up the problem.</p>

They are that there should be an end to self-regulation and that there should be greater enforcement of existing legislation. Self-regulation, I am afraid, does not work and the regulation of the huge growth in cosmetic surgery cannot be done by the industry alone. I hope that our campaign will succeed so that men and women who opt for cosmetic treatments are not fooled into their decision by advertising gimmicks and pushy salespeople, only to regret their decisions after receiving substandard treatments.</p>

 I agree, as I tighten my jacket. The pressures on women to conform to certain shapes, sizes and looks are extraordinary. The Advertising Standards Authority has a real role to play, but I believe that it is not carrying out the role for which it was set up in respect of regulating adverts of the type that appear in magazines and newspapers. There are pages and pages of such adverts. The things that appear in such media put pressure on young women in particular to get a nose job or some other kind of job done, and that should be regulated by the ASA. As the hon.

On the subject of history, I should like to share what I tell constituents is my favourite part of the tour of the House of Commons. It is the marble statue in the approach to Central Lobby. I do not know the background to its subject, but he was clearly deemed to have been worthy of a statue in the House of Commons when Emmeline Pankhurst was not. He  <br>

was, apparently, the second Viscount Falkland, who obviously had some importance. What attracts me to that part of the tour is not the subject of the statue, but the little crack along the sword that he holds; both his hands are clasped on the sword, which goes down to the statue&#146;s marble base.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o106"><a name="80306-0011.htm_para11"><a name="08030641000565">That crack is there because on 27 April 1909, one Marjory Hume, also a suffragette, handcuffed herself to the statue and the only way to remove her was to break the sword. It is my favourite part of the tour because when I stand by the statue, I think about how nearly 100 years ago, a piece of history took place by it.</p>

It is also important for the credibility of this Chamber in the eyes of our constituents. When they turn on the television to watch the goings-on here, as they may occasionally do, it does politics no service when they see such a lack of diversity in the House; that applies not only to gender, but to age, background, ethnicity and many other elements of diversity.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o108"><a name="80306-0011.htm_para13"><a name="08030641000569">It is also important to note that better representation of women changes the issues that are discussed. I highly recommend an excellent book called &#147;Women in Parliament&#148; by Boni Sones and the hon. Member for Luton, South (Margaret Moran), which chronicles interviews with many women MPs. I read it a few months after my election and found it contained a few tips. I also found, pleasingly, that some of the experiences of women elected in 1997 of extreme and awful cases of sexism, even in the Chamber, did not relate to my experience eight years later in 2005. I am pleased that there has been good progress in the House. The book also found that there has been a noticeable change in the issues discussed as a result of having more women in the Chamber.</p>

But time is limited for the debate and it is impossible for me to cover everything. If more speakers can contribute, it will make for more interesting debate. I intend to confine my remarks to a few areas that particularly affect women; equal pay, violence against women, pensions, the international dimension and women&#146;s representation.</p>

 The hon. Lady is absolutely right; the project is an excellent one that deserves support and its website is www.wpradio.co.uk. I would certainly encourage hon. Members to become involved with that excellent project.</p>

It is simply shocking that, more than 30 years after the equal pay and the sex discrimination legislation, we still have a significant pay gap between men and women&#151;17 per cent. of the mean average for full-time workers and as high as 35 per cent. among part-time workers. That latter figure is particularly worrying because so many more women as a percentage work part-time than men.</p>

In the year to 1 April 2007, some 130,000 claims were made under the legislation. Before it was wound up, the Equal Opportunities Commission pointed out the great problems that it had and the time taken for cases to be heard, an understandable delay given their volume. Effectively, the legislation is not managing to tackle the issue.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o112"><a name="80306-0011.htm_para17"><a name="08030641000575">Pay audits are a good, proactive way of dealing with the pay gap and are now common practice in the public sector. I would like that arrangement to be extended to the private sector. We have the gender equality duty but we should require private companies to undertake pay audits and, as a quid pro quo, say to them that if problems are uncovered during the audit, claims cannot be made against them as long as they put right those problems.</p>

 I agree with the hon. Lady on mandatory pay audits. She mentioned the number of equal pay claims that are currently being brought, many of them by the public sector.

fit. Currently, it could be said that fathers get quite a raw deal, in getting only a short period of paternal leave, and that helps to reinforce discrimination against women. An employer interviewing a woman of child-bearing age might perhaps wonder whether this person, whom they might employ, will end up taking maternity leave, but would not necessarily think the same about a man. By sharing the parental leave, more choice would be given to parents about managing child care, and it would help to tackle some of the indirect discrimination that is difficult to prove and to deal with through legislation.</p>

 There is broad agreement in the House about equalising pay, but I want to mention one of the things that shocked the Select Committee when we looked at the findings of the Women and Work Commission. The commission studied women graduates and compared them with male graduates five years&#146; out of university. One would have thought that there was a reasonable expectation that the pay gap would not even exist there, let alone be very big, but it was still 15 per cent.

 As the hon.

It is &#147;Be a good girl,&#148; but &#147;Boys will be boys.&#148; There is an in-built discrimination of which, to a certain extent, we are all guilty. Partly this could be addressed through education, which is why pay audits and the requirement on companies to be proactive in that respect is so important.</p>

Businesses need to be able to make decisions based on business reasons, but why should not everybody have the right to request, not demand, flexible working? If everybody had that right, we might start to change the working culture. That can be in the interests of business; if one member of staff wants to start and leave early and another wants to start and leave later, a customer-facing business might be able to open for longer.</p>

The shocking statistic that almost half of all women in the UK will, at some point in their lives, face domestic violence, sexual assault or stalking is frankly unacceptable. In the past few years, much progress has been made to counter such violence, and the Labour Government have introduced specialist domestic violence courts, sexual assault referral centres and so on to deal with certain aspects of it.

found that one third of local authorities have no specialist violence against women services. Rape crisis centres are closing in increasing numbers; surely we need to be going in the other direction.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o116"><a name="80306-0011.htm_para21"><a name="08030641000587">The recent report &#147;Map of Gaps&#148; highlighted Scotland as a good example to be followed, as Scotland had ring-fenced the funding for support for women&#146;s services. As a Scottish MP, I was particularly pleased to read about that. That is why it is with great disappointment that I have to inform the House that the recently elected Scottish National party Government in Holyrood have reversed that pioneering and forward-thinking move and, in the recent local funding round, have ceased ring-fencing the money for women&#146;s aid services and for work to counter violence against women. The money will now be rolled up into the general local government settlement. When budgets come under pressure, I have a fear that some of those services for women will be cut.</p>

 There is no guarantee. When the funding was ring-fenced, it had to be spent on those services. It will now be subject to decision making and there is great pressure on local authority funding in Scotland. Councils must make difficult decisions because they have effectively been blackmailed into providing a zero per cent. council tax rise.

We need to recognise that violence against women is not just about the often excellent Department responsible for women and equality matters. It is not just about the health service providing support when women have been victims of violence, or the justice system dealing with such cases. It is not just about safe transport for women or education to prevent such violence. All the relevant Departments need to work together.</p>

I asked him if he would commit to developing an integrated strategy. I was somewhat disappointed by his answer, which related solely to victims of domestic violence. The point that I was making was that violence against women is much wider than just domestic violence. The Government were given one out of 10 in the first year by the coalition in its report on those services, and two out of 10 the following year. I hope that there will be continued progress.</p>

Members have already signed. The conviction rate for rape, as we all know, is appallingly low&#151;around 5 per cent., which is down from 33 per cent. in the 1970s. That is not the conviction rate for cases that get to court. More than four out of five cases do not get to court, so the problem is not necessarily at the jury stage. The difficulty tends to arise at an earlier stage, with cases being dropped because insufficient evidence has been collected.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o122"><a name="80306-0012.htm_para3"><a name="08030641000597">I know that the Government have been consulting on the issue, which is to be welcomed. We need to know how we can improve criminal practices to ensure that more cases get to court and are successful, but it also important that the support services receive stable funding. That can be an important factor in determining whether a woman will pursue a case, decide to drop it or not report it at all.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o123"><a name="80306-0012.htm_para4"><a name="08030641000598">We need to address the myths about rape. There have been some shocking reports about the perception out there. In 2005, an ICM poll found that a third of British people thought that in some circumstances a woman could be held partly responsible if she was raped. That must be scotched. It is not a woman&#146;s fault if she is raped. It is not her fault if she has been drinking. It is not her fault depending on what she is wearing. If somebody was murdered or mugged, we would not say that it was their fault because of the way they had acted, and we should not say that in the case of rape.</p>

A recent Amnesty study showed that 40 per cent. of young people know girls whose boyfriends have coerced or pressurised them into sex. In one sense, that is shocking, but it is not all that surprising when one considers the education that is currently provided and the different views about sex that are allowed to develop between boys and girls. We must tackle the matter from an education point of view so that it is clear what is and is not acceptable behaviour.</p>

However, the way that changes are being introduced means that there will be a cliff edge where the difference in entitlement between women who are eligible after 6 April 2010 and women who are not eligible the day before will be &#163;27,000 over their lifetime.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o128"><a name="80306-0012.htm_para9"><a name="08030641000603">The Government should have considered introducing the new scheme in a more staggered way to avoid such a cliff edge. They should also consider a citizen&#146;s pension. It will still be a requirement to have 30 years of national insurance contributions for a full pension. Even with that change from 39 years, some women will still not achieve a full pension because of their caring responsibilities. That needs to be taken into account.</p>

Friend the Member for Northavon (Steve Webb) has drawn attention to the problem of women who have gaps in their contribution record, which they could pay to have filled. There was a six-year period when the Government did not inform women that that was possible. Women can do that retrospectively and in some cases be eligible for a lump sum of a couple of thousand pounds or more, plus an enhanced pension going forward. I have tried to raise awareness of the matter in my constituency and help women in individual cases, but the Government should take responsibility for being proactive and making sure that women get what is rightfully theirs.</p>

There are countries where female infanticide is common. As has been mentioned, 2 million girls every year go through the appalling practice of female genital mutilation. Rape is used as a weapon of terror. We saw that in Rwanda, yet the same is happening again in Darfur. Women are oppressed in societies and countries across the world, unable to access education and denied equal rights in judicial procedures. Poverty tends to hit women the hardest.

There are 126 women Members of Parliament at the moment&#151;fewer than one in five&#151;which is clearly not enough. The figures are slightly better in some of the other authorities and Parliaments. A third of the Members in the Scottish Parliament are women, but I am sad to say that that is a decrease from 40 per cent. previously. The Welsh Assembly has an excellent record, with 47 per cent. of its Members being women&#151;I congratulate the Assembly on achieving that. In the European Parliament, 31 per cent. of Members are women. Although representation in local authorities is better than it is in this House, with 29 per cent. of councillors being women&#151;and I am delighted that the Liberal Democrats have the highest percentage of women councillors, at 32 per cent.&#151; we have no reason to be complacent.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o133"><a name="80306-0012.htm_para14"><a name="08030641000608">Sometimes in meetings, I have raised that problem, and men will turn round and go, &#147;Oh, a third are women. That&#146;s quite good.&#148; And I say, &#147;Hang on a second&#151;it might be quite good compared to the really awful representation in other areas, but there is no way that a third of representatives being women is good.&#148; We can probably say that a figure of 47 per cent. is quite good&#151;it is not always going to be exactly 50:50&#151;but we cannot be complacent about a proportion such as a third. The Labour Benches are made up of many more women, and I hope that there is no complacency there, because even on their Benches, there is still a long way to go.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o134"><a name="80306-0012.htm_para15"><a name="08030641000609">We need to look at the variety of reasons why representation is so low. Is sexism the reason? It probably is partly sexism, but I do not think that it is the only one. The reason is less likely to be sexism now that it was 30 years ago. We certainly know that the electorate are no less likely to vote for a woman. In fact, I have seen research showing that not only does turnout go up when women stand, but that women are marginally more likely to be elected than men&#151;so it is an advantage to have women candidates. If the electorate are no longer sexist, it would be slightly strange to suggest that political parties have a higher degree of sexism. Although sexism is probably still a factor in some cases, it is not the only one.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o135"><a name="80306-0012.htm_para16"><a name="08030641000610">Is it a matter of lifestyle? Is it that women look at us debating until 11 o&#146;clock&#151;on at least two nights so far this week&#151;and at the sometimes strange procedures and practices of this House, and say, perhaps entirely sensibly, &#147;Hang on a second, that&#146;s not for me. I can make an impact in another career in business or in one of the professions, or through working in my local community.&#148; I suspect that that sentiment has a role to play. However, it would not explain the low percentage of councillors. Combining the lifestyle of a councillor with the other sensible things that one might want to do is easier than combining them with the lifestyle of a Member of Parliament, which involves two lives and two homes.</p>

involved in politics leads to additional costs. Like it or not, as the right hon. Member for Cynon Valley said, women get judged on their appearances more, so there are wardrobe costs. There are certainly child care costs. But there is also the cost of going to party conferences and accommodation, and the little things that happen all the time when one is a candidate, such as taking volunteers out for a drink after a hard day&#146;s work. A lot of incidental costs are involved, and because there is a pay gap, the financial implications are even worse for women.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o137"><a name="80306-0012.htm_para18"><a name="08030641000612">Another real problem is confidence. One of my favourite things about the job is speaking to school groups. Rather than being deferential, they will always tell it exactly like it is, and they are inquisitive and enthusiastic. I have noticed with interest that when I meet a school group and ask for questions, nine times out of 10 the first question is from one of the boys, and very often the second question is, too. There have even been occasions when I have had to turn to the class and say, &#147;Come on girls, you must be thinking interesting things, too. Why don&#146;t you put your hands up?&#148; And then, fair enough, some of them do. I have noticed that; I do not know whether other women, or male Members, in the Chamber have done so.</p>

No, I might look stupid.&#148; I have a sort of internal conversation, and decide that it is safer not to put my hand up, or not to contribute. Then, of course, some bloke says the same thing far less eloquently, and everyone lauds them for it. It is only through making myself speak, and through others helping me to have the confidence to do it, that I got to a position where I felt happy to stand for Parliament. I did not wake up one morning and think, &#147;I want to be an MP&#148;&#151;other people suggested the idea to me.</p>

sunset clause in the Sex Discrimination (Election Candidates) Act 2002 till 2030 or until the issue is no longer a problem. Parties should have the opportunity to use that as a tool to tackle the problem, but it is not the only tool. If the problem is sexism in the selection process, I can think of few other things that would change the outcome. However, if that is not the main problem, all-women shortlists are not necessarily the right solution.</p>

We examined the figures, did the research and found that women were as likely to get selected in seats&#151;winnable and otherwise&#151;as men, but five times as many men came forward as candidates. When working with such numbers, ending up with a gender balance would be a statistical anomaly.</p>

 That may well have been the case in the Labour party. I have not conducted research on the Labour party, only on my party. We found that, when shortlists were half men and half women, men won half the time and women won half the time. I will not say that there was never an instance of sexism, or that a sexist comment was never made, in Liberal Democrat selection contests, although in my experience, for everyone who said, &#147;What would you do if you had children?&#148; or, &#147;Are you sure you can do this?&#148; someone else said, &#147;It&#146;s great to have more women in Parliament and I&#146;ll vote for you because of that.&#148; Things can even out, but I cannot speak for other parties&#151;obviously, I do not know their internal procedures and cultures as well as those of mine.</p>

Our approach is to encourage more women to become candidates, and we have good support mechanisms to help them with that and to get selected. Given that we still have many more male than female candidates, we must ensure that those women punch above their weight and are more likely to get selected. We undertake intensive mentoring and training.

what Baroness Thatcher did in office&#151;I am also speaking as a Scot, and I do not believe that she was necessarily good for the country&#151;but I can still acknowledge that important achievement, which deserves to be recognised, as do many achievements more recently by Labour women. They include the first woman Speaker, Baroness Boothroyd, the first woman Foreign Secretary, who is still a Member of Parliament, and the first female Home Secretary. As was mentioned earlier, we now have the first female Serjeant at Arms&#151;I was delighted when that appointment was made, and it is a shame that she is not here today.</p>

Members present who want to make contributions and I am keen to hear them. We have made a lot of progress, but there is still so much more to do. One problem is that although we have debates and discussions about equality, I suspect that we can sometimes put women off. There is a feeling out there that this place is an old boys&#146; club that is full of sexism and that the job is really difficult for women, but a lot of that is not true. Women Members in all parts of the House will say that being an MP is a wonderful job and very suited to the skill sets of women. It is not all about standing up and making speeches. So much of the job is about listening, dealing with constituents&#146; problems and finding ways to work with those from different parties or other agencies in our constituencies to find solutions, and even in this place there is nothing like the sexism that there used to be. Indeed, this job is very enjoyable.</p>

For me, one of the most moving things is to see women in my community being empowered through programmes such as Sure Start. There are women who have not been out of their houses and who have not had much guidance and help from their families, but I have seen them blossom into people who are able to become representatives within the Sure Start movement and set up groups by themselves. I have seen them learn to cook and pass that skill on to younger mothers. We should be encouraging all that. It is easy to talk about the notable women, but we must be there to ensure that this kind of work is happening as well.

Now, however, we have breastfeeding mentors to encourage new mums to take up breastfeeding. We have the equipment to do it&#151;and I am very pleased that we do&#151;yet we used to discourage it. Now we are giving women the power to encourage it and to increase the numbers of breastfeeding mums. The result will be that our children will be healthier, slimmer and more intelligent.

 I am glad to be able to begin by agreeing entirely with the final remarks of the hon. Member for Crawley (Laura Moffatt). We are very privileged women&#151;indeed, very privileged people&#151;in the western world in terms of the freedoms and the standard of living that we and our families enjoy. We are also privileged people to be elected to this House, so I am very pleased to have this opportunity to mark international women&#146;s day. It is the international aspects of today&#146;s celebration that matter almost more than anything else. It is our duty and responsibility to give moral support and solidarity to women&#151;and, indeed, men&#151;throughout the world who are fighting to make all countries fairer and more equal places for people to live in.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o162"><a name="80306-0013.htm_para12"><a name="08030641000649">I happily acknowledge the enormous efforts made by women and men on all sides of the House&#151;unlike the hon. Member for Crawley, who originally said that she was very pleased about what the &#147;sisters&#148; on the Labour Benches are doing. I acknowledge what they are doing, but I also acknowledge what everyone throughout the House and throughout our democratic system is doing to make our country&#151;and therefore other places where we can exert influence&#151;a more equal and fair society. It is good that we are having this debate today.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o163"><a name="80306-0013.htm_para13"><a name="08030641000650">I always insist that there is no such thing as a women&#146;s issue. For generations, indeed centuries, men managed to sideline topics with which they did not particularly want to deal, saying &#147;Oh, that&#146;s a women&#146;s issue; we will appoint so-and-so to deal with it.&#148; That applied particularly to such matters as health, child care and families. Those are not women&#146;s issues&#151;they are everyone&#146;s issues, but men and women often approach things from slightly different directions. I think it is time we had the courage to stand up and dare to say that women do things differently from men.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o164"><a name="80306-0013.htm_para14"><a name="08030641000651">I am sure that every woman in the Chamber will at some time have had the experience of being the only woman at a meeting or in an organisation. As the hon. Member for East Dunbartonshire (Jo Swinson) explained very graphically, a woman may make a point differently from the way in which it has been made by all the men, and then all the men will sigh in a man-like way because the woman used slightly different language or a slightly different tone of voice. I hope we are reaching a stage where there is less of that, possibly because of the increased representation of women.</p>

 I wonder whether, in those circumstances, the hon. Lady finds that the gentlemen eventually get around to seeing the point.</p>

 I do. On some occasions the realisation is more immediate than it is on others.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o165"><a name="80306-0013.htm_para15"><a name="08030641000654">I agree with much of what has been said today. For nearly 11 years I have been saying things&#151;as have many of my colleagues, especially my right hon. Friend the Member for Maidenhead (Mrs. May)&#151;and only now are we beginning to be listened to. Better late than never, though, and it is because we have the courage of our convictions that we keep going and will achieve what we set out to do.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o166"><a name="80306-0013.htm_para16"><a name="08030641000655">I want to put one thing on record. On occasions such as this Lady Thatcher is always mentioned, with great affection and respect by Conservative Members and in different terms by Labour Members&#151;although I must say that the right hon. Member for Cynon Valley (Ann Clwyd) was generous in pointing out that the Thatcher Government did achieve some things for women. I will always argue that the fact that Lady Thatcher and her Government turned around the country&#146;s fortunes in the 1980s inevitably benefited the 52 per cent. of the population who are women just as much as it benefited the rest of the country.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o167"><a name="80306-0013.htm_para17"><a name="08030641000656">I have already mentioned the expansion of educational opportunities.

men who have had a good education. If we do not get education right, we can never achieve the equality that we all want. The hon. Member for Slough (Fiona Mactaggart) is shaking her head. She cannot possibly disagree with my view that education is the most important tool that can be given to anyone, male or female, to help them contribute to the society that we all want to build.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o168"><a name="80306-0013.htm_para18"><a name="08030641000657">The main thing that Margaret Thatcher did, of course, was to be there. She was Prime Minister, and therefore no one can say that a woman cannot be elected to Parliament and cannot be a successful and effective Member of Parliament.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o169"><a name="80306-0013.htm_para19"><a name="08030641000658">Last week, I was fortunate enough to be the Inter-Parliamentary Union delegate to the United Nations Commission on the Status of Women in New York. I was sent there with the right hon. Member for North-West Durham (Hilary Armstrong), and we attended the meeting for IPU representatives. It was an important meeting, and it is a very important commission. It has been taking place for some 52 years. I felt honoured to take part, representing the UK Parliament along with the right hon. Lady. It was extremely important to be there.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o170"><a name="80306-0013.htm_para20"><a name="08030641000659">We in the United Kingdom are in a privileged and important position; I am not being complacent in saying that, as I accept that there is a lot of work yet to do for women in our country, Europe and the wider western world. However, when one attends such a UN meeting and looks around what is an enormous chamber&#151;possibly somewhat bigger than this Chamber&#151;filled with people, mostly women, from countries all over the world, one realises what a fortunate position we are in, because many of the battles have been won here. Some Members have already referred to the work of the suffragettes and the fact that we are celebrating 80 years of women&#146;s suffrage. Many countries throughout the world that were represented are far behind our position, as is universally known. I had an opportunity to discuss that with their representatives last week. In attending meetings such as the commission, we can make the important contribution of offering moral support and solidarity to those who still have so much to fight for in their countries.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o171"><a name="80306-0013.htm_para21"><a name="08030641000660">There were two main themes to the conference: increasing the representation of women and gender budgeting. We have discussed the first of those themes at length and I shall not reiterate the points that have already been made, but something struck me as ironic. Inside the UN building there was much talk of the importance of increasing the representation of women, and many people said&#151;I think, sadly, somewhat naively&#151;&#147;If only we had more women in our Parliament, we could change this and change that, and make such a difference.&#148; Meanwhile, outside in the rest of America there are people raising money&#151;$34 million in February alone&#151;to pay for advertisements to try to prevent Hillary Clinton from becoming President of the United States of America. If we were to follow the representation argument to its logical conclusion, merely having Hillary Clinton, a woman, as President of the USA&#151;and, therefore, arguably the most important person in the world&#151;would solve many of the ills of the world. I am afraid that I would argue that having Hillary Clinton as President of the  <br>

USA would cause more problems than it would solve, not only for America but for its position in the rest of the world. I will not go into that in any greater detail, but it is somewhat ironic that those two major debates were going on at the same time.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o172"><a name="80306-0013.htm_para22"><a name="08030641000661">What bothers me far more, however, is the representation of women in this House of Commons. I absolutely agree with much of what the hon. Member for East Dunbartonshire said about it being our duty to go out and be evangelical about encouraging other women to enter the House of Commons. Many of us in the Conservative party are doing that; we are encouraging women to stand for election, and to become involved in politics not only at local level, where we have many good women, and not just in other organisations, but here in Parliament itself.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o173"><a name="80306-0013.htm_para23"><a name="08030641000662">I hope, however, that the Minister for Women and Equality, who is also Leader of the House, will take account of the following point. If we are to encourage more women with children, and men with family responsibilities and who come from different sorts of backgrounds, to enter this House and be devoted as full-time Members, taking care of their constituency duties, their duties to this House, and their duties to their families, we must give them the financial wherewithal and the practical support to be able to balance all of those duties.</p>

 I am listening with interest and respect to my hon. Friend&#146;s speech. In the light of what she has said, does she share my frustration and disappointment that, notwithstanding the commentary on the subject over at least the past decade, this House still has not got a properly functioning crèche for the benefit of Members and, importantly, of staff?</p>

<p><a name="st_o439"><a name="08030641000664"><a name="80306-0013.htm_spnew7"><a name="08030641001523"><b>Mrs. Laing:</b>
 Yes. As ever, my hon. Friend makes an extremely good point. Crèche facilities are part of it, but this is about the whole attitude towards Members of Parliament, and not only women Members. Let us be practical and honest about family responsibilities. The burden of caring for family, whether it be children, elderly relatives or someone who is sick, falls far more often on women than men. I do not like to personalise things, but I feel duty bound to use myself as an example in this case, because I am the example I know best. Two thirds of my net salary as a Member of Parliament is spent on child care costs. People say, &#147;Can&#146;t you get grandparents to help? Where is your husband? Haven&#146;t you got a sister?&#148;. Such questions are nonsense. I am divorced from my husband. It is no wonder that he did not want to spend every weekend doing constituency duties, as I was happy to do. There was no reason why he should have wanted to go to coffee mornings every Saturday&#151;I do not blame him.</p>

 My hon. Friend says that his wife does not want to go to them, and I do not blame her either.

and father both died, and my brother lives abroad, but in any case why should one seek voluntary family help to carry out one&#146;s duties properly?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o174"><a name="80306-0013.htm_para24"><a name="08030641000667">People never consider what happens every time this House sits past 6 pm. I am very much in favour of this House sitting all the hours there are, because it is only by using time that Members of Parliament can hold the Government to account. I am happy to be here until midnight, but not many Members of this House and not many members of the Executive have to consider how much it costs per hour to pay someone to look after one&#146;s child while one is undertaking parliamentary duties.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o175"><a name="80306-0013.htm_para25"><a name="08030641000668">Dare I say it, but members of the press and media have no idea what they are talking about when they criticise Members of Parliament for being overpaid or for using their allowances one way or another. They have no idea what it costs to keep two houses, look after a family and be diligent in all one&#146;s duties in these different areas of life.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o176"><a name="80306-0013.htm_para26"><a name="08030641000669">We must consider what would happen if we gave in and said that we would not fund Members of Parliament properly for carrying out their work and duties owing to a press campaign that arose because a small minority&#151;a very small percentage&#151;of Members of Parliament did not behave responsibly as far as finances were concerned. Many of us have worked hard over the years to bring more women, more people from ethnic minorities, and more people who are not professional people or lawyers&#151;I am a lawyer; that is the downside&#151;into Parliament. We have worked to bring a much more varied group of people into Parliament to make it truly representative of the people of Britain. That cannot be done unless things are properly resourced. I sincerely hope that the Minister for Women and Equality will take my remarks seriously when she considers the part of this debate for which she has not been present.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o177"><a name="80306-0013.htm_para27"><a name="08030641000670">The conclusion of the IPU meeting was a very good one. It was that increasing the representation of women is important in bringing about the better conditions for women that we are all seeking, but the economic power of women is far more important. We all know that an increase in women&#146;s economic power is what will actually make a difference in the long run. That is why flexibility in employment is so important, so that women can earn a living, stand up for themselves and use their voice, and so that they do not have to be dependent.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o178"><a name="80306-0013.htm_para28"><a name="08030641000671">The second part of the IPU meeting was about gender budgeting, which is a very good idea and I hope that the Government will consider it. Gender budgeting means that legislation is assessed in terms of its gender impact, just as we have always considered the economic aspect and now look much more carefully at the environmental impact. I suggest that to the Government as a good idea.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o179"><a name="80306-0013.htm_para29"><a name="08030641000672">I do not wish to take any more of the House&#146;s time as many hon. Members wish to speak. I apologise in advance if I cannot be here for the end of the debate. I have mothering duties to undertake, and one small six-year-old simply does not understand why I have to be here for such long hours this week. I would rather be answerable to him than to the Government or my Whips.</p>

 I welcome the fact that this debate is taking place in this Chamber today. On previous occasions, it has not always been possible to have the international women&#146;s day debate in the Chamber, and it is a sign of the progress that has been made and the impact that the Leader of the House has had that we are having it here today. We should all welcome that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o180"><a name="80306-0014.htm_para0"><a name="08030641000674">I shall be brief, because several hon. Ladies wish to contribute. I do not consider it discriminatory to say that, because international women&#146;s day is about women. It is about the struggles of women and it is a celebration of women&#146;s role. We have the debate in recognition of the fact that women have faced historic and unprecedented discrimination.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o181"><a name="80306-0014.htm_para1"><a name="08030641000675">International women&#146;s day emerged from two movements. The first was the suffrage movement, which campaigned for women to have a vote and a say in how society was run. The second was made up of campaigns against the exploitation of women in the workplace. The history of international women&#146;s day shows that the two were strongly linked. The first record we can find is of New York women workers in the textile and clothing industry who demonstrated about their low wages and poor working conditions  on 8 March 1857. Fifty years later, in 1907, a demonstration was held in New York to commemorate the 1857 demonstration and to call for votes for women and an end to child labour and workshops. It was the movements around May day, in support of votes for women and against exploitation of women in the work force that led to 8 March being regarded as the day on which to celebrate what women were achieving, to recognise their struggles, and to act as a focus on what women wanted to change. Many men played a significant role in many of the victories that women achieved, but on international women&#146;s day it is fitting that we celebrate the women who put so much into fighting not only for themselves but for their sisters.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o182"><a name="80306-0014.htm_para2"><a name="08030641000676">I welcome the fact that the debate is being held in the Chamber. We have discussed women&#146;s representation in the Chamber, and many Labour Members spoke of the significant advances in women&#146;s representation in the Labour party over recent years. We remember the hugely important events of 1997, when so many women were elected here. The Labour party is justly proud of the fact that in the Scottish Parliament it has always had 50 per cent. representation of women, and it is right that all parties discuss how we ensure the better representation of women. The Labour party in Scotland adopted positive discrimination, women-only shortlists and the twinning of constituencies, whereby some seats were women&#146;s seats. It recognised it had to do something&#151;the other methods that had been tried and for which women had campaigned over so many years had not succeeded.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o183"><a name="80306-0014.htm_para3"><a name="08030641000677">I was selected on an open shortlist, but the Labour party organises itself to ensure that women enjoy parity on shortlists, and the transferable vote system encourages women who are coming through the process. It is important that we talk about that and about getting more women into this building, but it is even more important that we talk about what women must do to ensure that they have a full say over every aspect of their lives and are represented in every walk  <br>

of life. That is not about women being different or the same, but about women being human beings and having a full say over the way in which they live.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o184"><a name="80306-0014.htm_para4"><a name="08030641000678">We in Britain are very lucky. We have heard much today about the problems that women still face in Britain, and I agree with what has been said about pay inequality, discrimination in the workplace and the lack of child care not only for Members of Parliament but for women throughout the country, which affects so many women&#146;s lives and their opportunities. Women play a massive role in Britain and are often at the forefront of community organisations, fighting for their communities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o185"><a name="80306-0014.htm_para5"><a name="08030641000679">On international women&#146;s day we must celebrate what women have achieved and acknowledge that there is still a long way to go. We must also say that what we in Britain have achieved is what we expect in every country. We are all aware of the discrimination that women still experience and of the fact that they still do not play the full role in society that they should, but when we look around the world we see that we are lucky in the choices that we have. In Saudi Arabia, for example, women have so few rights and hardly any voice. They are not allowed to walk unaccompanied on the street, to drive a car or to join many professions, so it is easy to see that we in this country have come a long way.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o186"><a name="80306-0014.htm_para6"><a name="08030641000680">International women&#146;s day is about not only celebration but struggle and protest, which is how it came about and why in 1975 the United Nations decided to make it a day to be recognised throughout the world. Today, we should be saying that women should have a far stronger role in the world and a far stronger voice. If we achieve that, the benefit will be felt by not only women but humanity and the world will be more civilised.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o187"><a name="80306-0014.htm_para7"><a name="08030641000681">I hope that next year a debate on these issues will again be held in this Chamber, enabling all Members to raise their voices about why we must ensure that women secure more victories.</p>

 This debate has reaffirmed the fact that gender equality is still relevant and important throughout the country. It is a pleasure to follow the hon. Member for North Ayrshire and Arran (Ms Clark), and I wish to pick up her point about the central role that women play in many community organisations. I am sure that that is the case in her constituency, as it is in mine, so I am perplexed that it does not translate to more women wanting to stand for Parliament. I shall touch on that point later.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o188"><a name="80306-0014.htm_para8"><a name="08030641000683">There have been many good contributions to the debate. The hon.

Conservative women inspired me to be here today&#151;my noble Friend Baroness Thatcher. We might disagree about what she contributed to this country, but I believe that she contributed hugely to the success that we continue to enjoy in some ways. She certainly served as a role model to me in respect of what women can achieve, and we should not forget that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o190"><a name="80306-0014.htm_para10"><a name="08030641000685">This debate is still highly relevant, perhaps because one in three women in our country still feel that there is a long way to go on gender equality. I would never suggest that there is a sense of complacency about it on either side of the House, but we should not forget that a huge number of women still feel that there is much more to do. Parliament has a vital role to play in making women feel that there is working equality. Parliament&#146;s authority and legitimacy is based on representing the nation as it is today, not as it was in the past, so having more women in the House is an important challenge that we should all take on.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o191"><a name="80306-0014.htm_para11"><a name="08030641000686">As my hon. Friend the Member for Epping Forest (Mrs. Laing) said, women and men have different priorities. A stronger, more resilient voice for women in the House of Commons means that women throughout the country can feel that matters of importance to them are being addressed. We do not suffer alone from the under-representation of women in political life. Again, my hon. Friend mentioned that point. I have examined some work by the World Economic Forum, which speaks of a &#147;political power gap&#148; in the ratio of men and women in Parliaments and in Ministerial positions. We have made great progress in this country, and more women are in Parliament, but we still suffer from what the WEF calls an 86 per cent. political power gap, because of the lack of women that we still have in the House. I am not sure whether I find it reassuring that even countries such as Sweden, Norway and Finland, which we hold up all too often as the epitome of what we should be aiming for, still suffer a 50 per cent. power gap according to the WEF. Many women who are elected do not go on to have powerful and influential positions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o192"><a name="80306-0014.htm_para12"><a name="08030641000687">I am concerned that we have bypassed some of the fundamental reasons why there are not more women sitting in Parliament. Before I turn to those reasons, we should try to understand why such a large proportion of women feel that we have not gone far enough towards gender equality. Hon. Members have already cited many of the pressing problems that predominantly affect women in this country today. Women in part-time work&#151;the type of work that most often fits in with family life and caring responsibilities&#151;face a gender pay gap that continues at almost 40 per cent. It is little wonder that in the past year alone 28,000 sex discrimination cases have gone to an employment tribunal. That figure, which has doubled in the past 12 months, is unacceptable. We have to look for ways to ensure that women throughout the country have access to good-quality part-time work. Many businesses have already seen the strong business case for that, but there has been a failure to deliver in too many areas.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o193"><a name="80306-0014.htm_para13"><a name="08030641000688">Others have spoken about flexible working. We have made some progress on that, and it is heartening to hear Ministers say that there is interest in extending the right to flexible working to those with older children, although I share the concern voiced by my right hon.  <br>

Friend the Member for Maidenhead (Mrs. May) that mixed messages seem to be emerging from the Government on that point.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o194"><a name="80306-0014.htm_para14"><a name="08030641000689">Looking at health matters, particularly the treatment of cancer, we find that only three in 10 women aged between 50 and 70 receive breast cancer screening every three years, despite Government policy on that, and the position has worsened since 2001. Staffing levels in maternity services and wards are causing women considerable concern, but are not being dealt with in a way that many women feel is appropriate. We have also touched on the subjects of women in prison, domestic violence, and problems such as the number of reported rapes increasing while cuts are being made to funding for rape crisis centres. Those are many of the reasons why many women feel that the matter of equality has been incompletely addressed by our legislative body.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o195"><a name="80306-0014.htm_para15"><a name="08030641000690">Nobody who has spoken today advocates sticking with the status quo and not finding new ways to increase female representation in this place. My right hon. Friend the Member for Maidenhead outlined some of the excellent measures that our party has established, and all the other parties have tackled the issue in ways that are appropriate for them, but I am concerned that we may be dealing with the symptoms rather than the cause.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o196"><a name="80306-0014.htm_para16"><a name="08030641000691">There was a great influx of women to Parliament in 1997 as a result of the Labour party&#146;s change in its selection criteria, but I was worried to see some figures the Library produced for me on men and women&#146;s average length of service as MPs. In the decade and a half to 2005, the average length of service for women declined from 13.7 years to 11.5 years. That is at odds with the situation for men, whose average length of service remains about 17 years. We should be concerned about the fact that although more women are coming into Parliament, they are not staying as long as men. To pick up on the comments made by the right hon. Member for Cynon Valley (Ann Clwyd), we need to make sure that age and experience are valued. Parliament benefits from the continuing contributions of those who have been here for several years. When considering how this place operates, we should see whether that problem can be tackled.</p>

 Does the hon. Lady agree that the reason for that phenomenon may be that, generally, in the Labour party, women have been selected in marginal seats? If the Conservative party intends to focus only on marginal seats, the women elected may also not last.

On the contrary, we have a number of excellent women candidates in seats now held by Conservative MPs who I am sure will join us here in the Commons after the next election. However, I understand how that is a problem. Unfortunately, it will probably be a problem for her party after the next election.</p>

 I thank the hon. Lady for her intervention. We do not place candidates in seats; they are selected for seats. It is difficult for anybody to say what a safe seat is.

Many women have significant roles in organisations that play a part in supporting our many different communities, but what perception do those women have of the House of Commons? Why are they not choosing it as a way of putting themselves forward? The House needs to give a little more consideration to that issue. Many other organisations have had to deal with the issue of how they get more women to put themselves forward for jobs.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o198"><a name="80306-0014.htm_para18"><a name="08030641000699">I recently took a look at the medical profession, which was long the domain of men. One could say that there are parallels between the challenges dealt with by women entering medicine and those dealt with by women coming to the House of Commons. In 1963, just 29 per cent. of students applying for medical school were women, but today the figure is two thirds. Indeed, some predict that women will become the dominant force in the medical profession by 2012. That is because the profession has changed the selection process to decrease discrimination against women, and has looked at increasing the number of women applicants. It has also looked into making changes to medicine as a career for women. The change is particularly acute in the general practitioner sector. In 2005, 40 per cent. of GPs were women, compared with 29 per cent. in 1995. The House will be interested to know that the percentage of practitioners working part time has more than doubled in the past 10 years, and  <br>

 Is the hon. Lady aware that until the 1950s and 1960s, many universities had quotas for the maximum number of women whom they would accept as entrants to the medical profession, and does she agree that we have come a tremendous way?</p>

 I would probably be straying too far from the subject of today&#146;s debate if I went into the details of that point, but the hon. Lady raises an important issue. We should understand the important role that women can play in professions such as medicine, and try to tackle the barriers that have stopped women from entering such professions. We could use what we learn from that to encourage more women to enter the House of Commons.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o199"><a name="80306-0014.htm_para19"><a name="08030641000704">I do not mean to underestimate what the Modernisation Committee has already done in trying to identify ways of attracting a broader cross-section of people to the House. Importantly, some of its suggestions have focused on the need to improve the running of this place rather than on the convenience of Members of Parliament. However, as my right hon. Friend the Member for Maidenhead said, having more women in this place will make it more effective and, importantly, more representative of the country as a whole.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o200"><a name="80306-0014.htm_para20"><a name="08030641000705">However, perhaps we should not consider only changes to working hours and holidays when thinking about how to modernise the House. Such changes have made up more or less the bulk of the reforms, but we could do far more important things to send out strong messages to women that they should consider politics as a career. What more can be done to attract women to the House? The issue is not only about changing the working hours or the trappings of Parliament; we need to understand how we can change the culture&#151;or perceived culture&#151;of this place, so that it is more attractive to women.</p>

I was disappointed by the right hon. and learned Lady&#146;s contribution. I hope that, on reflection, she decides that a different approach would be appropriate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o202"><a name="80306-0014.htm_para22"><a name="08030641000707">Let us be honest: this place has not caught up with how people expect Parliament to conduct itself today. There is an enormous opportunity for the House to consider that point, particularly in the light of current considerations about pay, pensions and how we present payments for our offices and staff.

We should make sure that we talk about costs, not expenses&#151;the cost of employing staff is important; we should not term it an expense.

Despite many years of Conservative government, in only eight years were there more women Conservative MPs than women Labour MPs. I do not say that to be smug; I believe it is partly because of the values of the Labour party that more women have been selected.

It is my judgment that the training programmes for women put on by the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats outshine what my party has been able to do. It is a pity that we have not done more and it is great that they have done that. We should now steal their ideas and do more.</p>

In January 2000, I wrote a paper that said that my analysis of the problem was that because women in Parliament were the exception to the norm, every woman in Parliament carried the burden of representing women as a class of MP. Every time a woman MP made a mistake, everyone said, &#147;They would, wouldn&#146;t they? That is what women MPs are like.&#148; One carried the burden of representing the class of women as MPs.

The equalities Bill creates an opportunity to do something about public appointments, not merely to ensure gender equality, but to think about the qualification for public appointment.

Members on which women&#146;s experience is different from that of men, which is violence. Men are more likely to be victims of violent crime than women, but the way in which women experience violence is quite different. The classic example is domestic violence, where 77 per cent. of the victims are women. On average, those victims have been assaulted 35 times before they report it to the police. Women as victims of domestic violence and of rape, and as victims of violence in other areas, face an accusation that men who are victims never face: &#147;She asked for it.&#148; I am afraid that although things have changed, that attitude is still much too common. I am glad that John Yates pointed out, in an interview published earlier this week in <i> The Guardian</i>, that the culture in the police&#151;the failure to take early evidence and so on&#151;is one of the contributory factors to our lack of success in securing effective levels of rape convictions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o217"><a name="80306-0015.htm_para12"><a name="08030641000731">I strongly urge Ministers to ensure that we get an effective national reporting line for rape. I wonder whether the national telephone number that we use for NHS Direct might be a possible way of dealing with this issue. One of the problems with a local helpline is that most of us would not carry the number around in our pocket, and any woman can be raped. We need a national number that everyone knows about, through which such reporting can be done quickly, and through which women can be supported on the question of whether or not they want to go to the police. Many women are frightened of going to the police in the first place.</p>

I managed to raise the issue in one contribution where I was able to speak for only two minutes, and in another where I managed only 20 seconds.

 Indeed, it is. The police can deal with whether to prosecute. As a result of the prostitution strategy, the police are now targeting men more effectively. It is no longer only the Cleveland police who target kerb crawlers; other police forces do the same, and there is a reduction in, although not an elimination of prosecutions for brothel-keeping when more than one woman who sells herself is in a flat. People realise that that offence is designed to deal with the traffickers and exploiters.</p>

I do not accuse the Women&#146;s Ministers of that&#151;they have been brave and bold. My right hon. and learned Friend the Minister for Women and Equality has been an effective cheerleader in, for example, dealing with newspaper advertisements for women. However, it is shocking that the clauses in the Criminal Justice Bill on getting rid of fines for prostitution have quietly been dropped while clauses that were drafted long after them have been pursued in the other place. I understand that the Bill has to get through to tackle a possible problem in the prisons; nevertheless, we should not allow those matters to slip away.</p>

I worry that, in government, one can fall into the trap of believing that the only way to change things is through new laws. I believe that our Government can change things by changing the way that people view things. It is inconceivable that a student newspaper would do now what the Oxford newspaper did to me. However, it is still conceivable that a jury would believe that a victim of rape asked for it. We will not change that by legislation. We will help to end it by better prosecution, by the work that we are doing with specialist prosecutors, and by dealing with cases better, but the big challenge for any Government is ensuring that we continue to tackle difficult issues that people do not want to discuss. For example, my hon. Friend the Member for Keighley (Mrs. Cryer) talks about forced marriages to people who pretend that they do not exist. We must have the courage to keep banging the drum because if we do not, attitudes will remain the same as they were 90 years ago.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o223"><a name="80306-0015.htm_para18"><a name="08030641000746">In an earlier, wide-ranging and similarly powerful speech, the hon. Member for East Dunbartonshire (Jo Swinson) made the fair point that parties must have the space in which to determine their approach to increasing the number of female Members of Parliament. With that I do not disagree.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o224"><a name="80306-0015.htm_para19"><a name="08030641000747">Nevertheless, I suppose that my starting point is that I am an empiricist. I tend to follow Edmund Burke in thinking that one should not wallow in the realms of metaphysical abstraction, but look at the evidence. What does it tell us? What happened? What was the outcome? The reason why, a little over five years ago, I came to the conclusion that my party ought to adopt all-women shortlists was simply that when we look at the evidence from across the world, we see that no other instrument has been remotely comparably effective in ratcheting up the level of female representation. We do not have to look into the crystal ball when we can read the book.</p>

Member for East Dunbartonshire was absolutely right to stress that there are all sorts of other elements in the equation. There must be a family-friendly environment and people who are willing to entertain the prospect of a woman, and we have to rule out sexist language, sexist lines of questioning, sexist and intimidatory behaviour, and so on. But I simply think that all-women shortlists can make a decisive difference. The governing party has demonstrated that to its benefit and doubtless to the benefit of the country, too.</p>

I know that I made that point in an intervention on  my hon. Friend the Member for Epping Forest (Mrs. Laing), but I am surprised that that has not happened, because the Modernisation Committee has done a good job in many respects and it seems extraordinary that that idea should keep slipping through the net.</p>

 I would like to add my support for that demand. One of the reasons my right hon. and learned Friend the Leader of the House saw so many babies in the Whips Office the other night is that so many of my colleagues brought their babies in when they came for the vote, but are not allowed to take them through the Lobby, even though all the babies were being breast fed&#151;although not at the time, obviously.

 I am not surprised, but I want to take this opportunity to pay tribute to my hon. Friend. He knows that I have had my differences with him. I start from a position of almost instinctive prejudice against him, because he is a member of the Whips Office and I am not very enthusiastic about Whips. However, my hon. Friend is something of a progressive and he is not even very secret about it. I have watched some of the things he has done in recent times and heard some of the statements that he has made. He is very sound and he ought to be quite explicit, in front of hon.

One is the national minimum wage. A lot has been said about its benefits, and that is absolutely right. As the hon. Member for Amber Valley (Judy Mallaber) knows, I long ago conceded that the Opposition were wrong to oppose it. If it had been introduced at a very high rate, it would have done damage, but it was not, so it did not.

<p><a name="stpa_o228"><a name="80306-0016.htm_para0"><a name="08030641000759">Let us not be complacent, however. Yes, 660,000 women will benefit from the uprating of the national minimum wage, and that is to the credit of the Government, but as we speak, 175,000 women in this country are being paid below the minimum wage. I accept that the Government cannot do it all, as the hon. Member for Slough pointed out, and that it is not all about this House, about Ministers or about new legislation. We have a responsibility, however, to take account of, and try to serve, those who are operating in the twilight zone&#151;perhaps in the informal economy&#151;and are being consistently exploited. Such people are deeply vulnerable. I am not sure whether we should address that through transparency, publicity or public education campaigns&#151;or a judicious combination of all three&#151;but we must not forget those who are simply not getting their just entitlements.</p>

 I apologise to my hon. Friend for taking issue with his comment that the minimum wage has not had an impact. Women earning the minimum wage also have to apply for working family tax credit because, unfortunately, the minimum wage does not suffice for people bringing up a family. The minimum wage has therefore had an impact, in that it has hidden the true cost of bringing up a family and the true cost of living for women. If we did not have the minimum wage, perhaps the wages paid to single women would be considerably higher.</p>

 I confess that I find that a rather curious line of argument. If my hon.

 The sector in which women work most is part-time work, and the real tragedy is that, over the past 10 years, we have seen almost no movement in the differential between what women and men get paid. I believe that that differential is still about 40 per cent.</p>

 The differential is enormous, and it is especially great among part-time employees. Ironically, the gender pay gap among part-time workers is even more pronounced in the public sector than in the private sector. Of course, there are all sorts of factors to explain the desperate disparities in pay that continue to exist. There are differences in capacity and skills, for example, resulting from historic under-recognition of the importance of training, career progression, qualifications and educational provision for women. Furthermore, a lot of women are, for understandable reasons, going into part-time work, where the gap is greater. Another factor is that women are often unable to travel as far as men&#151;perhaps because of their other responsibilities&#151;and therefore have a more limited set of jobs from which to choose. We know that 60 per cent. of women work in a very restricted set of occupations, so the opportunities for them are not as great. There is also the problem of occupational segregation&#151;and of segregation within the workplace, to boot. All those things have to be tackled.</p>

I suggest to right hon. and hon. Members that where we are dealing with the private sector, our attitude should be that we are the friend of the well-meaning but uninitiated employer, but the foe of the wilfully non-compliant and incorrigibly discriminatory employer. If we operate on that basis, we will understand the sort of approach that we need to take to improve the situation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o230"><a name="80306-0016.htm_para2"><a name="08030641000765">I would like, if I may, to make two other brief points. Rape crisis centres have been mentioned and I feel very strongly that we could be in danger of kicking out the baby with the bathwater. This is an incredibly important service, operational across the entire country, and it is estimated that something in the order of half of the 32 centres could be lost altogether if the funding cuts that have been decided upon are not reconsidered. Organisations need sustainable funding.</p>

It is all very well to talk about local innovation, local variation and local social entrepreneurship, but where we are talking about relatively vulnerable categories of people, among whom I include women and children with special educational needs&#151;a subject in which Members will know I am particularly interested&#151;we often need to have protective mechanisms in place, including ring-fenced funding to ensure that the people at whom the resources need to be directed are able to access them.</p>

Member for Luton, South (Margaret Moran), if she were still in her place, as I know she has been a passionate champion of women who have suffered from, or are at risk of, domestic violence. The Government have done excellent work on that front, but I have just one caveat. I know that there is talk of changing the rule of no recourse to public funds, and I welcome what I understand the Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department, the hon. Member for Gedling (Mr. Coaker), is reported to have said earlier this week to the Home Affairs Committee on that matter.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o233"><a name="80306-0016.htm_para5"><a name="08030641000768">That said, I am bothered about women of uncertain immigration status who do not qualify for public funds, because those people are extraordinarily vulnerable. They are scared witless and dare not walk out on their sadistic, bestial and, in some cases, homicidal partners or husbands unless they know that there is a safe refuge to which they can go. If the Government could turn their mind to that matter&#151;while recognising concern about the pull factor in immigration terms of simply opening the floodgates&#151;and devise a practical, workable and equitable solution to the problem, I think that Amnesty International, End Violence Against Women, the Fawcett Society and a plethora of other organisations committed to the interests of women, and particularly vulnerable women, would applaud the Government, and they would be right to do so.</p>

 I would like to comment on a couple of points raised by the hon. Member for East Dunbartonshire (Jo Swinson).  <br>

First, she referred to her favourite spots in touring the House, mentioning Earl Falkland&#146;s statue and the broken sword. When I take constituents around the House, my favourite part is the broom cupboard in the crypt chapel, where Emily Wilding Davison spent census night in 1911. A comment was made earlier about Emmeline Pankhurst&#146;s statue not being in the precincts of the House but outside; Emily Wilding Davison actually spent her time here, but it has never been officially acknowledged by the House. The plaque in the broom cupboard was placed there by my old friend Tony Benn, who made it himself. It is time that the House authorities acknowledged the direct action that women took to establish their right to be in this place.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o234"><a name="80306-0016.htm_para6"><a name="08030641000770">Secondly, the hon. Member for East Dunbartonshire referred to relationships and sex education and I think that she was absolutely right. I served on the Health Committee of the previous Parliament, which produced the report on sexual health. I think that we have got it the wrong way round when we talk about &#147;sex and relationship education&#148;, as we should be talking about &#147;relationship and sex education&#148;&#151;and the relationship education should start at the earliest possible opportunity.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o235"><a name="80306-0016.htm_para7"><a name="08030641000771">My right hon. Friend the Member for Cynon Valley (Ann Clwyd) said that nothing much on the equality front was going on in this place or in government during the 1980s. At that time, my hon. Friends the Members for Luton, South (Margaret Moran) and for Amber Valley (Judy Mallaber) and I were actively engaged in local government. There has been some criticism of local government, and I accept what the hon. Member for Buckingham (John Bercow) said about the need for uniformity, but during the 1980s it was pioneering local authorities that pressed forward the agenda of women&#146;s rights and racial equality. We were pilloried when we set up women&#146;s equality units in our local authorities, but I am pleased to say that our work&#151;not only in supporting and empowering women in the community, but in examining our own procedures and practices to ensure that we were not discriminating and that access was possible within authorities&#151;has now been taken on board as mainstream, and is no longer seen as something rather loony and politically correct.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o236"><a name="80306-0016.htm_para8"><a name="08030641000772">Moreover, local authorities were in the vanguard of identifying and campaigning on domestic violence. Edinburgh, for instance, launched the first campaign for zero tolerance of domestic violence, closely followed by the Association of London Authorities, long before the Home Office had taken up the issue. Although there is some rightful criticism of local authorities&#146; failings, I think we should pay tribute to their work in this sphere.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o237"><a name="80306-0016.htm_para9"><a name="08030641000773">I will not repeat the figures given by my hon. Friend the Member for Slough (Fiona Mactaggart) and others relating to the prevalence of domestic violence, or go into the question of whether one woman in four is affected or whether the rate is higher. I will, however, repeat what my hon. Friend said about the number of occasions on which women are victims of violence before reporting it. Some, of course, do not report it at all. Domestic violence involves a higher rate of repeat victimisation than any other crime.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o238"><a name="80306-0016.htm_para10"><a name="08030641000774">It is not just in the United Kingdom that domestic violence is a problem. As some Members will know, I  <br>

am a member of the Council of Europe&#146;s Committee on Equal Opportunities for Women and Men. We have launched a Europe-wide awareness campaign, which the Under-Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, my hon. Friend the Member for Sheffield, Heeley (Meg Munn)&#151;who was here earlier&#151;helped to launch in Madrid.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o239"><a name="80306-0016.htm_para11"><a name="08030641000775">It is estimated that in Europe overall, one in six women over the age of 16 has been in a relationship involving domestic violence. In Belgium, between April and December 2006 nearly 40,000 attacks were recorded by the courts&#151;140 cases a day. According to Amnesty International, in Belgium 70 women die every year. In Portugal, 39 women died as a result of domestic violence in 2006. In Spain, which has some of the most advanced legislation on violence against women in the world, 71 women were killed last year. In France, one woman is beaten to death every four days. According to the United Nations, in Russia one woman is killed by her partner every 35 minutes&#151; that is 14,000 women a year. We need to tackle the issue on a Europe-wide basis, and I am glad that the Government have supported the Europe-wide campaign.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o240"><a name="80306-0016.htm_para12"><a name="08030641000776">The majority of victims of domestic violence are women, and the majority of perpetrators are men. Statistically, is must be a fact not only that a substantial number of women in the House have been victims of domestic violence, but that a large proportion of men in the House have been perpetrators of it. The issue is important for men as well as women, because it must involve the perpetrators. I welcome the support given in this country to the white ribbon campaign, which started in north America. A conference organised by the campaign will take place next week. It will deal with the importance of engaging young men directly to challenge the stereotypes involved in violence, sexism, images and roles. Valuable work of that kind is necessary if we are to tackle domestic violence properly.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o241"><a name="80306-0016.htm_para13"><a name="08030641000777">The hon. Member for Epping Forest (Mrs. Laing) mentioned gender budgeting. Until recently I was chair of the Inter-Parliamentary Union&#146;s gender partnership working group. The hon. Lady mentioned the conference held in New York last week, which was also attended by my right hon. Friend the Member for North-West Durham (Hilary Armstrong). The Budget is next week, and it would be very helpful if in introducing it the Chancellor were to tell us what will be the likely gender impacts of the measures. The Government have, of course, introduced new laws. As the Budget rolls forward, Departments come forward with their policies and there is an obligation on them to produce equality impact assessments, as there also now is on local authorities. It is important that we start looking at budgets&#151;not only at the ways they perpetuate gender inequalities, but at how they might be used to address them. I commend to Members the Inter-Parliamentary Union handbook &#147;Parliament, the Budget and Gender&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o242"><a name="80306-0016.htm_para14"><a name="08030641000778">In this regard, one thing did happen in this House during the &#146;80s: the Conservative Government signed the convention on the elimination of all forms of discrimination against women&#151;CEDAW. There is an obligation on the Government to produce a report every four years to the United Nations. There is much to be commended in the 2007 report, and therefore  <br>

much on which to congratulate the Government. A lot has been done during that four-year period, including the measures to tackle domestic violence, so the Government have a very good record indeed. I have a question for the Minister, however: what is the parliamentary input into that report that goes to the United Nations? I am happy to be corrected if I am wrong, but I cannot recall there having been a debate in the House about that report on our activities in compliance with CEDAW. As Members have said, we should have more frequent debates on some of the issues raised today, including prostitution. I do not necessarily agree with everything my hon. Friend the Member for Slough said about that subject, but she made some powerful points and we must have an open and honest debate about how to tackle prostitution and the exploitation of women. We should also, however, have a debate on the Government&#146;s report on CEDAW.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o243"><a name="80306-0016.htm_para15"><a name="08030641000779">I agree with the Government that for many people the best way out of poverty is to get into employment, but I get worried sometimes about women with family responsibilities being pressured into taking employment. There should be facilities, support and child care for those who wish to do so, but I do not think we should devalue those women who choose to stay at home and bring up their children and devote their time to their household; nor should we devalue what they do. We should not see that as non-productive.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o244"><a name="80306-0016.htm_para16"><a name="08030641000780">The United Nations International Research and Training Institute for the Advancement of Women undertook some research into the productivity of such work. It is not negative; it is productive work. Some years ago I was one of the signatories to a campaign called Wages for Housework. We should get away from the idea that it is all very well for women to take a job looking after somebody else&#146;s children and getting paid for that, but it is not good for them to stay at home and look after their own children.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o245"><a name="80306-0016.htm_para17"><a name="08030641000781">My final point is on representation. The hon. Member for Epping Forest mentioned the proportion of women in various Parliaments. The IPU produces an annual report on the progress&#151;or otherwise&#151;that countries have made on the number of women in Parliament. Worldwide, the rate is about 17.7 per cent. but at Government ministerial level it is about 16 per cent. There are 144 nations in the league table, and the UK is about 60th, so there is clearly room for improvement. In New York last week, my right hon. Friend the Member for North-West Durham talked about the UK experience, and in particular the positive action the Labour party has taken.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o246"><a name="80306-0016.htm_para18"><a name="08030641000782">I accept the point made by the right hon. Member for Maidenhead (Mrs. May) that there may be many different ways of getting women into Parliament, but I agree with the hon. Member for Buckingham (John Bercow) that the best and most proven way in a first-past-the-post system is the all-women shortlist, which the Labour party has adopted. I hope that the Minister for Equality will give an assurance that that selection process will be allowed to continue.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o247"><a name="80306-0016.htm_para19"><a name="08030641000783">I hope that we will have a debate about how we will influence the monitoring procedures that are to be set up if we do not ratify the trafficking convention soon.

number of survey forms were completed by Members of this House, including both men and women. A report is to be published, which will discuss how men and women parliamentarians work together to advance gender equality. It will examine some of the barriers to women&#146;s participation in the political process&#151;it will be a long report. I ask the Minister to have a word with the powers that be so that we can have a debate on it when it is published in April.</p>

 It is a pleasure to follow another thoughtful contribution. I enjoyed a number of the earlier ones, particularly those of the hon. Member for East Dunbartonshire (Jo Swinson) and my hon. Friend the Member for Epping Forest (Mrs. Laing). I echo a comment made by my hon. Friend the Member for Basingstoke (Mrs. Miller) to the Minister for Women and Equality. Tomorrow, when the Minister compares her contribution with the rather measured and generous spirited speeches in the rest of the debate, she might feel that she slightly let herself down at the beginning of it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o248"><a name="80306-0016.htm_para20"><a name="08030641000785">I wish to highlight three areas where, in my experience, the role of women has been, and is, particularly significant. One is unpopular, one is very popular and a third touches on the international dimension. Hon. Members may be aware that the Yarl&#146;s Wood detention and removal centre is based in my constituency. Since the fire of 2002, that centre has been used almost exclusively for women detainees and their children. It is designed on the basis that they should be there for a brief period before being returned in most cases to their country of origin.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o249"><a name="80306-0016.htm_para21"><a name="08030641000786">Failed women asylum seekers are not necessarily at the top of everyone&#146;s care agenda, and I was pleased that my hon. Friend the Member for Buckingham (John Bercow) mentioned the issue. How a country treats those who, for one reason or another, are on the margins of society is very much a measure of its humanity. The failed asylum seekers in the Yarl&#146;s Wood centre are a mixture. Some have been convicted of crimes, notably those who have been used as drug mules for gangs, whereas others have committed no crime save for wanting to come to this country to have a better life. As the House knows well&#151;it is the common policy of all parts of the House&#151;that in itself is not enough reason for someone to be allowed to remain in the United Kingdom. Virtually all the women in Yarl&#146;s Wood have been through some form of judicial or other procedure that has determined that they have no right to remain here.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o250"><a name="80306-0016.htm_para22"><a name="08030641000787">Behind those legalities are issues of human tragedy. It is difficult to be certain in every case as to whether the story being told is true, but there are enough similarities in stories told to non-governmental organisations and representatives across the world to feel that some of them resonate perfectly accurately. They are stories of war, rape, oppression and escape, which are mixed in with the other stories of wanting to flee poor economic circumstances and sometimes the threat of violence from families or others.</p>

<notus-date day="6" month="3" year="2008" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><b>6 Mar 2008 : Column 1996</b><br>

<p><a name="stpa_o251"><a name="80306-0016.htm_para23"><a name="08030641000788">Once the judicial processes have been exhausted, the departure from the UK is not always a quick one. For a number of reasons, a detainee may be at Yarl&#146;s Wood for much longer than originally anticipated. They may be there for months rather than weeks&#151;sometimes for more than 12 months. The uncertainty of the departure date considerably increases the mental anguish that these women suffer. Accordingly, my first thought in this debate is for all at Yarl&#146;s Wood, both those detained and those who care for them, for they, too, are my constituents.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o252"><a name="80306-0016.htm_para24"><a name="08030641000789">It may help the House if I make some quick points about the situation. First, I visited Yarl&#146;s Wood recently, after the change from Group 4 to Serco. My impression is that the regime is rather easier than it used to be: formerly closed doors have been opened; the ratio of officers to detainees has decreased; and detainees have much more access to each other and to all parts of the building. The atmosphere is sad, because of the circumstances, but it is not always oppressive. It is only fair that that is recognised by those who are concerned for detainees.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o253"><a name="80306-0016.htm_para25"><a name="08030641000790">Secondly, when forced removals have to be carried out, they are always filmed. That is done to protect both the officers involved and the women themselves. Occasionally stories circulate on the internet about a forced removal, which suggest unlawful or unnecessary action on the part of those carrying out that admittedly unpleasant procedure. I have asked the independent monitoring board at Yarl&#146;s Wood, which is mostly made up of constituents who are unconnected with the authorities, always to be involved if there is a dispute about a forced removal, so that it can see precisely what has happened and to act as an extra safeguard. I am grateful that the Home Office has agreed to that procedure.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o254"><a name="80306-0016.htm_para26"><a name="08030641000791">Thirdly, it is important that the Healthcare Commission has some responsibility for the medical facilities inside Yarl&#146;s Wood. We have requested that for some time, but it is still being considered. It is important because the health care provided has not always been appropriate and an extra safeguard would be helpful. Fourthly, I am still not sure that children should be at Yarl&#146;s Wood at all. I am keen that the Government and Conservative Front Benchers continue to monitor that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o255"><a name="80306-0016.htm_para27"><a name="08030641000792">Finally, I wish to pay tribute to the befrienders, a group mostly consisting of women, who out of pure charity and kindness have made it their business to visit those who are detained and offer them what support they can while they are at Yarl&#146;s Wood. Some detainees have no one to visit them. Some have no idea about how long they will be held and some are very fearful about returning. The befrienders listen, only very rarely making an intervention in a case, because no one can be truly involved with a revolving population of some 300 or so. They provide a necessary lifeline of sanity to those in a very difficult place. All of us who make decisions about the law and through our own actions place others, after due process, behind bars and locked doors owe a huge debt of gratitude to those who visit and care for those who are thereby detained.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o256"><a name="80306-0017.htm_para0"><a name="08030641000793">On a lighter note, I wish to extend my thanks to all those women in my constituency who volunteer for some role or other and make the wheels of a largely rural constituency go round.

on the Future Of Volunteering, led by Baroness Julia Neuberger, and I appreciated the opportunity to look at the work of volunteering in modern society. We can be proud of the fact that over the past 12 months some 73 per cent. of all adults have volunteered at least once and that 48 per cent. are regularly involved in volunteering at least once a month, which is a good proportion. Women outnumber men in that respect, and women are also more generous in giving to charity.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o257"><a name="80306-0017.htm_para1"><a name="08030641000794">Most of us appreciate the work done by volunteers in our constituency. I could pick out many examples, but I shall pick out solely the work of the group Carers in Bedfordshire. It has been established only for a few short years and is energetically run by Yvonne Clark. She has brought together an invaluable advice and information service for those caring for young and old throughout the county. The group goes out looking for those who might be isolated in the rural environment and lack access to facilities, and it is doing a terrific job.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o258"><a name="80306-0017.htm_para2"><a name="08030641000795">Baroness Neuberger&#146;s commission made several recommendations, which were presented to the hon. Member for High Peak (Tom Levitt) in January, and I commend the document to all hon. Members. The recommendations include ensuring that volunteering is genuinely open to all and that the Government set  up a working party as soon as possible to seek to remove unnecessary or disproportionate obstacles to volunteering&#151;including, for example, repeat criminal record bureau checks, entitlement to benefit and the ever present frustrations caused by risk management and health and safety. I hope that the recommendations are considered and accepted as soon as possible.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o259"><a name="80306-0017.htm_para3"><a name="08030641000796">Last week, as my hon. Friend the Member for Epping Forest (Mrs. Laing) and the hon. Member for Erith and Thamesmead (John Austin) mentioned, the 52nd session of the Commission on the Status of Women took place at the United Nations. I commend all the UK groups that took part. The event is dedicated to gender equality and the advancement of women and takes place under the auspices of the United Nations Economic and Social Councils. Among the groups from the UK was the Conservative Women&#146;s Organisation, and I pay tribute to its chairman, Fiona Hodgson, to Pauline Lucas and to my wife, Eve, who went to New York at their own expense to represent Conservative women and take part in the various sessions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o260"><a name="80306-0017.htm_para4"><a name="08030641000797">As we have been talking about women in politics, I wish to digress slightly and say something about those women who are in politics although they may not have been elected, and about Members&#146; spouses, both male and female. In recent weeks, they and the work they do have come under some pressure from external sources. I am immensely proud of my wife, what she does unpaid for the Conservative party and what she does in a paid capacity for my constituents. I could not function without her and she represents many parliamentary spouses who work incredibly hard and without whom none of us would work as effectively as we do.</p>

 I am grateful to my hon. Friend, who was at the commission and made a distinctive contribution, as she always does. Her comments are certainly appreciated.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o261"><a name="80306-0017.htm_para5"><a name="08030641000802">As the House has already heard, subjects such as gender financing for women through microfinance and sexual violence in conflicts were very much a theme of last week. One of the points of such a large-scale conference is what can be learned and brought back. Men&#146;s violence against women, violence and oppression in the name of honour and violence in same-sex relationships all need public recognition and to be combated virtually all the time. Women in all countries are fighting violence within relationships daily. In a recent UK survey of 18 to 24-year-olds, one in five boys stated that they saw violence as a normal part of a relationship and one in nine girls said that they would expect violence as part of a relationship; those are depressingly sad statistics.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o262"><a name="80306-0017.htm_para6"><a name="08030641000803">The event in New York highlighted how far forward Sweden, Denmark and Norway are with this agenda and how user-friendly their documentation is in comparison with ours. The action plans and documents gave sound practical advice and direction, illustrating what could be done in all countries and making a distinctive contribution to the debate that has been brought back to the UK.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o263"><a name="80306-0017.htm_para7"><a name="08030641000804">Visits overseas to developing nations have many purposes and benefits. Often, they leave visitors profoundly shocked by the different experiences for those who happen to be born and brought up in different parts of what should be one world. In many parts of the developing world, women are bearing the brunt of inequalities. Last summer, Lady Fiona Hodgson went with my right hon. Friend the Member for Witney (Mr. Cameron) and some 40 colleagues to Rwanda for two weeks to take part in a series of projects that were put together with the co-operation of the Rwandan Government and led by my hon. Friend the Member for Sutton Coldfield (Mr. Mitchell). The visit was inappropriately criticised at the time, and those who made such criticisms should be ashamed of themselves.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o264"><a name="80306-0017.htm_para8"><a name="08030641000805">During those two weeks, Fiona Hodgson of the Conservative Women&#146;s Organisation spent a lot of time with women from all levels of society in Rwanda. In 1994, Rwanda was the scene of a dreadful genocide, and because that genocide targeted men in particular, there are many widows, orphans and children who are heads of households. Many women lost their children, but they decided that because a new family structure was needed and because every child was special, they would adopt. Some women have adopted 18 or 20 children.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o265"><a name="80306-0017.htm_para9"><a name="08030641000806">Many people lost their homes. Previously women would never have been involved in such things as house building, but now they are. Many more women had to become breadwinners. Rwanda has the highest proportion of women in its Parliament, at some 48 per cent. In the 14 years since the genocide, the women of Rwanda have achieved their first phase of political empowerment and equality and are now working on their second vision of economic empowerment of women coupled with health provision and social welfare.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o266"><a name="80306-0017.htm_para10"><a name="08030641000807">Finally, I join the voices in this country and others who pick out the availability of water as the single most important need that the world collectively has the resources to address and that might make the single most important difference to the lives of women throughout the world. Visitors to many parts of Africa come away haunted by the spectre of so many women and children carrying huge cans of water with grace, skill and strength as they try to take the water that they need for just a few hours. More than 1.1 billion people have no access to safe water. Each year, more than 1.5 million children under five die from diarrhoea caused by dirty water. It is estimated that up 118 million people, mostly children, will die over the next 15 years from water-related diseases, all of which are preventable.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o267"><a name="80306-0017.htm_para11"><a name="08030641000808">Throughout the world, millions of people have to walk miles to find water, and they often find at the end of the journey that the water is dirty and unhygienic. Accordingly, I support the various organisations in this country that are doing what they can to raise awareness of the problem and seek change by supporting the efforts of NGOs and voluntary and charitable organisations to achieve such change.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o268"><a name="80306-0017.htm_para12"><a name="08030641000809">I particularly commend the &#147;Turn on the Tap Challenge 2008&#148;, organised by the Christian group Samaritan&#146;s Purse. On 10 May, or thereabouts, it will be organising walks all over the country for children, schools, faith groups and others, who will symbolically walk a few miles to raise money and remember those who need to walk and carry heavy loads every day. Much of that burden falls on the women of the world, and if they were relieved of it, the time that they spend doing what takes us only a second would be freed up, and they would be freed from their frustrations. They could learn, train or be in more profitable work.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o269"><a name="80306-0017.htm_para13"><a name="08030641000810">Occasionally, constituents come to our advice centres and say angrily that we are living in third world conditions in relation to our roads, health service or transport. They have no idea what they are talking about. On international women&#146;s day, we should dedicate ourselves to freeing women from the circumstances that they have to endure all too often, about which our population fortunately knows very little.</p>

been concerned about constituents who have gone there, and I share his concern about children being there. He made some important points on that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o271"><a name="80306-0017.htm_para15"><a name="08030641000813">It is good to speak on international women&#146;s day again, when we can remember women&#146;s achievements and what happens to women throughout the world. It is important to think internationally, and I was struck by the hon. Gentleman&#146;s comments about Rwanda. The hon. Member for East Dunbartonshire (Jo Swinson) mentioned the exhibition in the Upper Waiting Hall. A board in the exhibition states that a study has found that in Africa,</p>
<a name="80306-0017.htm_brev0"><a name="08030641001023"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;on average, women carried more than 80 tonnes of fuel, water and farm water over the course of a year. That&#146;s about the same as eight steamrollers. The average for men was 10 tonnes.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o272"><a name="80306-0017.htm_para16"><a name="08030641000814">The exhibition clearly illustrates the problems that climate change is causing women and the fact that it is affecting them more than men. Today is a day to think globally.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o273"><a name="80306-0017.htm_para17"><a name="08030641000815">Here in the UK, we mark this day in many ways. It was great yesterday to be in the cross-party group that put flowers at the statue, and it was also good to be with the group of Labour women MPs who sang in the House of Commons Chapel, outside the cupboard where Emily Davison hid. My hon. Friend the Member for Erith and Thamesmead (John Austin) mentioned that earlier.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o274"><a name="80306-0017.htm_para18"><a name="08030641000816">Last Saturday in my constituency, the women&#146;s forum put on the 1909 play &#147;How the Vote Was Won&#148; by Cicely Hamilton and Christopher St. John, which was directed by our women&#146;s officer, Pam Cartlidge. It was an exciting and vibrant occasion. The author Cicely Hamilton was a remarkable woman who co-founded the women writers&#146; suffrage league. During world war one, she worked in nursing care and then joined the Army as an auxiliary. After the war she campaigned on various issues, including birth control. She wrote the words to &#147;The March of the Women&#148;, the rallying anthem of the Women&#146;s Social and Political Union.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o275"><a name="80306-0017.htm_para19"><a name="08030641000817">&#147;How the Vote Was Won&#148; was put on last Saturday to celebrate both international women&#146;s day and the 90th anniversary of women aged over 30 getting the vote, in 1918. That applied only to women who had property, so it was only one step forward. Women got the vote in 1918, but they did not necessarily get voted in, as has been said frequently in the debate. Emmeline Pankhurst said of the suffragettes:</p>
<a name="80306-0017.htm_brev1"><a name="08030641001024"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;We are here, not because we are law-breakers; we are here in our efforts to become law-makers.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o276"><a name="80306-0017.htm_para20"><a name="08030641000818">We might have expected there to be many more law-makers today, and I think that she would probably have been disappointed by the pace of change. We could have got much further, as the debate has shown. Things have improved, but the statistics have been widely cited today and we know that we still have a long way to go.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o277"><a name="80306-0017.htm_para21"><a name="08030641000819">We have discussed ways to achieve greater women&#146;s representation. In my view, we will achieve it only by taking the direct positive action that we in the Labour party have taken, with all-women shortlists and twinning in Scottish Parliament and Welsh Assembly constituencies. For many years, we tried all the other ways that one could think of involving training, encouragement and gender-balanced shortlists, but we  <br>

got nowhere; only when we had all-women shortlists did we make a big step forward. Although the suffragettes would be disappointed, we have achieved a lot.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o278"><a name="80306-0017.htm_para22"><a name="08030641000820">As law-makers we can make a real difference, and we have done so in many areas. We have heard a lot about those today and I shall not go over all the problems such as domestic abuse and inadequate child care provision. We now have paternity pay, increased maternity pay, flexible working rights and the national minimum wage and many other measures. One of the ways in which women have made a huge difference by being part of the governing party is by changing policy on families and children. Since Labour came into office, we have taken huge steps towards creating a more family-friendly, more equal society. Views have been transformed. When I came into Parliament in 1997, it was still not the done thing to talk about such matters&#151;I remember hearing sniggers in the House when we talked about improving child care, breastfeeding and so on. We have made a lot of progress since then. All the parties are now striving to achieve the things that we want.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o279"><a name="80306-0017.htm_para23"><a name="08030641000821">It is now much more than the norm for women to work: in Wales in 2007, 67.4 per cent. of working-age women were in employment. Between 1997 and 2007, the women&#146;s work force has increased by 12 per cent. Women now expect to be in employment, but of course they still have to look after the children and elderly relatives. The Government have tackled head-on the question of how to balance those competing priorities. The right to request flexible working has been very successful: 90 per cent. of parents of children under six who requested flexible working have been granted it. Two of my daughters have benefited from flexible working, so it has been of great benefit to my family. However, I believe that it should be extended to the parents of children of all ages. I know that the Government are considering that in their review, and I hope that we will soon hear that the right to request flexible working, which is not such a huge thing, will be extended to parents of children of all ages. Whatever age their child, parents have needs and have demands placed upon them during so-called normal working hours, and it is important to acknowledge that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o280"><a name="80306-0017.htm_para24"><a name="08030641000822">Another important point that I hope the review will pick up is that it should be possible for parents to request flexible working on a temporary basis. Although 90 per cent. of requests are granted, that results in permanent changes to the contract of employment, whereas often parents need to change their working hours only temporarily&#151;for example, for the year in which their child attends nursery for half a day only. That it is necessary to change the employment contract back afterwards is a matter of concern. Parents should be able to request a year&#146;s contract.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o281"><a name="80306-0017.htm_para25"><a name="08030641000823">The gender pay gap has been discussed a lot today. People who work part-time, who we know are often women, earn far less than full-time male workers in particular. Women who request flexible working&#151;it is mainly women who do so&#151;or who work part-time get caught in that trap.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o282"><a name="80306-0017.htm_para26"><a name="08030641000824">Another issue relating to care for children and families that I want to flag up is the informal care provided by grandparents and friends. It has been calculated that in Wales two thirds of informal care is  <br>

provided by friends and grandparents. Families in some parts of Wales are totally dependent on relatives to manage and to cope. In some ways, family members are the people who are most trusted, in any case. The Government should address the issue and see whether there is any way in which the finance available for formal care can be used for informal care. Obviously, that will require some work, but we should consider the issue. Flexible working is good for families and companies, and there is much that the Government can do to improve lives for families. We can move forward by extending flexible working to the parents of children over the age of six, being more flexible about employment contracts, recognising grandparents&#146; role, and continuing to address the pay gap.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o283"><a name="80306-0017.htm_para27"><a name="08030641000825">I have very little time left to speak. I had intended to address the issue of vulnerable women in prison, which I feel strongly about, but my right hon. Friend the Member for Cynon Valley (Ann Clwyd) went through the statistics in great detail, so it is not necessary for me to do so. All the facts show that we are not serving women, the community or children well by imprisoning women in the numbers that we do. Many more of them could be doing community sentences. I strongly urge the Government to adopt the recommendations in Baroness Corston&#146;s report, and not to leave it too long. I am concerned about parts of the Government&#146;s prison policy, and I have doubts about the two titan prisons. We should concentrate on the matter of women in prison who should not be there. I hope that the Government will move ahead on the issue.</p>

 This has been a very interesting debate, and I am delighted to be able to take part in it.

Time is limited so I will not talk a lot about vigilance; I want to concentrate on the successes. However, having heard the comments made by Members in all parts of the Chamber about carers and caring, about work, pay and pensions, about prisons and violence, and about all the other issues that have been raised, we are right to be vigilant, and to make sure that there is no regression. We should continue to push forward and make progress with the equality that everybody wants, whatever their perspective.

Minister for Women and Equality. I think that they were slightly ill-judged, and she may regret them when she reads them in <i> Hansard</i> tomorrow.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o287"><a name="80306-0018.htm_para0"><a name="08030641000830">Some of the debate has rightly focused on the House and its composition, which is an important subject. The right hon. Member for Cynon Valley (Ann Clwyd), who is no longer in the Chamber, made the point that the Scottish National party has no women Members at present. That is absolutely right; we do not. It is a matter of some regret to me, not least because 25 per cent. or so of all SNP MPs ever elected have been women, some of whom have been particularly notable. I will speak about some of them later.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o288"><a name="80306-0018.htm_para1"><a name="08030641000831">Of course, the House of Commons is not the only legislature to which women choose to be elected. It is useful and instructive to look at what is happening in the Scottish Parliament in all parties, particularly in ours. Talented young women such as Shirley-Anne Somerville and Aileen Campbell have been elected, through the list system, to the Scottish Parliament to do their politics. Experienced politicians such as Tricia Marwick and Angela Constance beat Labour incumbents in Central Fife and Livingston to do their politics there. Roseanna Cunningham and the late Margaret Ewing, who were both MPs, sought election in the Scottish Parliament. When we see women&#151;and, interestingly, men as well&#151;from all parties choosing to go back to the Scottish Parliament, perhaps the time has come to look again at what that Parliament is doing to make itself such an attractive proposition in comparison, perhaps, with this wonderful place. Although we finish early tonight, I shall not see my four-and-a-half-year-old daughter for the fourth consecutive evening. Perhaps we should look at some of the issues again.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman will be aware that at the moment there are 13 women Scottish National party MSPs, about 27 per cent. of the parliamentary party. That is fewer than the party had in 1997. The SNP does, however, have a tradition of high-profile women representatives. But is the party trying to get better representation in the Scottish Parliament as well as here?</p>

<p><a name="st_o493"><a name="08030641000833"><a name="80306-0018.htm_spnew2"><a name="08030641001577"><b>Stewart Hosie:</b>
 Like all parties, we are doing that. Earlier, a helpful comment was made about the various ways in which the different parties are trying to resolve the issue according to their traditions. I have not been the national secretary of my party for some time, but when I was, I wrote the guidelines for the avoidance of discrimination at the selection-meeting stage. There is a whole process to be carried out&#151;not least the mentoring and training done by the Liberal Democrats and Conservatives and the route that the Labour party has taken. I pay tribute to the Labour party; being an institutional party with big power blocs, its mechanism was perhaps the only one available to it to solve the problem that it saw.</p>

won the Govan by-election in 1973, there were still 26 women in the 1970 intake. When Margaret and Winnie Ewing won again in February 1974, they were two of only 23 women in that intake. When Roseanna Cunningham won in 1995, there were 60 women in the 1992 Parliament, and when Annabelle Ewing was elected in 2001, there were 118. There are now 126 women, just short of 20 per cent. of the total number of MPs.</p>

In 1999, 2003 and 2007, there were 48, 50 and 43 women respectively&#151;37 per cent., 39 per cent. and 33 per cent. Those figures are not perfect, but they are better than the ones for this place. There is much to be done and we need to get equality, but those Scottish numbers are significantly better in all years than Westminster has ever achieved.</p>

 The people of Scotland were right to choose the settlement that they got; if one party wants to claim credit, it can go ahead and do so.

 On the issue of the difference between voting in respect of the Scottish Parliament and here, does the hon.

More than a third of the Scottish Government is made up of women, and they are not just making up the numbers. Linda Fabiani is the Minister for Europe, External Affairs and Culture, Fiona Hyslop is the Cabinet Secretary for Education and Lifelong Learning and Maureen Watt is the Minister for Schools and Skills.

<p><a name="stpa_o296"><a name="80306-0018.htm_para9"><a name="08030641000848">Since 1918, in every single election in Scotland to every seat, only 34 women have ever been elected and I am proud that five of them were from my very small party. Most impressive of them all was Winnie Ewing, who won the Hamilton by-election, without which there would not have been the pressure for devolution and now the Scottish Parliament. She was also elected to three legislatures: to this place twice, to Europe three times&#151;she was appointed the first time, in 1974&#151;and to the Scottish Parliament, where she became the Mother of the House.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o297"><a name="80306-0018.htm_para10"><a name="08030641000849">I said I wanted to talk about successes and I shall do so in relation to two successful women. The first was Muriel Gibson, who died sadly in 2005 aged 92. She rose to become a lieutenant-colonel in the Army. That was highly unusual; she was the exception that broke the rule. The second is another lieutenant-colonel, Kate Howie, who won a Perthshire council by-election two weeks ago, with 60 per cent of the vote. I was wrong when I said that I had only one bit of partisan politics; Labour got 3 per cent., which I think is worth putting on the record. She also became a lieutenant-colonel, but her achievements&#151;rising in the military, her civilian career and her success in the election and in the council chambers&#151;is now normal. In the modest time scale from Muriel Gibson to Kate Howie, the change is extraordinary and we should celebrate the fact that women can now succeed in any walk of life they choose. We must not be complacent, but this sort of success is normal.</p>

 It is a particular pleasure to speak in the debate under your chairwomanship, Madam Deputy Speaker. I have fond memories of speaking when we were celebrating the struggle of the women chain makers in your constituency on the issues of low pay, a minimum wage and women&#146;s pay.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o302"><a name="80306-0018.htm_para15"><a name="08030641000857">That is rather a good quote. International women&#146;s day and the struggle for the franchise were intended to ensure that women were no longer anonymous or unrepresented, and that women&#146;s voice was heard and their concerns acted on. I am proud that in Derbyshire, of the 10 MPs, four are Labour women. I am pleased that in the new 11th constituency, the Conservatives have adopted a woman candidate. I am glad that they have come on board, as the woman whom they have selected has for many years complained about the barriers that she encountered in trying to be selected as a Conservative candidate. We are all familiar with those barriers. I am proud that one of our Labour women in Derbyshire was the first woman Foreign Secretary, as has been mentioned.</p>

I refer the House to the just published report from the Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform Committee, entitled &#147;Jobs for the Girls&#148;. It was drawn up by a Sub-Committee which I chaired with the hon. Member for Bromsgrove (Miss Kirkbride) and my hon. Friends the Members for Kingswood (Roger Berry) and for Crosby (Mrs. Curtis-Thomas). We know that there is still a stubborn pay gap.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o304"><a name="80306-0018.htm_para17"><a name="08030641000859">It is particularly good to discuss that issue in a debate on international women&#146;s day. As we have heard, the celebration of international women&#146;s day originated in the United States as a result of the industrial struggle in a period of huge expansion and turbulence in the industrialised world. The first march took place in the States in 1909, after 15,000 women had marched through New York City, demanding shorter hours, better pay and voting rights. Today it is particularly relevant to talk about women at work and the struggles that we still face.</p>

There has been great progress. When I first became involved in promoting the interests of women, one was regarded as a lunatic feminist if one thought that balancing home and work commitments was an issue or a priority. Indeed, in the House I have been called a Stepford wife because I spoke about us promoting our policy of equal rights for part-time workers, on which we still have a long way to go. I found it odd that I was  <br>

attacked for promoting the Government&#146;s policy, as it had taken about 20 years to persuade my own party to adopt it. It would have been strange for me not to support it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o306"><a name="80306-0018.htm_para19"><a name="08030641000861">We have made progress. Now it is not regarded as mad to talk about the work-life balance; now that is almost sanctified as a policy. I was pleased that when we were drawing up our policies before the 1997 election, and our prospective Chancellor, now the Prime Minister, was being careful not to make too many uncosted financial commitments, one of the first two priorities that he identified was child care. He understood that it was not just a moral and ethical stance to promote child care, but that it was an economic issue. It is crucial that those are linked.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o307"><a name="80306-0018.htm_para20"><a name="08030641000862">That is what our Committee report has done. The work originated under the Trade and Industry Committee, and we started it partly because of the economic problems associated with the pay gap. In the press release that I put out when launching the report, I said:</p>

<a name="80306-0018.htm_brev5"><a name="08030641001029"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;is not only unfair to women but also limits the pool of recruits available to employers at a time when harnessing and extending the skills of all is increasingly vital for the health of the economy.

</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o309"><a name="80306-0018.htm_para22"><a name="08030641000864">We need a determined battle on every front if we are to make further progress.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o310"><a name="80306-0018.htm_para23"><a name="08030641000865">One area that was referred to in our report, with which I was involved in a previous capacity when I worked for the then National Union of Public Employees, was the campaign for the minimum wage, which has been so important in starting to equalise pay for some women, and in starting to break down the pay gap, particularly at the bottom of the pay scale. In my union, that issue had been campaigned on for decades by an enlightened general secretary who made the case for county road men. It took a long time for us to recognise that it would be an important issue for women. It was a long struggle to get the labour movement to accept that we should intervene, and to get that acceptance across the spectrum. As has been said, the change was opposed vehemently in this House, and I am pleased that it is now recognised that the change was of great importance for women. I recognise, however, that there are still difficulties with regard to enforcement and so on.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o311"><a name="80306-0018.htm_para24"><a name="08030641000866">I hope that people will look at our Select Committee report, and that there will be further debate on it in Parliament. The report covers a range of issues, and I have time to tackle only a few. We looked at the implementation of the recommendations of the Women in Work Commission, set up by the Government and chaired by Baroness Prosser. It has been said that we need to look at a range of areas, not just legislation, if we are to promote equality and make further advances.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o312"><a name="80306-0018.htm_para25"><a name="08030641000867">I shall just canter through a few of the issues that we raised, some of which have been touched on. We considered the fact that one of the key factors in the  <br>

gap between men and women&#146;s pay is occupational segregation: men and women going into different areas of work. It was said earlier that educating women and girls was critical. Of course that is important, and it is important internationally, but girls have been doing well in education compared with men, and there is still a pay gap. That is because of the terms under which women go into employment, the jobs that they go into and&#151;a point made by the hon. Member for Bromsgrove&#151;the way in which that gap persists among similarly qualified people even five years after graduation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o313"><a name="80306-0018.htm_para26"><a name="08030641000868">If we are to break down barriers, one of the early things to consider is education. We considered two issues: work experience placements and careers advice in schools. Those should not just be an add-on for a teacher; more resources and effort need to be put into those practices. The YWCA has come up with a number of interesting ideas, including the need to try different work placements at school. I welcome our huge programme to expand apprenticeships, and I also welcome the fact that, within that, it has been recognised that we should examine the work into which boys and girls, and men and women, go.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o314"><a name="80306-0018.htm_para27"><a name="08030641000869">In one of my local schools, a girl wanted to go into construction because she wanted to follow in her father&#146;s footsteps&#151;he was in the construction industry. She was put off by her family, who said, &#147;No, you can&#146;t do that&#148;, even though they should have looked upon her following her father as a matter of pride. I also met a young woman in an engineering company providing signalling equipment for the railways, which was very proud of the fact that she had been taken on as a young apprentice. It adopted her&#151;they thought that she was wonderful and hoped that she would carry on. There are good examples, and less positive ones. I hope that we can do more to promote the idea of women going into more traditional areas of work.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o315"><a name="80306-0018.htm_para28"><a name="08030641000870">There are not so many opportunities for older women to reskill if they want to go back to work. We looked at work done by Ofsted, which has examined whether courses are provided in a flexible way.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o316"><a name="80306-0018.htm_para29"><a name="08030641000871">When we asked Baroness Prosser about her key priorities she highlighted one that has been raised today: the dearth of good quality part-time work. A report last week showed how women managers, wanting to work part-time after having a baby, see their opportunities and chances for qualification plummet because they are made to take jobs at a lower level. There has been a quality part-time work initiative, and the TUC and CBI said to us that they hoped that full funding would be provided, as recommended by the commission, to promote that initiative. We have to get beyond pilots and extend those initiatives across a broader range of the economy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o317"><a name="80306-0018.htm_para30"><a name="08030641000872">We considered legal changes because there was a feeling that the discrimination law review had not found the answers. If we continue not to make strong progress, we will have to examine again compulsory pay orders or extending the gender equality duty to the private sector.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o320"><a name="80306-0019.htm_para0"><a name="08030641000877">I am delighted to contribute to today&#146;s debate to mark international women&#146;s day on Saturday. Hon. Members may know by now that I was born in the United States, but they might not know that the predecessor to international women&#146;s day was also born across the pond in February 1909. It had far more dubious parentage than mine&#151;the Socialist party of America. Early socialist credentials stood the movement in good stead when the observance of international women&#146;s day in Russia on 8 March 1917 coincided with the downfall of the tsarist regime. However, the story of women's rights has much more to do with evolution than revolution.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o321"><a name="80306-0019.htm_para1"><a name="08030641000878">Women won the vote not because Emily Davison shocked race-goers at the Derby but because those who survived her proved themselves indispensable during the great war. If Emmeline Pankhurst, Emily Davison and Millicent Fawcett were the figureheads in the fight for women&#146;s rights in the 20th century, J. S. Mill provided much of the early impetus for that fight during the 19th century.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o322"><a name="80306-0019.htm_para2"><a name="08030641000879">Mill represented Westminster as a Member of Parliament, but his constituency was far broader, and the debt that is owed to him is correspondingly deeper. Gladstone described him as the &#147;the saint of Rationalism&#148;, and he was certainly more rational than his electorate, who failed to return him to Parliament after he had been a Member for only three years.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o323"><a name="80306-0019.htm_para3"><a name="08030641000880">It is striking that Mill&#146;s contribution to the debates of his day continues to be relevant to the debates of ours. Although we have made tremendous advances in some matters, there is clearly ground to be made up in others. When Mill spoke out on the admission of women to the electoral franchise, for example, he believed that it would address the practical grievance of the lack of property rights then given to women. He told the House simply that</p>

1882, 18 married women&#146;s property Bills were introduced in Parliament and an Act finally appeared on the statute book only in 1882, by which time Mill had said goodbye to the world along with Westminster. </p>

<p><a name="stpa_o325"><a name="80306-0019.htm_para5"><a name="08030641000882">The substance of the inequality is perhaps less important than the lesson that there will always be those who say that change takes time and that it must be allowed to run its course. Our answer to them should be that sometimes the pace of change needs to be given as much encouragement as possible. I am therefore proud to be co-chair of the Conservative party&#146;s Women2Win campaign with my right hon. Friend the Member for Maidenhead (Mrs. May). I am also proud to claim Nancy Astor, the first woman to take her seat in the House of Commons, as both a Conservative and a fellow Anglo-American. Women2win is making great strides to secure better representation among women, without the party needing to resort to the expedient of all-women shortlists, proving that positive action does not necessarily mean affirmative action.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o326"><a name="80306-0019.htm_para6"><a name="08030641000883">Helping to encourage the right women to be selected for winnable seats is a challenge that my right hon. Friend the Member for Witney (Mr. Cameron) has set us. It is a challenge that we are undoubtedly meeting, with one third of the prospective candidates whom we have so far selected being women, as we heard earlier. All the women selected have shown not only what can be achieved on merit alone, but that the Conservative party is doing what it must to improve representation of women among its candidates. Notwithstanding all that, the figure of one third is only a start. I am confident that, in the spirit of 1997, things can only get better.</p>

<a name="80306-0019.htm_brev1"><a name="08030641001031"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;I should like to have a Return laid before this House of the number of women who are annually beaten to death, kicked to death, or trampled to death by their male protectors...We should then have an arithmetical estimate of the value set by a male legislature and male tribunals on the murder of a woman, often by torture continued through years, which, if there is any shame in us, would make us hang our heads.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o328"><a name="80306-0019.htm_para8"><a name="08030641000885">The issue is no longer the values set by a male legislature or a male judiciary, because we have made great advances in those respects. Nevertheless, as we heard earlier, violence against women, the practice of forced marriage, human trafficking, female genital mutilation and that most unpleasant misnomer, &#147;honour killing&#148;, are all alive and well in 21st century Britain. Thankfully, there is no need for us to argue that those things are wrong. We all know far better than that. However, the culture may have changed in Westminster, but it has not always changed out in the real world, and that is still the challenge to us in all parts of the House.</p>

As the hon. Member for East Dunbartonshire (Jo Swinson) pointed out, the median pay gap between male and female full-time workers fell from 17.4 per cent. in 1997 to 12.6 per cent. in 2007, while the mean figure fell from 20.7 to 17.2 per cent. in the same period.

workers has &#147;remained fairly static,&#148; at around 40 per cent. Although there has been some progress, clearly we can all do better. Some 28,000 sexual discrimination cases were taken to employment tribunals last year, which is double the figure of the previous year. Since I am an optimist, I interpret that as evidence of a greater awareness among women of their rights, rather than of a greater incidence of discrimination, but the figures should nevertheless give us pause.</p>

 I have cut my speech down a great deal, and I shall start very near the end.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o333"><a name="80306-0019.htm_para13"><a name="08030641000891">Since February 1999, there has been a campaign for changes to the customs and practices of some of our ethnic communities, in order to improve the lot of young women born here or brought in from the sub-continent as a spouse. My friend, Alice Mahon, then the MP for Halifax, and I had an Adjournment debate on the subject of forced marriages. We did so not because we woke up one morning and searched around for an Adjournment debate topic, but because we were becoming aware of, and alarmed by, the increasing number of young ladies of Asian descent coming to us for help. They usually wanted us to ask a high commission, often the one in Islamabad, to put a stop on the provision of an entry clearance visa for their so-called husband.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o334"><a name="80306-0019.htm_para14"><a name="08030641000892">In the past nine years, things have moved on enormously. Forced marriage is no longer a taboo subject, and police forces such as that in West Yorkshire have developed excellent practices for helping victims. I should like to mention Philip Balmforth, who is employed jointly by the West Yorkshire police authority and Bradford social services. He must now be a world authority on rescuing victims and ensuring their safety. The consular section of the Islamabad high commission, with the help of the  <br>

local Pakistani police, has developed some very good methods for rescuing victims and getting them to safety. The forced marriage unit here in London, funded jointly by the Foreign Office and the Home Office, is doing sterling work in giving advice. The Home Affairs Committee is looking into how further improvements can be made.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o335"><a name="80306-0019.htm_para15"><a name="08030641000893">However, all our work is with victims and potential victims. The ideas that I started off with, of winning the hearts and minds of community and religious leaders&#151;and, though them, those of the families and wider biradaris&#151;have not reached anything like fruition. Communities are still in denial, and those practices continue apace. I therefore hope and trust that the Forced Marriage (Civil Protection) Act 2007, which comes into force in September, and the changes to immigration regulations that are now out for consultation, will eventually stop these mediaeval practices, or at least reduce their numbers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o336"><a name="80306-0019.htm_para16"><a name="08030641000894">On a vaguely related subject&#151;again, I am treading on eggshells&#151;I will continue to encourage primary care trusts to advise communities to move away from the practice of cousin marriages. Yes, many children born to such marriages are perfectly healthy, and some children born to parents who are not related suffer from birth defects. However, Bradford has the second highest number of infant deaths in England. A study by the paediatrics department at Bradford royal infirmary, led by Dr. Peter Corry, has so far identified 148 different autosomal recessive genetic conditions in child patients over recent years. Dr. Corry estimates that a typical British health district might see between 20 and 30 such conditions. There is a growing recognition of such problems by the younger generation, but that is not the case with older people and those brought in from the sub-continent for marriage. The Bradford and Airedale Teaching Primary Care Trust should be supporting a younger, enlightened generation by encouraging community elders, and parents arranging marriages, to move away from cousin marriages.</p>

I look forward to seeing women bishops, and I have spoken at one or two meetings about that. However, I shall have to give up now, as someone else wants to speak.</p>

afternoon. Such achievements give us an indication of what can be done for people facing far greater challenges than those that we face in this country.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o339"><a name="80306-0019.htm_para19"><a name="08030641000898">In this country, there is absolutely no doubt that the position of women is getting better, but it is still wrong. Part-time working women earn less than part-time working men. There is the paradox, of course, that while part-time working women in manual jobs earn less than men and part-time working women in white-collar jobs earn less than men, if we take part-time working women as a whole, they earn more per hour than men. That is because more of them are in white-collar jobs, which means they are more qualified, and also because working-class jobs were traditionally for men.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o340"><a name="80306-0019.htm_para20"><a name="08030641000899">That will change, and I hope we will see changes in the sort of things I observed when I first became a Member of Parliament. When I was an MP representing a south-east London constituency, I visited a girls&#146; school&#151;a dame&#146;s school, meaning that the headmistress had become a dame, but she had actually left&#151;and found that not a single school leaver from this school of 1,200 girls had an A-level in maths, physics or chemistry. We cannot claim that we are providing opportunity for all in comprehensive schools if children get no A-levels in maths, physics or chemistry. I am not saying that they are not capable of doing it, but those who are capable&#151;there should be a spread of them in schools&#151;should be able to do it. It is often a want of ambition, a want of expectation or a want of something&#151;whatever it is, it needs changing.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o341"><a name="80306-0019.htm_para21"><a name="08030641000900">When I went to a secondary school in Westminster and asked when a pupil last got an A grade in mathematics, the school did not know. I hope that that sort of thing is changing. I will do all I can to support the achievement of good results in the so-called hard subjects&#151;in fact, I think maths, physics and other such subjects are easier, because there are right and wrong answers. We will make a change and raise expectations so that more people can go into the professions and educational lines of work&#151;qualifications matter.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o342"><a name="80306-0019.htm_para22"><a name="08030641000901">It is odd to think back to when I was a junior Minister in the Department of Employment. I discovered&#151;or rather, I was told, as I did not discover it myself&#151;that 80 per cent. of our first-line managers were female, and within two promotion grades 60 per cent. were male. Part of that was due to the fact that one had to apply for promotion rather than be given it; and part of it was a conspiracy between the management and the unions that one could not get a second promotion until a certain number of years had passed. Many women were mothers, but the fact that many male workers were fathers did not seem to matter, as they did not take time off work.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o343"><a name="80306-0019.htm_para23"><a name="08030641000902">In some ways, we expect women to take on the responsibilities and opportunities of their fathers while maintaining the responsibilities of their mothers. We should stop saying that women who are not in paid employment are not working. I have not yet met a woman with family responsibilities who was not working&#151;or probably not doing even more work than most of their men would willingly put up with for long. They certainly carry the burden of looking after many of the older generation who need help.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o344"><a name="80306-0019.htm_para24"><a name="08030641000903">Incidentally, may I say in passing that to regard our present parliamentary hours, particularly when we  <br>

start early, as &#147;family friendly&#148; is absolute nonsense? One cannot take a child to primary school if one needs to be at work at 9 o&#146;clock in the morning and one cannot look after an elderly parent during the day if one has to be here. In fact, the older hours were far more compatible with family responsibilities than the present ones, but that is a side issue.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o345"><a name="80306-0019.htm_para25"><a name="08030641000904">There is not enough time to go into a number of other issues that I would have liked to cover at some length. I believe that those who make appointments should always ask themselves who are the women who can be considered on merit as well as who are the men who come naturally to mind.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o346"><a name="80306-0019.htm_para26"><a name="08030641000905">Let me provide another anecdote. When I was appointing a street works advisory committee to look into services under the roads&#151;telephone, computer, electricity, gas and the like&#151;11 names were put forward. I asked those who provided the advice to come and have a chat as I had noticed that all 11 were male. They said that that was due to chance. I asked what categories were being filled. They said they wanted to have someone who had been head of transportation for a major highway authority. When I said that a woman retiring from the Greater London council would also qualify, they said that they had forgotten about her. When I suggested a professor of electronics or engineering, they said, &#147;Name one&#148;, so I named one from the university of Surrey. I said that I did not know all the universities around the country. It was suggested that we met again a week or so later. We came back with 11 names and appointed all 11: six were women and no one raised an eyebrow, because they were all clearly qualified to fill the categories for which advice was sought. Those sorts of things matter. </p>

<p><a name="stpa_o347"><a name="80306-0019.htm_para27"><a name="08030641000906">Let me end, if I may, by paying tribute to my wife, who was one of those women who had not really thought of coming to the House of Commons. She once thought that the only time she would come here would be if I got run over by a bus and she would be the grieving widow, gently smiling and dabbing her eyes. In fact, she was approached and told that she was on most people&#146;s lists. She would not have come here if the suggestion had not been made to her. I think that just as we suggest to people that they should consider becoming nurses, doctors or teachers, or becoming involved in some enterprise, we ought to encourage more talented people to stand for election. We know that women can perform their roles in the Cabinet, as Members of Parliament and as councillors, and I think we should try to ensure that we do not just wait for the volunteers.</p>

she lost her job because men were returning from the first world war and she was told that she was doing men&#146;s work, so perhaps that 90th anniversary is not such a great symbol after all.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o350"><a name="80306-0019.htm_para30"><a name="08030641000910">If we want a real symbol of the change in attitudes we should think of 1997, when the culture of the House of Commons changed radically and inevitably. Those of us who were here before 1997 will know how much it changed. I do not mean just the way which we dealt with each other outside the Chamber. Anyone who glances at a 15-year-old Order Paper will observe a very different set of priorities and preoccupations, and that is a result of the arrival of so many female Members. Most of them are on the Labour Benches&#151;my sisters&#151;but I think that attitudes have changed in all parts of the House, and for the better.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o351"><a name="80306-0019.htm_para31"><a name="08030641000911">When we take stock of what this Government have done, we see that there have been tremendous achievements. I do not have time to list them all. Instead, I shall mention an area in which we need to make more progress: equal pay. While I agree that we will need the pay audits that were mentioned earlier if we are to see the pay revolution that we want, we should also recognise that many women&#146;s roles as carers or mothers mean that their careers do not operate on the same basis as men&#146;s. That is at least part of the reason for the fact that the pay gap is still so wide.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o352"><a name="80306-0019.htm_para32"><a name="08030641000912">Probably more than half the work force have worked flexibly in the past 12 months, but some of that flexibility may not be good for employees&#146; families. Perhaps we need a different kind of flexibility. We should ask what flexibility really means in our society, and we should extend the concept of how we offer it to members of the work force. As Members in all parts of the House have pointed out, because of the type of career that women pursue they often undersell themselves in the labour market relative to their qualifications, and as a result drift into less secure occupations. Very different patterns of employment now exist. Women are often temporary and agency workers&#151;there is a continuing debate about that&#151;and the fact that they occupy such positions makes them more vulnerable. It leads to a continuing cycle of low pay, which will also affect women&#146;s pensions at the end of their working lives.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o353"><a name="80306-0019.htm_para33"><a name="08030641000913">As this is international women&#146;s day, let me say something about the international situation. Two thirds of the 1.3 billion people living in desperate poverty on the planet are women, as are some three quarters of the nearly 900 million who are functionally illiterate. The hon. Member for North-East Bedfordshire (Alistair Burt) said that the need for water was one of the great needs of our planet, but education is another. The task of liberating a generation of women globally through the power of education is a challenge that is enormous but achievable. I am proud of the Government&#146;s record on international development, and the specific investment in education programmes. Such measures are fundamentally important if we are to change the way in which the world operates.</p>

ensure that Britain ratifies the European convention on trafficking, and that the International Labour Organisation is given real teeth.

Friend the Member for Basingstoke (Mrs. Miller) made a number of points, rightly saying that we should seriously consider why women do not take up careers in Parliament in order to serve their community and their country. The hon. Member for Slough (Fiona Mactaggart) highlighted the impact that women MPs have had in the House, rightly pointing out the influence that they have had in Select Committees, such as the Select Committee on Defence.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o365"><a name="80306-0020.htm_para11"><a name="08030641000934">My hon. Friend the Member for Buckingham (John Bercow) spoke with his usual eloquence, and there was universal support for him in mentioning the need for a crèche in the Commons. My hon. Friend the Member for North-East Bedfordshire (Alistair Burt) gave a typically thoughtful and compassionate speech. His experiences in Rwanda, particularly as regards women ensuring that there was clean water for themselves and their families, were particularly noted by all of us.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o366"><a name="80306-0020.htm_para12"><a name="08030641000935">The hon. Member for Dundee, East (Stewart Hosie) gave a good explanation of what is happening in the Scottish Parliament. As he said, that point has even been made by Hillary Clinton in the US election campaign. My hon. Friend the Member for Braintree (Mr. Newmark) gave a learned speech. Long may he continue to do sterling work as joint chairman of women2win.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o367"><a name="80306-0020.htm_para13"><a name="08030641000936">I pay tribute to the hon. Member for Keighley (Mrs. Cryer), who brought her welcome expertise to this debate. Despite considerable opposition at times, she has stayed firm on issues that are now recognised by others as deserving of serious consideration. My hon. Friend the Member for Worthing, West (Peter Bottomley) put matters in perspective when he told us that there are more widows in India than there are women in this country.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o368"><a name="80306-0020.htm_para14"><a name="08030641000937">The hon. Member for Manchester, Central (Tony Lloyd) concluded by referring to the continuing theme of the need for a change in culture in the House, and he also rightly pointed out the issue of human trafficking. In my constituency, the Cambridgeshire police have done sterling work in trying to deal with human trafficking and the desperate situation where a woman can be bought in a pub for &#163;1,000 in Peterborough.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o369"><a name="80306-0020.htm_para15"><a name="08030641000938">Despite the heat of the speech given by the Leader of the House at the start of the proceedings, the debate has been a good one. I hope that in a small way we have played a role in helping to further the cause of women throughout the world.</p>

 I am grateful for all the contributions that have been made today. The hon. Member for Epping Forest (Mrs. Laing) said that there is no such thing as a women&#146;s issue, and the huge range of topics covered today illustrates the truth of that statement. We have had 30 speakers and I am glad to say that many of them were men. Women cannot do this alone, and I want to work with men in the House and outside to correct the democratic deficit that we face.</p>

ministerial role as speaking, and I have done quite a bit of the former today. I shall try to address some of the main points that were raised today.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o371"><a name="80306-0020.htm_para17"><a name="08030641000941">Only 19.5 per cent. of the Members of this House are women, and that is a shamefully low statistic. Many people have mentioned the 48.8 per cent. of women MPs in Rwanda and the 32.8 per cent. in South Africa. Even Afghanistan has 27 per cent., so we have a long way to go. The same applies at local government level, with only 29 per cent. of local councillors being female, a shamefully tiny fraction of whom are from black and ethnic minority communities. There are no Asian woman MPs. In public life, in the judiciary and the upper echelons of our civil service and financial sector, women remain woefully under-represented. But things are being done to correct that, and I am glad to say that we have made significant advances over the last decade&#151;even getting the hon. Member for Braintree (Mr. Newmark) to join women2win, about which I am very pleased&#151;<i> [</i><i> Interruption.</i><i> ]</i> I am not being sarcastic: I cannot express how much I welcome the change of heart on both sides of the House. We have recognised the part that women have to play in politics and we are acting on it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o372"><a name="80306-0020.htm_para18"><a name="08030641000942">I am grateful to my right hon. Friend the Member for Cynon Valley (Ann Clwyd) for reminding us of the inspiring work done by women inside and outside the House, and for her measured assessment of what I regard as one of our greatest achievements. The hon. Member for Buckingham (John Bercow) and I had the pleasure of serving on the Committee considering the minimum wage legislation, and I well remember the 36-hour filibusters in which he took part. As my right hon. and learned Friend the Minister for Women and Equality stressed, that legislation has virtually eradicated the gender pay gap at lower income levels&#151;and I know that the hon. Gentleman has reviewed his position on the minimum wage.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o373"><a name="80306-0020.htm_para19"><a name="08030641000943">I also welcome the assurance that my right hon. and learned Friend gave that we will extend the provisions that allow positive action in parliamentary selections. I do not like them&#151;no one likes them or wants positive action&#151;but without them, I fear that we would not achieve for several hundred years the representation in this House that women deserve.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o374"><a name="80306-0020.htm_para20"><a name="08030641000944">The right hon. Member for Maidenhead (Mrs. May) raised several important points, not least of which was the need for affordable child care. As a mother of five and grandmother of four, I am glad to say that since 1997 the number of child care places in this country has doubled, and the Government are providing a staggering &#163;3 million a day through the working tax credit to help parents meet the cost.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o375"><a name="80306-0020.htm_para21"><a name="08030641000945">The right hon. Lady also raised the issue of trafficking. Like her, the Government regard trafficking as a modern form of slavery, which is why we have signed the European convention and are taking the necessary steps to ratify it by the end of this year. It is also why we are doing so much to support the victims of this truly horrible trade. As the right hon. Lady knows, the Government are reviewing their prostitution strategy and looking closely at measures to reduce the demand for that service. I pay  <br>

<p><a name="stpa_o376"><a name="80306-0020.htm_para22"><a name="08030641000946">I want to clarify the point made by my right hon. and learned Friend the Minister for Women and Equality about the Domestic Violence, Crime and Victims Act 2004. This week, the Government announced that in the summer we will introduce domestic violence homicide reviews. We are considering the timetable for the introduction of restraining orders, as set out in section 9 of the Act, which is one of our priorities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o377"><a name="80306-0020.htm_para23"><a name="08030641000947">Like the hon. Member for East Dunbartonshire (Jo Swinson), I am saddened by the fact that almost 40 years after the Equal Pay Act 1970 was passed there is still a gender pay gap in this country. I am glad to say that it is slightly less than she said: it is not 17.9 per cent. but 12.6 per cent.</p>

 Yes, but there has been a drop and I am glad about it. However, the gap remains unacceptably high for full-time and part-time workers. We hope to address some of the causes in the equality Bill that will be announced in the Queen&#146;s Speech in November. We need transparency and enforcement.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o378"><a name="80306-0020.htm_para24"><a name="08030641000950">I do not think that any of the measures would have been introduced had it not been for the vastly increased representation of women in this House. I will be happy to work with both Opposition Front Benchers to attract more women into a parliamentary career. My feeling is that the long-hours culture in this place is a disincentive, but I know that that is a highly contentious subject that we could argue about well into the night.</p>

 Let us not.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o379"><a name="80306-0020.htm_para25"><a name="08030641000953">My hon. Friend the Member for Crawley (Laura Moffatt) highlighted the benefits of the university campus that is being built in her constituency, which will bring black, Asian and minority ethnic women into the university arena. As 40 per cent. of women of Bangladeshi origin living in this country have no educational qualifications at all, we have do what we can to ensure that such women access the available opportunities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o380"><a name="80306-0020.htm_para26"><a name="08030641000954">As the hon. Member for Epping Forest emphasised, we must also ensure that the 44 million girls in the developing world who will go to bed tonight without having gone to school and with no prospect of going to school get the chance to go. It is pointless investing millions in developing countries if people do not have the skills to make progress.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o381"><a name="80306-0020.htm_para27"><a name="08030641000955">Health was mentioned several times, and like my hon. Friend the Member for Crawley, I am glad that chlamydia screening has been rolled out in 88 per cent. of all primary care trusts in England. I am also extremely glad that girls of 11 are receiving injections to protect them against the scourge of cervical cancer. One of my daughters is a junior doctor in a London hospital and&#151;believe me&#151;I am all too aware of the failings in the system. I was pleased by the Health Secretary&#146;s  <br>

I am also aware of the vital role played by rape crisis centres and my right hon. and learned Friend and I are working across Government to ensure that they are integrated in and work with the new sexual assault referral centres.

<a name="ordayhd_23"><a name="80306-0021.htm_ordayhd0"><a name="08030641001065"><h5 align="left">6.1 pm</h5>
<p><a name="st_o523"><a name="08030641000967"><a name="80306-0021.htm_spnew0"><a name="08030641001607"><b>Mr. Richard Benyon (Newbury) (Con):</b>
 It is a great pleasure to be able to raise this matter. I welcome the Minister to his place, as he has been extremely courteous to me in my short time in the House. I think that I must be one of the higher-maintenance Members for him and his Department, for a host of reasons. I place on the record my gratitude to him and his civil servants for the courtesy and tenacity with which they have taken up a number of matters. I have another for him tonight, which is related to a military installation in my constituency called RAF Welford.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o390"><a name="80306-0021.htm_para1"><a name="08030641000968">RAF Welford is a former wartime air base. During the second world war it was visited by both Churchill and General Eisenhower and considered to be of major strategic importance to this country and our allies. It remains so today, because it is now one of the largest ammunition storage facilities in Europe. It is currently under the command of the 420th Munitions Squadron, in support of the 501st Combat Support Wing at Fairford. That is a United States air force forward operating air base, last used in operational circumstances as recently as 2003 in the Gulf war.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o391"><a name="80306-0021.htm_para2"><a name="08030641000969">The site at Welford covers more than 800 acres in isolated Berkshire downland, but it is accessible. It is only 38 miles from its parent base at Fairford, and has access to the M4. Having its own access to a major arterial motorway is one of its unique features. It is used to store large, air-delivered bombs, many of which are extremely old. On my visit there today, I heard of plans to reduce the amount of ordnance stored there by roughly half, principally because of the reduction in the use of so-called dumb bombs in favour of so-called smart bombs. Today&#146;s armed forces need less ordnance to achieve the same result, and much of the ordnance there dates back to the Vietnam war. RAF Welford is an extraordinary place to visit. From the ground one can see the extraordinary earth bunds, which are also visible on Google Earth. Much of the ordnance is still sitting out in the open air, although much of it is now being covered.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o392"><a name="80306-0021.htm_para3"><a name="08030641000970">About last October, rumours started to be heard in the air around west Berkshire of the removal of Ministry of Defence armed guards from the base at RAF Welford and their replacement with a much smaller number of unarmed civilian guards, possibly members of the MOD&#146;s civilian guard service. I saw it as part of my job to calm some of the concern. At that stage no one knew whether RAF Welford had a future or whether it would continue to store high explosive munitions. If no munitions were to be stored there and it was to become a place where the occasional trenching tool or mess tin was stored, there would be no need for the type of guard service that is there now. Clearly, however, it is still being used as a munitions store.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o393"><a name="80306-0021.htm_para4"><a name="08030641000971">I wrote to the Secretary of State to raise the local concerns, and I received a letter from the Under-Secretary of State for Defence on 20 January. He set out a number of points, but the most important is:</p>

</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o395"><a name="80306-0021.htm_para6"><a name="08030641000973">Later in the letter, the Minister states:</p>
<a name="80306-0021.htm_brev2"><a name="08030641001041"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;I would, however, like to assure you that the security arrangements at all bases, including RAF Welford, remains an important priority to both the MOD and the USVF and that any changes that might take place will only occur if they are both suitable and appropriate to the circumstances and do not compromise the overall level of security.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o396"><a name="80306-0021.htm_para7"><a name="08030641000974">That was a welcome assurance as far as it went, but it did not allay the concerns of the people who work at RAF Welford or who live close to it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o397"><a name="80306-0021.htm_para8"><a name="08030641000975">On my visit to the base, I met the commanding officer of Welford, his superior from Mildenhall and the liaising RAF personnel from Fairford and Mildenhall. It is clear that, although Welford now stores less tonnage of ordnance, it remains very important to the USAF. A considerable investment is being made in buildings and infrastructure on the base. </p>

<p><a name="stpa_o398"><a name="80306-0021.htm_para9"><a name="08030641000976">The purpose of this debate is to draw from the Minister what the review of the security arrangements is about and the implications for local people and those who work at RAF Welford. I hope that he will also address concerns arising in other parts of the country where such reviews are starting to be discussed, and those of the wider community in the present climate. The level of threat to this building is &#147;severe&#148;, which is not as high as &#147;critical&#148;, but it shows that we live in a dangerous world.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o399"><a name="80306-0021.htm_para10"><a name="08030641000977">Obviously, I shall not discuss in any detail the precise form of current security provision at the base. I am sure that the Minister would not thank me for doing so and will not do so himself. Suffice it to say that the current provision is comprehensive: it is a full security package provided by armed MOD police officers with access to dogs. Local people tell me that they are an extremely assiduous group of officers and that anyone who approaches the perimeter for some legitimate reason is approached immediately. However, the information we have is that those officers, who are highly professional and highly trained, are to be replaced by a much smaller number of unarmed guards, and that is the basis for a degree of concern. I therefore have several questions to which I would like the Minister to respond.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o400"><a name="80306-0021.htm_para11"><a name="08030641000978">In 2006, RAF Welford was designated a strategic site under the Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005. That puts it alongside the Atomic Weapons Establishment at Aldermaston&#151;also in my constituency&#151;Burghfield, Devonport, Faslane, Lakenheath and two or three other important sites. Only two of the sites listed under the 2005 Act are not protected by armed MOD police: the headquarters at Northwood, which is protected by the Royal Marines, and, I believe, Feltwell, which is a base close to Lakenheath, and the MOD police from Lakenheath cover that area. The proposal is that the armed guards go, but what has changed since 2006? Prior to the deployment of armed Ministry of Defence police, there were a number of incursions on to the base by so-called peace protesters. Under the Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005, such incursions can result in imprisonment, however benign the intent  <br>

of those responsible. Since the MOD police have been on the site, I believe that there have been no such incursions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o401"><a name="80306-0021.htm_para12"><a name="08030641000979">Moving on to my second point, I have been told that it is difficult to envisage any circumstances in which MOD police on the site would be required, under the rules of engagement, to use the weapons that they carry, and that they have to be trained to use. One might therefore ask what the point is of having armed police on the site. My understanding is that under section 3 of the Criminal Law Act 1967, any of the MOD personnel may use force, up to and including lethal force, if it is a reasonable action taken in order to save life. It is obviously not necessary to have armed guards to protect property, because they could not use their weapons for that purpose, but if someone intended to remove munitions from the site for use elsewhere, or wanted to detonate a bomb on the site, they could be required to use their weapons.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o402"><a name="80306-0021.htm_para13"><a name="08030641000980">It was made clear to me when I was on the site today that the size of the munitions stored there&#151;the smallest is about 500 lb, and there are bombs of up to 2,000 lb&#151;means that we are not talking about the sort of thing that someone could remove from the site under their coat or over their shoulder. Some form of heavy-lifting equipment would be required. Nevertheless, an assessment was made and a risk was identified. That risk is deemed to be no longer applicable.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o403"><a name="80306-0021.htm_para14"><a name="08030641000981">My third point is that it is important to know whether the current review of the threat is being cross-checked with the assessment of our Security Service and the police. What may not be a threat to the United States air force may well be envisaged to be a threat by our security services. It is important that local people be given an assurance that the proposal is not a cost-cutting exercise by one or both of the organisations concerned. Obviously thought has been given to what would replace the MOD police officers. It has been hinted that in addition to any provision made, MOD police at Fairford could provide back-up, but there is talk of their numbers being reduced as a result of a parallel review. At times of high traffic, Fairford is a good hour away from RAF Welford, even though it is only 38 miles away as the crow flies.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o404"><a name="80306-0021.htm_para15"><a name="08030641000982">It has been hinted that Thames Valley police can provide back-up to anyone on the site, and that arrangements will be made with them, but that aspect of the issue causes me great concern. Thames Valley police force has undergone a reorganisation in recent years, which has resulted in a basic command unit that includes west Berkshire, Wokingham and Reading. West Berkshire is a low-crime area&#151;long may it remain so&#151;but Reading has a much higher crime rate. It is only through the tenacity of our local superintendent and his predecessors, the actions of a number of partners, and the support of the chief constable that we manage to keep police numbers up in west Berkshire to a fair degree. However, I have to say that police are pretty thin on the ground, particularly in the rural downlands. Members of the rural community frequently complain that there are not enough police officers out in those rural areas.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o405"><a name="80306-0021.htm_para16"><a name="08030641000983">It is frankly fanciful to believe that there are roaming patrols in the Hungerford and Newbury area that could be at RAF Welford in seconds flat in response to an incursion on to the site. It is also fanciful to believe that  <br>

there is a Thames Valley police armed response unit that could respond with any degree of speed in such circumstances. We are also led to believe that technology can now assist in the security of such sites. I am sure that there is a degree of truth in that&#151;sensors, CCTV and new lighting can all deter people from entering such sites. However, those are of use only if there is somebody to monitor them and others to respond when they are activated. What is the Minister&#146;s response on that? Will he give an assurance that the issue will not be yet another burden on our hard-pressed local police force? What alternative deployments or prospects will be offered to the highly respected Ministry of Defence police officers working on the site? Will there be proper consultation with the Ministry of Defence Police Federation, which has great concerns about this matter?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o406"><a name="80306-0021.htm_para17"><a name="08030641000984">As I said, I have calmed&#151;or done my best to calm&#151;some local concerns. I am prepared to do more placating of the rumour mill if the Government give me a little more assurance than the Minister did in  his letter. I accept that there may be entirely understandable reasons why a reduction might be necessary; I am the first to accept that terrorist or criminal threats need to be constantly assessed in relation to the protection of what is stored in the base and its physical infrastructure.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o407"><a name="80306-0021.htm_para18"><a name="08030641000985">However, we need to be assured that such circumstances as result from the review will be arrived at by proper joint working between us, as host nation, and the United States air force. I understand that the memorandum of understanding that forms the basis for the contractual arrangements for the guarding of US bases is being updated; it was first published in 1980. It would be helpful to know whether the proposal forms part of that updating.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o408"><a name="80306-0021.htm_para19"><a name="08030641000986">I am extremely proud that a United States air force base is in my constituency. Greenham Common, in my constituency, is synonymous with so many things but, contrary to what people might have thought from what they saw on &#147;News at Ten&#148; every night at the time of the cruise missile deployment, the relationship between the United States visiting forces when they were there and the town of Newbury, which is so close, was extremely strong.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o409"><a name="80306-0021.htm_para20"><a name="08030641000987">As the local MP, it is a matter of pride to me that the forces are here. I want to make sure that the base is properly protected, and I hope that it continues in the area. I should like to place it on the record that I enjoyed meeting the United States personnel on my visit. I hope that they and us, the local people, continue to have a long relationship. I look forward to the Minister&#146;s response.</p>

matter personally with the Secretary of State for Defence, and I am happy to confirm the assurance that he has already been given in the House today.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o410"><a name="80306-0021.htm_para21"><a name="08030641000989">RAF Welford is made available to the United States visiting force under the NATO status of forces agreement of 1951 and other arrangements, which are appropriate to the relationship between the UK and the US for the purpose of our common defence. The United States visiting force is present in the UK at the invitation of the UK Government, and demonstrates the special relationship that exists between our two Governments.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o411"><a name="80306-0021.htm_para22"><a name="08030641000990">Although considerably reduced since the end of the cold war, the USVF forms an important part of the continuing US commitment to NATO and the security of this country. That importance is much more than just symbolic; direct support is provided to NATO forces and coalition forces&#151;including, of course, UK forces.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o412"><a name="80306-0021.htm_para23"><a name="08030641000991">The UK welcomes that commitment and the contribution that the US forces provide to NATO, which remains the cornerstone of Europe&#146;s security policy and the only organisation guaranteeing its members&#146; collective defence. Under the 1951 agreement, the Secretary of State for Defence retains legal possession and control over all sites made available to the USVF, including RAF Welford. The sites continue to be known as RAF stations for the simple reason that they are RAF stations playing host to units from the US armed forces stationed in this country.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o413"><a name="80306-0021.htm_para24"><a name="08030641000992">The USVF units remain responsible for administering their own routine, day-to-day activities. They use the RAF stations on licence technically as a matter of comity between sovereign powers and rather than as a matter of landlord and tenant. But article 2 of the NATO status of forces agreement is clear in its statement that:</p>
<a name="80306-0021.htm_brev3"><a name="08030641000993"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;It is the duty of a [visiting] force and its civilian component and the members thereof as well as their dependents to respect the law of the receiving State.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o414"><a name="80306-0021.htm_para25"><a name="08030641000994">We play host to a significant population of US service personnel, their civilian support personnel and their families. There are currently approximately 12,000 members of the USVF stationed at the 10 USVF bases in the United Kingdom, making a valuable contribution to our collective defence. In addition, there are a similar number of dependants, making a total USVF plus dependants of some 24,000. We should not forget that we have a responsibility to provide those personnel with a safe and secure environment and to support the important work they do, so that it is not disrupted or undermined.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o415"><a name="80306-0021.htm_para26"><a name="08030641000995">As the hon. Gentleman has highlighted by initiating this debate, any armed forces establishment is likely to contain dangerous materials. This is certainly true of RAF Welford. In those circumstances, safety is paramount, and any unauthorised incursions into military establishments may present a risk. The various warning signs around the base are there for the safety of the public as well as for the security of the base. Of course signs are not enough and it may be of value if I outline to the House the arrangements in place for the security of USVF bases.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o416"><a name="80306-0021.htm_para27"><a name="08030641000996">The degree of protection at Ministry of Defence establishments and sites used by the USVF will vary from site to site according to the location, the nature of the establishment and the risk to the site. Security measures are informed by threat assessments, which are derived from available intelligence. That involves risk management decisions, taking into account the effectiveness and proportionality of countermeasures.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o417"><a name="80306-0021.htm_para28"><a name="08030641000997">It is the UK's responsibility as the host nation to provide and fund the appropriate level of external security to RAF bases made available to the USVF in the same way as support would be provided to any MOD establishment with a similar role. In addition, the host nation will take into account legal and policy restrictions placed on the USVF and acknowledged sensitivities and concerns associated with conducting global operations while based in an overseas environment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o418"><a name="80306-0021.htm_para29"><a name="08030641000998">There are several options that may be considered for the protection of defence establishments. The first is unarmed guarding, the core of which is provided by the MOD guard service and comprises access control measures that can include personnel and vehicle searches and patrolling, where an unarmed guard provides a limited visual deterrent but may be limited in his or her ability to respond to an incident.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o419"><a name="80306-0021.htm_para30"><a name="08030641000999">The second option is defensive armed security. An armed guard at the entrance to a military establishment provides an important visual deterrent. An armed guard is also better placed to respond in the event of a terrorist incident if a suspect is armed, and is able to react quickly to an incident. Armed guarding at UK armed forces locations is provided by UK service personnel from the unit stationed at those locations or by the Military Provost Guard Service, a specialist unit designed for that purpose. Beyond that, however, the MOD has the option of deploying the MOD police to any location owned or run by the MOD. They bring with them the full range of constabulary powers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o420"><a name="80306-0021.htm_para31"><a name="08030641001000">In addition, police officers possess the skills to interact with personnel and the general public with a view to gathering intelligence, maintaining the peace, detecting and preventing crime and prosecuting offenders. With the agreement of the local police force they can work both inside and outside establishments. There are currently close to 4,000 personnel serving in  <br>

the MOD guard service, around 2,000 personnel in the Military Provost Guard Service and some 3,500 MOD police officers. They work at more than 200 locations across the country. May I take this opportunity to make clear my appreciation, and I am sure that of all hon. Members, for the work they do in maintaining the safety and security of the armed forces and the public?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o421"><a name="80306-0021.htm_para32"><a name="08030641001001">When it comes to the USVF sites, there are some variations in this pattern. The status of forces agreement places a responsibility on the visiting forces to maintain internal security at any location provided for them. That duty is also fair and reasonable. We would not invite forces to this country who did not recognise or understand such a duty. Those responsibilities and duties are fully recognised by the USVF. It maintains a security force that has jurisdiction over US service personnel and which can provide both armed and unarmed guards for these locations. The security force does not, however, have constabulary powers. For that they must draw on either the local police force or the MOD police. Discussions are taking place with the USVF on future arrangements as part of a wider review of security at its bases, including RAF Welford. It is too early to predict the outcome, as the hon. Gentleman will understand, having made a number of important points about that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o422"><a name="80306-0021.htm_para33"><a name="08030641001002">I assure the hon. Gentleman that the MOD continues to strive to adapt and improve the security measures already in place so that they meet the evolving threat, with priority given to the protection of life and those assets critical to the delivery of our defence capability. Our security policy and standards must be proportionate to the threat, effective, consistent and cost-effective. In attempting to gain efficient and cost- effective security, it is important to ensure that appropriate physical security measures are in place and to identify the right balance and number of personnel required to perform the task.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o423"><a name="80306-0021.htm_para34"><a name="08030641001003">In closing, I should like to assure the hon. Gentleman that the security arrangements at all bases, including RAF Welford, remain an important priority to both the MOD and the USVF. I further assure him that any changes that take place will occur only if they are suitable and appropriate and do not compromise the overall level of security.</p>
