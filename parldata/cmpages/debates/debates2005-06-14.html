 (Con): What assessment she has made of the provision of NHS dentistry in south Devon.  [3669]
</p>


<p><a name="st_5"><a name="50614-01_spmin0"><b>The Minister of State, Department of Health  (Ms Rosie Winterton): </b> 
 South Hams and West Devon, and Plymouth primary care trusts have received &#163;238,000 capital and &#163;102,000 revenue, 22 per cent. of practices have moved over to the new pilot contracts, and there are three new Polish dentists working in the area. Taken together, these developments are all helping to improve local access.
</p>





<p><a name="st_6"><a name="50614-01_spnew0"><b> Mr. Streeter: </b> 
 Eight years into a Labour Government, six years after a specific promise from the Prime Minister and one year after a debate in Westminster Hall on dentistry in Devon, why is not a single dental practice in south Devon taking on new NHS adult patients? How much longer will my constituents be kept waiting for the NHS dentistry that they deserve?
</p>





<p><a name="st_7"><a name="50614-01_spnew1"><b> Ms Winterton: </b> 
 As the hon. Gentleman pointed out, and as I am the first to admit, there have been problems in the area, which is exactly why we have targeted it for 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>14 Jun 2005 : Column 142</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>extra resources. As I said, the extra money has already led to new registrations. There have been 8,000 in the Plymouth area, but in the South Hams and West Devon area, the number will increase in line with the new money, with the new dentists coming into the area and with the gradual introduction of personal dental services contracts.
</p>





<p><a name="st_8"><a name="50614-01_spnew2"><b> Mr. Adrian Sanders  (Torbay)</b> 
 (LD): Is the Minister not aware that the number of dentists leaving NHS practice is rising faster than the number of new ones coming in? Only last week, a Torquay practice stopped taking NHS patients or even providing NHS treatment for children.
</p>





<p><a name="st_9"><a name="50614-01_spnew3"><b> Ms Winterton: </b> 
 I am of course aware that there continue to be some problems in particular areas, but, in fact, after a dip in 1998, the number of registrations is rising. That will take time to reach all parts of the country, which is exactly why we have introduced special access funding, why we are changing the system for delivering dentistry and why we have said that we will recruit another 1,000 dentists by this October. The hon. Gentleman&#039;s area is benefiting from that extra recruitment, although the registrations will take a little time to come through.
</p>





<p><a name="st_10"><a name="50614-01_spnew4"><b> Alison Seabeck  (Plymouth, Devonport)</b> 
 (Lab): I know that my hon. Friend is very aware of the problems facing the south-west and our difficulty in accessing dentists, but I also know that her Department is working hard to implement a range of measures designed to increase dentist numbers. What we ultimately need is a sustainable approach, so we need to train more dentists. Will she therefore welcome a bid from Plymouth for a new dental school?
</p>





<p><a name="st_11"><a name="50614-01_spnew5"><b> Ms Winterton: </b> 
 My hon. Friend is right to say that our reforms are making a gradual difference. Progress is slower in some parts of the country than in others, but as well as increasing investment by &#163;368 million from this year, recruiting an extra 1,000 dentists and changing the way that dentists work, a further major part of the reforms is our training of another 170 dentists a year from this October. This year, those 170 places will go to existing dental schools, but from next year we will welcome bids for some 91 places from existing schools, from new dental schools and, in some cases, from satellite schools, so that such schools can not only train dentists on site, but put them out into the community.

 (LD): A private dental practice in Teignbridge has secured nine new NHS dentists with the support of the district council, the PCT and myself. If we can do that, why cannot the Government?
</p>





<p><a name="st_13"><a name="50614-01_spnew7"><b> Ms Winterton: </b> 
 The hon. Gentleman will acknowledge that we had a meeting about that matter and that I was able to assist him in ensuring that his local primary care trust could put the contract through. The extra funding and commissioning at local level has meant that such changes can take place. That, combined with international recruitment, has made a difference in areas such as his.

<br>&nbsp;<br></p>





<p><a name="st_14"><a name="50614-01_spnew8"><b> Mr. Andrew Lansley  (South Cambridgeshire)</b> 
 (Con): Three months ago, I met Mr. Ian Stuckey, chairman of the south Devon dental committee, and it was clear from our discussions that, with no base contract, no progress made on the contract with dentists and no information about the future charging review, many dentists have no incentive to offer new NHS registrations. Frankly, the Minister is pouring money into a bath with the plug out. Will she tell the House when she is going to publish the review of patient charges that she received 15 months ago?
</p>





<p><a name="st_15"><a name="50614-01_spnew9"><b> Ms Winterton: </b> 
 I received Harry Cayton&#039;s report on patient charges in March 2004 and we are considering its implications. We now have approximately 5,300 dentists working under the new pilot contracts, which are similar to the contract that will eventually be produced, and we are reflecting on some of the implications of the charges in those pilots. We will publish our response to Harry Cayton&#039;s report shortly.
</p>





<p><a name="st_16"><a name="50614-01_spnew10"><b> Mr. Lansley: </b> 
 In south Devon, as we heard from my hon. Friend the Member for South-West Devon (Mr. Streeter), the proportion of people registered for NHS dentistry collapsed from more than 50 per cent. in 1997 to fewer than 30 per cent. now. The Minister is very fond of targets, so will she tell us what is her target for the proportion of people who should be registered for NHS dentistry?
</p>





<p><a name="st_17"><a name="50614-01_spnew11"><b> Ms Winterton: </b> 
 At its height, the number of people registered with an NHS dentist was about 55 per cent., but because of the changes in the re-registration of 1997, it fell to 49 per cent. The number went down over the next few years, but is now back up, we believe, to 49 per cent., so there has been a levelling off. It is early days, so the extent to which it is sustainable is not yet clear, but the changes that we have introduced are making a difference. As to the publication of the report and the continuation of those changes, I have already said that we shall respond shortly. I remind the hon. Gentleman that there are about 5,300 dentists working in the new wave in 2,000 practices across the country. I would certainly like anyone who wishes to register with an NHS dentist to be able to do so. That is the aim of our changes.
</p>





<p><a name="st_18"><a name="50614-01_spnew12"><b> Steve Webb  (Northavon)</b> 
 (LD): South Devon falls within the South West Peninsula strategic health authority, which has seen a dramatic fall in the proportion of children registered with an NHS dentist. In 1998, about two thirds were registered, but it is now fewer than half. Coming to this subject afresh, I sense a lack of urgency&#151;to put it charitably&#151;on the part of the Minister. After taking 15 months to consider a report, she talks about whether the levelling off will be sustainable. When will we get back to the rates that she inherited and when will we get them back to a decent level?
</p>





<p><a name="st_19"><a name="50614-01_spnew13"><b> Ms Winterton: </b> 
 Investing &#163;368 million more in dentistry, allowing dentists to move over to the new ways of working&#151;resulting, as I said, in 5,300 new dentists in 2,000 new practices&#151;recruiting an extra 1,000 dentists by October this year, introducing an expansion of dental training with 170 new dentists starting this year: I do not believe that all that shows a 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>14 Jun 2005 : Column 144</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>lack of urgency. Rather, it shows that we are tackling the problem. Progress is not as quick as we would all like and there are particular areas in the country with special problems, which is why we have established support teams working with local primary care trusts to improve local access. Nevertheless, we have introduced a radical reform that has shifted the balance of power from the centre to local areas. That means that money stays in local areas and it is increasing. We are also using international recruits and increasing the number of dentists by 1,000 from this October.

 (Lab): How many patients visited walk-in health centres in the last period for which figures are available; and if she will make a statement.  [3670]
</p>


<p><a name="st_20"><a name="50614-02_spmin0"><b>The Secretary of State for Health  (Ms Patricia Hewitt): </b> 
 I take this opportunity to pay tribute to the work of the muscular dystrophy society Parent Project UK in supporting children suffering from Duchenne muscular dystrophy. The Minister of State, my right hon. Friend the Member for Liverpool, Wavertree (Jane Kennedy), will meet a delegation from the group shortly. Some 2.1 million people visited NHS walk-in centres in the year to this March. That represents a 31 per cent. increase over the previous year and demonstrates that NHS walk-in centres are now established as a mainstream NHS service that increases patient choice.
</p>





<p><a name="st_21"><a name="50614-02_spnew0"><b> Andrew Gwynne: </b> 
 Walk-in centres are a key component in ensuring better access to health services and play a major role in addressing health inequalities. Will she say what discussions her Department will have with the Tameside and Glossop primary care trust, and the Stockport PCT, to ensure that the benefits of those excellent facilities are extended to the communities in Denton and Reddish, where they are not currently available?
</p>





<p><a name="st_22"><a name="50614-02_spnew1"><b> Ms Hewitt: </b> 
 I note that there are no NHS walk-in centres in my hon. Friend&#039;s constituency at present. Neither Tameside and Glossop PCT nor Stockport PCT has chosen to develop proposals for such a centre, although I am sure that both would welcome the opportunity to discuss the matter with him. I draw to his attention, and that of the local PCTs, the fact that &#163;18 million remains of the investment of &#163;50 million that we made available in 2003 to provide more walk-in centres. PCTs are welcome to bid for money to expand walk-in centre provision.
</p>





<p><a name="st_23"><a name="50614-02_spnew2"><b> Tony Baldry  (Banbury)</b> 
 (Con): Why was the Public Accounts Committee told that the simple cost of treatment for a person who goes to a general practitioner was &#163;15, whereas walk-in centre treatment cost &#163;25? Can the Secretary of State be confident that she is getting the best value for money out of walk-in centres?
</p>





<p><a name="st_24"><a name="50614-02_spnew3"><b> Ms Hewitt: </b> 
 I certainly can be confident that we are getting increasing value for money out of walk-in centres. When they were first opened, the usage of walk-

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>14 Jun 2005 : Column 145</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>in centres was lower than that of GP services, but that is to be expected with a new service. As a result, the cost per consultation was higher, but the cost per patient has been falling as awareness, and therefore usage, of walk-in centres has risen. I am confident that that trend will continue, because walk-in centres are popular and patients very satisfied with the service that they provide.
</p>





<p><a name="st_25"><a name="50614-02_spnew4"><b> Mr. Sadiq Khan  (Tooting)</b> 
 (Lab): Will my right hon. Friend join me in congratulating the walk-in centre at St. George&#039;s hospital in Tooting and its staff? They have worked hard since the centre opened and treated many thousands of local patients. That has freed up resources at the local accident and emergency department, and among local GPs, who think that such centres represent good value for money.
</p>





<p><a name="st_26"><a name="50614-02_spnew5"><b> Ms Hewitt: </b> 
 I entirely agree with my hon. Friend and readily join him in congratulating the excellent staff at the walk-in centre, the hospital and throughout the local health service. The great merit of walk-in centres is that they are open from 7 am to 10 pm, 365 days a year. They therefore extend access to NHS care to people who often find it difficult to go to a GP or who, in some cases, are not yet registered with one.
</p>





<p><a name="st_27"><a name="50614-02_spnew6"><b> Dr. Andrew Murrison  (Westbury)</b> 
 (Con): The uniqueness of our primary care is the enduring relationship that GPs have with patients, families and communities. That is especially important in the context of people with chronic disease. Most patients know that instinctively and would rather see their own doctor in their own community. Moreover, they would rather see their GP on a Saturday morning or in the evening than go and see someone who is&#151;with the greatest respect&#151;an anonymous technician off a railway station platform. Why are the Secretary of State&#039;s priorities so different from the priorities of patients?
</p>





<p><a name="st_28"><a name="50614-02_spnew7"><b> Ms Hewitt: </b> 
 Although this is my first appearance as Secretary of State for Health at Health questions, I fear that the hon. Gentleman&#039;s question is sadly typical of the willingness of Opposition Members to denigrate NHS staff. Perhaps he would like to join me on a visit to a walk-in centre, such as the excellent one at New Cross in south London that I visited a couple of weeks ago. The nurse practitioners staffing that centre, with the back-up of a GP, do superb work, to the great satisfaction of patients&#151;and I spoke to all of them.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50614-02_para0">
<a name="stpa_0">Of course, it is important that we ensure continuity of care and the integration of walk-in centre care with GP care. That is why a record of treatment provided by a walk-in centre is, with the patient&#039;s consent, made available to that patient&#039;s GP. However, in nine cases out of 10, it is not necessary for the walk-in centre to refer a patient back to a GP, as treatment can be provided on the spot. That is why walk-in centres are so popular, and why they are continuing to improve the quality of health service care.

<p><a name="st_29"><a name="50614-02_spmin1"><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Health  (Mr. Liam Byrne): </b> 
 We have a clearly understood approach to funding for children&#039;s hospices. It is for local NHS commissioners to determine the need for hospice provision for children in their local areas and to fund services accordingly. We will publish best practice guidance in the area shortly.
</p>





<p><a name="st_30"><a name="50614-02_spnew8"><b> Jeff Ennis: </b> 
 I welcome my hon. Friend to his new position on the Front Bench. Is he aware of early-day motion 220, which notes that adults&#039; and children&#039;s hospices are funded by the NHS through the same mechanism, via the local lead primary care trusts? In many respects, that funding mechanism lends itself more to adults&#039; hospices than to children&#039;s hospices. With that in mind, will he agree to meet me and representatives from the Association of Children&#039;s Hospices to discuss that important matter further?
</p>





<p><a name="st_31"><a name="50614-02_spnew9"><b> Mr. Byrne: </b> 
 I congratulate my hon. Friend on his tireless work on behalf of the hospice movement. I understand that Bluebell Wood hospice will shortly open in Dinnington, near his constituency, and he can take some pride in that achievement. Children&#039;s hospices and adults&#039; hospices are very different. In an adults&#039; hospice, 95 per cent. of patients suffer with cancer and their average stay is about 13 days. In a children&#039;s hospice, children may suffer from one of 14 different life-threatening conditions and may live for many years, and therefore the range of services they need&#151;educational, recreational, respite care or hospice care&#151;is very different. That is why local primary care commissioners need some flexibility in providing the right package of care. We need to take two further steps. We need to ensure that primary care trusts are clear about how to execute their responsibilities properly, and that is why we will publish national guidance very soon. Hospices also need to engage with primary care trusts, and I am pleased to say that the Association of Children&#039;s Hospices, supported by the Department of Health, will also publish guidance in that area.

 (Con): Quidenham children&#039;s hospice in Norfolk treats children with Duchenne muscular dystrophy, which the Secretary of State mentioned earlier. Is the Minister aware that age discrimination may be being practised against people who suffer from that tragic condition? If they are fortunate enough to reach the age of 21, which many do not, they can no longer be treated by a children&#039;s hospice, and adequate alternatives are not in place. He will know that there is a lobby on Duchenne muscular dystrophy today, and I was glad to hear the Secretary of State say that the Minister of State, the right hon. Member for Liverpool, Wavertree (Jane Kennedy), would meet people from that campaign later. Will the Minister look into my point and see what can be done?
</p>





<p><a name="st_33"><a name="50614-02_spnew11"><b> Mr. Byrne: </b> 
 I would be happy to do that. Our strategy in that area of policy is clear. The national service frameworks for children&#039;s health, and more broadly, set clear service standards. It is important that those promises are backed by the record extra investment in primary care. The average primary care trust will have an extra &#163;45 million or so in investment over the next two or three years, and that level of investment will make those standards real.

<p><a name="st_34"><a name="50614-02_spnew12"><b> Mr. Lindsay Hoyle  (Chorley)</b> 
 (Lab): I, too, welcome my hon. Friend to the Front Bench, but will he recognise that funding should not be down to the local primary care commissioners alone? The Derian House children&#039;s hospice in Chorley takes children from as far away as London and Scotland, so the whole burden should not be on local primary care and we should ensure more direct funding from the NHS to ease the burden locally. That would be only right, as hospices are the poor relation when it comes to direct funding from Government.
</p>





<p><a name="st_35"><a name="50614-02_spnew13"><b> Mr. Byrne: </b> 
 My hon. Friend has also been a champion for the hospice movement, on which I congratulate him. There are some 35 hospices around the country, which is an increase of 20 per cent. on 2004. The hospice movement is growing, but the fact that such a small number serve the entire country gives some the opportunity to specialise in particular conditions. That is why there will always be local specialisms that need to be plugged into primary care trust funding nationally. It is important that primary care trusts understand how best to commission services in those complex and sensitive areas. That is why national guidance is needed. I will take that national guidance out to several regional events to ensure that the new policy is bedded down on the ground.
</p>





<p><a name="st_36"><a name="50614-02_spnew14"><b> Mr. Simon Burns  (West Chelmsford)</b> 
 (Con): I add my welcome to the Minister to what is probably one of the best jobs in government. Why is it that adult hospices receive on average about 35 per cent. of their funding from the Department of Health while children&#039;s hospices receive just under 5 per cent.? What justifies paying children&#039;s hospices from the funding of the Department of Health so significantly less than adult hospices, notwithstanding the standard answer that he gave earlier? Why can they not receive significantly more from Department of Health funding so that they are more on a par with adult hospices, given the overriding need for those services for suffering children?
</p>





<p><a name="st_37"><a name="50614-02_spnew15"><b> Mr. Byrne: </b> 
 The needs of adult hospices are so different from the needs of children&#039;s hospices that it would be a mistake for me to stand here at Westminster and write a prescription for how that mixture of services should be delivered up and down the country. The needs of communities in Cumbria are different from the needs of communities in Kensington and Chelsea. The needs of people with different conditions are also very different. That means that there will always be differences in the way in which education services are combined with respite services and hospice services. It would simply be wrong for us to dictate to local communities the right mixture of funding. It is important that we set out what people are entitled to when it comes to palliative care for children with life-threatening conditions. It is even more important that we back that promise with realistic investment, and that is exactly what we have done.

 Thanks to improvements that we have made to detection and treatment, we have seen a 19 per cent. decrease in breast cancer mortality rates in England in women aged under 75 since 1997. We are seeking to build on that by further improving screening, helping GPs better identify the symptoms of cancer, speeding up the time in which a patient with suspected cancer is seen and treated by a specialist and increasing the availability of the latest treatments.

 I pay tribute to my hon.

Does she recognise that a cancer is likely to be more advanced by the time it is diagnosed in poorer areas, and that there are worrying regional disparities between survival rates, especially in the north-east, where there is only a 68 per cent. five-year survival rate as compared with 76 per cent. in the south-east?

 I thank my hon. Friend for her question and welcome her to the House. It is pleasing to see hon. Members who take the issues around breast cancer seriously. She is right. We have to look not only at the national figures but at what is happening in local communities. We know that half of all women diagnosed with breast cancer are not referred urgently by their GP. That is why we have made a commitment that, by 2008, every woman referred by her GP for any breast problem will be seen by a specialist within two weeks.

 I thank the hon. Lady for raising that matter. I have had some discussions in the Department on it. Herceptin is not yet licensed for early breast cancer in England, but there have been positive trial results and we are considering referring it to the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence for urgent appraisal. We have made it clear that newly licensed treatments should not be withheld because guidance from NICE is not available. We have asked a group of experts chaired by the national cancer director Mike Richards to advise on the implications of introducing herceptin more widely in the NHS and on the issue of licensed products that PCTs could take up if trials show that they could have an impact and positive results.

 (Lab): Does my hon. Friend acknowledge that, while we have invested in this area and produced some excellent services, if we are now to widen this service to women who are 75 years of age or women who are 45 years of age, there are problems? In my constituency, North Tees hospital is telling me that it needs more space and is desperate for an investment that would ensure that that could be provided; but it also needs additional investment for digital mammography. Is my hon. Friend considering how and in what way that investment can be put in place to keep and enhance an already excellent service?
</p>





<p><a name="st_44"><a name="50614-03_spnew5"><b> Caroline Flint: </b> 
 My hon. Friend makes a valid point. It is not enough to agree to screening. We have to talk about how it will be implemented, the staffing implications and, very importantly, the environment in which screening would take place. I assure her that any further developments would take into account all those issues, but she would agree that the enormous investment that we have made in relation to cancer services, growing from an extra &#163;280 million in 2001-02 to an extra &#163;570 million in 2003-04, demonstrates our commitment not only to providing the resources but to coming up with the ideas to tackle these serious illnesses, which can lead to death.

 (Con): Conservative Members naturally welcome the continued reduction in premature mortality rates for breast cancer, which has been in large part due to the introduction of the national breast screening programme in 1988. The Minister will be aware that breast cancer often involves a lengthy course of treatments and yet there is growing evidence that the Government&#039;s two-week and one-month targets are pushing resources to the front end of the system at the expense of those subsequent treatments. Given that, for example, the Royal College of Radiologists&#039; latest figures show a significant lengthening in waiting times since 1998 for both radical and palliative radiotherapy&#151;figures that the Government cannot contest because they do not collect such figures&#151;what are the Government going to do to put right this worrying situation?
</p>





<p><a name="st_46"><a name="50614-03_spnew7"><b> Caroline Flint: </b> 
 The hon. Gentleman again raises an important point about how all the different services interact with one another. There is no doubt that demand for radiotherapy has increased markedly in recent years. Perhaps that has something to do with the fact that women are coming forward and that we are diagnosing and identifying their cancer and providing the subsequent treatment. We are working hard to retain and recruit more staff. The Modernisation Agency is leading a programme to disseminate good practice in redesigning services. I have heard the points that the hon. Gentleman raised and will consider them.

 We have already commissioned precisely that evaluation.

In the case of A and E departments and ambulance services, the evaluators found no evidence at all to support the argument that NHS Direct was increasing demand.

 Is the Minister aware that many people in my constituency are struggling to find a dentist and that some people in need of emergency dental care are having to go private? Teeth are not like aching bones: people cannot wait six months, or six weeks, or even six hours in some cases, as when a root canal is needed. They need a dentist there and then, but because of waiting lists or difficulty finding a dentist, people are having to go private and spend a lot of their own money. I should be grateful if the Minister would assure my constituents, such as the Andrews, that the money they have spent going private will be refunded by the NHS, because they are not getting a service to which they are entitled.

<p><a name="st_59"><a name="50614-04_spnew1"><b> Ms Winterton: </b> 
 I am sorry to hear about the hon. Gentleman&#039;s constituents&#039; difficulties. As I said, extra money has been allocated to the strategic health authority to provide 63,000 additional registrations. One of the difficulties in his area is that it has been slow to move to the initial stage of personal dental services, whereby it is possible to provide more emergency access. However, the changes being made at local level will aim, through PDS, to provide precisely the type of emergency treatment that he mentioned.

</p>

Does the Minister have trouble with that, and if not, will she get on with providing the draft contract for dentists and their advisers to look at?

The review is considering the future organisation of ambulance services and how resources can be used more efficiently. We hope to publish it shortly.
</p>





<p><a name="st_84"><a name="50614-05_spnew4"><b> Mr. Clifton-Brown: </b> 
 I thank the Minister for her reply. She will be aware that Gloucestershire ambulance trust is one of the most innovative and efficient in the country; yet the strategic health authority launched a consultants&#039; report with a predetermined view that it should be fully merged with Avon and Wiltshire. That is overwhelmingly unpopular in my constituency and in Gloucestershire. It is believed that a decision has already been made to conduct the merger in September, so the patients forums are seen as a complete sham. This should be a Government for the people, not a Government against the people&#039;s wishes.
</p>





<p><a name="st_85"><a name="50614-05_spnew5"><b> Jane Kennedy: </b> 
 I hear what the hon. Gentleman says, and I know that he has been pursuing these concerns and has raised them many times, including not least, most recently, in an Adjournment debate in April. His points are valid. The purpose of the review is to get an overall picture of how ambulance services should now be developed, following the massive investment that has gone into them. There will always be a need to give interested parties, such as the hon. Gentleman&#039;s constituents, the opportunity to shape their local health services, and they will have an opportunity to comment on the detail of the review when it is published.

<p><a name="st_86"><a name="50614-05_spnew6"><b> Mr. David Drew  (Stroud)</b> 
 (Lab/Co-op): The hon. Member for Cotswold (Mr. Clifton-Brown) will know that I share a great deal of his concern about the way the plans are, apparently, being rushed through. I welcome what my right hon. Friend says, but will she make it clear that there will be a full opportunity to scrutinise the proposals and to look at how we can link the ambulance service with the fire service and the police locally as an alternative to what some see as back-door regionalisation?
</p>





<p><a name="st_87"><a name="50614-05_spnew7"><b> Jane Kennedy: </b> 
 This is a comprehensive and wide-ranging review looking at every aspect of emergency ambulance services. Of course, it would be sensible to take into account precisely the point that my hon. Friend makes. I reassure the House that there will be consultation prior to the implementation of any proposed changes in the organisation of ambulance services.

<b>14 Jun 2005 : Column 158</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>will forgive me for pointing out that the review is warmly welcomed at the southern end of our strategic health authority area. We think that it is a very sensible solution to over-management in ambulance trusts. Furthermore, when the consultation is complete&#151;I believe that my constituents are in favour&#151;will she consider also conducting a review of NHS trusts? We have 2.5 million people in our strategic health authority and 22 trusts trying to administer the NHS. Will she see whether the NHS hospital trust in Salisbury can merge with our local primary care trust? That would save an   awful lot of administration and deliver a better service.
</p>





<p><a name="st_89"><a name="50614-05_spnew9"><b> Jane Kennedy: </b> 
 I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for his comments, and I shall look into his suggestion. Clearly, the Government will not be able to please all the people all the time on this occasion, but this detailed review will be offered up for full consultation when we have the findings of Peter Bradley.

This is such an important and sensitive subject that we in Government want to be sure that every aspect has been fully considered. We must give the National Institute for Clinical Excellence the opportunity to carry out its work and present us with its findings.

 I beg to move, That the Bill be now read a Second time.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50614-06_para1">
<a name="stpa_0">It is 10 years since the national lottery was introduced, and it has grown to be part of our national way of life; indeed, some would now call it an institution. That is underlined by the fact that 70 per cent. of us play on a regular basis. Last year, just under 5 billion tickets were sold. Over the period of its life, the lottery has raised about &#163;17 billion for good causes. By any standards, it has been a huge success, and I give credit to the Opposition for introducing it when they were in power. In particular, the Prime Minister of the time, John Major, played a major role in introducing the lottery, which has had broad support across the House for that decade or so. That is to the credit of all those on both sides of the House who promoted the original National Lottery Bill back in 1993 and developed it further in 1998.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50614-06_para2">
<a name="stpa_1">Tickets do not sell themselves, and the choices between good-cause projects are sometimes hard to make. Success is the result of constant hard work and creativity by Camelot, the lottery distributor, the National Endowment for Science, Technology and the Arts and the National Lottery Commission, all of which should be congratulated on how they have conducted themselves over the past decade or so. They have helped to maintain interest and, importantly, confidence in the lottery.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50614-06_para3">
<a name="stpa_2">Last year, we celebrated the 10th anniversary of the first lottery draw, and people all over the country have been marking the 10 years since the first lottery awards went to good causes. Advice centres, leisure centres, cricket clubs, wetlands sites and film theatres from all over the country have joined in and held celebration open days to say, &quot;Thank you&quot; to the people of this country who have played the lottery and who have therefore contributed to good causes. Nowhere celebrated more enthusiastically than the Eden project in Cornwall, which is one of many excellent projects that the Millennium Commission has supported with spectacular success.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50614-06_para4">
<a name="stpa_3">When I became a Minister in 1997, I worked on regeneration, setting up the regeneration agencies and planning. I travelled to Mevagissey in Cornwall to examine the site of the Eden project and visited the Cornish clay quarry, as it was then, in a battered old Land Rover. When someone explained the concept of a big bubble on the side of the quarry, I thought, &quot;They must be mad&quot;, but the Millennium Commission and 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>14 Jun 2005 : Column 160</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>others had the vision to back that futuristic project, and they were right to do so. I have visited the Eden project on a number of subsequent occasions&#151;my children have visited it, too, and I hope to take my grandchildren there this year. The project was a good investment in itself, but it has also had a considerable impact on that part of Cornwall&#039;s economy, and it is important to acknowledge the contribution of the lottery, the Millennium Commission and others.
</p>





<p><a name="st_3"><a name="50614-06_spnew1"><b> Mr. Don Foster  (Bath) (LD):</b> 
 Does the Minister agree that the organisers of the Eden project had a phenomenally good idea when they decided to open up the project for people to view while it was being built? They called their idea, &quot;The big build&quot;, which was a great way to get people to take an interest in the Eden project.
</p>





<p><a name="st_4"><a name="50614-06_spnew2"><b> Mr. Caborn: </b> 
 That was an excellent idea, and the specially built greenhouses in which the plants to fill the Eden project were growing also became a visitor attraction. The organisers did a lot of work to ensure that the Eden project was a success when it was eventually launched.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50614-06_para5">
<a name="stpa_4">However, such success cannot be taken for granted. The national lottery must stay in close touch with what people are thinking and striving for, and it needs to communicate its achievements, which it has not done as well as it could have done. The lottery must develop to meet new aspirations, and all those involved must work hard, respond to change and deliver the best value for public money.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50614-06_para6">
<a name="stpa_5">Some of those changes require a new legal framework to get money to those who are not expert in the system and who need money quickly, to allow good-cause funders to raise awareness of the lottery&#039;s successes and use modern techniques to involve the public in decision taking, to get more of the money into the front line rather than into administration and bureaucracy and to improve the powers of the regulator of the lottery games.
</p>





<p><a name="st_5"><a name="50614-06_spnew3"><b> Mr. David Drew  (Stroud) (Lab/Co-op):</b> 
 I agree with my right hon. Friend that we must get the money to where it will be spent best, but some hon. Members have slight misgivings about clauses 7 and 8, which might allow the redistribution of balances of some elements of the lottery. He has discussed the Eden project; I am working on a project to raise money through the Heritage Lottery Fund to reopen the Cotswold canal, which relies on balances being held over on occasions until all the funding is in place. Does my right hon. Friend recognise the worry that if the Secretary of State could pilfer those funds, he might rob Peter to pay Paul?
</p>





<p><a name="st_6"><a name="50614-06_spnew4"><b> Mr. Caborn: </b> 
 I recognise that worry, which I shall address later in my speech. A related concern is the question why more than &#163;4 billion was being held in reserve at one stage. It is a matter of striking a balance, but I hope that I can reassure my hon. Friend that the Secretary of State will not pilfer anything and will act in the best interests of the lottery.
</p>





<p><a name="st_7"><a name="50614-06_spnew5"><b> John Bercow  (Buckingham) (Con):</b>

<a name="stpa_6">These changes will renew the vigour of the lottery and, we hope, sustain it for the next 10 successful years. Some hon. Members may ask me about the Olympics. Let me say that the Bill does not, of course, cover the framework needed for staging the Olympic games in London. Parliament has already approved legislation to make the new Olympic lottery games possible and to set up the distributor for that money.

<a name="50614-06_para8">
<a name="stpa_7">I am sure that on 6 July, when we come back from Singapore with the Olympic games, even the hon. Member for Perth and North Perthshire (Pete Wishart) will be saying from his place in Scotland how welcome that success is for the United Kingdom.
</p>





<p><a name="st_11"><a name="50614-06_spnew9"><b> Pete Wishart: </b> 
 Absolutely&#151;I wish London great success when it comes to the bid in July. Nevertheless, can the Minister confirm that no funds will be taken from the mainstream lottery and given to the London Olympic lottery game? Is not it right that the commitment and purchases of those who continue to play the mainstream lottery should be honoured?
</p>





<p><a name="st_12"><a name="50614-06_spnew10"><b> Mr. Caborn: </b> 
 The answer is yes. There will be displacement in terms of the Olympic draw. That has already been debated in this House during the passage of the Horserace Betting and Olympic Lottery Act 2004. The situation was clearly explained and the House voted for that legislation.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50614-06_para9">
<a name="stpa_8">Let me re-cap on how we got to this Bill. The proposals are based on two rounds of consultation and involvement. The first of those was launched in 2002, with a very open agenda for change. People were asked for views on our emerging thinking and encouraged to make their own suggestions for change. What came through the reading of those reports and the subsequent comments that were made was a resounding vote of confidence in the lottery. We found that people wanted to know more about where the money had been spent and felt that it was right for Camelot and distributors to work together on this.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50614-06_para10">
<a name="stpa_9">People also wanted more consultation and more involvement in decision making, while stressing the need for impartiality. They wanted it to be easier to apply for lottery funding and welcomed the idea of a single front door, particularly for smaller grants. There was overwhelming support for the concept of additionality and a strong belief that it was still relevant. There was recognition, too, that lottery funding needed to complement other streams of funding in order to deliver most benefit.

<p><a name="st_13"><a name="50614-07_spnew0"><b> Philip Davies  (Shipley) (Con):</b> 
 Does the Minister agree that far too often awards given from the national lottery money have been given to politically correct organisations that command very little support from the public, while very small organisations such as Fashion Services for Disabled People in my constituency, which command a great deal of public support, find the whole process so bureaucratic that it is very hard to get money? Will he assure me that we will have a system whereby more money goes to smaller groups that command very local public support and less money goes to politically correct groups?
</p>





<p><a name="st_14"><a name="50614-07_spnew1"><b> Mr. Caborn: </b> 
 My strong advice to the hon. Gentleman is to think very carefully about which Division Lobby he goes through tonight. If he votes for the reasoned amendment tabled by the official Opposition he will continue to have bureaucracy, but if he votes for the Bill, he will streamline the process, make it effective and get money to the very people he wants to have it. <i>[Interruption.]</i> I am entitled to give the hon. Gentleman, who is a new Member, a bit of advice. I simply say that he should not believe everything his Front Benchers tell him.
</p>





<p><a name="st_15"><a name="50614-07_spnew2"><b> Dr. Tony Wright  (Cannock Chase) (Lab):</b> 
 People feel that there should be a connection between the amount of money that areas put into the lottery and what they get back from its distribution. There is a feeling that no such strong connection currently exists. I wonder whether my right hon. Friend could ensure that there is a stronger connection when considering the new arrangements.
</p>





<p><a name="st_16"><a name="50614-07_spnew3"><b> Mr. Caborn: </b> 
 Again, if my hon. Friend will allow me to progress through the speech, I shall try to answer the question. There is no perfect solution. There will always be imbalances when deciding whether to base distribution on those who pay into the lottery or deprivation factors. However, we have tried to balance that.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50614-07_para0">
<a name="stpa_11">Let us consider the Big Lottery Fund. In consultation, there was considerable support for bringing the Community Fund and New Opportunities Fund together. It made no sense in our view to run two separate bodies with such similar remits. Conversely, it makes sense for the Millennium Commission&#039;s residual functions, including any remaining balances of funds, to be transferred to the new lottery distributor. One body, one board, one set of overheads instead of three will mean more money for grants and cut costs and bureaucracy. The new body, the Big Lottery Fund, is at the heart of the important progressive reform that I am presenting to the House. The fund will also be the centre of lottery excellence, for example, in improving the assessment of capital projects for viability and developing cutting-edge ways of involving the public in decisions about grants and programmes.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50614-07_para1">
<a name="stpa_12">Although the Department has not conducted any polling, we know that polls have shown evidence that the public regard health, education and the environment as important good causes.

<br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>

<p>
<a name="50614-07_para2">
<a name="stpa_13">Let me consider the balances. Careful preparatory work and consultation lies behind the provisions that we are introducing to ensure that money gets to the good causes more quickly. The size of the balances that distributors build up has always been a matter of concern in the House and, indeed, outside. We have already made much progress on that. We have developed guidance on managing the balances and we have simplified the financial framework in which they operate. More recently, the National Audit Office recommended more that the Department and distributors could do and we are following that advice vigorously.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50614-07_para3">
<a name="stpa_14">All that has helped to get money out more quickly to where it is needed and to reduce the balances by no less than one third.
</p>





<p><a name="st_17"><a name="50614-07_spnew4"><b> Robert Key  (Salisbury) (Con):</b> 
 The Minister has been generous in giving way but he has reached a crucial point and I hope that we will refer to it in detail in Committee. The point about the Heritage Lottery Fund is vital for cathedrals and ecclesiastical buildings. We all understand the desire to reduce balances and get the money out quickly but that is exactly what should not happen in the case that I mention. For example, the Heritage Lottery Fund estimates that, if it does what the measure suggests, it would reduce the available funds by &#163;15 million in any year. That is almost as much as the entire spending on cathedrals and ecclesiastical buildings in the Church of England. If they are not allowed to have the money ready for the preparatory work&#151;it takes a year to get the application in&#151;heritage buildings could lose out seriously. I hope that we can reconsider the matter.
</p>





<p><a name="st_18"><a name="50614-07_spnew5"><b> Mr. Caborn: </b> 
 With all due respect, there is a difference between &#163;15 million and &#163;3.5 billion. There must be balances in any organisation or business. However, the amount of the balances caused concern in and outside the House. I have rightly had to go on television and defend&#151;or probably not defend&#151;the position. We are holding more than &#163;3 billion in reserves. There is a great difference between &#163;3 billion and the few millions that the hon. Gentleman mentions. Any sensible organisation will have a reserve with which it continues to perform its functions efficiently and effectively. That does not mean holding balances of the amount that the distributors have been holding in the recent past.
</p>





<p><a name="st_19"><a name="50614-07_spnew6"><b> Mr. Don Foster: </b> 
 Can the Minister tell the House whether he believes that the current balances are acceptable or too high? Will he not acknowledge that it is bizarre that the Government are going ahead when the Public Accounts Committee, which is due to report on the issue, has still not produced its report?
</p>





<p><a name="st_20"><a name="50614-07_spnew7"><b> Mr. Caborn: </b> 
 When the Public Accounts Committee produces its report, we will examine that. As I have indicated, the National Audit Office has given us further advice, we have tried to introduce a more managed regime in consultation with the Treasury, and we have reduced the balances by a third already. The NAO has indicated that we need to do a lot more to bring the balances down, and if the PAC, which will no doubt 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>14 Jun 2005 : Column 164</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>reflect on the NAO&#039;s report anyway&#151;I cannot see it departing much from that&#151;believes that it is prudent to reduce those balances further, and if that can be managed in a proper way that does not put at risk any of the schemes, it will be in everybody&#039;s interest to consider that. That is sensible and common sense.
</p>





<p><a name="st_21"><a name="50614-07_spnew8"><b> Mrs. Theresa May  (Maidenhead) (Con):</b> 
 Does the Minister accept that when dealing with large-scale heritage projects, which will amount to major expenditure over a number of years, it is prudent and only right that the Heritage Lottery Fund should set aside the money for those projects as soon as it has been committed? Otherwise, it could find that money has been expended and is not available to put forward to those good causes. Does he not accept that that is prudent for the Heritage Lottery Fund?
</p>





<p><a name="st_22"><a name="50614-07_spnew9"><b> Mr. Caborn: </b> 
 Absolutely, I do not disagree with that at all&#151;what the hon. Lady has said is sensible. A balance must be struck, however, in relation to having money in the bank that could be used for other purposes and it not being there to cover that type of heritage expenditure. We have given assurances, and I will refer later to the undertakings that we have given to one of the distributors, the Heritage Lottery Fund. We have tried to take on board what we believe is a reasonable request to reduce those balances. We have done that in consultation with the Treasury and given new guidelines, and we have also taken on board what the National Audit Office has said. If the hon. Lady believes that she is the sole custodian of wisdom in this area, and far better than the National Audit Office or anyone else, that is fine, and she will table relevant amendments in Committee. I hope that at the end of the process the Opposition will defend keeping public money in accounts when it could be used for good causes&#151;<i>[Interruption.]</i> It is public money, and if the Opposition are not going to use it, that is fine, and they will defend that at another time. Money has been drawn down and spent on good causes, probably in some Opposition Members&#039; constituencies. There is over &#163;1 billion less waiting in the bank now than there was two and a half years ago, and I do not believe that taking out that &#163;1 billion has done any damage to the heritage lottery distributors or to any scheme in the pipeline. That &#163;1 billion is helping many projects up and down the country.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50614-07_para4">
<a name="stpa_15">What does the Bill propose? The Bill will make changes to the framework of the lottery to make it more responsive to people&#039;s priorities and to maximise the money going to good causes. Clauses 1 to 5 deal with the regulation of the lottery through the National Lottery Commission. The chairman would no longer change annually and it would be possible to have executive board members, putting the commission in the same position as the companies with which it will be dealing. Clause 6 and schedule 1 deal with amendments to the licensing structure of the lottery. As we announced in November last year, the new system is designed to deliver significantly greater competition to the licensing process with a clear presumption that there will be a single licence.

 Absolutely. <i>[Interruption.]</i> As my hon. Friend will learn, unfortunately we get a bit of stupidity from the Opposition from time to time.

Friend makes a very valid contribution by pointing out how the Bill will operate, and the way in which her constituents and the people of Scotland will gain from it. We will respond to what they and others have said, but my hon. Friend will doubtless learn that the Opposition do not take this issue as seriously as they should.

<a name="stpa_18">Clause 9 provides for a new system of allocating investment income from the national lottery distribution fund, in the same proportions as ticket sales income, to each lottery distributor. So the first step has been taken in the direction to which my hon. Friend the Member for Swansea, East (Mrs. James) referred. Clause 10 will enable lottery distributors to seek, and to take account of, public consultation in making distribution decisions. We want the public to have a say in such matters, and this provision will remove the legal uncertainties that have proved an impediment to greater consultation.

When Parliament last considered the issue in 1998, health, education and the environment were added as things that are as important to people&#039;s lives as sport, heritage and the arts. The Bill reaffirms the existing good causes, whose shares we have guaranteed until 2009. We have also said that the same good causes will continue beyond 2009, and this autumn we will consult about the overall priorities to be set under the existing powers for those existing good causes.

 During the consultation on what the populace wanted, we discovered that they viewed health, education and the environment as areas already covered by Government expenditure, but in respect of which additional expenditure should be made. I cannot comment on the specific case that the hon. Gentleman mentioned, as I have no evidence, but I can say that   when people have been consulted on health, education and the environment, they have expressed overwhelming support for what we are doing. Evidence provided not just by the Government, but by MORI and others, strongly suggests that the public regard education, health and the environment as good causes that should be supported.

 Does the Minister admit, following what he has just said, that the Government&#039;s proposals breach the principle of additionality? He was generous in paying tribute to the last Conservative Government who set up the lottery on the basis of five good causes, one of which&#151;the millennium fund&#151;we can dispense with. The four other good causes&#151;sport, arts, heritage and charity&#151;were then to receive 100 per cent. of the cash. However, the Bill that the Minister now proposes offers 50 per cent. of the money to funding causes, including education, health and the environment, that have traditionally been areas of Government activity paid for by the taxpayer. The Minister may be right in saying that the public support those causes, but the Bill surely breaches the principle of additionality, despite the Minister&#039;s claims that it does not.
</p>





<p><a name="st_34"><a name="50614-08_spnew11"><b> Mr. Caborn: </b> 
 The Opposition have their views and will want to canter around the course on the basis of them. Let me be absolutely clear: the results of two consultations&#151;the ICM and YouGov polls&#151;were strongly indicative of public opinion. The Opposition are perfectly entitled to go against public opinion. That is fine, but it is also probably why Conservative Members sit on the Opposition side of the House and Labour Members on the Government side. It is entirely their choice, but life moves on.

<a name="stpa_23">It may well be that what happened in the mid-1990s was right and appropriate at the time, so let us examine the history of the lottery. Some mistakes were made over huge amounts of money, but the lottery has been more successful by any standards subsequently, with more money going to good causes. Yes, there were problems with revenue and capital, but we have dealt with them. Yes, there was a problem about geographical disparities throughout the country when judged against need, but we have dealt with that, too. We have tried at least to keep in line with public opinion, which is why we conducted wide consultation in 2002. We have not chucked it in the bin as a result of people&#039;s accusations, but used it constructively.

 I should like to try and push my hon. Friend the Minister in a different direction. Will he consider abandoning the idea of additionality? It is nonsense and a complete figment of the imagination. Additionality does not exist except as a way of saying that lottery money can go only to projects that are not getting money already from some other source. In the early years of the lottery, former mining constituencies such as mine found it difficult to get money for arts or sports projects, as they got only a quarter of the funding received by other areas, such as Henley or Bromsgrove. Bringing the priorities of lottery funding more in line with the views of constituents such as mine has been a significant and welcome change.
</p>





<p><a name="st_36"><a name="50614-09_spnew1"><b> Mr. Caborn: </b> 
 There is some truth in what my hon. Friend says, but I repeat that these matters were part of the wide consultation held in 2002. Further consultation has been held since, and it was accepted that additionality was an important principle that should be embodied in future legislation. The Government have a responsibility to respond to that and to manage additionality in the best possible way. I agree with my hon. Friend to the extent that the word &quot;additionality&quot; presents problems because it can be interpreted in a variety of ways&#151;<i>[Interruption.]</i> I hear giggles from Opposition Front-Bench Members, but that difficulty also existed when the Conservative Government were in power.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50614-09_para0">
<a name="stpa_25">Another difficulty is that the principle of additionality has prevented the lottery from being as holistic in its approach as it should have been. We are trying to address that problem. I am not saying that projects can always turn to the Big Lottery Fund for money, but they will be able to seek additional funds from other sources, as long as they stay within the terms of the Bill, and give advice to other organisations. That shows that we are trying to adopt a joined-up approach to this problem. We believe that there will be benefits in terms of added value, and that results from the money that is invested will be improved. We want to move the lottery on, with the support of all those who buy tickets every week, and of the good causes that benefit.

 I am grateful to the Minister, and want to help him. The most sensible thing that he has said is that the lottery should move on. I was the Minister responsible for taking the original legislation through Parliament, and I remind him that the Labour Opposition of the day fought against additionality mainly because they believed that it would reduce the takings from ticket sales. We agreed, but that is why so many of the Minister&#039;s predecessors&#151;notably Lord Pendry&#151;fought so valiantly against the principle of 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>14 Jun 2005 : Column 169</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>additionality. Experience may have caused minds to be changed, but we must not forget what motivated Labour Members at the time. In those days, all the available evidence&#151;primarily from the Republic of Ireland&#151;suggested that acceding to additionality would cut the number of tickets sold. We have moved on since then, and we must not impugn each other&#039;s honesty on this matter.
</p>





<p><a name="st_40"><a name="50614-09_spnew5"><b> Mr. Caborn: </b> 
 I disagree with the hon. Gentleman, although my colleagues may well have argued in the way that he describes. Let me offer him an example of how lottery money is used that runs counter to what he has just said. School sports co-ordinators are an integral part of the school sports partnerships, of which there are now 3,000. Under that scheme, teachers are able to devote two or three days a week to that role, and originally they were funded out of the lottery. However, that funding is now part of the core expenditure of the Department for Education and Skills. The amount of money involved is significant, and it contributes towards delivering the sports programme in schools throughout the country. The investment is sustainable, because it has been taken over by the Department for Education and Skills and, through Sport England, the money thus liberated has been put back into sport.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50614-09_para1">
<a name="stpa_26">There are a number of other examples of how the problem identified by the hon. Member for Salisbury (Mr. Key) can be seen to work both ways. In those cases, lottery money has made a significant contribution in the first instance, but has then been taken over by core expenditure in the relevant Department. I have not prepared a balance sheet or conducted a cost-benefit analysis of these matters, but I urge the House to be careful about questioning additionality, as it cuts both ways, in the way that I have set out.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50614-09_para2">
<a name="stpa_27">On getting money to causes quickly and balances down, let me say some more about how the Bill responds to concerns in Parliament that lottery money is not always distributed as quickly as it might be. I am hopeful that the advice from the National Audit Office will be followed, but we have made slower progress than I would have liked. I have said that many times at the Dispatch Box and outside the House. We cannot be complacent, because &#163;2.5 billion in reserve is still a great deal of money that should be, at least in part, distributed. We can no longer be relaxed about that until more progress has been made, so the reserve powers are designed to ensure that all distributors act quickly.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50614-09_para3">
<a name="stpa_28">Last year, the proposed new powers were misrepresented as an attack on our heritage. That attack has been echoed this afternoon. It was said that our proposals would mean less money for heritage projects. That was simply not true, and I hope that in the discussions and exchanges of letters that we have had since then, we have been able to explain that and put minds at rest. Nothing in the Bill will allow money to be taken from heritage and spent on something else. The Bill has been clarified in that respect.

However, the percentage distribution for heritage, the arts and sport and the Big Lottery Fund will be the same and the terms of reference will remain the same.

<p><a name="st_44"><a name="50614-09_spnew9"><b> Mr. Caborn: </b> 
 Absolutely. The problem is not new. The distribution of regional structural funds from the European Union has experienced the same problem.

<a name="stpa_29">In 1998, Parliament approved setting up the New Opportunities Fund to distribute lottery funding to a new, additional good cause of education, health and the environment. The new good cause has been successful and popular. It has enabled lottery money to support activities that go beyond what it is right for taxpayers to fund in health, education and the environment. The charitable good cause, administered by the Community Fund, is also enduringly popular and has helped tens of thousands of voluntary and community sector bodies to carry out their important work.

But it is the people&#039;s money and decisions cannot be taken in a vacuum by the great and the good. So it will not be politicians taking decisions, but it will not be the great and the good either. If the lottery is to flourish, lottery distributors must keep in touch with popular aspirations and involve people in taking key decisions. The new powers will allow them to do just that. We need a wholehearted commitment not just to consultation, but to true involvement.

We are determined to see a successful competition for a single licence. There are improvements that the regulator, the National Lottery Commission, could consider making to the bidding process: switching to two stages; reducing information required from bidders at early stages; and possibly contributing to bid costs. Those underline our confidence that we will have a successful competition for a single licence next time.

In the extreme circumstances&#151;I emphasise the word &quot;extreme&quot;&#151;of an unsuccessful competition, unwelcome as that would be, we would be negligent not to have a fallback, a plan B. We therefore propose to introduce a reserve power that would allow the commission to offer for competition a small number of licences to run different parts of the lottery. The commission, however, will have to be clear from the outset how it would define an unsuccessful competition, and it will take into account the uncertainty that the fallback could create among potential bidders.

By establishing the Big Lottery Fund, the Government will establish in law the right to fund projects, through the lottery, that the taxpayer would rightly expect to be funded direct from Government. Training for school dinner ladies and the provision of hospital equipment are things that we all expect to be paid for by the taxes that the Chancellor raises, not to come from the coffers of charities and good causes. Every pound that the Government choose to snaffle in that way is a pound that cannot go to help community groups or to preserve our historic buildings.

 I understand the right hon. Lady&#039;s argument, but from the viewpoint of a constituency that is very different from hers, the Bill looks different.

The aims introduced in more recent times have made access to the funding much more possible for constituencies such as mine. Rhondda does not have many great historic buildings, or an opera house, or even a rowing museum. For some constituencies, especially former mining constituencies, it is extremely important that the lottery has been rejigged so that it meets the needs of the whole country, not just the needs of constituencies such as hers.

Local sports clubs and arts projects can benefit, and should be benefiting, as well as local charities. That was the point of the lottery.

 Indeed; there has been such a power throughout the lottery&#039;s existence.

However, the Secretary of State will now prescribe expenditure by the Big Lottery Fund. He will set out ways in which it should channel its funds, and the purposes on which those moneys should be spent. Bit by bit, the Government have put their hand into the lottery pot. That change fundamentally undermines the independence and integrity of the grant-making system, along with, sadly, the esteem in which the lottery is held by the vast majority of the public. That undermines the independence of the Big Lottery Fund to determine its own strategic direction and to make decisions free from interference.

<br>&nbsp;<br>the improvements in drafting that resulted in the draconian powers of the first National Lottery Bill being consigned to the wastepaper bin, but there is little doubt that the level of prescription is still too great.

Ministers have said that that power would be used only as a last resort, but the sad truth is that those assurances only confirm that those powers are there for a reason.

<a name="stpa_64">The Bill does two things&#151;it allows for the redistribution of interest, as the Minister said, but it also allows for the movement of balances from one distributor to another.

The Minister has suggested that the money could be distributed for heritage purposes, but it can be moved to a different distributor for allocation. As I said in my intervention on the Minister, the whole point of the Heritage Lottery Fund is that it has been set aside for particular projects, so there is little point in moving funds from one distributor to another unless the intention is that the balances should be spent differently.

Although some people have pointed to a gradual decline in participation since 1997&#150;98, that modest decline has been reversed, and in 2004&#150;05 we saw an increase in the income generated and in the number of people participating. That has happened to such an extent that we are able to say that, to date, some &#163;16.8 billion has been raised by the national lottery; 50 per cent. of that has been allocated to prizes and 28 per cent. to good causes. In other words, the lottery has been a success; indeed, it is one of the most successful lotteries of its kind, if not the most successful, in the world.

Since 1997, however, the allocation of grants has certainly been scrupulously fair, to the extent that every constituency in the country has benefited from at least 50 lottery grants, most having had a great deal more, irrespective of their political complexion.

It was enormously successful. The grant helped to pay for workshop costs, materials and outdoor activities for the young people of the community. Another example, from further down the valley, is that of Ystrad Mynach old-age pensioners. In October 2003, they received a grant for &#163;1,960 to pay for such things as bingo machines, a projector screen, catering and amplification equipment for their pensioners&#039; hall.

With the help of the local authority and money from the European regional development fund through objective 1, that YMCA has been one of the most successful ventures of its kind anywhere in the south Wales valleys. In fact, it has been so successful that it has received numerous awards. The national lottery has made a significant contribution to the success of that regenerated YMCA.

<br>&nbsp;<br>different ways not only to set lottery priorities, but to determine which awards are allocated to different projects. As I understand it, a range of options are being considered. One is the introduction of citizens juries, and telephone surveys are another possibility. Award panels could also be established, and we could have voting for individual projects.

<a name="stpa_76">Significantly, the Bill specifically advocates greater co-operation with the devolved Welsh Assembly and Scottish Parliament, which I welcome as a Welsh Member. There is already effective co-operation between the national lottery and the Welsh Assembly, and I am sure that it will increase significantly if the Bill is passed. The Bill strikes the right balance between reinforcing the fact that this is a UK or national lottery and recognising the scope for greater participation by the devolved Administrations. Striking the right balance is difficult, but the Bill achieves it.

<a name="stpa_77">We are discussing large sums of money that belong not to the distributors or to the Government, but to the people who play the national lottery week in, week out. Earlier this month, the Big Lottery Fund announced a new partnership with ITV to create a series of programmes called, &quot;The people&#039;s millions&quot;, in which ITV will encourage regional and national competition and the winners will get money to support transformation projects. Some 50 grants of &#163;50,000 will be available, and I anticipate that at least three of them will be made available in Wales.

<a name="stpa_78">I welcome that initiative, which builds on the excellent example set by the recent BBC2 programme, &quot;Restoration&quot;, which was an extremely popular programme that mobilised people in local communities to get together, to make submissions and to take pride in participating in a viable bid. In my area, one project in particular, the so-called &quot;Memo&quot; or Memorial hall in Newbridge, has been extremely successful in getting people together to support its strong bid, which was the runner-up in the final of &quot;Restoration&quot;. The hall is in the Islwyn parliamentary constituency, but it falls within the Caerphilly County borough council area. Although the bid was unsuccessful on the last lap, it successfully pulled together the community, and a number of other initiatives have taken place. I hope that the new programme is as successful as &quot;Restoration&quot;, that it helps to open a new chapter in the history of the national lottery and that it shows that people can get involved in the revitalisation of their communities, given sufficient political will and imagination.

<a name="stpa_79">I support the Bill for a number of other reasons, of which I shall briefly touch on two. Excessive balances are not a problem if they are reduced quickly, but if balances are held on to and significant interest accrues, it is right to take action. Distributors currently have a perverse incentive to hold on to balances for as long as possible in order to benefit from the interest, which is a ridiculous situation that undermines the positive ethos behind the national lottery. I am pleased that the Government are taking a reserved power to reallocate such money as and when it is necessary to do so.

<a name="stpa_80">The Bill provides the new Big Lottery Fund with greater strategic power.

<a name="50614-12_para17">
<a name="stpa_81">Match funding is often a difficult issue for applicants, and the Big Lottery Fund should be able to provide more effective advice about it. The Big Lottery Fund could also manage funds to ensure that the community gets the best possible rewards from applications and funding.

<a name="stpa_82">I am truly delighted that this important piece of legislation is having its Second Reading today, early in the life of this Parliament. It is important that we consider the issues before us calmly and rationally. If the Bill passes its Second Reading, it will make the national lottery even more of a success story than it has been so far. I am a firm supporter of the national lottery, as are many of my constituents. We want to recognise the success that has been achieved but also to recognise that we can go a lot further with this Bill.

I am at least prepared to say, in view of all the very good work that has subsequently been done by the national lottery, that we may have made a mistake.

<a name="stpa_87">The national lottery remains enormously popular, and despite a dip in sales over the past couple of years, sales are again rising, with even more money going to good causes. However, that is not to say that everything is right with the lottery. The current Government&#039;s record is frankly disturbing. Time and again, they have breached the additionality principle set out by John Major when he first proposed the national lottery back in 1993. It is worth putting it on the record that the Prime Minister said:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_9">&quot;We don&#039;t believe it would be right to use Lottery money to pay for things which are the Government&#039;s responsibilities.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>

<a name="50614-13_para5">
<a name="stpa_88">Despite that, that is just what they have been doing.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50614-13_para6">
<a name="stpa_89">The Minister, who is still with us, albeit at a distance, referred throughout his contribution to opinion polling. I remind him of the YouGov poll in <i>The Guardian</i> a couple of years ago, which showed that almost three quarters of the population believe that it is &quot;vitally important&quot; for lottery funds to remain independent of    Whitehall interference. Yet we have witnessed Government interference. In my view, it is not surprising that the Select Committee on Culture, Media and Sport report of 2003&#150;04 states:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_10">&quot;We believe that the additionality principle is being eroded.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="50614-13_para7">
<a name="stpa_90">That is what a Committee with a majority of Labour Members said about the issue.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50614-13_para8">
<a name="stpa_91">The prime example of that breach of additionality was the establishment of the New Opportunities Fund in 1998. As we have heard, since that time, some &#163;3 billion has been awarded to education, environment and health projects, including MRI scanners, and, as the right hon. Member for Maidenhead said, giving a piece of fruit a day to children aged four to six. Although no one doubts that those are worthy causes, do they breach the additionality agreement? I believe that they do. It was interesting that, when the Minister intervened on the right hon. Lady, he made it clear that that extent of Government interference would never happen again. That is a clear admission that the Government are guilty as charged.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50614-13_para9">
<a name="stpa_92">Several debates could be held about the definition of additionality. The hon. Member for Rhondda rightly said that we need to tackle what we mean by additionality&#151;even Labour Members are uncertain and unhappy. I remind the Minister of the words of the former arts Minister, Estelle Morris. In an article in the <i>New Statesman</i> on 8 October last year, she said:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_11">&quot;I&#039;m going to be a bit contradictory about my own government now . . . it isn&#039;t an issue of whether the government . . . <i>does</i> fund it, it&#039;s whether it <i>would</i> fund it.&quot;</p>

<a name="50614-13_para10">
<a name="stpa_93">I therefore hope that the Bill will give us the opportunity to resolve once and for all what we mean by the additionality principle. I hope that we get a consensus and will perhaps consider doing exactly what the Minister said only a few minutes ago. He said from the Dispatch Box that future legislation should embody

<b>14 Jun 2005 : Column 184</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>additionality. Those are his words, not mine. Let us hope that he will agree to include in the Bill something, which we can all support, about additionality. We can then expect the Government and future Governments to stick to it.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50614-13_para11">
<a name="stpa_94">I hope that, if we formulate a new definition of additionality, we shall take account of the suggestion of the National Council for Voluntary Organisations. It stated:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_12">&quot;Funding from lottery distributors must be additional to that which is properly funded by government and not a substitute for it. It should not be used to fund essential services or government-inspired programmes.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="50614-13_para12">
<a name="stpa_95">The last point is crucial and could form the new part of the definition. Such a definition of additionality, which implies that it is not for the Government to dictate on what lottery money is spent, would go a long way towards reassuring all parties and, more important, the people of the country who have said that they do not want Whitehall interference.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50614-13_para13">
<a name="stpa_96">I hope that we will agree to do more about a recommendation from the Culture, Media and Sport Committee. It suggested that there should be an annual report to Parliament about the application of the additionality principle. I hope that we will accept that. I also hope that the Minister, or the Under-Secretary who replies to the debate, will assure us that, if the Government are so keen on separating Government funding and lottery funding, they might agree to produce their annual reports rather differently. The annual report currently conflates lottery money and Government money and makes it hard to understand which is which. It leaves open the opportunity for the Government to claim credit for projects that were funded by the lottery. That happens all too often. The school dinners project was one example of that.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50614-13_para14">
<a name="stpa_97">Having said that the Labour Government have been guilty of dipping their fingers into lottery money and claiming the credit, we at least ought to put it on the record that the Conservative party is not as innocent as it would have us believe. I am sure, Madam Deputy Speaker, that you read, as all Members will have read in great detail, the Conservative party&#039;s manifesto at the last election. You will therefore have seen that that manifesto introduced a school sports scheme to be called &quot;Club to School&quot;, with funding of &#163;750 million. Where was that money to come from? The House has guessed it&#151;from the lottery.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50614-13_para15">
<a name="stpa_98">We have already had debates about some good and bad aspects of the Bill. Of course, the Bill has some good points: it provides a legal framework for the creation of the Big Lottery Fund, which has already been created, but is a proper legal framework. While we opposed the creation of the New Opportunities Fund, continue to oppose it and believe that activities should no longer take place under the Big Lottery Fund, if the Government are to force the proposal through against our wishes, there will at least, as the hon. Member for Caerphilly pointed out, be benefits in terms of savings on administration and economies of scale amounting to between 10 and 20 per cent. of expenses a year, which would release &#163;6 million to &#163;12 million a year for good causes. We would prefer the NOF activities not to go ahead at all, but if they are to do so, at least that makes sense.

<a name="stpa_99">I have one particular concern, and I should be grateful if the Minister would intervene to clarify the point. He, the acting chairman of the Big Lottery Fund and the Secretary of State have all said that they will make sure that 60 to 70 per cent. of BLF funding will go to the voluntary and community sector. I am grateful for those assurances, and I hope that the Minister will be prepared to include that in the Bill. What exactly does he mean, however? As the right hon. Member for Maidenhead pointed out, the Bill changes the definition in relation to areas of funding. It changes the definition of charitable expenditure in relation to lottery funding from expenditure by charitable, benevolent or philanthropic organisations to expenditure for a charitable, benevolent or philanthropic purpose&#151;there is a big difference between the two. The House will be aware that the provision of education is defined as a charitable purpose, which could mean that rather than going to charitable organisations, money could go to the local education authority sector for the provision of education. Will he therefore intervene and tell me whether or not that commitment of 60 to 70 per cent. is to be given to organisations? I am waiting, and he is not replying. We will get an answer at the end, and I look forward to it.

 Is the hon. Gentleman as intrigued as I am that 60 or 70 per cent. of the BLF funds are going to that category? By our calculation, that leaves about &#163;270 million. What does he think that the Government might do with that?
</p>





<p><a name="st_73"><a name="50614-14_spnew1"><b> Mr. Foster: </b> 
 Well, the House will have heard absolute assurances from the Minister that he will do nothing. Whether or not the Government get their sticky little mitts out remains to be seen.

<a name="stpa_100">To return to some of the positives, I genuinely welcome the fact that if the Bill is passed the Big Lottery Fund will have the power to distribute some non-lottery money, although I hope that we can have absolute assurances that the person or body giving that money to the BLF will not be able to subvert the way in which BLF money will be used. I also hope that this will not result in the Big Lottery Fund&#039;s becoming increasingly like a Government agency. However, we welcome the broad principle.

<a name="50614-14_para1">
<a name="stpa_101">We also welcome the fact that the Big Lottery Fund will be able to give out loans as well as grants.

We look forward to receiving in Committee more detail on how those loans will work in practice. We further genuinely welcome the move towards the public&#039;s greater involvement in deciding how lottery money is distributed&#151;a mandate that is clearly implied in clause 10. However, like the right hon. Member for Maidenhead, we would argue that we need to go further, subject to a number of clear caveats. If my hon. Friend the Member for Cheltenham (Mr. Horwood), who is expert in these matters, manages to catch your eye, Madam Deputy Speaker, he hopes to develop some of these points in more detail.

<br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>

<p>
<a name="50614-14_para2">
<a name="stpa_102">It is worth remembering the research carried out by the Big Lottery Fund, which found that nine out of 10 lottery players believe it important that the general public are involved in deciding where lottery funding should go. Reference has already been made to the best example so far&#151;the two wonderful series of the BBC&#039;s &quot;Restoration&quot; programme. Some &#163;5.5 million of lottery money was distributed to the winners of those two projects. More recently, the &quot;People&#039;s Million&quot; scheme was announced, and as the Minister rightly pointed out, this is only the start. We know that there are a number of projects to follow, in conjunction with GMTV and others, through which the money, and the percentage of money, will increase.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50614-14_para3">
<a name="stpa_103">I should point out that we need to be careful when we talk about public involvement in decisions. I certainly welcome the Big Lottery Fund&#039;s statement, in which it pointed out that when the public are involved, they will not be
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_13">&quot;asked to choose between projects where there is a large imbalance in their levels of popularity.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="50614-14_para4">
<a name="stpa_104">Rather, they will be asked to choose between similar projects that are perhaps in different locations or run by different organisations. That is right and proper, but I hope that in Committee we will debate the need for the decisions and involvement of the public to be based on their ability to make informed choices. That means more education.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50614-14_para5">
<a name="stpa_105">Last year, ICM conducted a poll that showed that the majority of members of the public believe that as much money is given to asylum seeker organisations as is given to organisations supporting disabled people. The reality, of course, is that almost 10 times the amount of money that is given to asylum seeker organisations is given to those supporting disabled people. I will happily place on the record that I am delighted that asylum seeker organisations get lottery grants, and I hope that they continue to do so. Alongside increased public involvement in decision making, there is also an important need, therefore, to improve public awareness of where the money is going.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50614-14_para6">
<a name="stpa_106">I turn from some of the welcome aspects of the Bill to those that give us real cause for concern. There has already been a debate about the rather bizarre difference, whereby the Big Lottery Fund has to comply with directions issued by the Secretary of State when allocating funds, whereas others need only take such directions into account. My hon. Friend the Member for Cheltenham has rightly pointed out that the 1993 legislation already effectively empowers the Secretary of State to instruct the various lottery distributors in these matters, so why is there this strange difference?
</p>

<p>
<a name="50614-14_para7">
<a name="stpa_107">If the intention is to put much greater pressure on the Big Lottery Fund than on other distributors, it will be rather difficult for Sir Clive Booth, who is doing a tremendous job as acting chairman of the Big Lottery Fund, to stick to the commitment that he gave when he said that the days of the Government issuing instructions over lottery cash for schemes such as the distribution of fruit to schoolchildren were gone. Organisations such as the National Council for Voluntary Organisations have raised real concerns about the clause. As that body points out:

</p>

<p>
<a name="50614-14_para9">
<a name="stpa_109">One particularly bizarre point about the clause is why it contains no reference whatever to the need for the Secretary of State to consult before making any direction. The Minister is well aware that only last year the Government entered into a compact with voluntary organisations, which made it absolutely clear that consultation between the respective bodies of the Government and the voluntary organisation was paramount. If it is paramount in the compact, why is the requirement for consultation not built into the Bill?
</p>

<p>
<a name="50614-14_para10">
<a name="stpa_110">Clauses 8 and 9 have already been touched on. Clause 8 gives the Secretary of State a new power to reallocate funds from one distributor to another&#151;amazingly, without having to consult the National Audit Office before doing so. In view of the Minister&#039;s reliance on the NAO&#039;s report thus far, one would have thought that a requirement to consult that body before any action is taken would be part of the Bill. I have already pointed out that the clause is bizarre in any case, given that the Public Accounts Committee has not yet reported on the matter.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50614-14_para11">
<a name="stpa_111">The Minister has said&#151;the briefing and explanatory notes also make it clear&#151;that the power in the clause will be used only as a last resort if the distributors, according to the explanatory notes, have

<a name="50614-14_para13">
<a name="stpa_113">I acknowledge that the clause represents a change from the previous Bill and I am grateful for that. At least we now have an assurance that the same good causes will continue to receive the money, irrespective of whether a different distributor provides it. I welcome that move, which followed huge opposition by the Liberal Democrats and many others to the initial proposals. Despite that change, however, the clause still hangs like a sword of Damocles over the heads of trustees. It seems to encourage them to get money out of the door at a faster rate than they would otherwise view as appropriate. That has happened because the Government seem genuinely to have misunderstood the way in which balances are managed and the requirements of project funding. We have already heard examples of the impact on the Heritage Lottery Fund.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50614-14_para14">

Ultimately, the Government can abolish any non-departmental public body deemed not to be doing its job effectively. I therefore want the Minister to explain why clause 8 is necessary.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50614-14_para18">
<a name="stpa_118">Will the Minister reaffirm one assurance that he may already have given, albeit obliquely?

<a name="50614-14_para19">
<a name="stpa_119">Clause 9 is an additional way of discouraging balances from being held in the national lottery distribution fund, and it introduces a new way of calculating the interest on such balances. I do not need to go into the matter, because the Minister has admitted that the implication is that the Government will be altering the allocation of money among good causes. He has acknowledged what the NAO said&#151;that the clause will leave the heritage lottery fund nearly &#163;16 million a year worse off. If that is what the Government want, that is fine: they can go ahead and implement the provision, but they will not have the support of Liberal Democrat Members.

<a name="stpa_120">The Bill contains a reserve power in respect of the ability to break up the licence.

The Government appear to acknowledge what they rejected a few months ago&#151;that a single licence is much preferable to one that is broken up. I hope that the Minister can assure the House that the licence will be broken up only as a last resort, as that is the approach that we support. We believe that a single licence with good competition is the best way forward. Breaking up the licence could reduce the amount of funding available and the potential for economies of scale, while raising overheads.

<p><a name="st_74"><a name="50614-15_spnew0"><b> Ms Angela C. Smith  (Sheffield, Hillsborough) (Lab):</b> 
 As previous speakers have noted, this debate is taking place in the context of rising lottery sales&#151;an increase that bucks the global trend. Moreover, the overall volume of lottery grants since 1994 now totals nearly &#163;17 billion. This is a necessary debate on a Bill that will extend the reach of lottery funding even further, thus building on this Labour Government&#039;s previous efforts to spread the sums available more fairly. The Tories may have created the lottery, but Labour has taken action to distribute funds more equitably.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50614-15_para0">
<a name="stpa_124">I welcome the measures in this Bill, which are designed to bring the funds created by the lottery closer to the people who spend their money on tickets every week, year in and year out. I am especially pleased that the Bill contains a new strategic emphasis for the distribution of funds. That three-part emphasis focuses attention on promoting well-being, on community learning and creating opportunities, and on community safety and cohesion. That emphasis is important, because it recognises not only the principal motivating factors that propel people to work on behalf of their community, but the crucial preconditions for creating successful neighbourhoods&#151;the feeling on the part of those who live, work and play in any given community that they belong and have a valuable contribution to make to that community and its well-being.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50614-15_para1">
<a name="stpa_125">The strategic direction outlined in the Bill should therefore result in a grant distribution system that is fairer and more effective than it has ever been before. Indeed, the evidence that that will be the case is already there, with the first wave of funding programmes already announced, including &#163;155 million for children&#039;s play, &#163;354 million for environmental programmes&#151;including a welcome &#163;90 million for parks&#151;&#163;165 million for well-being programmes, and &#163;155 million for investment in the infrastructure of the voluntary sector. The latter programme is especially pleasing because it recognises and underlines the importance of the voluntary sector in the Bill in building and maintaining cohesive and successful neighbourhoods, as my right hon. Friend the Minister pointed out. It recognises that not everything can be done by the state and that in some instances the job is best done by those who are most knowledgeable about what it is that actually needs to be done.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50614-15_para2">
<a name="stpa_126">The services I am talking about, which provide the glue that holds many of our communities together, are familiar to all of us. We have services, for instance, that play a huge role in providing things to do and places to go for young people. In my constituency, the lottery has already made grants available to the High Green scouts, the Stocksbridge scouts and the Ecclesfield guides. Those groups, like many others that deliver services for young people, do great work, helping young people engage in purposeful activities and negotiate their way through the sometimes difficult transition to adulthood.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50614-15_para3">
<a name="stpa_127">In my area, the lottery has also funded several self-help voluntary groups, such as the Appletree after-school club in Grenoside, the Busy Bees toddler group in High Green and the Hillsborough one-parent group, 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>14 Jun 2005 : Column 190</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>all of which provide either pre-school or after-school activities. Some &#163;750,000 has been allocated to the Hillsborough community development trust for the refurbishment of a sports pavilion, a project that will not only play a key part in the regeneration of Hillsborough park, but help to sustain the availability of high quality sports facilities for local people. That is a particularly important investment, given the recognised need to increase the level of, and participation in, sporting activities on the part of most people if we are to reduce levels of heart disease and diabetes. It is a very appropriate investment for lottery funding.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50614-15_para4">
<a name="stpa_128">On a more modest scale, the Grenoside Young at Heart and Agewell group has been given small sums, year on year, to fund dance and exercise sessions, as well as day trips and Christmas dinners. That is a valuable grant that recognises the importance of exercise and social interaction in maintaining good health as one grows older. Last, but not least, we have Action for Stannington, which has been awarded nearly &#163;15,000 to establish a recycling culture in the village.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50614-15_para5">
<a name="stpa_129">All those services are delivered to a significant degree by the people living in those communities, and that is why they are successful. The activities are shaped and delivered by local people who understand best the needs and aspirations of the communities they serve. They are essential services, but delivered voluntarily and at highest quality. It is therefore pleasing to find that the Bill will follow that principle and take the funding of facilities closer to the communities that need and use the services eligible for lottery funding. It will maximise the social return on the investment that is made week after week by those who buy tickets in the national lottery.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50614-15_para6">
<a name="stpa_130">I am also pleased that the Bill will simplify the process for applying for lottery funds, with a suggested extra yield from that measure of between &#163;6 million and &#163;12 million. That will result from a reduction in bureaucracy and administration costs, which will surely be welcomed by all hon. Members, given the nature of the debate in the recent general election. Even if the lower figure applies, it will still be excellent news for voluntary groups, as is the measure to prevent the excessive accumulation of balances by lottery fund distributors, which will also contribute to the maximisation of the return on the lottery to those very communities who create the fund in the first place. I wholeheartedly support the Bill, because it will bring lottery funding closer to the people and the communities who need it the most.

<a name="stpa_134">This may be a good point at which to remind ourselves of the Prime Minister&#039;s words. He said that funding should be used for good causes and not for things that should normally be paid for by the Government. The merging of the New Opportunities Fund and the Community Fund has given Ministers control of 50 per cent. of the funding. Mid-Bedfordshire is bordered by Luton, South and Bedford and Kempston. In the past eight years &#163;8 million of lottery funding has gone into my constituency. Luton, South has received a staggering &#163;23.4 million. Bedford and Kempston have received an equally staggering &#163;15 million. That undermines the political process. Many people in my constituency have applied for grants over the years and have been refused without being told why or how the money has been spent.

<a name="stpa_135">The Minister said earlier that when the public were asked where they wanted funding to go they said that they wanted it to go into health and education. I want to know how that question was asked. If the public were asked, &quot;Would you like money to be spent on health and education via the lottery fund?&quot;, I think that they would have said no. The public want money to be spent on health and education out of general taxation. Inequitable funding serves only to undermine the political process. Such funding is by stealth, by the back door; it is inequitable and disingenuous. It makes a mockery of the original aims and objectives of the lottery, which were to support the arts and culture.

<a name="stpa_136">In 1997, my constituency received &#163;50,000 for the arts and culture. In 2004, it received &#163;12,000.

In my constituency, spending on health and education has increased at the same rate as spending on the arts and culture, charities and traditional good causes has decreased. I have no wish to denigrate the many worthy schemes that money may go to in my constituency, in Luton, South and in Bedford and Kempston, but I should like the Minister to know that some worthy schemes have applied for funding. I have been contacted in the past few days by 12 of those schemes that have been refused. They could have been counted as very good causes.

<p><a name="st_83"><a name="50614-16_spnew7"><b> Mr. Philip Dunne  (Ludlow) (Con):</b> 
 I am pleased to contribute to the debate on this important issue. It is important because in my constituency and neighbouring constituencies that I am aware of, the lottery has been the main facilitator of numerous community-based projects that have been completed since it was so successfully introduced by the last Conservative Government. Other Members have mentioned multi-million pound projects that have been funded. I feel rather envious of those projects because since the lottery began, my constituency has had only one, to my

<br>&nbsp;<br>knowledge, although we have had a large number of much smaller distributions. In the seven years since the beginning of 1998 we have had 374 individual projects funded by the lottery for a total of &#163;14.4 million, and in many cases it was the core funding that enabled entire projects to be completed.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50614-16_para1">
<a name="stpa_138">I should like to see three specific aspects of the lottery&#039;s operation confirmed in Committee. I share the concerns of the hon. Member for Bath (Mr. Foster), who is not in his seat, that only four days have been allotted to the Committee stage.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50614-16_para2">
<a name="stpa_139">The first issue that I should like to raise is the impact of allocations for heritage projects. Admittedly, the Ludlow constituency is blessed by a particularly rich cultural and historic heritage, and consequently more of our projects have tended to be allocated in that direction. In fact, since the beginning of 1998 the Heritage Lottery Fund has made 54 awards, accounting for 14 per cent. of the awards that I have mentioned. Their combined value is &#163;4.7 million, so 33 per cent. of the money granted by the lottery distributors has been given to heritage in my constituency. That is probably one of the highest percentages in the country.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50614-16_para3">
<a name="stpa_140">If I heard the Minister&#039;s opening remarks correctly, he said that despite the establishment of the Big Lottery Fund, the proposals will not alter the allocation of funding by distributors, including for heritage and the arts. From my reading of the Bill and the explanatory notes, that is a surprise; but if true, it is welcome. He also said that between 60 and 70 per cent. of the Big Lottery Fund will go to communities and charities. Does that mean that there could be an overlap between distributors? To maintain allocations, will projects have to apply to two distributors to achieve equivalence of allocation, or are the Minister&#039;s remarks relevant only on a national average basis, rather than on a local area basis? I do not understand that point&#151;

</p>

<p>
<a name="50614-16_para4">
<a name="stpa_141">I am especially concerned about the lottery&#039;s impact on major restorations of heritage monuments and features, for example, the Teme Weirs trust in Ludlow and the pending restoration of Ludlow&#039;s town walls, to which I have already referred in this place. Without equivalence of allocation to the Heritage Lottery Fund, it is unlikely that such projects will be completed. The trustees of the new Big Lottery Fund are unlikely to give much priority to heritage projects, as they will consider that they are already well provided for due to the continuance of the Heritage Lottery Fund.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50614-16_para5">

<br>&nbsp;<br>of revenue and funding for good causes obviously relies to a considerable degree on public confidence in the lottery and in the awards made by its distributing bodies. By introducing the potential for Government influence on the Big Lottery Fund, the Bill could undermine that confidence, which in turn will undermine revenues.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50614-16_para6">
<a name="stpa_143">To give a local example, it is, regrettably, well known in my constituency that the Shropshire hospitals NHS trust is sitting on a colossal deficit, rumoured in the press to be close to &#163;20 million. I am delighted to say, however, that on 24 February 2005 a brand new MRI scanner was delivered to the Royal Shrewsbury hospital, funded in part by voluntary donation and the lottery, but I regret to tell the House that the machine has yet to be turned on. It is well known in Shropshire that the MRI scanner is sitting in a purpose-built facility in the hospital, but that the trust does not have enough funding to use it.People in Shropshire suspect that if lottery funding can be used to supply equipment to the NHS, welcome though that equipment is, it may be used to help run the equipment in the future, which will undermine confidence in the lottery and participation in the game.

<a name="stpa_144">As I am from a rural constituency, I should like to endorse the remarks of my hon.

If, as my hon. Friend said, we are funding guinea pig producers in Peru, that will not inspire confidence in the lottery distribution system.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50614-16_para8">
<a name="stpa_145">My third point may relate to the Freedom of Information Act 2000. I am concerned about access to information about lottery funding. After awards have been made and projects completed, it is possible to obtain full access to information about where allocations were made, but sometimes such information is not made readily available on projects where, although a decision has been made to allocate funding, it has not yet all been supplied. I am thinking of a case brought to my attention by a fellow councillor on South Shropshire district council: a substantial sum has allegedly been given to a local voluntary organisation, but he has had difficulty securing information on the project. The organisation in question is the Ludlow youth forum, which does some very useful work, especially in drug rehabilitation. My concern is that we have had great difficulty finding out how much money has been provided to that organisation by lottery and other bodies. To raise that matter in this debate might be to stray somewhat from the Bill, but I should be grateful if the Minister would write to me on the subject, or mention it in his winding-up speech. I hope to speak in Committee about the three concerns that I have raised in this debate.

The Conservatives advocate giving power back to the people, giving them a greater say, and ensuring that we help charities and arts, sports and heritage projects.

The Bill entrenches an approach that we have witnessed in the past few years.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50614-17_para1">
<a name="stpa_147">Rightly or wrongly, there is growing resentment as a result of a number of awards given to apparently fringe organisations. The hon. Member for Bath (Mr. Foster) alluded to public perception of the number of awards given and their actual value, but the public are experiencing a creeping sense of disquiet. To see that, I need only look at my local newspaper, which in the past fortnight has run the headline, &quot;Fury over Lotto handout.&quot; There is a feeling that awards are not being fairly given to organisations in my constituency. The hon. Member for Rhondda (Chris Bryant) highlighted the question of whether awards are distributed fairly across the country. My constituency falls within the London borough of Havering, which has received about &#163;13 million in awards to good causes since the lottery was established, whereas the London borough of Greenwich has received &#163;702 million in awards. Given such disparities, it is understandable that people are asking questions about awards and why they are given. The Bill does not address those concerns.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50614-17_para2">
<a name="stpa_148">Those concerns are given greater emphasis when we see worthy and valuable organisations in our constituencies not being given awards. I can think of two cases in my area: St. Francis hospice applied for funding but was turned down, as did a local charity, First Step. Against that backdrop, people want to know where funding is going&#151;they want transparency. Unfortunately, the Bill does not provide that transparency; if anything, it muddies the waters even more. My right hon. Friend the Member for Maidenhead (Mrs. May) has already quoted the Government response to the Culture, Media and Sport Committee&#039;s report on the national lottery, but I shall do so as well. In response to criticisms in relation to the principle of additionality, the Government said:

 I repeat my question to the hon. Member for Mid-Bedfordshire (Mrs. Dorries). Hon. Members cannot have it both ways: either they must list the projects that they support and, presumably, be willing to intervene to influence lottery funding, or they must guarantee the lottery&#039;s independence.

The House need only look at the swingeing powers taken under proposed new section 36E of the National Lottery etc. Act 1993, which would require the Big Lottery Fund to comply with directions given by the Secretary of State in almost every case, even if those directions are about who is to run the fund. The fact that such powers are being taken makes one question the independence of the organisation.

<a name="stpa_154">The Secretary of State is away, and I understand why she could not be present for Second Reading, but it is interesting to read a letter that she kindly sent to me and other new Members in which she set out the reasons to support the Bill. Referring to the New Opportunities Fund, she wrote:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_24">&quot;The Fund was also different in that it has been directed to distribute money in support of initiatives specified by Government, but still taking individual grant decisions at arm&#039;s length from Government as the other distributors do.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="50614-17_para9">
<a name="stpa_155">The point I take from that is that the initiatives are &quot;specified by Government&quot;&#151;in other words, the fund is directed by the Government. Although Ministers might argue that individual grants are determined by the fund, if the overall framework and certain decisions are specified by the Government, what we see is direction by the Government.

<p>
<a name="50614-17_para10">
<a name="stpa_156">I congratulate the Bill draftsmen on trying to set out the fund&#039;s independence by creating, in effect, a corporate body for the Big Lottery Fund and stating in schedule 2:

<a name="stpa_157">However, given all the powers reserved under the Bill and the clear prescription of the fund&#039;s terms of reference, the Big Lottery Fund looks very much like a servant or agent of the Government. The more closely one examines the legislation and the powers reserved for the Secretary of State, the more one thinks that it might have been clearer to state that the Secretary of State shall have control over 50 per cent. of the funds from the lottery and she will specify as she sees fit in relation to that money.

<a name="stpa_158">I have a couple of specific questions about the Bill. I note that clause 8, on the reallocation of funds, says that in relation to the allocation between individual distributors, for example, Sport England, if we feel that that organisation is not performing correctly, the fund would be ring-fenced for the same beneficiary, so funds could be allocated to another sports body. Is there any provision that would prevent that going to the Big Lottery Fund? It seems that the 50 per cent. threshold is being increased. I wonder whether the Minister could answer that specific point when he replies.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50614-17_para13">
<a name="stpa_159">A point that emerged from the Secretary of State&#039;s interesting letter was the funding that would come from the Big Lottery Fund&#151;she referred to &#163;60 million being made available for international grants. My understanding is that lottery funding has been ring-fenced for applications within the UK. There may be a misunderstanding on my part, but I am sure that it is not the public&#039;s understanding of how the money would be allocated. Perhaps the Minister would follow up this point when he replies to the debate.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50614-17_para14">
<a name="stpa_160">I am left with the impression that the Government seek to extend control over the way in which lottery money is to be allocated. I shall refer to another poll, as I know that the Minister was keen to emphasise the importance of consulting the public. An ICM poll published last year showed that 73 per cent. of the public supported an independent public body deciding how lottery money was to be spent. From what I see in the Bill, that is not what we have on offer. The purpose behind the Bill is to take greater control, greater power and greater authority into the hands of the Secretary of State. Unfortunately, that is taking control further away from the people who buy the tickets and voluntarily spend their money on the lottery in good faith. I cannot support the Bill because of the powers that it is designed to put, to a much greater extent, in the Government&#039;s hands.

<a name="stpa_161">Quite a lot of irritation and bureaucracy will be suffered for the several millions of pounds that the Alzheimer&#039;s Society raises for carers and people with dementia from the national lottery, but it is worth doing. It seems that in this place it is not always easy to pay compliments to our opponents, but I should pay a compliment to the Conservative Government of John Major. Despite the irritations and the bureaucracy of the system, the national lottery distributors that were established were overwhelmingly a good thing. They were cheap to apply to and they were thoughtful in that they spent a great deal of time talking through, with applicants, exactly who would benefit from projects and how those projects would work. They were supportive of applicants, especially those with inexperience; they considered difficult and unpopular causes; and they had a good track record in supporting those causes.

<a name="50614-17_para16">
<a name="stpa_162">Many of the fears that were attached to the National Lottery etc. Act 1993 were that it would cannibalise existing fundraising. Those fears turned out to be unfounded. At the time, some charities were dependent on scratch card income. There was a great deal of publicity that they would lose money, but so much publicity was raised that their funds increased. Even they did well out of the Act.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50614-17_para17">
<a name="stpa_163">The issue of additionality was mentioned during consideration of the 1993 legislation. As I rather unkindly mentioned to the right hon. Member for Maidenhead (Mrs. May), there were provisions in that Act to give the Secretary of State powers of direction. In practice, the Millennium Commission, the National Lottery Charities Board and the other distributors have acted independently for most of their history. That was much appreciated by those of us who were working in the sector. We appreciated the independence from Government that they were able to exercise.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50614-17_para18">
<a name="stpa_164">Since the Labour party has come into Government we have watched with increasing concern the progress of the so-called reforms of the national lottery distribution. First, there was the establishment of the New Opportunities Fund, which seemed to us to be established purely to meet Government priorities&#151;health, education and the environment. Those are worthy things but they have been used, as the hon. Member for Mid-Bedfordshire (Mrs. Dorries) said, to support state-run and state-funded institutions, which was never the idea of the national lottery. The lottery was there to support new causes with new money and new projects with new money.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50614-17_para19">
<a name="stpa_165">When the earliest funding priorities of the New Opportunities Fund were announced at a Labour party conference, it was clear that political control was starting to play a major role in the way in which the funds were distributed. Then we noted, with even more concern, that when the Millennium Commission was wound up it was merged with the New Opportunities Fund. We have seen a gradual increase the percentage of lottery funds under the more direct control of the Secretary of State. It has grown from 0 per cent. in 1993 to 13.5 per cent. in 1998, to 32 per cent. today and to 50 per cent. in the proposals that are before us. Earlier, the Minister was talking about moving forward, but it is clear in which direction the Government are moving&#151;eventually, presumably, it is towards 100 per cent. control by the Secretary of State. Our fears have been realised by many recent announcements. For instance, there was the decision to fund the school dinners programme. That is worthy, but money will be stolen from lottery funds.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50614-17_para20">
<a name="stpa_166">I was reassured by what the Minister said, namely, that there would be a departure from practice in the New Opportunities Fund, and from now on&#151;I think that I am quoting him correctly&#151;all important decisions would be taken by the Big Lottery Fund. That would be desirable, but we do not see that provision in the Bill. Given the Government&#039;s record, we need that provision in the Bill. Otherwise, that lottery funding becomes a tax-supporting Government policy. It may be voluntary, but it will still be a tax. That will gradually undermine ticket sales.

It is that black hole that is at the heart of the drive today.

I might add that interventions are always better if they are brief.
</p>





<p><a name="st_94"><a name="50614-18_spnew1"><b> Mr. Horwood: </b> 
 I fear that the hon. Gentleman is correct and the basis of the lottery might be undermined. It was supposed to find new money for new projects. Clause 7 contains a sweeping description of the powers of the Secretary of State. The Government took our advice soon after they came to power by allowing more independence to the Bank of England. The Chancellor has found it useful to have that political file between him and the decision makers of the Monetary Policy Committee. We should have sympathy with Ministers and want them to have similar protection. Otherwise, with these sweeping powers, they may find that they have an irresistible urge to intervene in the lottery&#039;s distribution of funds, especially when they are under pressure from the tabloid press or from rather ill-informed comments from people such as the hon. Member for Shipley (Philip Davies) in talking about politically correct funding decisions.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50614-18_para0">
<a name="stpa_167">Why would Ministers want to put themselves in such a situation? Surely they would do far better to stick to the well-established and well-respected system of allowing much more independence to the national lottery funding bodies. In Committee, we must find a mechanism to make that happen. I support what was said in the Select Committee, in its Fifth report in March 2004. It stated:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_26">&quot;whilst the national lottery and the benefits it gives to good causes should be publicised, it should not be promoted as an effective way of giving to charity. The percentage of the amount spent on a Lottery ticket that actually goes to good causes should be made clear to players.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="50614-18_para1">
<a name="stpa_168">If the promotion of lottery spending is related to charitable giving, that undermines the lottery&#039;s purpose. The lottery brought in new money because most of its marketing was based on people&#039;s desire to win millions of pounds&#151;it was not in competition with existing charity fundraising. Again, that is a good principle.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50614-18_para2">
<a name="stpa_169">We need to step back and look at the context in which charities work. The situation is difficult as there are 162,000 charities on the Charity Commission&#039;s register worth &#163;32 billion a year in income, representing a 92 per cent. growth in 10 years. Those of us with a background in the sector would accept that it has become 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>14 Jun 2005 : Column 200</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>increasingly lopsided. Of that &#163;32 billion, &#163;8.6 billion is raised just by the top 500 fundraising charities. The top 10 charities raise &#163;1.6 billion or 20 per cent. of the total. The top five charities&#151;Cancer Research UK, the National Trust, Oxfam, the British Heart Foundation and the Royal National Lifeboat Institution&#151;fundraise almost &#163;1 billion a year. Those are efficient, well-run charities, which I respect enormously. The Charities Aid Foundation, however, is right to point out that the gap between the largest and smallest charities in the UK continues to widen.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50614-18_para3">
<a name="stpa_170">Only 6 per cent. of the income of the top 500 charities comes from lottery sources, with the rest coming from public participation. The CAF&#039;s latest figures show that 43 per cent. of that income comes from individual giving, including standing orders and donations made as a result of direct marketing, telephone fundraising, community events and so on. They show that that 9 per cent. comes from legacies promoted in the same way, and that 4 per cent. comes from the trading of Christmas cards and gifts. In total, 56 per cent. of the income of the top 500 is effectively driven by appeals for popular causes to the general public. Another 13 per cent. comes from grant-making trusts and corporate donors, who are driven by popular opinion about the best causes. In many cases, companies try to find the best fit with their own customers or hold polls among their staff to decide which charities to support. I remember conducting a survey during my professional career which found that, overwhelmingly, cancer and children were the causes that received the most support.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50614-18_para4">
<a name="stpa_171">The CAF&#039;s latest figures underline the fact that the most popular causes dominate the sector. International charities receive &#163;654 million a year; cancer charities &#163;417 million a year; while children&#039;s charities are sixth in the list and receive &#163;321 million. However, we should be concerned about the less popular causes at the other end of the spectrum. The HIV/AIDS charities receive &#163;13 million; charities for the deaf &#163;33 million; and mental health charities only &#163;56 million. One might expect the elderly to be a popular cause, but only &#163;92 million was raised by such charities, a sum dwarfed by the sums raised by the most popular causes.

You have just made reference to money available for the elderly, but I should like to give the example of a pot of money available for elderly carers in Islington who are in their 80s and 90s and look after their 50-year-old children. That money is not available from local authorities because the needs of those elderly people and their children are not great enough for them to receive social security assistance. Money is therefore available from the lottery. If people in Islington were asked whether that is an appropriate use of lottery money, I can assure the hon.

 I beg forgiveness from the hon. Member for Islington, South and Finsbury (Ms Thornberry), who may have misunderstood me. I was listing the popular causes with other means of fundraising that are overwhelmingly the most important part of their income. Only 6 per cent. of the income of the top 500 charities comes from the lottery. For the precise reasons that the hon. Lady gave, the lottery is extremely important. However, there is substantial concern in the voluntary sector, particularly among the smaller and less popular causes, about the proposals for more popular involvement or, more significantly, more political involvement.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50614-18_para6">
<a name="stpa_173">The National Lottery Charities Board stood apart from the popular concentration on a few major causes, along with a few other funders such as Comic Relief and the Lloyds TSB Foundation, which have done very good work. It encouraged applications from much smaller charities and fundraising teams, as well as from people with much less experience of fundraising.

: I respect both the hard work that the hon. Gentleman has done to raise money for charity and his expertise in the field. However, will he flesh out the point that he is making? Does he accept that the bureaucracy of the lottery favours bigger charities over smaller ones because they can afford to pay people to fill in the plethora of forms? Worthwhile smaller charities, however, such as those in my constituency, lose out because they do not have the time or enough people to fill in all those forms.
</p>





<p><a name="st_100"><a name="50614-18_spnew6"><b> Mr. Horwood: </b> 
 There is an element of truth in that. However, the amount of money that goes to the top 500 charities from the lottery is proportionately less than the amount from other sources. If anything, lottery funding has traditionally favoured smaller charities. The hon. Gentleman is right that such charities have struggled. Having tried to fill in the forms myself, I know that it is a great burden, especially for charities without any professional staff who depend on the work of volunteers, so I am sympathetic to the point that he made. However, the causes that receive support from the lottery are small organisations that tackle difficult issues. In my constituency, for example, &#163;136,000 was given to the Gloucestershire Aids Trust for carers&#039; support and respite care, and &#163;5,000&#151;a small but significant sum&#151;was given to Cheltenham Open Door for the refurbishment of a drop-in centre for homeless people. People think of Cheltenham as posh and well

<br>&nbsp;<br>off, but that is not the truth. The NLCB saw through the image and funded important work with the most deprived people in my constituency. Cheltenham Housing Aid Centre received &#163;90,000 to back deposit funds for privately rented accommodation, and &#163;178,000 was provided for an outreach service on domestic violence&#151;a service which the hon.

<a name="stpa_174">The hon. Member for Ludlow (Mr. Dunne) made an important point about esoteric heritage projects, for which it is equally difficult to find popular support. The independence of the NLCB and the other distributors means that they were prepared to fund that difficult work, and the Government should be proud of presiding over such grants. Many of those charities would never have been able to afford to use other kinds of fundraising that dominate the sector such as large-scale direct marketing campaigns, telephone fundraising or big pitches to corporate donors. The lottery has been a lifeline for them and it has done them proud. However, larger charities are worried about the proposal.

An opportunity such as this, to move balances, would ensure that that work could go ahead, so that organisations that, in a week, have 250 people working with Kenfig rugby and football clubs, would have the

We have been debating in the House opportunities for youngsters to engage in sport, and we should remember that the lottery funds opened up opportunities for many youngsters in my community that would not otherwise have been available.

<a name="50614-19_para7">
<a name="stpa_186">I would like to share with the House some of the concerns and questions discussed with me by those in my constituency who co-ordinate many of our lottery bids. In particular, I thank Ty Jay Dekretser from the Bridgend Association of Voluntary Organisations&#151;with whom I am sure I will have further discussions on the Bill as it proceeds through the House&#151;and various officers from Bridgend county borough council who have shared their expertise and experience. They tell me that in Bridgend we have a particular problem with providing match funding. For example, the Kenfig Pocket Park committee has submitted an application for funding. We have a small dedicated group who have worked for two years putting together the application, but match funding is very limited.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50614-19_para8">
<a name="stpa_187">I wonder whether it is possible to consider using some of the underspend and interest money from the lottery funds to help communities where there are good ideas, good projects and people willing and eager to work, but where there are problems in raising match funding, perhaps in some of our more deprived communities. For my local authority that problem has been exacerbated by the fact that European development money has also been available, and much of its match funding has gone to objective 1 projects. We have been accessing some money, but smaller local projects have not gone ahead, which is one reason for our success rate being low.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50614-19_para9">
<a name="stpa_188">I welcome the opening of the new fund to take into account the views of the public, but we must not lose the opportunity that the lottery has given us, as a country, to tackle ideas and areas of work that were experimental or contentious. Sometimes that has related to people&#039;s perceptions of morality and what they perceive to be wrong. As one person commented to me, awards for lesbian and gay groups became more acceptable, but when those groups related to parenting, public opinion was often split.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50614-19_para10">
<a name="stpa_189">Some practices, such as advocacy and mentoring, now mainstream in local authority provision and in the public sector generally, were initiated and mainstreamed by the voluntary and community sector, often with no funding but with great determination and conviction. Lottery funding helped those projects to expand. Now, we generally recognise their worth and they are moving into mainstream local authority policy. At their inception those practices were deemed radical; now we are willing to support them.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50614-19_para11">
<a name="stpa_190">We must ensure that the Big Lottery Fund, like the Community Fund, which has been a tremendous success, will be prepared to fund new and radical ideas, to take risks and to recognise that one of the most effective ways of supporting communities, either geographically or interest-based, is to fund those new ideas. I have seen nothing in the Bill that suggests that that is not possible; I have merely heard it here today. I would therefore welcome reassurance when the Minister winds up the debate.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50614-19_para12">
<a name="stpa_191">From the voluntary sector, I have heard fears that rigid, stifling and directed priorities will damage the voluntary and community sectors and, in doing so,

<br>&nbsp;<br>reduce diversity and vibrancy. Those concerns were mentioned by the hon. Member for Cheltenham. I cite as an example the fact that, until three years ago, the United Kingdom had an established, though poorly funded, rape crisis centre network. Across the UK many victims of sexual abuse and rape were supported by volunteers who provided a free professional support and counselling service.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50614-19_para13">
<a name="stpa_192">During the past three years, that network has been lost in many areas as statutory provision has moved into the field and we have recognised the need for mainstream funding in such work. To allay some of the concerns that have been laid before the House today, we perhaps need to ensure that voluntary sector organisations in such fields continue to have access to some lottery funding so that they can continue to take new initiatives and tackle radical new ideas. We could use that work almost as a testing ground for new and innovative ideas and marry the flexibility of the voluntary sector with the funding streams available to the statutory sector.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50614-19_para14">
<a name="stpa_193">Some 30 per cent. of the Big Lottery Fund money will be used for public services. As a local Member, I feel a bit like a piggy in the middle between my local authority, which is desperate to access the money, and the voluntary sector. Lottery funding has been vital in Bridgend in enabling our very underfunded leisure services department to make a number of successful bids, benefiting my constituency and that of my hon. Friend the Member for Ogmore (Huw Irranca-Davies). Money has been accessed to develop sports facilities, with new sports barns at Cynffig, Ogmore and Ynysawdre comprehensives, as well as a new climbing wall at Pencoed and new pitches in Bryntirion. Our constituents will share use of the new Ynysawdre swimming pool, and my hon. Friend and I hope that money will be found to provide a sauna facility at the new pool.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50614-19_para15">
<a name="stpa_194">At the same time, I know that the voluntary sector fears that there will be a reduction in the provision of community-led services and the wider opportunities that they provide to communities. For example, I have discussed with the leader of Wildmill playgroup and with other community playgroups how development of nursery provision in schools has seriously affected voluntary pre-school groups. While the increase in free provision has an economic benefit for families, we must ensure that we do not lose the vital support structures that the voluntary sector brings to parents. I know how vital my own local playgroup and &quot;Meet a mum&quot; association were for me when I stopped working and my son and I found ourselves alone, with all my friends in work and my family miles away, as well as a lack of support and companionship and others from whom to learn the skills of parenting. The playgroup, the &quot;Meet a mum&quot; association and the nursery that my son attended provided me with lasting network support and provided my son with a plethora of social aunties and uncles, as well friends that he has had from birth. We must be careful that, in professionalising services, we do not lose that human dimension that makes so many of the voluntary services work so effectively. I hope that the Big Lottery Fund will help us to ensure that that dimension remains an active part of the funding that will be available.

<a name="50614-19_para16">
<a name="stpa_195">Considering the reasons for the lack of applications for funding in my constituency has led me to look again at the responsibilities that we place on the voluntary sector. In earlier debates on the Licensing Bill, one of the concerns raised was responsibilities for making and managing applications for licences for village halls. I heard the same concerns expressed when church groups that provide sitting and befriending services were required to register as domiciliary care agencies when I worked for the care standards inspectorate in Wales. I stress that we must use the Big Lottery Fund to consider how we can sustain and support the small voluntary groups that are afraid of some of the project management and legislative implications in respect of employment, health and safety; are concerned about preparing accounts; and worried about child and adult protection issues.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50614-19_para17">
<a name="stpa_196">For example, the Shaw Trust provided support services for those with disabilities who took advantage of direct payments to manage their own care packages. The task of bearing the huge responsibility placed on those with no experience in such a field was made possible by sharing the burden through the professional support of Shaw Trust officers, who managed the payroll, contracts of employment, health and safety and training issues. The Bridgend Association of Voluntary Organisations provides that work locally, but it is a single organisation. If we are to expand voluntary groups, especially the small ones, that can access lottery funding, more and more such umbrella bodies that support a network of smaller organisations must be able to access the funding. That could allow almost exponential growth among the smaller voluntary organisations.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50614-19_para18">
<a name="stpa_197">I hope that we will be able to provide that support work and not leave the smaller groups without the network of support that they need. Without such support, I fear that we may lose good ideas and initiatives, as well as the essential community link that makes projects work. Public policy may also lose that testing ground in respect of the voluntary and charity sector, which often provides initiatives and new thinking and drives services forward.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50614-19_para19">
<a name="stpa_198">In conclusion, I welcome the Big Lottery Fund and the proposed change. It is essential that we ensure the survival of the lottery, but I am eager to ensure that Bridgend finally moves on to the ladder of funded schemes that are successful. The need to build in capacity with my local communities to fund and manage lottery bids will be essential if we are to access the funds.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50614-19_para20">
<a name="stpa_199">I pay tribute to the hard work of those who spend hours, as the hon. Member for Cheltenham described, preparing and writing lottery applications and managing funds and projects that benefit their local communities. I hope that the Big Lottery Fund will ensure, through its streamlined application process, that new, creative, innovative and controversial ways of working remain a key part of the lottery role and function, and that yet more will be coming from Bridgend.

<br>&nbsp;<br>a growing band of the disappointed. It is not that they expect to wander down to the results every week to find that they have won a huge amount; they have simply become part of a growing number of people who have become disappointed by being involved in one way or another with rejected applications for funding.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50614-20_para0">
<a name="stpa_200">The group to which I refer consists of village halls and community centres. It is not surprising that a growing number of people have become disappointed when we bear in mind the role of such buildings in community work and the huge number of people who become involved in them. Almost from first thing in the morning to last thing at night, those buildings are used for a variety of activities. In the mornings, they are used for children&#039;s playgroups, nurseries and early-years education. Later on, there are coffee mornings and fundraising activities. At lunchtime, there are old and lonely people&#039;s luncheon clubs, and in the afternoons, there are forums where people meet as part of community groups. Some places have tea dances, and moving on to the late afternoon, there are after-school clubs and meetings for Beavers, Cubs and St. John Ambulance cadets. In the evenings, there are sports such as badminton, meetings of Scouts and Guides, committee meetings, fundraising activities and community events. It is not surprising that in many communities, especially in rural areas, a vast number of people have become interactive with what happens in their village hall or community centre.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50614-20_para1">
<a name="stpa_201">When the lottery was introduced, a fairly significant number of capital grants were available for refurbishments, replacements and even brand new facilities. I am pleased to say that some such developments occurred in my constituency, but that happened a long time ago. There have been very few, if any, such awards in more recent times. The Countryside Agency had a vital villages initiative to enable some more funding to be available for projects, but it was quickly curtailed. Many of those involved are now being asked to raise their contribution to a refurbishment or even replacement in the hope&#151;most of the time, it is a forlorn hope&#151;that a lottery grant will be awarded to them.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50614-20_para2">
<a name="stpa_202">At the same time, in recent years, significant costs have been imposed on village hall committees. There have been enhanced and additional health and safety regulations and developments in the disability access situation. Licensing has been mentioned, and the standards required for playschools and nurseries have changed, including standards for toilets and so on. All those factors have produced significantly greater costs for village hall committees&#151;even insurance costs contribute to that huge burden&#151;but those committees cannot access additional funding to make their facilities compatible with today&#039;s standards.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50614-20_para3">
<a name="stpa_203">For some reason, applications are almost inevitably refused, which causes huge concern and disappointment among a large section of the rural community, particularly in Cornwall and in my constituency. The hon. Member for Bridgend (Mrs. Moon) mentioned many of the problems with match funding in an objective 1 area that we have experienced, and match funding is becoming less and less feasible.

<a name="50614-20_para4">
<a name="stpa_204">People often use village halls and community centres to raise funds, but if they try to raise funds for those buildings, they encounter an ever-decreasing circle.
</p>





<p><a name="st_103"><a name="50614-20_spnew1"><b> Mr. David Heath  (Somerton and Frome) (LD):</b> 
 I assure my hon. Friend that that problem affects not only those areas that are lucky enough to have obtained objective 1 status, but other areas. Voluntary groups in rural areas are increasingly defeated by the amount of paperwork, by the cost of providing the required information and by match funding fatigue, which stops people finding the funds to enable bids to go ahead.
</p>





<p><a name="st_104"><a name="50614-20_spnew2"><b> Mr. Breed: </b> 
 My hon. Friend is right. I suspect that not only objective 1 areas but all rural areas and some other areas find it difficult to secure additional funding. Community centres and village halls can probably lay claim to meeting most funding objectives, because health services and education for the elderly and the young are provided in them. They also provide a base for all sorts of community projects and are sometimes used as sports changing rooms for nearby playing fields. Those much-needed facilities seem to hit all the right buttons, but whether the application is from the village hall committee, the Scouts, the Guides or a group for elderly people, funding cannot be obtained.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50614-20_para5">
<a name="stpa_205">Facilities are becoming older, and those that need to be replaced are 60, 70, 80 or even 100 years old and are no longer capable of hosting vital community projects. Some playgroups and nurseries will have to close because Ofsted says that the facilities are not up to standard and because the village hall committees do not have access to the necessary capital.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50614-20_para6">
<a name="stpa_206">I hope that the Big Lottery Fund will specifically consider umbrella funding for village halls, because it is unnecessary for every single village hall committee to go through a plethora of applications, and a simplified approach would allow two, three, four, five or even 10 village halls and community centres to join together in one application for funds for improvement, refurbishment or even replacement. A combined approach would allow small areas to improve facilities for all who use them. I urge the Minister to recognise that people who buy lottery tickets will become disillusioned if they experience too many setbacks on applications for reasonable projects which are in no way esoteric or difficult to understand, but which are vital to the life of communities and villages.

I have read it a number of times and tried to put myself in the Minister&#039;s position to ascertain what he is trying to achieve, but the Bill is so far away from the original intention of the national lottery, and so opposite to what my party would do in power, that I cannot find any common ground.

<a name="stpa_212">Through their refusal to listen to constructive criticism, the Government have managed to unite the Opposition, the Liberal Democrat party and a good number of free thinkers on the Government Back Benches and in the wider community.

<a name="stpa_215">When people pay their taxes&#151;they pay too much under this Government&#151;they do so, perhaps with some reluctance, as part of an understood contract with the state. As part of that contract, they receive public services, public security and, among other things, the Minister. But when people pay for a lottery ticket, they do so to enjoy themselves in the hope perhaps of winning, but in the knowledge that even if they do not win some of their money will be going to good causes.

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_34">&quot;We don&#039;t believe it would be right to use Lottery money to pay for things which are the Government&#039;s responsibilities.&quot;</p>

<a name="stpa_218">We have heard much tonight from Government Members about their definition of the additionality principle. They interpret it as meaning that the lottery can be used to pay for things that are new and which, because of their novelty, have not been paid for before by Government. The school fruit pilot scheme is a classic example: paid for by the lottery because it was new, but now paid for by central Government. Does that mean that if the Army orders a new type of tank, Ministers could use the lottery to pay for that because Government could not have paid for it before? Despite the Prime Minister&#039;s assurance, his Government soon began to dismantle the lottery and to use it to fund health and education. In 1998, Ministers placed 13 per cent. of lottery funds under their direct control; in 2001, they increased that to 33 per cent.; and now they are proposing to take 50 per cent.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50614-21_para4">
<a name="stpa_219">The Government have turned the lottery into another stealth tax. We have heard during this debate just a few examples of where lottery funds have been used in place of Government funds: &#163;93 million, as my hon.

That is why our election document &quot;Action on Arts and Heritage&quot; advocated a reputational impact clause saying that
</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_39">&quot;we will ensure that distributors take the Lottery&#039;s reputation into account when dispensing grants.&quot;</p>

<a name="stpa_226">Perhaps the Minister will say whether he finds merit in that idea and whether it will be taken up by the Government.

<a name="stpa_227">We also published detailed and widely acclaimed proposals to restore the lottery to its original purpose&#151;to give the Community Fund back its independence and guarantee that lottery money would be spent only on sport, charities, the arts and heritage. I regret that we are not able to implement those proposals, but I urge the House to consider supporting our amendment so that the lottery is not turned into another stealth tax and remains the treasured national institution that it is.

<a name="stpa_228">My hon. Friends the Members for Salisbury (Robert Key) and for Ludlow (Mr. Dunne) raised the subject of our national heritage, which is certainly dear to my heart. My hon. Friend the Member for Salisbury was particularly concerned about clauses 7 and 8 and their

That is a myth&#151;every single penny held by the Heritage Lottery Fund in its account has been committed to projects. The heritage sector has lost out under Labour, so let us be absolutely certain of the facts before we penalise it further.

My party guaranteed at the last election that we would continue to receive a quarter of lottery funds after 2009; can the Minister give the same assurance tonight? Will he rule out the Big Lottery Fund taking an even greater share of lottery funds? I doubt that he will do so, because the Government simply cannot resist taking control of such a large amount of money.

That is, of course, assuming that the Bill passes through all its stages uninterrupted. I wonder what consideration the Government have given to the major difficulties that would result from the Bill failing. That just about sums up the mess into which the Government have got themselves. The Bill is unwanted and will herald the end of the national lottery as we know it. I therefore urge hon.

<p><a name="st_108"><a name="50614-22_spmin0"><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport  (James Purnell): </b> 
 I thank the hon. Member for East Devon (Mr. Swire) for his kind remarks at the beginning of his speech. It is a genuine pleasure to make my first speech from the Dispatch Box in such an interesting debate. There have been many excellent contributions from all parties, including from several new Members.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50614-22_para0">
<a name="stpa_235">My hon. Friends the Members for Sheffield, Hillsborough (Ms Smith) and for Bridgend (Mrs. Moon) showed their passion for their constituencies and their genuine understanding of the issues. I was impressed by the speech of the hon. Member for Cheltenham (Mr. Horwood), and the hon. Member for Hornchurch (James Brokenshire) made some strong points. Debate on and scrutiny of the Bill as it proceeds will benefit greatly from the knowledge of people who have clearly had experience before entering the House of matters that are highly relevant to it.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50614-22_para1">
<a name="stpa_236">We start with some common ground between the parties. We all believe that grants should be made independently of Government and that the money should be spent as efficiently as possible and with as little as possible used on administration. There is also common ground on the reforms that need to be made to the competition for the next licence.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50614-22_para2">
<a name="stpa_237">The hon. Member for Bath (Mr. Foster) made some points about the licence. I hope that I can reassure him by saying that it is, indeed, our intention to have one major licence. The powers in the Bill are only back-stop powers should we fail to obtain the right outcome. It is worth saying that the signs are encouraging at this stage. Several organisations have shown an interest in the next licence, and we therefore hope to get a good level of competition. The powers to break up the contract into smaller contracts exist to be used only if there are problems with getting one major contract. We hope that those powers, including the changes that we are making to the National Lottery Commission, will enable a smoother and more effective process than that which took place last time.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50614-22_para3">
<a name="stpa_238">I hope that I can reassure the hon. Member for Bath about promoting the lottery. The proposed changes are not intended to promote playing the lottery&#151;they will not promote the sale of tickets&#151;but to promote its benefits, especially support for good causes in general. There was previously a constraint and a concern that lottery distributors could promote only their good causes. The proposals will give them more freedom to promote the lottery overall. The idea behind that is that the greater the trust in the lottery overall, the greater the number of sales and thus the greater the amount for good causes. I hope that those two points will reassure the Liberal Democrat Opposition.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50614-22_para4">
<a name="stpa_239">Several points were raised and I shall try to answer as many as I can. <i>[Interruption.]</i> I shall try not to take three hours&#151;I do not think that I would make it back on to the Terrace alive if I did that. Several detailed points were made but it is worth starting with those that are of genuine concern to voters. My hon. Friends the Members for Caerphilly (Mr. David) and for Rhondda (Chris Bryant) 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>14 Jun 2005 : Column 214</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>made important points on anxieties about access to lottery funds by constituencies that are away from the metropolitan centres and that had experienced genuine problems with access to grants under the old regime, before the changes that we introduced in 1998. That should concern hon. Members of all parties because, without support from constituencies throughout the country, it would not be a genuinely national lottery, there would be no genuine support and the amount of money raised through ticket sales would fall.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50614-22_para5">
<a name="stpa_240">My hon. Friend the Member for Caerphilly made a crucial point about the need to integrate lottery spending into local strategies and to give distributors more flexibility to ensure that lottery money is spent in tune with local priorities. That is one of the Bill&#039;s key objectives.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50614-22_para6">
<a name="stpa_241">Several hon. Members, including the hon. Member for Mid-Bedfordshire (Mrs. Dorries), mentioned additionality. The subject has clearly worried people, and we have been accused of breaching additionality and thus reneging on the principle laid down either by John Major or the Prime Minister. I want to make it clear that we are doing no such thing. We are putting in place the same framework on additionality that existed in 1993 when the original Act came into force. The only difference is that we have taken account of what the public tell us are their priorities.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50614-22_para7">
<a name="stpa_242">We do not decide that the Government should spend money on one cause and not another. We do not claim that the Government should spend money on education but not on the arts or sport. The logic of the Opposition&#039;s position is that the arts, sports, heritage and charities are not Government priorities. I presume that they do not claim that, owing to the changes that they advocate, they would reduce the amount of money in grant in aid for the arts and sport, heritage and charities. The arts and sport are Government priorities in the same way as education and health. We should decide on the basis not of the causes but the projects.
</p>





<p><a name="st_109"><a name="50614-22_spnew0"><b> Mr. David: </b> 
 Will my hon. Friend confirm that additionality has never been defined as something that is in contradistinction to Government policy? It has always been viewed as something that can legitimately enhance Government initiatives.
</p>





<p><a name="st_110"><a name="50614-22_spnew1"><b> James Purnell: </b> 
 That is a good point. It we took the argument to its logical conclusion, we would never grant money to anything on which the Government might conceivably spend. That would lead to a bad allocation of public funds. The Opposition may remember that our manifesto in 1997 was widely supported. We made a commitment to spend money on health and education because that was what the public wanted. That was confirmed in 2000 by a MORI poll. The hon. Member for Hornchurch asked earlier about the question in that poll. It asked what were the two or three things that people most wanted the lottery to fund. Fifty-five per cent. of people said education, and I believe that, for 69 per cent., the top priority was health. The top priorities were clearly health and education. YouGov repeated the question, asking people which existing good causes they most favoured. Charities were well 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>14 Jun 2005 : Column 215</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>supported&#151;I believe that the figure was 30 per cent.&#151;but, again, the most popular replies were health, education and the environment. If people who play the lottery tell us that, we must reflect their priorities.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50614-22_para8">
<a name="stpa_243">We must reflect the public&#039;s priorities and continue to spend money on the arts, sport and heritage because they are Government priorities, but we must also spend on the other priorities of health, education, the environment and community well-being. Do the Opposition genuinely claim that the public are wrong? Will they issue press releases tomorrow, condemning spending on MRI scanners? Will any Opposition Member volunteer to do that? Will they issue press releases condemning spending on Macmillan nurses, physical education for young people or letting young people in schools learn from veterans about history? If any Opposition Member wants to volunteer to issue such a press release, I should be happy to see the coverage in the local paper.
</p>





<p><a name="st_111"><a name="50614-22_spnew2"><b> Mr. Charles Walker  (Broxbourne) (Con):</b> 
 I am grateful to the Under-Secretary for giving way because it gives me an opportunity to put the record straight. The people whom he claims might protest about not having MRSA scanners have already paid for them through national taxation. Indeed, they have paid for them through record taxation, which the Government have imposed on them. The money that the Under-Secretary claims should go into the national health service should go to smaller charities, voluntary groups, organisations and those people who are in the community trying to do great work. It is not a case of one or the other but a matter of the Government diverting the funds where taxpayers&#039; money should be spent&#151;for example, on such scanners.
</p>





<p><a name="st_112"><a name="50614-22_spmin1"><b>Mr. Deputy Speaker  (Sir Alan Haselhurst): </b> 
 Order. The hon. Gentleman must not make a speech on an intervention.
</p>





<p><a name="st_113"><a name="50614-22_spnew3"><b> James Purnell: </b> 
 I notice that the hon. Gentleman is not putting out a press release, but if he does do so, I shall look forward to receiving it and to him opposing the money for what are, in fact, MRI scanners. I suspect that we have all been involved in raising money for cancer charities, and the point is that that can dovetail with the money raised by Government. This Government have spent more money on health than ever before. Therefore, the MRI scanners are in addition to what the Government are putting in and they benefit people&#039;s health. His constituents, I believe, would widely welcome them. If he changes his mind about putting out a press release, I shall look forward to it.
</p>





<p><a name="st_114"><a name="50614-22_spnew4"><b> Mr. Don Foster: </b> 
 I, too, congratulate the Minister on his appointment. He has been given a pretty bad hand and is making quite a good fist of it. Ultimately, does not he acknowledge that there is huge confusion in the country at large about what we mean by additionality? Does he agree with his right hon. Friend the Minister for Sport and Tourism who said earlier today that it is important that an understanding of additionality is 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>14 Jun 2005 : Column 216</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>enshrined in new legislation? Would he be prepared to work with all parties to get an agreed definition to include in the Bill?
</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm050614/debtext/50614-23.htm"/>




<p><a name="st_115"><a name="50614-23_spnew0"><b> James Purnell: </b> 
 Obviously, that can be examined in Committee. Our concern would be whether such a definition would reduce the flexibility of all distributors to make worthwhile grants.
</p>





<p><a name="st_116"><a name="50614-23_spnew1"><b> Mr. Swire: </b> 
 As a number of confusing statements are coming out surrounding the Bill. As far as I am aware, Macmillan nurses are a charity, so I would be happy to put out a press statement tomorrow saying that they would get more money under the Conservatives&#039; proposals. Given the confusion about additionality in particular, will the Minister undertake to speak with his Whips to ensure that we get more than the prescribed four days in Committee?
</p>





<p><a name="st_117"><a name="50614-23_spnew2"><b> James Purnell: </b> 
 Clearly, that is a matter for the usual channels, but the Whips have been perfectly clear that the amount of time necessary for scrutiny will be granted. The delay until October is because of the link with the Olympics decision and to ensure proper scheduling of debates. We agree that the Bill must have proper scrutiny.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50614-23_para0">
<a name="stpa_244">On Macmillan nurses, the hon. Gentleman and his colleagues opposed New Opportunities Fund money going on health and yet I have three examples of Macmillan nurses benefiting from NOF, with money spent on nursing care, on the Borders general hospital in Melrose and on a hospice in Moray. I presume that he agrees with such activities and that he therefore supports the idea of lottery money going on health.
</p>





<p><a name="st_118"><a name="50614-23_spnew3"><b> Mr. Swire: </b> 
 I am not allowing the Minister to get away with this. The fact is that Macmillan nurses are a charity&#151;charities are one of our original four pillars&#151;and as such will be entitled to receive money.
</p>





<p><a name="st_119"><a name="50614-23_spnew4"><b> James Purnell: </b> 
 It is a health charity that spends money on cancer, which clearly confirms that the Opposition&#039;s whole case has been blown apart as the hon. Gentleman thinks that money should be spent on health.
</p>





<p><a name="st_120"><a name="50614-23_spnew5"><b> Mr. Horwood: </b> 
 I have worked with Macmillan Cancer Relief, which is a charity. The percentage reserved for charities under this Government has gone down from 20 per cent. to less than 20 per cent. and is now proposed to be abolished altogether. Under the current system, help would be given according to the charity&#039;s priorities, whereas under his system it would be given according to the Secretary of State&#039;s priorities.
</p>





<p><a name="st_121"><a name="50614-23_spnew6"><b> James Purnell: </b> 
 No, the priorities would be those for which the charity had applied and which the distributors decided that they wanted to fund. <i>[Interruption.]</i> I will return to the matter later in my speech.
</p>





<p><a name="st_122"><a name="50614-23_spnew7"><b> Pete Wishart: </b> 
 I accept the Minister&#039;s point that a significant proportion of the population would like to see lottery money spent on education and health. Can he 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>14 Jun 2005 : Column 217</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>tell me, however, what percentage of the UK population supports spending &#163;1.5 billion of lottery money on infrastructure for the London Olympics bid?
</p>





<p><a name="st_123"><a name="50614-23_spnew8"><b> James Purnell: </b> 
 The hon. Gentleman started off by wishing us all the best with the Olympics decision on 6 July, and the Government are united in support of our bid. I know that both main Opposition parties support us and that he does, too. If he wills the ends, he must will the means to have a fantastic Olympic as well.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50614-23_para1">
<a name="stpa_245">On additionality, it is clear that the distinction should not be between the causes that we fund, but the projects. The attention of distributors should be focused on funding projects that are innovative, that pilot new developments, that do things that Government could not otherwise do, and that could bring organisations together in a way that Government might otherwise find difficult. I hope that I can reassure my hon. Friend the Member for Bridgend that that will continue under the Bill.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50614-23_para2">
<a name="stpa_246">Let me deal with the issue of Government control, which was raised by the hon. Members for Cheltenham and for Hornchurch. It was claimed that the Government were seeking to control grants. That is the opposite of the fact. What happened was that people raised concerns about NOF having prescribed programmes set by the Secretary of State. We have listened to those concerns and, therefore, under the Big Lottery Fund, those decisions will be much further away from Government. The Government will set some high-level priorities and then it will be up to the Big Lottery Fund to formulate the programmes, as set out in the Bill. If we consider the new programmes put forward by the Big Lottery Fund, such as children&#039;s play, parks, support for the voluntary sector infrastructure, we will recognise that those are clearly additional and clearly welcome. I assume that the hon. Member for Hornchurch supports them. The whole thrust of the proposals is to put distributors further away from Government and closer to the public, and to give the public a much greater say in how these funds are spent. That is exactly right&#151;it should be the public, not politicians, who have the keenest influence on how the money is spent.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50614-23_para3">
<a name="stpa_247">I thought that the right hon. Member for Maidenhead (Mrs. May) was slightly churlish to say that the &#163;65 million being spent through the People&#039;s Millions was a small amount of money. Most people would say that having &#163;65 million allocated by the public is a very good initiative, and it is just the start of what we want to see&#151;we want widespread consultation through citizens juries, through the telephone service and through whatever ways that distributors think are appropriate to ensure that they can properly reflect what people want. Therefore, the Bill puts distributors further from Government, much closer to the public and much further away from some Conservative Members&#039; views, which we have established today.
</p>





<p><a name="st_124"><a name="50614-23_spnew9"><b> Mr. David: </b> 
 On the critical issue of members of the public being more involved in the decision-making process, will the Minister join me in expressing some reservations about whether the internet can be effectively used in that respect given that socially excluded people do not have good access to the internet?


<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>14 Jun 2005 : Column 218</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br></p>





<p><a name="st_125"><a name="50614-23_spnew10"><b> James Purnell: </b> 
 Clearly, we must ensure that we consult the whole range of people and must not repeat the mistakes made at the beginning of the lottery, when only a subsection of the population was involved. My hon. Friend makes a good point.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50614-23_para4">
<a name="stpa_248">On charities, I hope that my hon. Friend the Member for Bridgend has been reassured by what was said about the reserved amount for charities. We guarantee that between 60 and 70 per cent. of Big Lottery Fund grants will go to the voluntary sector, which is an increase. On lifeboats, I reassure my hon. Friend the Member for Blyth Valley (Mr. Campbell) that lifeboats can apply for grants. They have already received &#163;2 million, and if he wants to write to me, I will be happy to examine the issue that he raised.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50614-23_para5">
<a name="stpa_249">Finally, the hon. Member for Ludlow (Mr. Dunne) showed his keen interest in heritage, and he will clearly be campaigning on that during his time in the House. We have made it clear that the Heritage Lottery Fund will not lose any money under this Bill. I hope that he will be reassured that the power concerned would not remove any money from the Heritage Lottery Fund&#151;it is merely there as a backstop if people are failing to spend their balances.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50614-23_para6">
<a name="stpa_250">We should give credit where credit is due. Many people have paid tribute to John Major and the previous Conservative Government for creating and launching the lottery. Clearly, we should repeat that tribute. The Major Government will be remembered for three things: the national lottery, Black Wednesday and the cones hotline. One out of three is not bad. I pay tribute to Chris Smith for bringing the lottery much more into line with the people&#039;s priorities. When we came to power, nearly half the value of lottery grants was going to London and the south-east even though they contain only a quarter of the population of this country. Clearly, that was a scandal. The Tories were on their way to ruining the national lottery. They were turning it into a lottery run by the great and the good, for the great and the good. Chris Smith put that right, and the Labour Government changed that, so that lottery priorities are now much more in line with those of the people. The amount of money going to London and the south-east is now in line with the number of people in London and the south-east.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50614-23_para7">
<a name="stpa_251">This Bill will put the distributors at a much greater distance from the Government. It will give the public much more power. It merges three distributors into one, and it will save money to put back into good causes. It will raise confidence in the national lottery, and I commend it to the House.

<p><a name="st_136"><a name="50614-25_spnew0"><b> Mr. Julian Brazier  (Canterbury) (Con):</b> 
 I am grateful for this opportunity to discuss our armed forces serving abroad in operational theatres such as Iraq and Afghanistan. I am delighted to see my hon.&#151;and gallant&#151;Friends the Members for Blaby (Mr. Robathan) and for Newark (Patrick Mercer) in their places. I am also glad that the hon. Member for Chorley (Mr. Hoyle) is in the Chamber, as I know that, like the Minister who will reply to the debate, he takes a close interest in all matters affecting the welfare of our armed forces.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50614-25_para0">
<a name="stpa_252">Hon. Members of all parties in this House accept that we owe a special duty of care to those men and women who are required to take daily risks with their lives on our behalf, and to carry out duties that no other job requires. The military structure has to provide them with a working environment in which there are clearly understood rules, and with an ethos that enables men and women who regard themselves as ordinary to deliver quite extraordinary things again and again. That is something that the British Army, and our other two services, have been achieving for generations. The success of the British forces in Basra, and the relationships that they built with the local community there, reflect that.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50614-25_para1">
<a name="stpa_253">The bonds of loyalty and trust&#151;the vertical ones between the different ranks, and the horizontal ones too&#151;that are built in peacetime are vital when a regiment finds itself in harm&#039;s way. That is why many of us were deeply concerned that Parliament should have subjected the armed forces to a legal framework that is alien to British law and enforceable by foreign judges who are wholly ignorant of the British military way&#151;and, in many cases, of war itself.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50614-25_para2">
<a name="stpa_254">Tonight, I want to focus on two cases: the current investigation of Colonel Jorge Mendonca; and the earlier case pursued against Trooper Williams. I hope that those examples will illustrate why the current legal framework is grossly unfair to men and women to whom we owe so much, and why it strikes at those very bonds of trust that lie at the heart of military excellence.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50614-25_para3">
<a name="stpa_255">I want to make it clear that I do not for one second seek to defend any soldier of any nation who abuses his uniform and commits atrocities against civilians or helpless prisoners. Such atrocities are much rarer in the British Army than in any other army that frequently sees action today. The attitudes and the ethos of the British Army have prevented, in the vast majority of cases, the sort of atrocities that so many other armies commit. The idea that the sort of micromanagement that the International Criminal Court Act 2001 entails will improve that is wrong. Indeed, it will work the other way. In the Balkans, it was those European armies that had the least effective discipline and poorest leadership&#151;it is odious to name names, but I am afraid that the example of the Dutch comes to mind in a couple of famous incidents&#151;that were responsible for the worst incidents.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50614-25_para4">
<a name="stpa_256">It is quite right that when genuine atrocities are suspected, they should be investigated and pursued. If necessary, charges should be brought and taken through 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>14 Jun 2005 : Column 228</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>the legal system. However, in the past any charges were always made in accordance with British concepts of justice and tried by a court martial, in which military officers who were familiar with pressures under which soldiers operate would moderate their judgments accordingly. In plain English, that meant that before a man bearing arms for his country abroad could be charged, evidence would have to exist that he or she was directly responsible for deliberate wrongdoing.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50614-25_para5">
<a name="stpa_257">Instead, the International Criminal Court Act has introduced something very different. Section 65 (2) states:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_58">&quot;A military commander . . . is responsible for offences committed by forces under his effective command and control, or . . . his effective authority and control&quot;&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="50614-25_para6">
<a name="stpa_258">an ambiguous phrase&#151;
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_59">&quot;as a result of his failure to exercise control properly over such forces where . . . he either knew, or . . . should have known that the forces were committing or about to commit such offences, and . . . he failed to take all necessary and reasonable measures within his power to prevent or repress their commission&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="50614-25_para7">
<a name="stpa_259">The press have carried several stories about Colonel Mendonca&#039;s case, but going into detail might involve compromising others facing charges resulting from the death of a civilian, Baha Musa. I simply want to draw attention to several facts. First, Colonel Mendonca received a Distinguished Service Order, the Army&#039;s second highest award for gallantry, for his handling of his regiment under extremely difficult conditions in Iraq. Therefore, we should not deal with him lightly. Whatever may or may not have happened in the death of Mr. Musa, it is uncontentious that Colonel Mendonca was nowhere near the scene of the alleged crime. He was some 13 miles away. Nor has there ever been any suggestion that he actively encouraged soldiers to commit an offence. But under the wording of the Act, he has been subjected to a military investigation and advised to seek legal advice. Even if the charges against him are dropped, the International Criminal Court is free to pursue him as it, and it alone, is the judge of whether any investigation in this country was adequate.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50614-25_para8">
<a name="stpa_260">The second case is that of Trooper Williams. I shall cite the facts entirely from Treasury counsel&#039;s view of the facts of the matter&#151;not the defence&#039;s view&#151;so these points are conceded by the prosecuting authority. Trooper Williams was one of a patrol that caught six Iraqi insurgents moving a cart containing heavy machine-gun ammunition. One of the Iraqis escaped and Trooper Williams and another soldier chased him into the courtyard of a private dwelling. The subject resisted capture and was killed, although he subsequently proved to be unarmed. Treasury counsel conceded that
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_60">&quot;The troops worked in dreadful physical conditions, never knowing when, in a moment, an apparently benign situation would turn into a lethal attack&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="50614-25_para9">
<a name="stpa_261">My hon. Friend the Member for Newark will say more on that, if he catches your eye, Mr. Deputy Speaker. However, I ask the House to focus on those words. Those were the grounds that the Treasury counsel advanced for finally abandoning the case. However, surely the facts in that statement should have been obvious to the prosecuting authorities from the beginning.


<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>14 Jun 2005 : Column 229</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>

<p>
<a name="50614-25_para10">
<a name="stpa_262">One can only imagine the courage it took for two lightly armed soldiers, without backup, to pursue an enemy into a rabbit warren of housing in a country abounding with armed angry men. The soldiers could easily have turned a blind eye and let the man get away, and nobody would have even considered bringing charges against Trooper Williams. His commanding officer chose to stand behind him. Despite that, no less an authority than the Attorney-General overruled the commanding officer&#039;s finding that there was no charge to answer and ordered the Crown Prosecution Service to prosecute Trooper Williams. It had been established that the Iraqi was a member of the opposition, and Trooper Williams chose to do his duty. However, the Attorney-General decided, from the comfort and safety of his office, to prosecute a man who did his best in the heat of the moment.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50614-25_para11">
<a name="stpa_263">It has not been lost at any level in the Army that that case went so far, and was only finally reluctantly abandoned when it became clear that the particular circumstances were unlikely to convince a jury. Furthermore, the International Criminal Court could still, as it could in the Mendonca case, choose to forget the British process and pursue a prosecution of its own against Trooper Williams.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50614-25_para12">
<a name="stpa_264">If those two cases separately are very worrying, they are even more so when put side by side. Let us imagine a situation in which the two cases run together. A good commanding officer is one who gives clear instructions to his subordinates and lets them get on with them. However, in future he will be endangering his position because the provisions in section 65(2) of the Act leave him open to prosecution if he does not take

Worse still, if another case like that of Trooper Williams were to go to trial, the CO who did the right thing&#151;supported a subordinate doing his duty bravely under difficult conditions&#151;would have the added moral pressure that he could himself face charges if he were to dismiss the case, because it could be argued, either in this country or before the ICC, that he had failed

<a name="stpa_269">is a charter for dereliction of trust between commander and subordinate. Does anybody believe that British officers have been involved in widespread cover-ups? I do not believe that that is the Minister&#039;s view, because I know that he is committed to the interests of our armed forces, but if it is, he must tell the House. If that is not his or the Government&#039;s view, on what possible basis are we putting that threat against commanding officers? As I said, armies that do not commit atrocities are not armies that are micro-managed; they are not armies with

<a name="stpa_270">After seeing the way in which Colonel Mendonca has been treated, every commanding officer will have to fight the temptation to distance himself from any soldier in trouble. Many would say, perhaps cynically, that that was the greatest temptation that members of the chain of command faced before this disgraceful law was passed.

<a name="stpa_271">The men and women who wear uniform on our behalf in Iraq suffer terrible discomforts. They often suffer horrible wounds, too, and they face the risk of death each day. Another large group of soldiers is due shortly to go to Afghanistan. Territorials from my constituency left last month for Iraq. Those men and women are entitled to expect Parliament to support them when they make split-second decisions in difficult and dangerous circumstances. It is unfair that the bonds of trust that hold our regiments and units together should be undermined in this shameful fashion.

<p><a name="st_137"><a name="50614-26_spnew0"><b> Mr. Lindsay Hoyle  (Chorley) (Lab):</b> 
 Obviously, tonight we are discussing an important subject. It is important that we air our views on behalf of those who find themselves at the wrong end of the law when they thought that they were performing their duty on an order from this country to go to war. Those people put their lives at risk and rightly did the job that they felt they had been trained to do.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50614-26_para0">
<a name="stpa_272">Yes, there is a rogue element in everything; and yes, there was a tragic case of an Iraqi whose life was taken in jail&#151;we cannot shy away from that. Somebody is guilty and should be brought to trial. However, should a colonel who was 13, 16 or 20 miles away&#151;no one can be sure because he was away from where the event happened&#151;face the threat of court action or a war crimes trial under a system that was introduced for people such as Milosevic? How on earth could a British colonel doing his duty in a proud regiment such as the Queen&#039;s Lancashire suddenly find himself being tried alongside Milosevic? Milosevic was responsible for genocide within Europe. How can a British colonel who was nowhere near, and was unaware that the event had taken place, face the threat of such a trial?
</p>

<p>
<a name="50614-26_para1">
<a name="stpa_273">One must ask, why should it stop at a colonel? Why not the brigadier? Why not the general on the ground? Why not the commander of the British forces? Why not, some might say, the Minister or the Prime Minister? There is no end if we follow the chain that is being used so far. Surely we ought not to say that we are making a colonel a scapegoat. What is happening is a tragedy. There needs to be an investigation into the circumstances of that death; nobody will shy away from that. Someone is guilty and someone should be tried. However, it is unacceptable to try and make responsible a colonel who was doing his duty and was given one of the highest honours, a DSO, for his services in Basra. For a man who led his regiment, the Queen&#039;s Lancashire, suddenly to find himself in line with Milosevic, a war criminal, is unacceptable.

<br>&nbsp;<br>according to the wishes of this House should be treated in the worst possible way. It is not acceptable. It is not the right way to go ahead. I hope that common sense will prevail quickly. Let us lift the cloud that is hanging over the British Army. Otherwise, people will say, &quot;Why should I join the Army? Why should I risk my life in any of the three services to find that I may be classed with Milosevic?&quot; It is not the way forward. I hope that people in the Ministry of Defence will agree and that the Minister will bring some common sense to the approach that has been taken so far. I am pleased that the hon.

The average age of that gang from Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire was 19&#189;. Most of my private soldiers were straight out of training. They were a little over 18. I asked those boys to go to Bosnia to do a difficult job.

It is a demanding job to get things right when one has youngsters of this ilk around who can get things terribly wrong. One of my lance corporals some 25 miles away from my battalion headquarters in Bosnia got hold of some slivovic, got drunk, took a pistol and, for reasons best known to him, shot at one of my interpreters, and missed. He probably should have been charged for bad musketry, but there we are. The point was that the soldier committed a crime. He was arrested and tried under the Army Act 1955. At no moment did I, as his commanding officer, feel that my future, my career, my judgment or my integrity was in doubt. I recommended that that soldier went forward to court martial, and he was duly punished.

<a name="stpa_278">It is instructive and interesting that next door to me    was a battalion that did not come from Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire. It got things dreadfully wrong on a number of occasions. At the end of its tour its commanding officer was told that there would be no decoration or promotion for him. He had made a bad job of commanding the battalion. The soldiers under his command who faced discipline under the Army Act did just that. He was not tried; he was not dragged in front of the court&#151;he paid the price in another way. Those conditions were small beer compared to those faced by the Queen&#039;s Lancashire Regiment. It is a fine regiment. I had the honour to command one of its companies under my operational command in Bosnia, and I had nothing but admiration for its men.

<a name="stpa_279">Regiments do not change their spots over 300 years. That regiment was constantly attacked&#151;by gunfire, improvised explosive devices or ambushes. Many of its soldiers were wounded and one of its officers was killed. They had the difficult job not of Telic 1, which involved fighting a clearly defined enemy, but of on the one hand dealing with terrorists, insurgents and enemies, and on the other helping to rebuild the country and deal with destitute men, women and children and the appalling problem of prisoner handling&#151;all this on about four hours sleep a day, probably in two two-hour bursts. Mr. Deputy Speaker, I do not know if you have experienced that, but if you are 18 or 19 and you are getting four hours kip a day it really is not good. I have experienced it. On top of that, they were operating in temperatures between 40 and 50o C. It was not easy.

<a name="stpa_280">What was the judgment on that battalion at the end of their time in Basra? A handful of mentions in dispatches, the first military cross to a warrant officer that the regiment had won in 40 years, and the commanding officer not just given the distinguished service order, but promoted to full colonel at one of the earliest ages possible, earmarked for higher command in the Army, and told that he would probably get an operational brigade in the near future. Colonel Jorge Mendonca&#151;I know him well&#151;is and was no fool. He was a fine officer who led a fine battalion well.

Again, it did not happen to me eight or nine years ago when I was commanding in Bosnia. I absolutely echo the point so presciently made by the hon. Gentleman. If one is going to charge a commanding officer under the Army Acts and thus the International Criminal Court Act, where does the responsibility stop?

I want it done by a certain time, with the expenditure of a certain amount of ammunition.&quot; That subordinate is then told, &quot;Go, my boy. Don&#039;t ask questions. If I tell you to capture hill 60 and the enemy is not on hill 60, press on to hill 70; take it. Do not ask questions.

What it means is that commanding officers, company commanders and the other commanders at all chains of command will simply say, &quot;No. I will not take this risk; I will not use my initiative because if I do, I may well end up going to court. Even if my superiors under the Army Acts find me not guilty or find that there is no case to answer, I can still be tried under the International Criminal Court Act.&quot;

They have thrown down their weapons or they have threatened to throw down their weapons and say, &quot;If you wish us to go on the streets, prepared to use lethal force, you must give us some protection.&quot; The Trooper Williams case and the case of Colonel Jorge Mendonca take that assurance away at a stroke.

<a name="stpa_288">One of the hardest things to cope with was my time in Northern Ireland. One was sent as a soldier into what was effectively a civilian conflict and one had to walk the tightest of tightropes. Instructions, yellow cards and warnings were issued; any soldier who got one of those wrong was very quickly charged with failure or a crime. Indeed, on one of my tours two of the soldiers that I served with&#151;Guardsman Fisher and Guardsman Wright&#151;were tried and convicted of murder for actions exactly comparable to those that led to this debate. What was interesting then was that those young men said that they had made a genuine mistake. It is my belief that they did. However, in the end they became part of the Northern Ireland peace process, and yet again, young men in a difficult situation effectively became a political football. I fear that many of the charges due to be laid or being laid in the Iraq conflict may enter that realm as well.

<a name="stpa_289">My hon. Friend asked why we do not charge these individuals purely under the Army Acts? Why do we have to go through the international court and not only wash our dirty washing in public but do no favours to men and women currently serving abroad? Imagine what will happen in the streets of Afghanistan or other countries if one of our soldiers has been sitting next to those war criminals who are the worst in Europe for many decades. People will say, &quot;Look, the British Army is the same as Milosevic and all those creatures who deserve to be in the dock.&quot; The Government need to be very wary of that.

<a name="50614-27_para3">
<a name="stpa_290">It is interesting to ask why these soldiers are in such a pressured environment at the moment. One reason is the Government&#039;s relentless use of soldiers with inadequate equipment and with, often, a very heavy, politically motivated timetable. My regiment, for example, was sent to Basra last year for what was supposed to be nine days of in-theatre training, to get used to the 50&#176; temperatures and to using the equipment. However, the Government chose to deploy the Black Watch with the promise that the regiment would be back by Christmas, so the nine days turned into two days. My regiment&#039;s equipment had not arrived, yet it was still sent north into the conflict zone. If that is not a recipe for future disaster, I do not know what is; it puts young men into difficult situations without protection.

<a name="stpa_291">The handling of the case of Colonel Mendonca and the Queen&#039;s Lancashire Regiment needs to be addressed. More than a year ago, the regiment and the individuals were informed that no more cases would proceed. They were told that the Special Investigation Branch had concluded its investigations and that that would be that for the four individuals charged originally. However, in March along came a new view from the Ministry, or indeed the Solicitor-General, that 11 people could be charged. That is completely wrong. The Minister should charge and be done.

Did the Minister, the Secretary of State, the brigadier or the Chief of the Defence Staff write specific instructions?

<a name="stpa_299">In the early 1990s, conflicts in the former Yugoslavia and in Rwanda, and the appalling brutality perpetrated by parties to those conflicts, brought the subject of genocide to the fore once again. As a consequence, a draft statute was presented to the General Assembly and an ad hoc committee on the establishment of an international criminal court was set up to hold individuals to account for atrocities. The drafting of the text was finally completed in April 1998. In summer 1998, a United Nations diplomatic conference on the establishment of the court was held in Rome.

<a name="stpa_304">In this country, legislation passed by this Parliament was needed to ensure that the UK could co-operate with the ICC. Devolution meant that the Scottish Parliament needed to pass a similar Bill for the same purpose. The legislation was needed to enable the United Kingdom to ratify the statute. The International Criminal Court Act 2001 covers England, Wales and Northern Ireland, and 

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>14 Jun 2005 : Column 237</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>many of its provisions extend to Scotland as well. The Act establishes a legal basis for the UK to offer support and co-operation to the ICC in all the ways provided for in the statute that were not already possible under domestic law: for example, UK authorities are empowered to arrest and surrender suspects indicted by the ICC. However, I repeat: the ICC will be able to take jurisdiction over an offence committed in the UK or by a UK citizen only if the domestic authorities are unable or unwilling to investigate or prosecute the case. The Act also incorporates the statute offences&#151;genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity&#151;into domestic law, so that the British courts can try those offences themselves.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50614-28_para2">
<a name="stpa_305">During the passage of the legislation, concerns were expressed about the implications for our service personnel. First, there was concern that the ICC and the Act were creating new criminal offences. However, the Attorney-General told Parliament that the ICC statute contained descriptions of war crimes to which Parliament in this country had already assented. The UK&#039;s armed forces have always sought to conduct armed conflict in accordance with international law and the Bill, he said, would not alter that fact.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50614-28_para3">
<a name="stpa_306">Secondly, there was concern that a politically motivated prosecution could reach the ICC. Some said that it could not be guaranteed that the court would never bring politically motivated charges against UK personnel, but the Government took the view that the risk was minimal. We remain satisfied that the Rome statute contains sufficient safeguards against such cases being brought before the court. In addition, there would have to be a catastrophic failure of the UK criminal justice system for the ICC to assume jurisdiction.

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_66">&quot;It falls to the ICC to determine whether these circumstances apply. There is an appeals procedure but the ICC determines the appeal as well.&quot;</p>

<p>
<a name="50614-28_para4">
<a name="stpa_307">The examples I gave represent a departure from the standards that we traditionally expect of our armed forces. That a commanding officer should be held responsible because he might have micro-managed a situation and prevented something from happening 13 miles away is a concept wholly foreign to British military law and British military command.
</p>





<p><a name="st_144"><a name="50614-28_spnew3"><b> Mr. Touhig: </b> 
 I understand that, but I can only repeat that the Government&#039;s view is that there would have to be a catastrophic failure of our criminal justice system for the ICC to assume jurisdiction in such matters. The 2001 Act does not make British service personnel more vulnerable; it does not criminalise any conduct that was previously lawful. The definition of war crimes in the statute is already part of established law of armed conflict. The responsibilities of a commander for the offences of forces under his command as set out in the statute go no further than is already the case in our own armed forces: neglect of duty has always been an offence under military law.

<br>&nbsp;<br>



<b>14 Jun 2005 : Column 238</b>

<br>&nbsp;<br>where responsibility starts and where it stops if one accepts his argument? One might say that it stops with the formation in which the incident or offence occurred. Perhaps it stops with the cap badge, in which case it is instructive to note that some of those charged in the case that we are discussing are not soldiers of the Queen&#039;s Lancashire regiment. Does responsibility stop at lance corporal? Section commander? Platoon commander? Company commander? If it should reach as far as commanding officer, why not brigade commander?

 I repeat that the responsibilities of a commander for the offences of forces under his command as set out in the statute go no further than is already the case in our own armed forces: neglect of duty has always been an offence under military law.

 I return to the point that I made earlier. I described an incident in my battle group&#151;my battalion&#151;where one of my non-commissioned officers had committed a crime. Indeed, he had. He was charged with that crime. At no point in that process did I feel myself vulnerable. At no time did his company commander, his company second-in-command or his platoon commander feel vulnerable. What is the change?

 I do not think that there is a change. The point that the hon.

<a name="50614-28_para5">
<a name="stpa_308">It is not the first time that the ICC has had jurisdiction over our forces in operations. The personnel of every NATO state during the Balkans conflict were subject to the similar criminal jurisdiction of the ICC on the former Yugoslavia.

 I am sorry to disagree with the hon. Gentleman. I do not believe that there is anything further that existed before the Act was brought into force. There were procedures with which our forces were expected to comply under British law. Those procedures remain today. They have not been changed as a consequence of the Act.

<p><a name="st_151"><a name="50614-29_spnew1"><b> Mr. Hoyle: </b> 
 I think that the question is why does it stop at the colonel? Why does it not go to a brigadier? Why not a general and why not a chief of staff? Where does the process end? Does it go right through Government? We understand that the process has reached a colonel, but why does it stop there? Why does it not continue right through to the Prime Minister?

 My hon. Friend has reinforced an important point made by Opposition Members. However, I am not tempted to trespass down that path, as an investigation is still under way. The implication of this evening&#039;s debate is that no one should reach hasty conclusions on such matters.

<a name="stpa_314">The hon. Member for Canterbury appeared to suggest that we carried out a different procedure in our investigations in the Baha Musa case. I would like to reassure him, however, that we have not done anything

<br>&nbsp;<br>differently from the way in which we did things prior to the implementation of the Act. A number of references were made to Trooper Williams. All soldiers understand that they are ultimately accountable for their actions to a court of law, but they can be assured that if they act in good faith and in accordance with the rules of engagement they should have nothing to fear from scrutiny of their conduct. Indeed, Trooper Williams was supported throughout, as are all service personnel facing legal proceedings, by the Ministry of Defence. Defence costs were met by the Department, and his regiment supported him by, for example, appointing a full-time officer for his direct assistance. That demonstrates the care provided for people in the circumstances in which Trooper Williams found himself, and it is the right way in which to tackle such matters. The hon. Gentleman said that the Attorney-General decided to overrule the decision of Trooper Williams&#039;s commanding officer. My advice is that senior Army staff were concerned that the legal advice on which the CO acted was flawed. The papers were then passed to the Attorney-General, who referred the matter to the Crown Prosecution Service. The decision to prosecute was made by the Director of Public Prosecutions. The court made it clear that there was not any criticism of the DPP, the Attorney-General or the Army, but senior Army staff were concerned about the legal advice given to the CO at the time.

<a name="50614-29_para1">
<a name="stpa_315">The hon. Gentleman made an important point about the ethos at the heart of the Army. He rightly said that bonds forged in peacetime make the Army stronger and more unified as it goes into conflict.

<p><a name="st_153"><a name="50614-29_spnew3"><b> Mr. Andrew Robathan  (Blaby) (Con):</b> 
 I am grateful to the Minister for giving way, particularly as I have not attended the whole debate, and heard only the opening speech of my hon. Friend the Member for Canterbury (Mr. Brazier). Is not the ethos the crux of the matter? The Minister has spoken a great deal about the International Criminal Court, and the need to prosecute war crimes, atrocities and genocide. However, in this case, we are talking about the prosecution of war when, in good faith and in the heat of battle, people are required to make a split-second decision. Trooper Williams may have been acquitted, but he experienced months of stress and horror. We ask these people to go and do our bidding in war and in times of danger, so we must support them to the hilt. This will lead to a change in the ethos of the armed forces to the extent that we will not be able to expect them to take part in war in the same way.
</p>





<p><a name="st_154"><a name="50614-29_spnew4"><b> Mr. Touhig: </b> 
 I understand the point that the hon. Gentleman is making, but I can only repeat my advice that senior Army staff were concerned about the legal advice given to Trooper Williams&#039;s CO. That is how the process started. I admit, however, that that does not detract from the stress, pain and suffering that he and his family experienced in those difficult times and with which we all sympathise. As I said, the Department supported him throughout that period, as we thought that it was right and proper to do so.

<br>&nbsp;<br>not be made a scapegoat. A proper investigatory procedure is being carried out. That is the right way in which to conduct these matters. I will not tolerate scapegoating, and I am sure that other hon. Members will not do so either. The hon. Member for Newark (Patrick Mercer) spoke with considerable authority, given his experience, and he made a valuable contribution to our short debate. That shows the House at its best&#151;people can bring their experience to bear on a major issue such as this and enhance the quality of the debate. The hon. Gentleman talked in real terms about the difficulties that may have to be faced, the tense circumstances in which decisions have to be made and the consequences that may arise from those decisions.

<a name="stpa_317">The hon. Member for Lancaster and Wyre (Mr.   Wallace) made a similar contribution, again emphasising the importance of the House having people on both sides who are able to make a useful and important contribution to an issue as complex as this.

<br>&nbsp;<br>International Criminal Court in that endeavour is matched by our commitment to the rights and well-being of our forces. That has to be uppermost in our minds; it certainly is in mine and, I know, in that of my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State. Our forces perform immensely difficult and dangerous duties with distinction in many parts of the world. We ask them to serve, and they serve, and they serve us well.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50614-29_para5">
<a name="stpa_319">There is nothing mutually inconsistent in the aims that I have outlined. We and our service personnel have nothing to fear from the International Criminal Court. Only tyrants and others who callously ignore and breach the established rule of international law, and oppress and persecute the vulnerable, should feel its justice. I am confident that the values and standards of our armed forces, as exemplified by the comments made in the debate, the incomparable training that they receive and the quality of our leadership that they have will hold us in good stead, whatever comes.
