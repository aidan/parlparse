I doubt it, but they need to take place because they will, in themselves, represent progress, and the huge population of Nigeria want the chance to express a view on how they will be governed in future.

predicated on the continuance of democratic institutions and, most immediately, on next year&#146;s elections. DFID currently funds voter registration, but with minimal tangible success. Just 2 million out of 70 million possible electors have been registered, thereby jeopardising the elections. What is DFID&#146;s strategy to put pressure on the Nigerian Government to ensure that these elections take place, and to increase the amount of domestic legislation and the level of public procurement and fiscal transparency initiated by the Nigerian Government, in order to ensure the confidence not just of the international community, but more importantly, of the Nigerian people themselves?</p>

His second point is also important, as it is about good governance. Fighting corruption and improving financial management are essential to Nigeria making progress. That is why we have supported the extractive industries transparency initiative, and I welcome the fact that one state governor is currently on trial. In the Dariye case, the High Court yesterday ruled that &#163;1 million of assets that were in London can now be returned to Nigeria. That shows what needs to happen: if money is stolen, we must play our part in returning it to the people from whom it was thieved in the first place. Nigeria can contribute by impeaching governors accused of corruption on a case-by-case basis. I can see no reason why anyone who holds public office in Nigeria should be exempt from prosecution if there are grounds to think that that person has broken the law. That has been discussed in Nigeria&#146;s constitutional commission. Although no progress has yet been made, I very much hope that it will.</p>

Discussions are taking place in the UN Security Council about whether a support and training mission for the transitional institutions should be set up. The states belonging to the intergovernmental authority on development have made proposals for a peace and support operation, but the central message that all parties in Somalia need to hear from the rest of the world is that the only way forward is to sit down and talk through the problems.

We support the transitional institutions, and is it right to help them build their capacity. However, that needs to be done in a way that does not lead to the consequences that she has described, as that would be a disaster.

They fit into two categories. First, inside Iraq, it is important that we complete the building up of capability, especially that of the Iraqi army. For example, down in the south, the Iraqi army is now capable of taking on security in two out of the four provinces and it is increasingly doing so in Basra. We have to complete that process. We must also ensure that the governance and capability of the Iraqi Government are improved. That relates not only to the way in which the Government function, but to the disbursement of money in both Sunni and Shi&#146;a areas. It is important that we make sure that the process of reconciliation that the Iraqi Prime Minister has outlined is carried through with greater effect than has been the case so far. Secondly, outside Iraq, as I said to the inquiry, and as I have said to the House on many occasions, we have to pursue a policy for the whole middle east, which means in particular&#151;and starting with&#151;finding a solution to the Israel-Palestine conflict. That will be absolutely essential if we are to put that region on a more stable footing.</p>

It has always been my view that it was in the British national interest to remove Saddam Hussein and to stand shoulder to shoulder after 9/11 with our American allies. At the moment, it is important that we complete the mission that we have set for ourselves in the south of the country. Thanks to the work that British troops have been doing, the operation that has been going on bit by bit in Basra to turn over control of security to Iraqi forces has been completed in about half the city. Reconstruction and development projects are going in behind that. I am pleased to say that the process has been relatively successful, and if it is successful, of course it diminishes the need for British troops to patrol in Basra.

<b>6 Dec 2006 : Column 300</b><br>

<p><a name="st_o65"><a name="06120652000099"><a name="61206-0003.htm_spmin0"><a name="06120652000447"><b>The Prime Minister:</b> The right hon. Gentleman was obviously not listening to a word that I said in my initial reply. The fact is that the results are hugely up since 1997; those are the facts. What is more, as I have just indicated, half of those kids who attain the right grades aged 11 are now getting to level 5, and that is a huge improvement since 1997. In addition to that, the number of computers in the classroom has doubled. In addition to that, for those aged 14 the results are up, as they are for those aged 16 and 18. As for what the right hon. Gentleman said about the chairman of Ofsted, she actually said that things had considerably improved over the last few years. I agree entirely that there is a long way to go&#151;of course there is. It is not acceptable that any child aged 11 does not achieve the requisite literacy and numeracy, but the situation is a darned sight better than what we had under his party.</p>

<p><a name="st_o66"><a name="06120652000100"><a name="61206-0003.htm_spnew0"><a name="06120652000448"><b>Mr. Cameron:</b> What she said was that it was a national disaster. Why not look at the five core subjects, and how children are doing in those? If we look at who is gaining five decent GCSEs in English, maths, science and modern languages, we see that the figures have fallen since 1997. Let us look at school leavers. In spite of the new deal, all the money and all the pre-Budget reports, the number of 16 to 18-year-olds who are not in employment, training or education has gone up by 40 per cent. since the right hon. Gentleman became Prime Minister. Why?</p>

<p><a name="st_o67"><a name="06120652000101"><a name="61206-0003.htm_spmin1"><a name="06120652000449"><b>The Prime Minister:</b> Because the proportion of children going through the system has risen at the same rate. It is not acceptable or right that any young person should leave school without going on to education or training, but that is the very reason why we have the new deal, which helps young people into a job&#151;and which the right hon. Gentleman opposes. That is the very reason why we want to increase investment&#151;but he has pledged to cut that investment. He talked about five good GCSEs, but whether we take that as five good GCSEs overall or including English and maths, again, the results are hugely up since 1997. We are very happy to debate education policy in this country. Yes, there is still a lot more to do, but it we look back over the last 10 years, results are up, investment is up, schools are getting better, and anyone who goes into any school in any constituency can see the changes and improvements. We are committed to increasing that investment still further&#151;but the right hon. Gentleman now has a fiscal rule that would chop that investment by sharing the proceeds with tax cuts. Let us not forget what the system was in 1997, how much improvement there has been in10 years, and what a disaster it would be if the Opposition ever got their hands on it again.</p>

Will he look again at the financial assistance scheme for people who lost their pensions before the fund was introduced, to see whether they can receive the same benefits?</p>

that we can put through the scheme. By pledging hundreds of millions of pounds to help people who have lost their pensions through no fault of their own, the Government have, for the first time in this country, provided at least some support, particularly for older people of working age who are approaching retirement, as they sometimes find that all the money that they have put in over 30 years of service is suddenly lost. I agree that it is important to keep the terms of the scheme under review, but my hon. Friend is right to say that for the first time people receive protection under the Government.</p>

Gentleman a comparison between this Government and the previous Government. <i> [</i><i> Interruption.</i><i> ]</i> I know that Tories do not want to hear this, but it is more relevant to compare rates of economic growth in this country. Under the Chancellor, we have the strongest economic growth of any comparable country. Interest rates are not 10 per cent., as they were when the hon. Gentleman&#146;s party was in power, but average half that figure. We have the lowest inflation and unemployment for decades. Once again, I should like to thank the Conservative party for pointing out our record.</p>

I think I am right in saying that there have been around 5 million extra visits to museums since we introduced the policy. Opposition Members may try to disparage it, but it has been a major change which has allowed low income families, particularly youngsters, to gain access to our museums. The fact that millions of people are visiting and using museums is a wonderful thing for our country, and we should be very proud of it.</p>

Given the huge impact that the increased use of biofuels could have on CO2 emissions, has the Prime Minister reflected on that presentation, and has he any proposals or ideas to increase their use?</p>

However, the presentation was excellent. In order to encourage biofuels, it is important that we continue, as the Chancellor has been doing over the past few years, to make sure that the system incentivises the use of clean energy. It is important that we recognise that biofuels, particularly engineered as the company suggests, give us the opportunity of reducing CO2 emissions considerably.</p>

Friend is right in describing the progress that has been made and the challenge that lies ahead. The remaining provisions of the Domestic Violence, Crime and Victims Act 2004 will be implemented in the middle of next year. We have invested an extra &#163;70 million to tackle domestic violence, and on the latest figures that we have, domestic homicides are down, the number of guilty pleas is up significantly, and convictions at court have quadrupled. One of the reasons why that is happening is that there is far greater co-operation across the agencies, and a far greater willingness in our court system and among the police to take domestic violence far more seriously.</p>

The families of those victims were told that the mastermind behind the bomb was a very senior Sinn Fein politician who was also an intelligence source for MI5. The historic inquiries team has now reopened the case. Will the Prime Minister first ascertain whether any intelligence exists as to the mastermind behind that bomb, and secondly, give the House the assurance that no intelligence will be held back to protect a senior politician or an intelligence source?</p>

About7 million adults in this country still have not attained the right literacy or numeracy grade, so it is important that we go further.

<p><a name="stpa_o5"><a name="61206-0003.htm_para1"><a name="06120652000136">The Treasury forecast is that growth&#151;sustained under this Government for a record 38 quarters&#151;will continue into its 39th and 40th quarters and beyond. Ten years ago, Britain was seventh out of seven in the G7, bottom of the G7 league for national income per head. In the last two years, Britain has been second only to the United States. In no other decade has Britain&#146;s personal wealth&#151;up 60 per cent. since 1997&#151;grown so fast. The pre-Budget report drives forward the great economic mission of our time&#151;to meet the global challenge and unleash the potential of all British people, so that the British economy out-performs our competitors and delivers security, prosperity and fairness to all.</p>

I can report that growth this year will surpass that figure and is expected to be 23/4 per cent., and will rise to between 23/4 and 31/4 per cent. next year. Business investment is up 53/4 per cent., exportsare up 6 per cent. and investment overall is up6 per cent. Despite contending with global imbalances, exchange rate uncertainties, stalled trade talks and high commodity prices, Britain&#146;s investment-led and export-led growth is forecast to continue in 2007, and investment and exports are forecast to rise by 5 per cent. or more.</p>

Productivity, which, in the last economic cycle up to 1997 grew by1.9 per cent., is averaging since 1997 2.4 per cent. From 1997 to&#151;and including&#151;this year, our productivity per worker has moved 3 per cent. ahead of Germany and11 per cent. ahead of Japan.

for Work and Pensions is today strengthening the new deal, with further measures to bring lone parents and the unemployed into jobs, but there is already a higher proportion of the working-age population in employment in Britain than in America, Japan, Germany, France or the whole euro area.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o9"><a name="61206-0004.htm_para0"><a name="06120652000142">I can report also that the number of people with tax-free savings accounts, ISAs, is now exceeding16 million, in contrast to just 9 million under the old system of TESSAs and PEPs, and I can confirm that the tax-free advantages of individual savings accounts will continue beyond 2010 and they will be made permanent.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o10"><a name="61206-0004.htm_para1"><a name="06120652000143">In line with independent forecasters, we have decided to maintain trend growth at 2.75 per cent. while basing our public finances, audited by the NAO as cautious and reasonable, on a rate of 2.5 per cent. As I will show when I give all the fiscal figures in detail, Britain will meet both its fiscal rules in this economic cycle and the next. So we build for the future from the fundamentals of a recession-free decade of stability and growth with low inflation, and this is the strongest foundation from which to address the great challenges ahead.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o11"><a name="61206-0004.htm_para2"><a name="06120652000144">Let me summarise: Asia is already out-producing Europe. China alone is manufacturing half the world&#146;s computers, half the worlds clothes, and more than half the world&#146;s digital electronics and, this Christmas, more than 75 per cent. of children&#146;s toys. But in the next10 years, the competitive challenge is even more profound. Once responsible for just one eighth of the world&#146;s growth, China and India will soon capture almost half. And increasingly they are competing not just on low cost, but on high skills. Every year, Britain adds 75,000 engineers and computer scientists, while India and China add half a million. Annually, Britain turns out a quarter of a million graduates; India and China 4 million. Economies like ours have no choice but to out-innovate and out-perform competitors by the excellence of our science and education, the quality of infrastructure and environment, the flexibility of our economy, and our levels of creativity and entrepreneurship.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o12"><a name="61206-0004.htm_para3"><a name="06120652000145">Just as in the last decade, by planning long term, we created a new and enduring British framework for long-term economic stability, the task is to think long term again for the coming decade and to create a new British framework for innovation and investment&#151;a British strategy to make the next stage of globalisation work for the British people.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o13"><a name="61206-0004.htm_para4"><a name="06120652000146">A shared finding of each review we have published in the past few days is that the investments that Britain must make can be achieved only in a new era of shared responsibility and of long-term partnerships between the public and private sectors. If the focus of our first decade was to replace or repair old hospitals, old schools and old housing&#151;that is the catch-up investment that we had to do&#151;the new priority is world-leading investments that will move Britain sustainably ahead of our competitors: the road and rail networks, the affordable housing, the advanced medicine and science and the schools and colleges of the future.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o14"><a name="61206-0004.htm_para5"><a name="06120652000147">We in Britain now have a long-term choice to make&#151;whether to commit to the essential investments that these reports recommend. First, I shall deal with science and innovation. Twenty-five years ago, the market value of our top companies was no more than the value of their physical assets. Today, the market  <br>

value of Britain&#146;s top companies is five times their physical assets, demonstrating the economic power of knowledge, ideas and innovation. The next challenge for Britain is to match strength in basic research with success all round in transforming knowledge into successful products and new jobs.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o15"><a name="61206-0004.htm_para6"><a name="06120652000148">So, having consulted on the way forward for university research in the UK, we are today detailing a new system for assessment and funding. As a first step, universities will have access to &#163;60 million a year directed to applied research with commercial potential. We are determined that Britain should be a world-class location for future medical research, including stem cells. To ensure that Britain leads the world in developing new treatments and drugs, we will bring together the research capability of our universities, institutes and pharmaceutical companies with the unique resources of the research facilities of the NHS. I can confirm that, with a pooled budget of over&#163;1 billion a year and a new fast-track procedure for priority research, the president of the Academy of Medical Sciences, Professor John Bell, will lead this new drive to identify for Britain the most useful and fruitful areas for potential medical breakthroughs.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o16"><a name="61206-0004.htm_para7"><a name="06120652000149">British science can also do more to eradicate poverty and disease around the world, so today the International Development Secretary is establishing a new partnership with the research councils and charities, including the Wellcome Trust and the Gates Foundation, so that we can maximise the contribution of British inventors, scientists and researchers to the urgent global task of attacking poverty.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o17"><a name="61206-0004.htm_para8"><a name="06120652000150">Because the future success of our creative and knowledge-based industries also depends on Britain having a robust intellectual property regime, the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry is announcing today that he will tighten the penalties for copying and piracy while giving individuals new rights for personal use, and he will introduce a new fast-track protection for small companies to safeguard their trademarks.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o18"><a name="61206-0004.htm_para9"><a name="06120652000151">Since 1997, the number of films made in Britain has increased by 50 per cent. To encourage an even more vibrant British film industry, I am confirming that 1 January will be the date to introduce new film tax reliefs. I am also addressing avoidance and the rules governing managed service companies.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o19"><a name="61206-0004.htm_para10"><a name="06120652000152">The best way to make globalisation work for the British people is to combine open markets, free trade and flexibility with investment in people and fairness to people. The minimum wage is now &#163;5.35 per hour, but to be effective we must ensure that British workers and good British companies are not undercut by illegal rates. In January, we will raise the penalties for persistent illegality, and to raise the standards of enforcement I am announcing a 50 per cent. increase to &#163;9 million in the budget to monitor and police the minimum wage.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o20"><a name="61206-0004.htm_para11"><a name="06120652000153">In the past 10 years, over 1 million more adults have gained literacy and numeracy qualifications, and the British work force now has 3 million more men and women with skills. The Leitch report says that instead of today&#146;s 6 million unskilled workers, the 2020 economy will need only half a million unskilled workers. Instead of 9 million high-skilled workers and graduates today, we will need 14 million.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o21"><a name="61206-0004.htm_para12"><a name="06120652000154">I want British workers to gain the skills for those higher-paid jobs of the future. Our aim is that by 2020: 90 per cent of adults reach at least the equivalent of5 GCSEs, achieving in just over one decade what no other country has managed until now; that by reforming underperforming colleges we will double from 2 million to 4 million the number of adults achieving A-level equivalent skills; and that we ensure that our economy has 5 million more men and women with high-level professional and graduate skills.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o22"><a name="61206-0004.htm_para13"><a name="06120652000155">Our objectives cannot be achieved either by Government alone or by business alone. So the review assesses that, after 2010, a new statutory entitlement to skills training may be required. But there is an urgent need to make progress now and by consensus, so the Secretary of State for Education and Skills is today appointing the former director general of the CBI,Sir Digby Jones, to advance an agenda of employees taking more responsibility to train; employers taking more responsibility to offer time off, with, in return, more say over what training is provided; and the Government taking more responsibility to reform and invest in training provision at work, in colleges and online.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o23"><a name="61206-0004.htm_para14"><a name="06120652000156">To meet the skills needs of the future, we must also encourage young people, who too often lose out, to stay on and study for qualifications and go to university and college. Around education maintenance allowances, we are introducing an earn-to-learn programme for people to gain graduate qualifications while still working part-time; new summer school universities; work experience and coaching to motivate young people to stay on in education after 16; and an extension of the support to 16 and 17-year-olds who are not in education or employment, to help them into training and then into work. We will consult on &#163;2,000 bursaries for looked-after children to encourage them to go to university. We will also consult on a new path for entry to university, in which students volunteer in return for a reduction in tuition fees.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o24"><a name="61206-0004.htm_para15"><a name="06120652000157">To ensure that every child and young person has the best start in life&#151;<i> [Interruption.] </i>I thought that there was common cause on this. We must address the causes and roots of child poverty. In April, child benefits paid to the poorest child, which were only &#163;28 a week in 1997, will rise to &#163;64 a week. These tax credits are the main vehicle that has ensured that, since 1997, 2 million children have been taken out of absolute poverty and almost 1 million children out of relative poverty. Now that the healthy start scheme offers half a million pregnant mothers and families with young children up to &#163;5.60 a week extra for nutrition, it is time to do more.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o25"><a name="61206-0004.htm_para16"><a name="06120652000158">I have received powerful representations that in the last months of pregnancy, when nutrition is most important, and in the first weeks after birth, the extra costs borne by parents could be better recognised if we did more to help through the universal benefit&#151;child benefit&#151;which is paid to all. Maternity grants are available to low-income mothers from the 29th week of pregnancy. Help should be available to all mothers expecting a child, so child benefit will be paid on that basis to every mother&#151;additional child benefit that now recognises the important role, at this critical moment, that child benefit can play.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o26"><a name="61206-0004.htm_para17"><a name="06120652000159">We are also publishing today the interim report of the third-sector review and an action plan for third-sector involvement in public services. We propose more stability in funding for the third sector, the voluntary community and charitable organisations upon which so many communities depend, particularly small local organisations. I can announce that in the spending review the norm will not be one-year funding for third-sector organisations, but offering them three-year funding.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o27"><a name="61206-0004.htm_para18"><a name="06120652000160">Community ownership of assets can provide local communities with a financial and social stake in their own areas, so we are also announcing a &#163;30 million fund to encourage local authorities and the third sector to work together to expand community ownership of community assets. Reviews on children and disability, issues of social care and local regeneration will report next year. With 100,000 Olympic volunteers already, my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport and my hon. Friend the Parliamentary Secretary, Cabinet Office&#151;the Minister responsible for the third sector&#151;will now consult on the next stage: how young people can do more to volunteer in the run-up to the 2012 Olympics.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o28"><a name="61206-0004.htm_para19"><a name="06120652000161">The same partnership of responsible individuals, companies and Governments is vital to meeting the environmental challenge. I have said that we should use market mechanisms and incentives to work towards global carbon trading. Since the Stern review, I can report that 31 countries in the European Union and the European Free Trade Association have now signed up to emissions trading as a first step towards that global framework, and we are bringing together the major financial institutions because our aim is to make London the world&#146;s leading centre for carbon trading.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o29"><a name="61206-0004.htm_para20"><a name="06120652000162">On the development of biofuels, Britain has now signed a partnership agreement with Brazil, Mozambique and South Africa. On the preservation of rain forests, we are working with Latin American and Asian countries. On clean coal, we are working with China and India. Today, Norway and Britain are together launching the first feasibility study for a new infrastructure for carbon capture and storage under the North sea. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry will be appointing engineers ahead of a decision to be made next year on the first carbon capture demonstration plan for the United Kingdom.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o30"><a name="61206-0004.htm_para21"><a name="06120652000163">It is time, also, to set a long-term framework for curbing the carbon emissions from houses, which constitute 30 per cent. of all emissions. Next week my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government and my hon. Friend the Minister for Housing and Planning will set out plans to ensure that within 10 years every new home will be a zero-carbon home, and we will be the first country ever to make that commitment. To accelerate the building of zero-carbon homes, for a time-limited period the vast majority of new zero-carbon homes will be exempted from stamp duty. For existing homes, I will consult on a new facility to undertake energy audits and offer low loans that would in time, because of low energy bills, pay for themselves.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o31"><a name="61206-0004.htm_para22"><a name="06120652000164">Through greater energy efficiency, our aim is to reduce emissions and to eliminate fuel poverty. In addition to the basic pension rising from next April by 3.6 per cent. and the winter allowance of &#163;200&#151;&#163;300 for the over-80s&#151;the pension credit minimum guarantee will rise by &#163;5 a week for a single person and &#163;7.65 a week for couples. With grants of &#163;300 to &#163;4,000&#151;through the Warm Front programme, which I extended last year&#151;we are providing not only insulation, but free central heating for low-income pensioners and extra support towards central heating in all other pensioner households. By the end of 2008, we will have insulated an additional2.7 million homes, but in the coming year we will extend Warm Front and, community by community, we will make it possible for 300,000 pensioner and other households, the ones most vulnerable to fuel poverty, to have free insulation and free central heating.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o32"><a name="61206-0004.htm_para23"><a name="06120652000165">I turn to the framework for transport, which is responsible for 30 per cent. of all carbon emissions, the aviation sector accounting for a fifth of those. Currently, aircraft emissions are not part of the EU emissions trading scheme, and nor is aviation fuel taxed. While we continue to work internationally to seek a global agreement on reducing aircraft emissions, each country must take action domestically. From1 February, we will double air passenger duty. For most journeys&#151;over 75 per cent. of them&#151;duty will rise from &#163;5 to &#163;10, securing extra resources in the coming spending round for our priorities, such as public transport and the environment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o33"><a name="61206-0004.htm_para24"><a name="06120652000166">A priority for vehicles&#151;responsible for 25 per cent. of emissions&#151;is to promote cleaner fuels through fiscal incentives. Today, I am extending the 20p per litre discount to include the next generation of biodiesel, and we will offer that discount to all new innovative fuels as they develop. I am also consulting, prior to a Budget decision, on extending the current 40p per litre duty discount for biogas and on the level of tax discounts for company cars that use high-blend biofuels. I am relieving small biofuel producers of requirements to register or submit returns. While I will go ahead with an inflation rise in fuel duty from midnight tonight of 1.25p per litre, I will not restore the fuel duty escalator and I have rejected a real terms increase in fuel duty. I can also announce that, to incentivise the use of cleaner fuels in trains in the same way as we do for cars, the tax rate for piloting rebated fuels mixed with biofuels will be reduced from 53p to 8p. For greater energy efficiency in public procurement, we are publishing new guidelines to ensure that the &#163;125 billion we invest each year is spent both well and in a sustainable way, and as a first step we will pilot school designs that achieve a level of excellence in carbon reduction.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o34"><a name="61206-0004.htm_para25"><a name="06120652000167">Tackling climate change is an opportunity for Britain to create thousands of new jobs. Our new institute to investigate new environmental technologies will start with a budget of &#163;550 million, and I can also confirm that there will be a second enterprise capital fund focused on innovative green technologies. The theme of both the Eddington review on transport and the Barker review on planning is that we must systematically modernise and improve Britain&#146;s road, rail, housing and civic infrastructure, which was run down in the &#146;70s, &#146;80s and early &#146;90s. We must invest in a sustainable infrastructure that will contribute to the future prosperity of the country.</p>

We will now consult on the proposal that in future, while Ministers will set policy guidelines, strategic decisions on location and planning permission for major infrastructure projects will be made outside of day-to-day political control and instead by an independent planning body.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o36"><a name="61206-0004.htm_para27"><a name="06120652000169">As we move forward our risk-based approach to local and national regulation, we are setting new incentives that will cut the numbers of local authority inspections.

<p><a name="stpa_o38"><a name="61206-0004.htm_para29"><a name="06120652000171">Properly equipping ourselves for the economic and social challenges ahead requires a long-term commitment of new investment supporting reform and modernisation. Our capacity to finance that modernisation depends on the strength of our fiscal position, on our ability to release resources for priorities, and on the choices we as a country are prepared to make. On the fiscal position, I am today publishing a document on Britain&#146;s long-term public finances. Its detail shows that even after taking into account our new commitments on pensions, the country&#146;s public finances are on a sound and sustainable basis for the long term, and they are stronger than other countries.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o39"><a name="61206-0004.htm_para30"><a name="06120652000172">Before I give this year&#146;s fiscal figures, I can confirm that to fund operations in Afghanistan, Iraq and other international obligations, the Secretary of State for Defence has been allocated an additional &#163;600 million, and I want to pay tribute to our armed forces and security services for their contribution to the country. I can also announce an additional &#163;84 million directed to intelligence and counter-terrorism. Our budget for security, which was just &#163;1 billion in 2001, will now be more than &#163;2 billion for 2007-08.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o40"><a name="61206-0004.htm_para31"><a name="06120652000173">Our two fiscal rules for the economic cycle are the golden rule that current spending is paid for by tax revenues, and the sustainable investment rule that with debt at a prudent level we can invest in education, the NHS, infrastructure and other essential priorities. Those rules are demanding, and no other major economy&#151;neither America, nor Japan, nor the euro area&#151;currently meets them. However, I can report that, even after the new commitments I am announcing in this report, our current deficit falls from &#163;15 billion to &#163;8 billion and then to &#163;1 billion, and then we record a surplus in successive years to 2011 of &#163;4 billion,&#163;7 billion, &#163;10 billion and &#163;14 billion.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o41"><a name="61206-0004.htm_para32"><a name="06120652000174">Therefore, with an overall surplus in this economic cycle of &#163;8 billion, we meet the golden rule and are already on course to meet it in the next cycle.

the rule was missed by a margin of &#163;140 billion, and in the cycle of 1986-97 they missed it by &#163;240 billion. The strength of our fiscal position is that over the economic cycle, and for the first time for four decades no borrowing is necessary to cover current spending.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o42"><a name="61206-0004.htm_para33"><a name="06120652000175">I now turn to our second rule, the sustainable investment rule. It is a rule that has been especially challenging for Britain because we have had to catch up after decades of underinvestment in our infrastructure. However, even after doubling capital investment in education, transport and the NHS, we meet our second rule. Debt is 47 per cent. of national income in America; it is 55 per cent. in the euro area; it is 65 per cent. in the European Union as a whole; and it is 90 per cent. in Japan&#151;but it is 37.5 per cent. in the UK. Net debt levels will in future years be 38.2 per cent. and38.6 per cent., and then 38.7 per cent. and 38.5 per cent. Total net borrowing, which under the last Government went as high as 7.8 per cent of gross domestic product&#151;the equivalent today of &#163;100 billion of borrowing&#151;will fall from &#163;37 billion this year to &#163;31 billion, &#163;27 billion, and then in successive years to &#163;26 billion, &#163;24 billion and &#163;22 billion. So borrowing will fall from 2.3 per cent. of national income next year to 1.3 per cent. by 2011. With overall deficits and debt lower than those of our competitors and lower than in recent decades, Britain is meeting both of our fiscal rules in this cycle and the next. Within that strong and sustainable fiscal position, we are well placed to make decisions and to meet our long-term priorities for public services and for investment.</p>

Already, share sales&#151; including Westinghouse and other assets&#151;will raise this year and next an additional &#163;7 billion, and over the spending review periods we will raise a further &#163;30 billion from sales of land and buildings.</p>

I can also confirm real term reductions of 5 per cent. a year in the budgets of Her Majesty&#146;s Revenue and Customs, the Department for Workand Pensions, the Cabinet Office and the Treasury,and of 31/2 per cent. a year in the Department for Constitutional Affairs. I can announce that for the years to 2011 I have reached agreement with Secretaries of State for net efficiency savings in their overall budgets of 3 per cent. a year and for cuts in their administration budgets of 5 per cent. a year. Taken together with other measures, that releases an additional &#163;26 billion by 2011 for our priorities such as education, the NHS, policing and security.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o46"><a name="61206-0005.htm_para1"><a name="06120652000179">One choice for Britain would be to adopt a balanced budget policy, but to achieve that by cutting back on essential investment in schools and infrastructure would in my view weaken us for the global challenges ahead. I have also considered representations for a third fiscal rule, but that would require us to cut spending by&#163;28 billion this year alone. That is a choice for Britain that I reject, because&#151;[Hon. Members: &#147;Hear, hear.&#148;] It would deny us investment in education, health, infrastructure and vital priorities, and leave Britain ill-prepared and ill-equipped for the future.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o47"><a name="61206-0005.htm_para2"><a name="06120652000180">Instead, I can confirm that capital investment in education, which was only &#163;1.5 billion in 1997, will be &#163;8.3 billion next year, and we will set out long-term plans for investment to rise even further. I can also confirm that investment in transport, just &#163;4 billion in 1997, will be &#163;9.6 billion next year, and in the spending review we will set out an updated 10-year spending plan. Investment in housing, just &#163;2 billion in 1997,will be nearly &#163;8 billion next year, with sustained investment through into the next spending round.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o48"><a name="61206-0005.htm_para3"><a name="06120652000181">I can also announce that the spending review for the years to 2011 will be based on planned capital investment in our country in infrastructure, education and vital priorities, rising from &#163;39 billion last year to &#163;60 billion in 2011. Let me give details of the investment that we will make over the five years ahead: next year,&#163;48 billion, rising in 2008 to &#163;51 billion, then to&#163;54 billion, then to &#163;57 billion and then to &#163;60 billion, showing our commitment to modern roads and rail, to modern schools and science, and to new housing, hospitals and the renewal of communities. That is a change from the age of disinvestment under the previous Government.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o49"><a name="61206-0005.htm_para4"><a name="06120652000182">The single most important investment that we can make is in education, and today I can start implementing the recommendations that have been put to us on skills. In 1997, there were 80,000 apprentices; today, in England alone there are 250,000, half of whom are now in manufacturing, construction and technology. I can announce that in the years to 2020, the number of apprenticeships will rise to 500,000. I can also announce that under the &#147;Train to Gain&#148; programme, we will increase the number of adults learning basic workplace skills from 100,000 this year to 350,000 a year by 2011, giving adults, as well as young people, the opportunity to better themselves.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o50"><a name="61206-0005.htm_para5"><a name="06120652000183">It is even more important that the next generation do not lose out or fall behind on the basic skills that they will need to succeed in the global economy. So the Secretary of State for Education and Skills is also announcing today that the &#147;Every Child a Reader&#148; programme, which already has the best results in literacy, will be extended nationwide year by year. All boys and girls who are already, at the age of six, falling behind in reading will be offered special catch-up tuition. In secondary schools, where the learning gap between boys and girls is greatest, there will be new funds for extra support for mentoring, small group tutoring and personalised learning.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o51"><a name="61206-0005.htm_para6"><a name="06120652000184">Since 2001, all children at the ages of one, two and three have received books to encourage them to read. I can announce today that all children starting primary school at five, and as they move to secondary school at 11, will receive books free of charge. In total, 3 million books will go direct to children to lift the reading standards of young people in our country.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o52"><a name="61206-0005.htm_para7"><a name="06120652000185">I have also become convinced that, for Britain to rise to the global challenge, we should commit now to year-by-year improvements in investments in schools and educational establishments. It is right that we now make a spending settlement right through to 2011 that covers all capital investment in education. Separate announcements will be made for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. To ensure that all 21,000 schools and educational institutions are fit for 21st-century challenges, I can announce that educational investment in our schools, colleges and university buildings and facilities, which stood at just &#163;1.5 billion in 1997, will by 2010 be &#163;10.2 billion for education alone. The investments in education that we will make are&#163;8.3 billion next year, &#163;8.6 billion in 2008, and&#163;9 billion in 2009, rising to &#163;10 billion in 2010. In the next four years, that is a cumulative investment in education alone of &#163;36 billion, matching by 2010 state school capital investment per pupil to private schools, as year by year we close the gap.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o53"><a name="61206-0005.htm_para8"><a name="06120652000186">Our goal is 12,000 new or completely refurbished schools&#151;half of all primary schools and 90 per cent. of all secondary schools&#151;benefiting 4 million children a year; in addition, 100 colleges rebuilt, serving 1 million students; and in total, 3,500 new children&#146;s centres, built for nearly 3 million boys and girls in every constituency of the country. Every one of our constituencies is benefiting from the biggest programme of educational investment ever, in support of our decision to prepare for the global economy as the most educated nation in the world.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o54"><a name="61206-0005.htm_para9"><a name="06120652000187">For next year, I can go beyond the announcement that I made in the Budget on spending per pupil. In striking the right balance between tax, spending and borrowing, I am able to meet both our fiscal rules and to release additional resources for the coming year. I propose to increase the cash that we give to every school and every head teacher, to be used in the way that local schools think best. The typical primary school received &#163;39,000 this year in direct payments. For April next year, I propose that that be &#163;50,000 for every primary school. The typical secondary school received &#163;150,000. For April next year, I propose that it be &#163;200,000. That is the equivalent of &#163;200 for every pupil, paid three months from now direct to the school&#151;money I could use for tax cuts, but I say, invest in education first; money that could not be invested if we had a third fiscal rule.</p>

that is not what we got today. With this PBR, like the nine PBRs before it, Britain is moving further away from the direction in which we need to go. The Chancellor talked about growth. What he did not tell us is that the growth that he announced puts Britain 21st out of the 25 members of the European Union. <i> [Interruption.]</i> He denied it today and he shakes his head, but it is confirmed by the European Commission. <i> [Interruption.]</i> Will he also confirm what is buried on page&#151;</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o57"><a name="61206-0005.htm_para12"><a name="06120652000193">The Chancellor talked about sound public finances, but he downgraded his borrowing forecast again. Will he confirm that that means that Britain is set to have the largest structural deficit of any major European economy next year&#151;as he himself might once have put it, larger than Germany, larger than France, larger than Spain and larger even than Italy? Will he confirm that he has just revised upwards his net debt figures for this year? By 2010, they will be &#163;4 billion higher. He did not mention that in his statement, but will he confirm that when he replies?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o58"><a name="61206-0005.htm_para13"><a name="06120652000194">How on earth could the Chancellor have given a report on the state of the economy without mentioning that Britain has just recorded the largest rise in unemployment in the developed world? He is so obsessed about securing his next job that he has forgotten about the 300,000 people who have lost their jobs.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o59"><a name="61206-0005.htm_para14"><a name="06120652000195">How could the Chancellor possibly have the nerve to speak for 40 minutes without addressing the crisis in the NHS? He had no new answers today. He promised a change of gear, but as usual all we got was more of the same. His speech was full of rhetoric about the long term, but he did not address the central, long-term economic question that we face: why, according to every international measure and league table, is Britain becoming less competitive?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o60"><a name="61206-0005.htm_para15"><a name="06120652000196">Does the right hon. Gentleman remember saying when he first became Chancellor that the first challenge was to increase our productivity? It remains the first challenge today. Productivity was 2.6 per cent. when he entered the Treasury, and is just 1.5 per cent. ashe leaves. Measured against what he calls his &#147;fundamental yardstick&#148;, has he not fundamentally failed?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o61"><a name="61206-0005.htm_para16"><a name="06120652000197">What is the Chancellor&#146;s answer? Like every central planner in history, he hides behind a relentless production of reports. There have been 70 in total, and never have so many poor trees died in vain. However, a glimpse of the truth can sometimes slip past the Treasury censors. Sir Rod Eddington jetted in from Australia to tell us what we already knew&#151;that the UK transport network is stretched beyond capacity. The Leitch report says that the Chancellor&#146;s skills policies have led to &#147;complexity, duplication and bureaucracy&#148;, and that it is no wonder that the UK has</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o62"><a name="61206-0005.htm_para17"><a name="06120652000198">Today, the Chancellor promised action for 16-year-olds, yet one 16-year-old in six cannot read, write or add up properly. They are the very children who have been educated almost entirely under a Labour Government, and they have already been failed by the Chancellor.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o63"><a name="61206-0005.htm_para18"><a name="06120652000199">The Chancellor&#146;s second challenge today was to sort out the public finances. We all know that he is a man in a hurry, but he read out his borrowing figures so quickly that people might have missed them, so I shall read them out again. Over the next six years, theright hon. Gentleman says that borrowing will be&#163;37 billion, &#163;31 billion, &#163;27 billion, &#163;26 billion,&#163;24 billion and &#163;22 billion. That is higher in every year than he forecast in the Budget last spring. By the way, the current Budget deficit has increased this year. Not only that, he said in the spring that we would be in surplus next year, yet today he confirmed that we will again be in deficit.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o64"><a name="61206-0005.htm_para19"><a name="06120652000200">All that borrowing comes despite the biggest tax increase in our peacetime history. Let us be absolutely clear that that means that each family will pay &#163;9,000 extra tax each year. In a world where our competitors are simplifying and reducing business taxes, the UK is almost alone in increasing ours. Where is the long-term sense in that? Where is the sense in landing us with the most complicated tax code in the developed world?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o65"><a name="61206-0005.htm_para20"><a name="06120652000201">The Chancellor often responds by citing last year&#146;s inward investment figures. That is a typical example of the systematic distortion of statistics that we have come to expect from him, as more than half of our annual inward investment&#151;&#163;50 billion&#151;comes from one company, Shell, which features in the figures only because it moved its headquarters from Britain to Holland. Does not that say everything that we need to know about this Chancellor&#146;s spin?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o66"><a name="61206-0005.htm_para21"><a name="06120652000202">The third great challenge that we face is climate change. People say that the Chancellor has become green only recently, but that is most unfair. He has been green ever since that meal at Granita. The Prime Minister remembers that and, although he does not live in Islington any more, it says something about the state of the Labour party that the restaurant is now called Desperados.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o67"><a name="61206-0005.htm_para22"><a name="06120652000203">This week, Friends of the Earth said that the Chancellors&#146; record on climate change had been &#147;woefully inadequate&#148;. Will he confirm that carbon emissions are higher than when he took office and that the share of taxes collected by green taxes has fallen? Today&#146;s increase in air passenger duty should have replaced other taxes and not added to them. It proves that the right hon. Gentleman is more interested in raising taxes than in cutting pollution.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o68"><a name="61206-0005.htm_para23"><a name="06120652000204">The fourth challenge is to spend public money wisely. The Chancellor once pledged to rise to that challenge. Does he remember saying when he was shadow Chancellor that he wanted to be remembered as a wise spender, not a big spender? His political obituary will say many things, but not that: he has spent &#163;4,000 billion, and now he pledges more spending on education&#151;[Hon. Members: &#147;Hear, hear.&#148;] The lemmings on the Labour Benches do not know that that was the third time that he has reannounced his extra capital spending on schools. When he first made the promise in the Budget, the Institute of Fiscal Studies dismissed it as a &#147;highly  <br>

misleading presentational device&#148;&#151;economist speak for &#147;spin&#148;. Will the Chancellor confirm, after all the rhetoric, that the rate of capital spending growth is set to fall?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o69"><a name="61206-0005.htm_para24"><a name="06120652000205">The Chancellor&#146;s greatest mistake is that he has spent without reform. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development has said that, despite the extra money, NHS mortality rates are declining no faster than before. By the way, the extra &#163;1 million for medical research was first announced last year. The Select Committee on Education and Skills says that school standards are not improving as fast as they were. People up and down the country who are struggling to find a decent school place or campaigning to keep their local hospital open or sitting in traffic on congested roads are entitled to ask: where has all the money gone?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o70"><a name="61206-0005.htm_para25"><a name="06120652000206">The Chancellor is trying to persuade the public that he is the change that they are crying out for. He lets it be known with nods and winks that he will end the spin and eye-catching initiatives of the Blair years, but let there be no mistake: they were his years too; the Blair-Brown years were the years of the clunking fist. The hospital cuts are the Chancellor&#146;s cuts, the failing schools are his failures, and the pensions that were destroyed were destroyed by him. The truth is that Labour can be new only once. If the public want change, they will have to vote for it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o71"><a name="61206-0005.htm_para26"><a name="06120652000207">Let us see whether the Chancellor can really break with his past and be different from the Prime Minister. I have four straight questions, to which I hope he will give four straight answers. First, will the Chancellor confirm what the European Commission has said&#151;that this year Britain has grown more slowly than 21 of the 25 EU member states? Secondly, will he acknowledge that in the past year our country has recorded the largest rise in unemployment in the developed world? Thirdly, does he accept that Britain is set to have the largest structural deficit of any major European economy? Fourthly, will he admit that, in an age of prosperity, real living standards in Britain are now falling?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o72"><a name="61206-0005.htm_para27"><a name="06120652000208">Those are four simple questions, so let us see whether the Chancellor can give us four straight answers. Let us see whether the clunking fist can change.</p>

Why does he not say to his Back Benchers the same things that he says when he goes to the City? There, he talks of Labour&#146;s &#147;macroeconomic success&#148; and &#147;economic credibility&#148;. He speaks of Labour&#146;s &#147;ability to manage&#148; the economy, and says that Labour is the &#147;party of economic competence&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o73"><a name="61206-0005.htm_para28"><a name="06120652000210">I remind the shadow Chancellor that there were3 million unemployed under the Conservative Government. Unemployment is below 1 million under Labour and&#151;as he wants international comparisons&#151;that is half that in France, half that in Germany, and below the EU average. He said that Britain&#146;s economic growth is down. In fact, growth here is higher than in the euro area, so how can he say that it is lower than in Europe?</p>

I have just explained to him that we are meeting our fiscal rules. He says that productivity is lower. Productivity has risen, on average, by 2.4 per cent., compared to 1.9 per cent. under the Conservatives.

Today, he promises that he wants to cut taxes. Then he says that borrowing is too high so he wants to cut borrowing. When will he wake up to the fact that to cut taxes, raise spending, cut borrowing and have a fiscal rule that requires him to cut spending of &#163;28 billion is exactly the position that the right hon. Member for Witney (Mr. Cameron) was in when he was economic adviser to Lord Lamont? That is exactly what led to the tragedy of 1992 when we ended up with 22 tax rises, &#163;100 billion of borrowing, 15 per cent. interest rates, mortgage repossessions and negative equity. We will never return to that.</p>

I am glad that the Chancellor has listened to at least some ofthe advice from the Liberal Democrats about environmental taxation. He has not listened to all of it, because revenue will not be returned in tax cuts for the lower paid, but at least there is something.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o77"><a name="61206-0005.htm_para32"><a name="06120652000215">The Chancellor may not have noticed that the Stern commission report recommended that tough preventive action was needed, amounting to something of the order of 1 per cent. of gross domestic product. The tax changes he announced today amount to about one tenth of 1 per cent. of GDP. Where will the other nine tenths come from? The Chancellor&#146;s environmental credentials are not helped by publishing in parallel the Barker report, which is really a property developers&#146; charter, and the Eddington report, which makes an unashamed plea for the expansion of airports.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o78"><a name="61206-0005.htm_para33"><a name="06120652000216">As the Member who introduced the most recent piece of legislation outlawing copyright theft, I welcome the Chancellor&#146;s recognition of the creative industries. That is a major step forward. He is also right to put such emphasis on the long-term challenges from international competition and on creating a knowledge-based economy. However, one question troubles many of us. After all the billions that have been spent on science and on education, why has the number of British young people studying at A-level and equivalent the core disciplines of maths, science and modern languages&#151;the foundations of a globalising economy&#151;fallen since 1997 in both relative and absolute terms? Why are the fundamentals not being got right?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o79"><a name="61206-0005.htm_para34"><a name="06120652000217">I turn to the basic theme of the Chancellor&#146;s statement. Of course, he has earned much credibility over the years from the fact that the British economy is stable and performing well. He would have earned more credibility today if he had acknowledged some of the problems that his successor will inherit.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o80"><a name="61206-0006.htm_para0"><a name="06120652000218">I start with personal debt. Two million people are in extreme debt. According to the Bank of England, one in six people has severe debt problems. The number of mortgage possession orders going through the courts is now 100,000 a year. The level of debt service in relation to income is close to the rate when the last Tory boom burst. My question is simple: who is responsible? Is it the responsibility of borrowers? Is it the responsibility of lenders? Has the Bank of England not done enough? Is it adequate for the Chancellor to be a passive spectator or does he have a role in these matters?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o81"><a name="61206-0006.htm_para1"><a name="06120652000219">The Budget numbers are impressive on the surface. The Chancellor has produced some impressive numbers for Gershon savings, but why should we believe them? Until he accepts that his numbers have to be fully independently audited&#151;both the assumptions and the outcomes&#151;he will be treated as the clever schoolboy who always gets 10 out of 10 in his tests because he marks them himself. Why does he not take advantage of his good initiative in partially increasing the independence of the statistical service to establish a fully independent system of fiscal policy monitoring?</p>

He has taken on board some big, expensive, open-ended public sector spending commitments: the continuing Iraq war; big defence procurement contracts, such as Eurofighter and Trident; new nuclear power; Ken Livingstone&#146;s Olympics; and ID cards. In that constrained environment, how can he guarantee that key public sector spending commitments, such as pensions, policing and hospitals, will be sustained?</p>

I am sure that the Chancellor will always want to be remembered not just for economic prudence but for a progressive record in advancing social justice, so can he answer the following simple question? After 10 years of Labour Government, why is income inequality as bad as when the Conservatives left power and why is wealth inequality&#151;in assets&#151;actually worse than it was then?</p>

Of course, individuals have difficult problems that need to be dealt with; we need proper protection and advice for those people, but the hon. Gentleman must not compare a situation in the 1990s, when interest rates were 15 per cent. and people faced mortgage repossessions, with the situation now when interest rates are 5 per cent. <i> [Interruption.]</i> Interest rates were above 10 per cent. for four years. I do not think that the Conservatives should keep raising that issue in case I read out the mortgage rates that people had to pay in the early 1990s. The hon.

Of the Gershon numbers, 45,000 jobs in the civil service have gone, so it is not a question of something that is about to happen&#151;it is happening now. It is part of our desire to drive forward efficiency and get resources to the front line, which I believe we are succeeding in doing.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o85"><a name="61206-0006.htm_para5"><a name="06120652000224">The hon. Gentleman asked about poverty and inequality. Of course, in this global economy, they are huge issues, some of which a national Government can affect, but some of which&#151;these days&#151;a national Government cannot affect. I think he will agree, however, that to have taken 2 million children out of absolute poverty and 1 million children out of relative poverty is a major achievement, given that child poverty trebled in the years of the Conservative Government to more than 4 million. As I announced today, we will continue with additional measures to take people out of poverty.</p>

Gentleman now says that he wants to cut borrowing&#151;<i> [Interruption.]</i> Behind him, someone is saying that he has a fiscal rule equivalent to that of the Conservatives. The only difference between the hon. Gentleman and the Conservatives is that he has at least admitted that he has to raise &#163;20 billion from environmental taxes. He has at least put the figure out in the public arena, although I have to tell him that he would have to raise the price of petrol by 18p a litre and I do not think that the Liberals would be elected in any constituency on that platform.</p>

However, behind the pre-Budget report is the issue of globalisation, which is indeed daunting. Given that current trends up to 2020 indicate that 6 million people will still be lacking everyday numeracy skills and 4 million will be lacking everyday literacy skills, is it not the case that initiatives are required in the employment sector? We have seen it in the USA and it is starting to happen here that unskilled workers&#146; incomes are falling behind. Will the Chancellor work with employers and trade unions to ensure that we do not end up with a two-tier work force in future&#151;some with rising wages and prosperity and the unskilled on stagnant wages living in comparative poverty?</p>

We have a stark choice. We have to ensure that people today who do not have the skills, get them for the future. I would have thought that there would be all-party consensus on what to do to achieve that. Britain is in a race with other countries to ensure that we can successfully work globalisation to our advantage.</p>

Member for Twickenham (Dr. Cable) has already referred. If the Chancellor&#146;s successor believes the extravagantly optimistic descriptions of the public finances that the right hon.

Does the Chancellor accept that his fiscal rules are now lost in a maze of creative accounting and absurd assumptions about the date of the cycle? Even in his pre-Budget reports, every year he has to raise more tax from soft political targets, such as the oil industry last year or transport through green taxes this year. Does he accept that his legacy to his successor will be the toughest public spending round that we have seen for a very long time, in which his successor will have to keep public spending below the growth of the economy as a whole for the foreseeable future?

Only yesterday, I visited a college where men and women who had previously thought that they would never get a skill were encouraged to come into college to acquire it.

The European Council offers a chance for EU leaders to send a strong signal that our strategic commitment to enlargement remains. The EU has been asked, not least by Dutch and French voters, but by others, too, to show that it has brought concrete, tangible benefit to its citizens. Enlargement is the single process that has done most to improve the lives of the people of Europe as a whole. In making that claim, I am referring in part to the startling transformation that EU membership has wrought in the lives of people in new member states.

Each successive wave of enlargement has provided new jobs, new markets and new opportunities for investment. The 2004 enlargement added 74 million consumers, making the EU the world&#146;s largest single market, and the economies and workers of the new member states have boosted growth across Europe.</p>

Romania and Bulgaria still have some way to go in strengthening the rule of law and in tackling corruption and organised crime. Indeed, the process of enlarging the EU to include those two countries, as well as the 10 new member states that joined in 2004, has led to a refinement and tightening-up of procedures. The requirements to join the EU are more rigorous and more carefully monitored than ever before, and they apply to Turkey and Croatia. Effective conditionality is  <br>

one thing, but fresh conditions are something altogether different. Having agreed membership requirements and invited people down that path, it would be quite wrong to put up new hurdles or to deliberately construct barriers designed to halt this or any further enlargement.

Croatia is showing the way for others in the region by making the necessary reforms. It has low inflation, a stable currency, and rapid economic growth. It has bright, hard-working young people and strong scientific credentials. It has taken on international responsibilities by, for example, sending peacekeepers to Afghanistan and working with British police, among, others, to fight drug smuggling and money laundering. To see how far Croatia has come, it is worth noting that although it is little more than a decade since a massive war, every year more than 250,000 British tourists choose to go there on holiday. Of course there are more conditions that Croatia must meet, particularly in reform of the judiciary and the fight against corruption, but it is on the right path, and it is on that path because of the prospect of enlargement.</p>

problem with Turkey joining, yet the strategic case for Turkish membership is at least as compelling as it is for any other country&#151;in fact, probably much more so. Just like any other country, Turkey must fulfil its obligations to the EU. In the case of the Ankara protocol, Turkey has not yet done so and it is right that the EU should give a clear response. But that response should be proportionate and should be designed to get Turkey to fulfil its obligations and maintain the momentum of reform. It should not be a pretext for derailing negotiations. We need to agree and set out clearly what we expect Turkey to do. It is then up to Turkey to decide how quickly to reform and progress towards accession.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o107"><a name="61206-0009.htm_para4"><a name="06120652000355">We, the UK Government, judge that the current measures tabled by the European Commission are too harsh and risk being counterproductive. That would be a very poor result for the people of Turkey. It would also be a very poor result for Europe. Look at some of the strategic challenges that we are facing: increasing global competition from Asia; insecurity in our energy supplies; seemingly intractable problems in the middle east; rising extremism trying to drive Muslims and non-Muslims apart; an ageing population and a looming pensions crisis; the desire for Europe to play a more active role beyond its borders; and both at those borders and within them, the need to tackle drugs, organised crime and illegal migration.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o108"><a name="61206-0009.htm_para5"><a name="06120652000356">Turkey could play an immensely positive role in tackling all these challenges. It has a dynamic economy that is on track to attract US$20 billion in inward investment this year. It is already a major transit country for oil and gas and is set to be a crucial energy corridor into Europe. It has a network of relationships with countries in the middle east, including Syria and Iran, which no current EU member state can match. It has a young and increasingly educated work force, and larger armed forces than any other European country. It has shown that it can deliver real successes, working with us, on tackling terrorism, organised crime, illegal migration and trafficking. Perhaps most of all, at a time when some people are peddling the idea of an inevitable clash of civilisations, it is an immensely powerful symbol that European values can be Muslim values and vice versa.</p>

opening of Turkish accession talks was perhaps the only significant achievement of the last British presidency of the EU, and we gave the Government full credit for that. We share the Foreign Secretary&#146;s view that the decision to suspend so many chapters of the accession negotiations is regrettable and is a major setback. It is essential that more progress should be made towards achieving normal relations between Turkey and Cyprus, but it is surely the case that the prospect and process of EU accession is an important lever to help to achieve that end&#151;as it would be for further improvements in democracy and freedom in Turkey.</p>

That is naturally a matter of the highest concern for countries that are wholly dependent on gas from a single source, but, last winter, the UK also suffered unprecedented problems. In our case, they were a clear demonstration of how far short we continue to be of a proper and efficiently working single market in energy. The Commission has a massive programme of work to ensure that all EU customers, including British customers, are treated equally, that all EU companies, including British ones, can compete equally and that EU member states do not use fears of energy insecurity as an excuse to distort markets by creating so-called national champions. That is a big agenda for the European Commission. Attempts to add new competences instead of making proper use of existing ones are an absurd diversion. For example, the proposal for a single European energy market regulator should be rejected.</p>

Overall, we need a pragmatic, market-oriented approach, the main goal of which is the results that customers and businesses want, not the aggrandisement of EU institutions.</p>

When I mentioned the accession of the A8 countries, the hon. Member for Altrincham and Sale, West talked about the need to get his plumbing system sorted out. I know that he was joking&#151;although I am sorry if his plumbing system really is not working&#151;but the fact remains that the entry of the A8 was extremely important for Europe, for all the historic reasons that we have rehearsed many times in these debates. It was important because it united Europe again and created the largest single market in the world.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o151"><a name="61206-0010.htm_para29"><a name="06120659000075">I am glad that we did not impose restrictions on the citizens of the A8 countries to come and work here. The figures show that more eastern European migrants have gone to Germany than have come to the United Kingdom, even though they faced quite severe restrictions there. The entry of the A8 countries&#151;and their citizens coming to work in our country, whether on a long-term or short-term basis&#151;has been good for their economies, good for Europe and extremely good for Britain. The sum of &#163;300 million has been added to the Treasury&#146;s coffers thanks to the arrival of the A8 citizens, and we are very grateful to them for being able to contribute in that way. It means that we do not have a grey economy. We have a straight economy in which people who earn salaries when they come to this country pay their taxes and national insurance.</p>

to address such matters. The Government&#146;s position is absolutely right: there is no need to resurrect the constitution as, clearly, this country has no appetite for a referendum, and I do not think that that would be successful. The French electorate have put paid to the European constitution for a long while. It is now a matter of negotiation and discussions between Heads of Government in the normal way.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o154"><a name="61206-0011.htm_para2"><a name="06120659000084">On institutional reform, however, we need to keep the British flag flying, as we should also lead the reform agenda. It is right to remind the House of the Prime Minister&#146;s many speeches about Europe being more acceptable to the British people if it reforms itself. Clearly, it will not reform itself, so we must lead that reform. When Bulgaria and Romania become members, the EU will have 27 countries. I have attended European Council meetings, as have other right hon. and hon. Members present. It will be impossible to get decisions made at such meetings with 27 Foreign Ministers,27 Prime Ministers and 27 Europe Ministers&#151;along with all the Commissioners&#151;sitting round the table putting their countries&#146; positions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o155"><a name="61206-0011.htm_para3"><a name="06120659000085">I therefore say to my right hon. Friend the Minister for Europe that if we need to move ahead in areas in which co-operation is possible, when that is in the national interest, we should do so, as long as it does not result in the need for treaty changes&#151;if it does, obviously, it is a great constitutional issue. If the practicalities of the way in which Europe is governed are at issue, we must go ahead. We cannot leave the European Union in a position in which decisions cannot be made and the organisation is paralysed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o156"><a name="61206-0011.htm_para4"><a name="06120659000086">That leads me to the issue of the Tampere agenda, which was agreed in 1999 and has now become the Hague formula&#151;named after the city, not the right hon. Member for Richmond, Yorks, who is in Pakistan&#151;which is the agenda for justice and home affairs. Of what are we afraid? Surely we are in favour of controlling illegal migration, dealing with the drugs barons and controlling the trafficking of people. Of course we need to move forward on that agenda with our European partners. It would be astonishing if our security forces, the police and other agencies would not work in concert with the police, Interpol and the security services of other countries to deal with those three issues. What have people got against co-operation on that line?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o157"><a name="61206-0011.htm_para5"><a name="06120659000087">I have no problem with giving up the veto on those issues. In majority voting, we are always on the winning side. The Conservative Government gave up the veto and allowed us qualified majority voting more than any other Government in the history of this country. Under them, the veto disappeared out of the window on whole areas of policy. I have no problem with QMV in justice and home affairs. In this day and age and in this climate, it is vital that we are able to co-operate with our European partners. I will take the judgment of Ministers on that, however, as they are in possession of the information, and they know whether it is right to do so. There is the argument&#151;if the hon. Member for Altrincham and Sale, West looks at the figures on the number of times that we are on the winning side on QMV, he will be amazed at the statistics.</p>

occupy those in Brussels on 14 and 15 December. To my mind, it is the crucial agenda that Europe should follow. On the day of the pre-Budget report, it is important that we pause briefly to emphasise the importance of the Lisbon European Council, which was different from any other such meeting, as for the first time it set out strict and legitimate benchmarks against which countries are to be judged. The hon. Gentleman has an engaging smile, and when I asked him about our performance, he smiled. In fact, our performance is the best of the big countries in the European Union, thanks to the stewardship of my right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer. On the Lisbon agenda, we are the fourth best performer in Europe Germany is 10th and France is eighth. On practically every one of the targets, especially the employment targets, we are well ahead of our European competitors. It was the Economic Secretary to the Treasury, my hon. Friend the Member for Normanton (Ed Balls), who ensured, while he was in Tokyo, that the derogation was agreed with Brussels so that we remain the financial capital of the world and keep New York at a far distance.</p>

Europe&#146;s economy will not be the most dynamic in the world unless it can meet the Lisbon benchmarks, and we cannot wait for five years to find out about that.

plumbing and the idea that the Eurovision song contest is setting the agenda for enlargement. Thankfully, a lot of serious points have also been made, which the subject of Europe surely merits.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o162"><a name="61206-0011.htm_para10"><a name="06120659000095">Two weeks ago, two important speeches were made on the same day about the future of Europe. Each, however, said different things. One was made by the Foreign Secretary, who was addressing European Union ambassadors to the United Kingdom at the Finnish embassy in London. The other was made by the Minister for Europe, who was addressing the Institute of European Affairs in Dublin. Of course, the differences in the speeches might be viewed as the latest twist in the soap opera of King Charles street, which has been entertaining some and depressing the rest of us in recent months. On that occasion, however, the differences were not about splits&#151;at least not on the surface.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o163"><a name="61206-0011.htm_para11"><a name="06120659000096">The Foreign Secretary&#146;s speech dwelt on the challenges of climate change and energy security, the increasing complexity of Europe&#146;s external relations and the importance of common responses to the threats posed by international terrorism, and touched on the desperate need to make progress on the Doha trade round and to tackle the desperate situation in Darfur. The Minister for Europe&#146;s speech focused on the historic recent enlargement of the Union, the opportunities offered by the growth of the single market, and the need to reform Europe&#146;s institutions if we are to make the most of Europe&#146;s potential.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o164"><a name="61206-0011.htm_para12"><a name="06120659000097">Whatever the differences on the Treasury Bench, one does not need to be too charitable to acknowledge that the two different speeches underline the sheer breadth of issues confronting the United Kingdom and our European partners, and the importance of ensuring that, as a country, we are committed players in a growing European Union.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o165"><a name="61206-0011.htm_para13"><a name="06120659000098">The recent mood has been downbeat, and it is proving hard to shrug it off. We have had a somewhat muted and low-key 12 months since the rejection of the constitution by France and the Netherlands. Finland acceded to the presidency with high hopes of re-energising the Union, bringing the passive period of reflection on the constitutional treaty to a close, and starting active discussions on the future of the treaty; but, with recent inconclusive elections in the Netherlands and French presidential elections in 2007, it is not surprising that the issue has barely been discussed by European leaders, openly at least.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o166"><a name="61206-0011.htm_para14"><a name="06120659000099">We believe that recent and planned enlargement will place further pressure on Europe, which will force further reform of the institutions. Only yesterday, as mentioned by the hon. Member for Altrinchamand Sale, West (Mr. Brady), Finland became the16th country to ratify the draft constitution. Perhaps that was a belated attempt to restart negotiations on the treaty; but whatever the reasons for the ratification and whatever Finland hopes to achieve by it, it is clear that the review of the constitutional process as it stands is virtually moribund and in need of a fresh start.</p>

<p><a name="st_o259"><a name="06120659000100"><a name="61206-0011.htm_spnew9"><a name="06120659000358"><b>Kelvin Hopkins:</b> The hon. Gentleman mentioned Finland. Some years ago I asked a Finnish journalist why Finland did not hold a referendum on these matters. The journalist said, &#147;We could not hold a referendum: the people would not vote the right way.&#148;</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o167"><a name="61206-0011.htm_para15"><a name="06120659000102">It is important for us not to concentrate on examining our constitutional navels. Europe must not lose sight of the need to address the delivery deficit which directly affects all the people of Europe. That means refocusing on the economic weaknesses that the Lisbon and Hampton Court agendas have sought to address, and, in the wake of the stark warnings in the Stern report, on tackling the urgent issue of climate change. Whatever the disappointments of the past six months, we should not blame the Finnish presidency, which for the most part has been left to deal with more immediate, although none the less important, issues. In particular, the issue of Turkish membership of the European Union has continued to be a key challenge for Europe, and controversy continues to be inextricably linked to the issue.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o168"><a name="61206-0011.htm_para16"><a name="06120659000103">The twin issues of relations with Cyprus and fundamental internal reforms continue to provide barriers to a smooth accession process, but those barriers must not come to be regarded as insurmountable. Turkey will have to open its ports and airports to Cypriot traffic, and further moves towards settling the Cyprus dispute are clearly a prerequisite for Turkish accession, as are measures to tackle the shocking human rights issues in the country. However, it is important that we reinforce our commitment to Turkish accession to the European Union. There ought to be no ideological or&#151;despite what some may try to assert&#151;religious barriers to Turkish membership of the Union. The issue of Turkish accession may prove to be the most difficult of the enlargements that Europe has undergone, but in the end a reformed, democratic Turkey will be stronger, and at the same time will strengthen the European Union. It must be worth the effort.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o169"><a name="61206-0011.htm_para17"><a name="06120659000104">Of course, the issue of Turkish membership is not the only matter of enlargement with which we are concerned. The enlargement process must continue in the Balkans, and we must reject any idea that the Union&#146;s absorption capacity precludes any further members from south-east Europe. The Balkans are a hugely important part of our continent and we are all affected by what happens there, as was demonstrated so disastrously in the 1990s. The legacy of those conflicts is still with us in Kosovo and Serbia, where the fragile state of affairs is testimony to the difficulties of overcoming conflict.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o170"><a name="61206-0011.htm_para18"><a name="06120659000105">The coming year will be important for Kosovo and Serbia, and we must hope that the Council will address these matters. There will be elections in Serbia in January, and the results of Kosovo&#146;s final-status process are expected shortly thereafter. It is important for Britain to speak strongly on the issue. Serbia&#146;s recent reassertion of its territorial claim to Kosovo means that there are tough times ahead for the region, but some form of internationally guaranteed independence for Kosovo is inevitable and vital. Serbia and its neighbours must recognise that. Moreover, all the aspirant countries in the region must recognise their continuing obligations to satisfy international demands relating to the war crimes committed during the bloody conflict of a decade ago.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o171"><a name="61206-0011.htm_para19"><a name="06120659000106">A strong approach is essential, but it is also crucial that the Union continues to offer the carrot of membership to the region as the countries continue to undergo the difficult process of recovery and reconciliation.

and its economic and political benefits remain an important prospective reward for the difficult choices and the work involved. For the Union, it will represent the chance finally to unite all the different corners of Europe in a peaceful and prosperous continent, and the hope of burying the terrible legacy of Europe&#146;s 20th-century conflicts in the process.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o172"><a name="61206-0011.htm_para20"><a name="06120659000107">Despite its aspirations, the European Union&#146;s external relations have at times been fragmented and haphazard in recent years, not least owing to the divisions caused by the Iraq war. Increasingly, however, it is becoming apparent in both Europe and Washington that European involvement is a crucial component of international affairs. We therefore need to develop Europe&#146;s capability in its external relations policy. That requires difficult choices on the part of member state Governments, not least the British Government. We need to rebalance our British foreign policy, away from dependence on taking Washington&#146;s lead and towards greater influence within Europe. Nowhere is that more apparent than in the middle east, where the United Kingdom appears to have been completely bypassed by the recent Spanish, French and Italian peace initiative. Current international policy towards Israel-Palestine is in danger of irreversible failure, and we need a serious rethinking of that policy if we are to see a solution.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o173"><a name="61206-0011.htm_para21"><a name="06120659000108">Europe has an important role in the region, and in resolving that conflict. The EU is the largest aid donor to the Palestinians. In 2005 it gave half a billion euros, and the figure for 2006 is expected to be even higher. In Lebanon, too, Europe is a key donor, pledging&#8364;100 million following the disastrous conflict earlier this year. The Union also has an important economic relationship with Israel through the association agreement. We are Israel&#146;s largest trading partner, representing 35 per cent. of its trade&#151;a full 10 per cent. more than its trade with the United States.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o174"><a name="61206-0011.htm_para22"><a name="06120659000109">Europe therefore has the motive, which is the crisis in our neighbourhood, and the means, which is our economic influence in the region, to play a greater role. For too long we have been the banker for a failed international approach to the conflict, providing hundreds of millions of pounds to rebuild what has just been destroyed in the most recent confrontation. That money, rather than genuinely developing Palestine and Israel by reversing their descent into poverty, is in essence paying the cost of each failed military action.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o175"><a name="61206-0011.htm_para23"><a name="06120659000110">The Franco-Spanish initiative was welcome and served to remind us how far removed we are from the road map, but it did not set out a new strategy, and without support from countries across the Union&#151;including Britain&#151;it is likely to become just another failed initiative. What we need is a new common European position on Israel-Palestine, and such an approach must continue to be based on the Quartet&#146;s principles to create a secure and stable state for both Israel and Palestine. Europe must use its economic and geographic influence, backed up by a willingness to be part of the necessary security measures, to ensure that we get a proper and sustainable peace in the region. Unilateral UK efforts or trilateral European efforts are unlikely to succeed. The European Union is the formal member of the Quartet; it must act in accordance with that fact, and not simply continue to bankroll an increasingly failed policy over which it has limited influence.</p>

Sadly, in recent times, criticism has been at best muted and at times&#151;the worst case&#151;non-existent. Such an approach allows the Russian authorities to divide and conquer in negotiations with Europe. That is clearly disadvantaging us, and it is particularly unacceptable as Europe ought to be in a strong position.</p>

Europe does indeed need Russian oil and gas supplies, but Russia is also very dependent on a European market that is willing to pay what remain high prices for those supplies. It is dependent on Europe in many other ways too&#151;not that that is always obvious from the way that the EU reacts.</p>

The original statement included strong references to the need to respect political and economic freedoms. Any successor agreement must also include strong commitments to human rights, democracy and the rule of law, but, more than that, Europe must be willing to hold Russia to those commitments. It must also be made clear that its actions in Georgia, Ukraine and Moldova&#151;to name but a few places&#151;are totally unacceptable. Moreover, if Russia wants European support for its aim of accession to the World Trade Organisation it should be made explicit that that support depends on its abiding by the international rule of law. The future of Russia is in the balance, and the people of Russia and those in European Union will be ill-served by Europe remaining divided in its handling of Russia&#146;s affairs at home and abroad.</p>

They represent a Europe that is still coming to terms with the dramatic enlargement of two and a half years ago, that is still to equip itself with the tools to do its job efficiently and effectively, and that has still to undertake essential, and possibly painful, reforms.</p>

Member for Berwickshire, Roxburgh and Selkirk (Mr. Moore). In some ways, listening to, and taking part in, this debate is a bit like being at a meeting of the European Council: many issues are placed on the agenda, and rightly so, and everybody wants to have their say about all the various issues that are on the agenda, but only a limited number of issues ever come off the agenda with any decision having been made. It is another axiom of Council meetings that if someone wants something to be on the agenda in 24 months, they must raise it now or there will be no chance of it ever becoming an issue that is treated as a priority. It is therefore right that Members of this House are raising many issues that affect our future in Europe.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o182"><a name="61206-0012.htm_para6"><a name="06120659000120">In debates such as ours, it is often said that the usual suspects take part&#151;often by making the usual suspects&#146; speeches. Our debate today is not particularly different from those of other occasions, although I notice and welcome that a number of newer Conservative Members are quickly learning the tricks of usual suspicion. We look forward to their contributions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o183"><a name="61206-0012.htm_para7"><a name="06120659000121">Inevitably, and as the Foreign Secretary said in her introductory speech, the main issue on the agenda, which will be taken off it following the decisions that will hopefully be taken next week, will be how we proceed with enlargement. Matters relating to Bulgaria and Romania, and to some of the other countries that have been mentioned today, will be discussed. It is very important to ensure that we get the Turkey situation right, and that we continue to argue a positive case. The very complicated position in the Balkans also needs to be sorted out over time.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o184"><a name="61206-0012.htm_para8"><a name="06120659000122">I would normally dwell on enlargement, as I have before in such debates, but today I want to be different. I want to put on the agenda an issue that, although it will not be top of the bill next week, will probably rise up the order of priorities come the June Council meeting and will become increasingly important in subsequent meetings: climate change. The European Union is often criticised on all sorts of grounds. Some of that criticism is friendly, and some of it not so. Whatever one thinks of the EU, I cannot imagine that any other body will hold together international talks on climate change. The United Nations will try and, in a sense, it will set the tone of what might be achievable, but to judge by history, it will not achieve it. Such aims  <br>


<meta name="Date" content="6 Dec 2006">

will be achieved through negotiations between different interest blocs, who will sit down in a multilateral decision-making forum, whatever form that forum might take.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o185"><a name="61206-0012.htm_para9"><a name="06120659000123">That is exactly what happened at the Kyoto talks some years ago. The UN was unable to resolve the situation on its own, so there were talks among the different blocs and different commitments were made. It is not just a question of outlining a particular position; it is about being able to deliver on it. If the EU was not taking a very active role in climate change, how on earth would we deliver what we want to deliver in a European context? It would be extremely difficult, and I doubt whether we could. As the emissions trading scheme shows, even with the EU&#146;s involvement, it is not all plain sailing; there are many difficulties that we have to face up to. Without the EU&#146;s involvement, the situation would be almost impossible.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o186"><a name="61206-0012.htm_para10"><a name="06120659000124">Emissions trading is playing a key role in tackling the carbon reduction aims that are increasingly being pursued throughout the world. This is not an original EU idea&#151;it evolved following inter-state agreements within the United States&#151;but the EU has driven it forward in a positive way. Some 18 months into the scheme, we are already seeing the progress that is being made. It is not perfect, however. As the right hon. Member for Wokingham (Mr. Redwood)&#151;he is no longer in his place&#151;pointed out in an intervention, there have been many somewhat dubious definitions of permits under the existing permit scheme. Such aspects of the scheme have to be tightened up, but essentially, it is sound. It sets carbon emission levels for different European nations and within different industries, and it provides a forum for examining what is happening and what needs to be done not only by nation states, but by the industrial and commercial sector. I cannot envisage a better forum for achieving that aim, which is why we must focus on it and build on what has already been achieved.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o187"><a name="61206-0012.htm_para11"><a name="06120659000125">A measure of marketisation is also the right approach. It is better if people have an incentive to do something sensible, rather than their being forced to do something that others believe to be sensible. That is why the incentive scheme is a good one. It encourages those who can make bigger gains than they are required to make to do so, and to trade them on. It also encourages those who find it extremely difficult in the shorter term to make such gains to buy the permit cover that they need to meet the European guidelines, if the other parts of their business allow them to do so. I think that the scheme is a good one, but the rules need to be examined and there must be a monitoring system, with the EU looking closely at what is happening in member states. If we start to wander from our commitment and targets, so will everyone else, and the scheme will fall to bits.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o188"><a name="61206-0012.htm_para12"><a name="06120659000126">However, the main challenge has to do with the future. The current emissions deals take us through to 2012. There is a European commitment to reduce carbon emissions by 8 per cent in that period, but whether we achieve those targets remains to be seen. How do we take things forward? How does the EU play its post-Kyoto role, looking forward to 2020 and beyond?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o189"><a name="61206-0012.htm_para13"><a name="06120659000127">Those key questions cover much of the territory covered by the recent Stern report. I know that the December Council meeting will not resolve them, but the Germans in particular are interested and there will be a lot of pressure to make real progress next May and in the Council meetings that follow.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o190"><a name="61206-0012.htm_para14"><a name="06120659000128">Another matter that needs to be reviewed on a regular basis is the scope of the emissions trading scheme. Which greenhouse gases should it cover? That question needs to be discussed in depth. Any EU agreement must be consistent with Kyoto, but nitrous oxide, for instance, is not included at the moment, even though it accounts for a significant amount of emissions. In addition, should gases emitted from coal, such as methane, be covered by a new emissions trading scheme? Other greenhouse gases are emitted from aluminium production plants. Their names are so complicated that I will not try to pronounce them, but should they be included in future?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o191"><a name="61206-0012.htm_para15"><a name="06120659000129">Those are big questions, and I shall be interested to hear what the Minister winding up the debate has to say in response. I also have various other questions that I want to ask.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o192"><a name="61206-0012.htm_para16"><a name="06120659000130">The UK has adopted a very radical approach to aviation. Our population accrues more air miles per person than just about any other in Europe, so any agreement is likely to hurt us a little. However, there would be a big gap in the new emissions trading scheme if it did not include aviation. I had thought that total emissions from aviation amounted to 2 or 3 per cent. of the European total, but my right hon. Friend the Chancellor said in his statement earlier that the proportion is now calculated at 6 per cent.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o193"><a name="61206-0012.htm_para17"><a name="06120659000131">A sector that accounts for so much in the way of emissions cannot be ignored, and that raises serious questions about how the EU will introduce controls on aviation. The matter could be dealt with relatively easily at a European level through fiscal measures, although I know that some Opposition Members might find that difficult. However, what is the positive alternative to air travel? How do we invest in a Europe-wide rail system whose emissions levels per passenger mile would be about one seventh of what is produced by aviation?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o194"><a name="61206-0012.htm_para18"><a name="06120659000132">I asked that question in my contribution to the Queen&#146;s Speech debate, but other questions are also important. For instance: how do we link up rail systems so that people can travel cheaply from any part of the EU to any other on fast trains? That would contribute to improving the environment but it would be a big, costly and challenging decision. Do Ministers accept that tackling the problems of aviation or vehicle travel in general raises questions to do with how we transfer the emphasis onto public transport in the European context? That is a difficult problem that cannot be resolved by single states acting alone.</p>

<p><a name="st_o264"><a name="06120659000133"><a name="61206-0012.htm_spnew3"><a name="06120659000363"><b>Kelvin Hopkins: </b>I strongly agree with my hon. Friend about the need to build a Europe-wide rail network. That is happening already, for freight in particular but for passengers as well, as a result of the initiative taken by our noble Friend Lord Kinnock when he was Transport Commissioner. However, does my hon. Friend agree that the lack of investment in this country&#146;s rail network, especially for freight, has always been a problem? As a result of it, the channel tunnel is almost bankrupt because so little traffic is going through.</p>

Friend says about European issues, but I agree with him on that point. He is right: we have not spent enough on rail investment and we need to spend more. Our system should connect with European networks and there should be a minimum investment figure for all EU countries.</p>

Gentleman has obviously thought about aviation sector emissions. Does he agree that if we are not careful and the EU imposes a duty on aviation fuel, there could be a huge distorting effect? We could suddenly find that Ryanair uses Moscow or Istanbul as its major refuelling depot. How could that result be overcome? Is it the best way to deal with the problem or would levying a further passenger duty be a better solution?</p>

<p><a name="st_o267"><a name="06120659000136"><a name="61206-0012.htm_spnew6"><a name="06120659000366"><b>Mr. Henderson:</b> I fully accept the hon. Gentleman&#146;s point. Transport experts need to look into the problem. A diplomatic issue would be involved, too. If there was a bilateral agreement between Russia and the EU that any tax that applied in the EU would apply in Russia if an EU plane refuelled there, it would resolve the problem, although I realise that is a lot easier said than done. On the other hand, Ryanair might not find it viable to fuel up in Moscow to fly from Newcastle to Dublin. However, the problem needs to be tackled, as does competitiveness with the United States and north America. Should flights from that area be dealt with differently from flights within the EU? Those issues are all part of a package and they have to be resolved.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o195"><a name="61206-0012.htm_para19"><a name="06120659000137">I want to make two more points. First, the proposal to hold auctions for carbon limits is interesting and should be examined. I am not convinced that auctions would necessarily be better than the permit system, but it would be worth hearing the Government&#146;s view about whether they would be more effective, although if things were left completely to the market it would be harder for countries to define permits differently. I would not instinctively travel in that direction, but I shall be interested in the Government&#146;s view. Perhaps there could be a reference to that in the wind-up.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o196"><a name="61206-0012.htm_para20"><a name="06120659000138">Secondly, under the current system of emissions control permits, if an EU-based business invests in a carbon-saving scheme outside the EU&#151;for example, in a developing country or in China&#151;their contribution counts in calculations under the EU rules. Although that provision is mildly imperialist, it has a lot of merit, because it reduces emissions worldwide. If, rather than emissions targets being reached only in a European context, they are reached both in Europe and beyond, there is an overall gain, and that is desirable.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o197"><a name="61206-0012.htm_para21"><a name="06120659000139">Earlier today, the Chancellor said that Britain had signed a partnership agreement on the development of biofuels with Brazil, Mozambique and South Africa, and that we are working on the preservation of rain forests with Latin America and Asian countries, on clean coal with China and India and on carbon storage with Norway. If EU businesses, particularly British businesses, currently invest in such projects, would that count against any limits set in the post-2012 agreements? The rules would obviously have to be EU rules, so can the EU make a forward agreement and would the British Government support it? If so, it would provide an incentive to go further towards  <br>

<p><a name="stpa_o198"><a name="61206-0012.htm_para22"><a name="06120659000140">I am sure that the meetings to be held next week will be similar to others that have taken place over many years. I understand that enlargement will be at the top of the agenda, and I welcome and support that, but I hope that the Government will feel able to push the climate change agenda. In the wind-up, it would be interesting if we could hear to what extent the Government accept the Commission&#146;s new proposals on emissions trading.

First, I am bound to say that disarray among member states is apparent not just in respect of Iraq a few years ago when the situation became terminal for foreign policy and defence, but in respect of institutional changes as promulgated by proposals for a European constitution. We have had the referendums in France and the Netherlands, which went against the constitution, and a series of other rejected referendums in Denmark and Ireland, for example, that have been reorganised&#151;with a lot of threats and blackmail&#151;in order to get the right result. Of course, one cannot do that with a country like France. I am certain that it would not happen in this country either, as it would be so alien to the British tradition that serious problems would be caused.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o200"><a name="61206-0012.htm_para24"><a name="06120659000143">Just from sketching out those indicative problems, it is quite clear that the European Union is not working. I am interested in which way the future Prime Minister&#151;the present Chancellor of the Exchequer&#151;is likely to go on this subject. Above all else, he is a pragmatist. It is possible to make inferences from the people intimately around him, from his first statement on the Bank of England, from the economic tests, from the direction in which he has pitched his economic policies towards a more transatlantic approach and from the views of commentators such as Robert Peston and Tom Bower. They all provide some indication that under the presidency&#151;<i> [Interruption.] </i>That was a Freudian slip, as I meant the prime ministership of the current Chancellor. As I have made clear on several occasions, Conservative Members need to be aware that the Chancellor might do a mini-Peter Shore. My old friend, now Lord Shore, was a strong opponent of further integration. It would not be quite the same thing, but I believe that the direction is likely to be sceptical.</p>

happen to agree with your Chancellor of the Exchequer&#148;&#151;namely, my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Rushcliffe (Mr. Clarke). Well, I think things have changed considerably since then and we need to be conscious of that change. I mention that because, fundamentally, any responsible Government have to look at the situation as it really is&#151;and it is not working: Europe is not working.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o202"><a name="61206-0012.htm_para26"><a name="06120659000145">We also need to reflect on what Europe affects. Despite the desire of many people to shove some of this under the carpet, the reality is that in the real world the EU affects a vast amount of what goes on for our constituents. I would challenge anyone to try to tell me anything that it did not affect. That is all driven by a harmonised legal system and majority voting.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o203"><a name="61206-0012.htm_para27"><a name="06120659000146">As I said in an intervention, the Court of Justice carries with it a contradiction: in most cases people do not get what they would voluntarily want if they exercised their freedom of choice in the ballot box, by virtue of which they choose representatives in this Parliament, which legislates on their behalf. Yet we know perfectly well that, if hon. Members vote against a directive or a regulation in the European Standing Committee, which has happened on occasion, the decision is automatically overturned on the Floor of the House. The scrutiny process is wanting in many respects, and it is better than in most other member states.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o204"><a name="61206-0012.htm_para28"><a name="06120659000147">As I said in an intervention on the Foreign Secretary, the EU is undemocratic and unaccountable. There are ways to remedy that, and I need not rehearse my arguments on the supremacy of Parliament provisions that I proposed to the Legislative and Regulatory Reform Bill. I am very glad to say that Conservative Front Benchers and Whips agreed to support those provisions and went so far as to provide Tellers for what was a Back-Bench amendment, even though50 hon. Members had signed up to it on the amendment paper.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o205"><a name="61206-0012.htm_para29"><a name="06120659000148">My amendment was pursued as an anchor in that Bill, which ranges widely across a raft of measures and many Departments, and it was followed up in the House of Lords by a whipped vote, when the Chief Whip and the Leader of the Opposition in the Lords went through the Lobby with many of our noble Friends. Although we did not win the vote in either House, the anchor that those provisions representin sustaining the democratic principles on which Parliament is based is a matter for congratulation and applause for not only the Whips Office but the current leadership&#151;provided, of course, that that anchor remains firmly fixed where it was in June. I should not like to see it dragged in any direction, and I would strongly advise the leadership to include it in the manifesto, when it comes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o206"><a name="61206-0012.htm_para30"><a name="06120659000149">I have taken this overall position both on the landscape and on the principle of parliamentary supremacy, which is an essential issue not only for the House but for Europe as a whole. In fact, I would go further and extend the landscape across the whole globe. Given that many people have an aspiration for the EU to operate on the scale of 450 million peoplein sophisticated, industrialised countries, with new countries coming in because of enlargement, it is clearly a matter of vast importance that the system is truly democratic and truly accountable, and it is not.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o208"><a name="61206-0013.htm_para1"><a name="06120659000153">I asked myself, &#147;Where are the problems and difficulties that arise?&#148; In the context of the system that now exists, they reside in most of the other member states. In Germany, for example, there has recently been a challenge to the European constitution through the German constitutional court, which has decided to put the matter to one side for the time being, because there are political questions that have yet to be resolved. However, the court did not suggest that it thought that the European constitution was consistent with the German constitution. In fact, I get the impression that it does not think that it is consistent, but it wants to put that on one side until the political questions are resolved during the course of the German presidency.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o209"><a name="61206-0013.htm_para2"><a name="06120659000154">What is the German presidency after? In my opinion&#151;I know that this is controversial, but I have said it before&#151;the German nation, in its own vital national interests, believes in a concentric circles plan. Michael Mertes, who devised the plan, had a clear idea of it. I discussed it with him at great length on a number of occasions. The indications are that, whether by design or otherwise, Germany would end up by having a disproportionate amount of dominance in a Europe dominated by the system of qualified majority voting. Those countries that are economically or politically dependent on Germany, which includes most of the new entrants, would be in a difficult position. How would they be able to vote against a country to which they were so deeply committed economically? I am not trying to evoke dark impressions of the past. I am saying that there is a realistic problem, which some people want to push under the carpet, but which has to be considered responsibly in this Parliament, which represents a system of democracy and accountability.</p>

We understand that she wants a road map, leaving it to the subsequent presidency to take things forward. Apparently she is not optimistic about the German presidency solving the constitutional issue, but the fact is that she wants to kick-start the process. She is also against cherry-picking, or, in other words, taking bits and pieces, like Nicolas Sarkozy. She is against him on that. However, the reality is that underneath, there is a continuing commitment in Germany, in the Chancellery, to the idea of a European constitution and all the problems that will flow from it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o211"><a name="61206-0013.htm_para4"><a name="06120659000156">There are two contenders for the presidency of France. One is S&#233;golne Royal. I happen to be a strong and fervent admirer of France. My father is buried there. He was killed in 1944, in the war, fighting for liberty. S&#233;golne Royal says that she does not want a two-speed Europe. However, in effect, she wants a hard-core Europe, relaunched with Germany, Italy and Spain&#151;so we are told. She has expressed considerable concern about the American influence. She says that it is possible to have treaties within the treaty among four nations. I say that she said that, but actually it was said on her behalf. However, I do not think that we can have any doubt about the interpretation of that. Mr. Savary, who is her spokesman, also said that goals should include convergence of tax and social security and that there would be talks on a European army, which would not replace national armies.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o212"><a name="61206-0013.htm_para5"><a name="06120659000157">So, we have a mixed picture&#151;in France, Germany, the Netherlands and elsewhere in the Nordic countries. It is not just a mixed picture, but a picture of confusion and uncertainty that makes the disintegration of the eurozone more likely. That will be driven by an implosion, with problems due to high unemployment of the kind that we have seen in Paris, Lyon, Hungary and elsewhere. The system will not work.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o213"><a name="61206-0013.htm_para6"><a name="06120659000158">This country has been denied a referendum. Apparently, the Prime Minister is in favour of the European treaty, but he will not bring forward another European Union Bill. He says that treaties cannot be implemented in part, but what kind of treaty will there be? People can look to the future against the background of the considerable differences that exist, such as Mr. Sarkozy suggesting that we would want a legal personality for the Union, that we should have more majority voting and that there should be a Foreign Minister. As I put it to the Prime Minister&#151;I think that he saw a googly coming and decided just to play it straight back, if he could&#151;as Germany is prohibited from having a nuclear weapon by the NATO treaty, but we are committed by article 5 of that treaty to a joint alliance in the defence of our interests, if NATO and Germany are going further abroad and there is talk of the European Union supplementing or subordinating our position on the United Nations Security Council with a European Foreign Minister, a European foreign policy and a European security and defence policy could not work because of such conflicting internal collisions.</p>

By its very nature, Parliament rarely has the means of finding an opinion that is contrary to the Government&#146;s because the party with the most seats forms the Government. It is not undemocratic that the Government win votes, because that is the way in which the process works.</p>

In the context of enlargement, will there be any consideration of the problems that giving Kosovo an independent status could cause with Russia? It would be the first state that was not a former nation state to be given independent status, so that could be seen as a green light for some of the rebellious groups on Russia&#146;s borders.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o216"><a name="61206-0013.htm_para9"><a name="06120659000163">Secondly, what progress is being made on the security of energy supply? I find it extraordinary that that is not at the top of the agenda, especially, as we heard earlier, given the quite extraordinary way in which Germany is conducting itself in its dealings with Russia. I look forward to hearing what the Minister will have to say about that when he winds up the debate.</p>

We never get to grips with the way in which the European Union really works because we are dealing with such a long-term process. It was mentioned earlier that if one wants to get something on the agenda, one has to flag it up about two years in advance.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o218"><a name="61206-0013.htm_para11"><a name="06120659000167">It is easy to overlook the way in which the process by which the European Union forms its institutions actually works. There is no single voice with any cohesion within the Union, other than the one calling for deeper European integration, and it is foolish to think otherwise. There are two ways of achieving that deeper integration. The first is to use crises, and the other is to create new institutions. Rather than anyone saying, &#147;On this occasion, we will deal with the problem in hand,&#148; crises, whether it be a terrorist attack or bird flu, are used as a pretext for setting up structures that lead to deeper integration. New institutions always start with a particular function but end up doing something quite different. My objection to that is the absence of honesty; what is proposed may be fine, but we should be up front about it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o219"><a name="61206-0013.htm_para12"><a name="06120659000168">It is interesting to follow the path of the European Defence Agency, an institution that is just emerging as something quite different from what it was meant to be. I hope that the Government will keep a close eye on it to ensure that it delivers what it was originally meant to deliver. It is a bit like a mixture of Cardinal Newman and Kevin Costner&#146;s character in &#147;Field of Dreams&#148;. The European Union believes the saying, &#147;Build it and they will come&#148;. Cardinal Newman believed that it did not matter how small the step was, as long as it was a step forward, and that applies to attitudes to deeper integration, too&#151;one must never turn back, because to do so is to be regarded a heretic.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o220"><a name="61206-0013.htm_para13"><a name="06120659000169">The European Defence Agency started life just before the European Convention process started in 2003. Defence has largely been outside the treaty obligations. Any real, big progress in defence co-operation has always occurred when the UK and France decided to do something, and things would move on from there. It was during work on the Convention in 2003 that it was first rumoured that a new agency was to be set up. I thought that it was an extremely good idea, because it was to be called the European military capability agency, and it was supposed to identify and monitor military capacity. When it was first set up, the UK Government were most concerned that it was the Commission&#146;s way of making defence procurement a Commission responsibility through the back door, but that was never mentioned, and the agency was set up. It was a key part of the constitutional treaty, and although the treaty was rejected, we went ahead with the agency because the truth was that we did not need the treaty provisions to set it up. The UK was comforted by the thought that it was run by a Brit.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o221"><a name="61206-0013.htm_para14"><a name="06120659000170">If one looks into the way in which the agency operates, there is still a hell of a lot of duplication going on. It seems to be leading to greater protectionism, too. It has a budget of &#8364;22 million for 2007, which, in defence terms, is chickenfeed. The United States of America spends $18 million a month supporting Pakistan in its counter-terrorism activities, so &#8364;22 million for the whole of Europe is not very much. However, what the agency does with that small sum is bicker and argue. Four or five years after its original, very helpful, purpose was decided on, it is enlightening to look at the agency&#146;s report on what it thinks that it has achieved.</p>

The UK is comfortable with the agency, because it was headed by a Brit but, in its own words, it has failed to address the problem that the EU must confront if it wants to be a serious player in defence. It must start spending more on defence&#151;despite all the protestations, defence spending continues to go down&#151;and rather than fighting NATO, it must start to work with it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o229"><a name="61206-0013.htm_para22"><a name="06120659000178">The Foreign Affairs Committee has just returned from Afghanistan. The operation there is not a proper NATO operation but a balkanisation of NATO troops. Command is provided by the international security assistance force, but the national units protect their own turf, and in some cases they are sitting on their hands. In Riga, we did not secure the advances that we wanted, but the good Europeans are comfortable in the knowledge that they have created an institution. That happens repeatedly, so I urge Ministers to demonstrate at the Council the healthy pragmatism for which the Brits are renowned. What is the purpose of the institutions that we have set up, and are they delivering it? For most partners, the setting up of institutions and initiatives is a mechanism to achieve deeper integration. I will admit that I am wrong the minute that a French or German politician says that there are some EU functions that are better performed by the nation states. But no one says so, as there is a continuous push for deeper integration.</p>

hon. Friend the Member for Stone (Mr. Cash) said, almost every aspect of our national life is subject to the influence of the EU, but people have no sense of control. As a result, there is a disconnection from the process.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o232"><a name="61206-0013.htm_para25"><a name="06120659000182">I agree with the Foreign Secretary that there should be an open door to new entrants. I accept, too, that for some countries on the borders of the EU, the possibility of membership is helpful in achieving reforms. I wish to explore that, but before I do so, it was Willy Brandt who said that the trouble with politicians was that they went into politics to resolve a given set of problems. Once they had done so, however, they failed to move on. The EU is a classic example, as the challenge that it faces is not one of constitutional centralisation, which is quite irrelevant to its needs, but one of demography and lack of competitiveness. Astonishingly, UK corporation tax, which used to be lower than the EU average, is now higher. As a percentage of world trade, the European single market is diminishing as a result of globalisation and other challenges. We have become more insular and obsessed with policies and directives that do not address those challenges for the long-term benefit of the people of this country and of other Europeans.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o233"><a name="61206-0013.htm_para26"><a name="06120659000183">I echo the hon. Lady&#146;s point. Notwithstanding all the ambitions for a common foreign and defence policy, what we have seen in Afghanistan is truly shocking. Although that is nominally a NATO exercise, our European partners have been unwilling to play their part in dealing with the terrible situation in Afghanistan, which is universally regarded as a huge challenge for all of us. There seems to be an inverse relationship, with those who plead more for political integration and centralisation being unwilling to face their domestic electorates and argue for the defence spending to make that credible and viable, and those who are conceited enough to believe that the European Union should be a force in the world being unwilling to argue with their domestic electorates for adequate defence spending. That makes a mockery of the EU&#146;s demand to be listened to.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o234"><a name="61206-0013.htm_para27"><a name="06120659000184">Like other hon. Members, I shall speak about the issue of Turkey. We sometimes forget that the accession process has been going on for a long time. Turkey became an associate member of the EEC in 1963. The formal application to join the European Community was made in 1987. Turkey was officially recognised as a candidate for membership in December 1999 at the Helsinki summit of the European Council. The negotiations for Turkey&#146;s entry started only in October 2005. With the current problems, the issue will take at least a decade to resolve.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o235"><a name="61206-0013.htm_para28"><a name="06120659000185">We should recognise the extraordinarily brave part that that country played during the cold war, right on the border of the old Soviet Union. We should respect the fact that Turkey played a significant part in our defence and our freedoms. Its geographic location enables it to play a hugely important part not only culturally, but militarily, between Europe and the middle east.</p>

however difficult that is. She has accepted the view of the European Commission, which is probably far too tough. At least she is not going further, as she previously seemed to be indicating. The attitude in Germany and France is not driven by an important geopolitical consideration of the future of Turkey and its relationship with the EU. It is driven by domestic attitudes and politics, which in my view is wrong.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o237"><a name="61206-0014.htm_para1"><a name="06120659000187">The EU Commission has frozen eight out of the35 chapters for negotiation. Those are the free movement of services, the right of establishment and freedom to provide services, agriculture and rural development, financial services, fisheries, transport, customs union and external relations. There are huge demands on Turkey and all derive from the difficulty of creating an adequate customs protocol.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o238"><a name="61206-0014.htm_para2"><a name="06120659000188">As several hon. Members have noted, one of the barriers to negotiations is the key Turkish demand that the isolation of Turkish north Cyprus be lifted. On a strict legal interpretation, Turkey is in the wrong and should admit Greek Cypriot ships to its ports. However, there are powerful domestic reasons why that is not happening and the issue remains a flashpoint.</p>

I agree with the Prime Minister, who said in Latvia recently that it would be a &#147;serious mistake&#148; to send a negative signal to Turkey over its EU membership. There are presidential elections in Turkey at the beginning of next year and parliamentary elections at the end of the year. In 2008 there are European elections in a number of countries, notably Germany. So there is a window, but not a large one, for us to consider Turkey&#146;s future.</p>

Some polls suggest that a majority would wish to break off accession talks altogether, and there is certainly a considerable decline in the number of those who favour joining the EU at all.</p>

It has excellent relationships with Israel and with Arab countries. It has committed its troops to Lebanon. There is a Jordanian-Turkish initiative known as the neighbourhood forum which could at least be the basis for countries in the region coming together to consider the terrible problems that are besetting it.</p>

Many of the states of central Europe were offered the prospect of membership of the EU and NATO as an ultimate reward for their diligent pursuit of democratic and market reforms, but Ukraine received no such serious offer after it had declared independence. That has rendered its transition that much harder and given political ammunition to those in Ukraine with a deep mistrust of the west. Western scepticism may thus have become a self-fulfilling prophecy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o244"><a name="61206-0014.htm_para8"><a name="06120659000196">The orange revolution constituted a critical point of departure in the EU&#146;s new relationship with Ukraine. Over the past year, there has been a concerted effort to upgrade the EU-Ukrainian relationship, despite persistent political instability in Ukraine. That includes pressure on it in terms of creating a market economy, making progress on anti-dumping legislation, efforts to simplify visa rules, and a feasibility study on an eventual free trade agreement. The idea that this should, in stockbroking language, be &#147;all or none&#148; is irrelevant. In relation to a country such as Ukraine, which is of huge geopolitical significance given all the pressures, particularly from Russia in the north, we should have flexible arrangements that enable it to participate in aspects of life within the EU in order to encourage it to make progress on democratic practices, human rights and opening its markets without ultimately requiring full EU membership. Such flexible arrangements would work much more satisfactorily in the globalised world that we inhabit.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o245"><a name="61206-0014.htm_para9"><a name="06120659000197">The EU considers Ukraine to be a priority partner country and calls for an increasingly close relationship. Indeed, an EU/Ukraine summit took place in the autumn of this year. It is very important that the country be stable and successful. For example, a large amount of the energy supplies that come westwards from Russia come through Ukraine. Regardless of the outstanding problems, we should extend the hand of friendship to Ukraine at this time and try to develop these relationships. Ukrainians look to this country to lead on the matter. Many have contributed to the economic life of this country and listed some of their companies on the London stock exchange. They feel comfortable in this country and look to us to take a more pragmatic view than some of our European partners of the European Union and its future.</p>

Members have commented on Croatia and the western Balkans. However, I should like to consider the problem of Moldova, which is a close neighbour of existing EU countries. In February 2005, the EU and Moldova adopted a bilateral action plan. It is a political document that sets out strategic objectives to be fulfilled over a time frame of three years. It covers strengthening administrative and judicial capacity, respect for freedom of expression and freedom of the media. Furthermore, there are issues linked to border management and the fight against trafficking and organised crime. Of course, it is a poor country with a low standard of living, yet we need to encourage it to undergo reforms.</p>

She seems determined to bury the independence of member states and the democratic rights of their citizens in a much more bureaucratic, authoritarian state of Europe. She also wants to revive the European constitution. Some months ago, a parliamentary colleague clapped his hand on my shoulder and said, &#147;Now that we are not joining the euro and the European constitution is dead, nothing divides us.&#148; He said that with a smile on his face. I replied that I hoped that that was the case, but unfortunately it does not seem to be because there are people&#151;Angela Merkel is one of them&#151;who are determined to revive the constitution and to drive everyone to join the eurozone, which would be absolutely disastrous.</p>

However, in relation to our discussing how strong borders should be, or whether they should be porous or almost non-existent, Finland has the presidency at the moment, and it does not worry about borders. The Finns told me that people do not want to go to Finland because it is a very cold country with an extremely difficult language&#151;that is what Finnish politicians say. However, people do want to go to other countries in the European Union. The countries that are affected by changes in the strength of borders need to have more influence in the debate; they should have a bigger say in what goes on than those who are either unaffected or keen to have less policing on their borders because they want to move away from the poorer countries towards the richer countries. It is understandable for the people of those countries to take that view.</p>

that there are many others in the party and in the broader Labour movement who take a similarly sceptical view of the European Union&#151;not on a narrow, nationalistic basis, but on a socialist basis.

We have seen that inside the eurozone already. Some countries joined the euro at a parity that was too high for their economy, and some joined at a low parity, which has been advantageous.

the German interest rates much lower. It is no surprise that demand is constantly depressed in the German economy, as Germany cannot reduce its interest rates to stimulate demand. It does not do too badly in terms of trade but, internally, it is constantly in near recession as it cannot reduce interest rates and therefore raise domestic demand.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o261"><a name="61206-0014.htm_para25"><a name="06120659000218">Fortunately, we have careful control of our interest rates, which we adjust monthly when necessary. We might argue about whether they should go up or down, but at least we can adjust them according to our own economy and our own needs. If we chose to do so, we could also take steps to adjust our exchange rate in relation to the currencies of our trading partners, such as the dollar or the euro. Every major economy ought to be able to do that, and if they cannot they will get into deep trouble at some time or other.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o262"><a name="61206-0014.htm_para26"><a name="06120659000219">The best example of that is Argentina. It tied the peso to the dollar and made it completely exchangeable, and the middle class sold all their pesos and bought dollars, which almost destroyed its internal economy. After 10 years of a nightmare, it broke away from the dollar, devalued and started to rebuild its economy. Fortunately, it produces splendid wine, of which it now sells a lot, which is helping its economy grow again. For 10 years, however, the madness of tying a weak currency to a strong one almost destroyed what used to be the strongest economy in south America. We do not want to go down that route. Any country that chooses to bury its currency in that way would make a big mistake.</p>

With a stable exchange rate system, in extremis a country can change the value of its currency relative to others. We have done that a couple of times in our history, and it has had a tremendously beneficial effect on our economy. At present, of course, the euro is suffering greatly from the fact that the dollar is being devalued, and I expect it to have yet more problems because of the inability of individual member states to adjust their own currencies relative to the dollar. It is too rigid; too inflexible.</p>

We could claim that many of the regulations and laws&#151;or the aspirations of many of them&#151;are in our national interest. Plenty of arguments could be put forward on that topic. However, what is clear is that the EU has in many ways moved on from prescriptive legislation in the past year or two. It has begun to look at principles-based legislation&#151;a simple principle is brought into effect and then it is left to businesses to determine how best to put it into practice and to make their own decisions without being overwhelmed with reams of paperwork. Sadly, the Government have not yet cottoned on to that, or to the fact that it means that they no longer need to gold-plate legislation coming from the EU.

fathom the calculation for working out whether employees have been working an average of 48 hours a week over a 17-week period; it is mayhem. I can pretty much guarantee to the House that many small and medium-sized businesses will not be adhering to the working time directive by keeping such records. If they implemented all the detail in much of that guidance, they would simply be unable to run their businesses.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o275"><a name="61206-0015.htm_para7"><a name="06120659000235">On European regulation, there are two main challenges. First, although not all the stock of existing regulation needs to be undone, that needs to happen to a certain degree. Secondly, we must consider the flow of new regulations. Fortunately, that flow has slowed somewhat, but a lot remains to be done in stemming it further. That is largely a job for this House, as it examines the regulations coming through via statutory instruments and their implementation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o276"><a name="61206-0015.htm_para8"><a name="06120659000236">I want to finish by painting a slightly more hopeful picture of the future of the European Union. We are all very aware of the existing EU&#146;s failings and the challenges that we face, but I am hopeful and reasonably optimistic about the medium to long-term future. With enlargement comes opportunities; with enlargement, the mood and culture of the EU changes. Since Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia and Poland joined a few years ago, the culture of the EU has become more entrepreneurial. Those countries recognise the benefit of commerce and free trade, not only within the EU but in a global context. To a certain degree, that adds to the EU.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o277"><a name="61206-0015.htm_para9"><a name="06120659000237">We also have the opportunity to adopt more inthe way of principles-based legislation, instead of prescriptive regulation, and to reform European institutions.

I am not sure which language we might nominate, but that would certainly save a lot of translation. What do we think?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o282"><a name="61206-0015.htm_para14"><a name="06120659000249">Opinion polls consistently show that between 40 and 50 per cent. of the UK population favour Britain&#146;s withdrawal from the EU, and that less than half the remainder are convinced that we should remain in that organisation. That means that a clear majority of the British public are either convinced that we should withdraw or are sceptical about our continued membership. Indeed, in opinion polls more people express their support for EU withdrawal than say that they would vote either Labour or Conservative in a general election.</p>

Back in 2004, the EU was included in the US Central Intelligence Agency&#146;s &#147;World Factbook&#148;, an open-source publication that tracks the key characteristics of every nation around the globe. That was the first time that a supranational body had ever been included in a publication dedicated to tracking developments in nation states.

<p><a name="stpa_o285"><a name="61206-0015.htm_para17"><a name="06120659000252">It is hard to argue against many of the indictments against the EU. As my hon. Friend the Member for Windsor said, about 70 per cent. of our laws now emanate from the EU rather than from here. The rulings of unelected Commissioners take precedence over the wishes of democratically elected national Parliaments. Most people understand that the EU is inefficient and wasteful, and that it suffers from systemic corruption.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o286"><a name="61206-0015.htm_para18"><a name="06120659000253">More often than not, EU supporters do not attempt to defend the organisation against those charges. From time to time, warm words are offered about reform, but little debate is ever allowed on the fundamental question of our relationship with a body that is failing and undemocratic. Instead, those who support the EU engage in skilful if sometimes frustrating shadow boxing.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o287"><a name="61206-0015.htm_para19"><a name="06120659000254">For example, I recently tabled some questions about the number of our jobs that are dependent on our membership of the EU. I was told that about 3 million jobs depend on our trade with EU countries. There is no doubt that those jobs and that commerce are among the benefits of free trade, but they are not benefits of EU membership, as I shall try to explain later.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o288"><a name="61206-0015.htm_para20"><a name="06120659000255">However, responses of that sort are not unusual. People who support the EU project bring the debate back to the UK economy and jobs, and in my opinion they are right to do so, as few people give much thought to the EU and its role in our democracy. Instead&#151;and of course&#151;they think about their jobs, pensions and the money in their pocket, but EU supporters are wrong to suggest that arguments based on jobs and the economy make the case for the UK&#146;s continued membership.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o289"><a name="61206-0015.htm_para21"><a name="06120659000256">For most people, the distant and impersonal EU is less tangible than questions about schools, hospitals, police on our streets and the money in our pockets. Few spend much time thinking about the EU constitution, but mortgages, bills and pensions occupy most people&#146;s thoughts every day. Equally, people in business are likely to be far more concerned about making money and growing their businesses than about questions to do with the structure of the EU.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o290"><a name="61206-0015.htm_para22"><a name="06120659000257">It is on the economy that the argument as to whether Britain remains in the EU will be lost or won, as those who support our staying in the EU realised a long time ago. By presenting EU membership in economic terms, successive Governments have been able to sell what is essentially a political and unpopular project to the British people. However, we should look at the figures and examine the economics. When we consider the EU&#146;s effect on trade, jobs and growth we find that the case for Britain leaving the EU is more compelling than ever.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o291"><a name="61206-0015.htm_para23"><a name="06120659000258">We are told that, if we were ever to withdraw from the EU, Britain&#146;s economy and out trade with our European neighbours would suffer, and that jobs and prosperity would be lost. We are told that more than60 per cent. of our trade is with the EU, and that withdrawal would mean the loss of our markets there. We are told that the single market has been good for our economy and that we would suffer financial consequences from withdrawal. We are told that if we left 3 million jobs would be lost.</p>

Our European neighbours make money from us, too; in fact, they make more money from us than we make from them. Britain&#146;s balance of trade with the EU has been running at a deficit since we joined in 1973. According to figures from the Library, between 1973 and 2005 the cumulative trade deficit between the UK and the EU amounted to an astonishing &#163;230 billion.

I don&#146;t care what it does to my profit margins, but I&#146;m no longer trading with them on principle&#148;? How likely is that? In fact, Switzerland, a non-EU country, enjoys a healthier balance of trade with the EU than us and has a higher proportion of its trade with the EU than us. So much for the benefits of EU membership.</p>

Indeed, I come to the very point now. Earlier this year, the Enterprise and Industry Commissioner, Gunther Verheugen, said that EU regulations were costing the European economy &#8364;600 billion a year. That amounts to about 5.5 per cent. of Europe&#146;s total gross domestic product. That is staggering enough: on the Commission&#146;s own figures, European businesses are losing the equivalent of the entire GDP of Holland every single year.</p>

The most recent Commission estimates are for 2002, when the single market benefits were put at &#8364;165 billion&#151;quite substantially less than the costs. Even taking account of inflation, the costs of EU membership to business are about three times the benefits. So much for the economic benefits of the EU. Far from being good for business, the bureaucratic EU is actually profoundly harmful to business&#151;and that according to the European Commission itself. I wonder how much of those costs are falling on the shoulders of British businesses and I wonder what a business man might feel about withdrawal when faced with that particular fact.</p>

and a free trade agreement with EU countries. Crucially, only 24 per cent. of those business people thought that the EU would increase in economic importance in the future, whereas 35 per cent. thought that it would decline. Our future prosperity, Madam Deputy Speaker, depends on trading with countries such as China, India and South America and with the Commonwealth; it does not depend on being part of an inward-looking, backward-looking protection racket, which is what the EU has become.</p>

When it comes to such stark figures, we have to ask whether the EU has contributed towards that sluggish growth. If we compare the EU&#146;s stifling levels of regulation and high taxes with the USA&#146;s business-friendly, low-tax economy, we are forced to conclude that the EU&#146;s social democratic model has contributed to it.

The annual cost of the EU for every man, woman and child works out at &#163;873. Can we imagine what a hard-working family of four on a tight budget could do with that kind of money&#151;about &#163;3,500? Every minute of 2007, the EU will cost the UK &#163;100,000.

I do not claim to be speaking on behalf of the party; I am speaking on behalf of what I believe in. It is to the credit of my right hon. Friend the Member for Witney (Mr. Cameron) that he has allowed Back Benchers freely to express our views on withdrawing from the EU and the debate not to be shut down, as the Government would like.</p>

If we are to attract investment and win business in the future, we must start freeing ourselves from this stifling political Union. The 21st century, with the emerging economies of Asia, is not a time for uncompetitive protection rackets. Business is global, and if we are to compete, we must be too. Governments must reflect that with light regulatory touch, and the main impediment to that is the EU. When considering the case for Britain being better off out of the EU, I am reminded of the words from Bill Clinton&#146;s 1992 presidential election campaign headquarters: &#147;It&#146;s the economy, stupid.&#148;</p>

Friend, myself and other Conservative Members&#151;all very young people&#151;are going to take the EU in a different direction. I was born on the day that Edward Heath signed the documents to take us into the Common Market&#151;24 January 1972. Of course, when we had the referendum on whether we should stay in the Common Market, I was only three years of age, so I could not vote. Many hon. Members were too young to participate in that referendum, but there will come a time&#151;I am convinced of this more than I am of anything else&#151;when my generation of Conservative Members of Parliament will start to address some of the fundamental flaws in our membership of the EU and will make it more appropriate to our generation.</p>

An example of that is the Irish. The Irish have recently given their dairy farmers&#163;300 million in illegal subsidies.

I remember visiting Sweden in the mid-80s, when it was already pioneering endothermic energy and various renewable fuels. How marvellous that the Swedes, with a population of 9 million to 10 million people, can be an oil-free society by 2012. We can learn from one another and we should start to co-operate in the energy field.</p>

I have already mentioned this to my hon. Friend the Member for Altrincham and Sale, West (Mr. Brady). Germany is the main culprit. It is building a pipeline from Russia across the Baltic sea so that it can have a stable supply directly to its coastline on the Baltic. That will cause huge environmental damage in the Baltic sea, but worse, it is a deliberate attempt to bypass other EU nations. Germany wants deliberately to bypass the Baltic states and Poland and have its own secure supply from Russia. That, in my humble estimation, is a massive breach of what a common energy policy should be. The Government should use their influence to make the Germans think again.</p>

I applaud the Finnish presidency for focusing on trade relations with Russia. However, we need to work together as EU nations to help when one EU nation is unfairly treated by Russia. As I have already mentioned, the Russians are trying to block all imports of meat products from Poland and are threatening the Poles. As members of the European Union, we should be doing everything to support Poland in its dispute with Russia to ensure that its products have proper access to Russia.</p>

If one tweaks their nose, they want to retaliate very aggressively. Because of the recent espionage problems between Russia and Georgia, the Georgians are having terrible problems exporting basic foodstuffs and agricultural products.

The fact that we failed to do so means that every time something happens in Russia, the effect ripples right across. That is why our gas prices go up and down so tremendously.

<p><a name="stpa_o317"><a name="61206-0016.htm_para15"><a name="06120664000026">The European Union&#146;s priority should be helping small, vulnerable countries with illegal immigration. My friends who are Members of Parliament in Malta tell me that the country is being swamped by illegal immigrants from Libya. Many western Africans are coming to the ports close to the border with Tunisia, near Tripoli, and going across to Malta in a clandestine way. To my knowledge, we have not sent any immigration enforcement help to assist Malta in its struggle. We need to send patrol boats and assistance in sending people back. Malta needs us to put pressure on Tripoli to police its ports better. The Prime Minister has tried to improve our relations with Colonel Gaddafi and we should be using our position of influence. If the Prime Minister could manage to stop Colonel Gaddafi from going ahead with weapons of mass destruction, surely he can convince him to tighten up his ports to prevent illegal immigration into the European Union.</p>

Friend moves on from Malta, does he agree that Britain has a particular role to play in Malta and Cyprus, the other two Commonwealth countries that are members of the European Union? Before he moves on to the Canary islands, where other member states might have a role to play, does he agree that it would be nice to see Britain playing an especially strong role in countries with which we have an historical Commonwealth connection?</p>

Many of those illegal immigrants will make their way to France or the United Kingdom, so there is no good saying, &#147;Well, of course this is not our problem,&#148; because it is. In a recent television documentary on illegal immigrants, many of them said that they were going to the Canary islands only as a way of getting to the United Kingdom, so we should be doing far more.</p>

I estimate that illegal immigration is the biggest threat to our sovereignty. If a country cannot police its borders, it does not have sovereignty. Some of my colleagues say that the EU is the biggest threat to our sovereignty, but that is not the case. The biggest threat is not being able to police our own borders properly.</p>

played a role by broadcasting to those countries in their own languages, showing them that there was a world outside communism in which people had freedom, managed to enjoy democracy and were not fearful of the secret police. That gave tremendous succour to the people of eastern Europe. They really appreciated it, and were extremely grateful to Great Britain and the BBC for standing up to communism and showing them an alternative. We need to do the same for Belarus. We need to broadcast to its people to show them that the tyranny of President Lukashenko is not inevitable, and to show them that they should aspire to democracy, and to joining the free countries of Europe. We should invite Opposition leaders from Belarus to London, and we should give university scholarships to Belarusians. Most importantly, political parties need to build bridges with Opposition parties and to help them financially in any way that they can.</p>

Members played a tremendous role in safeguarding democracy in Portugal in 1975. Some hon. Members may remember that, in 1975, Mario Soares was trying to install a new democracy after the military dictatorship in Portugal, and members of the international socialist movement ensured that that happened, by making repeated visits to Portugal, and by inviting Opposition leaders here. Callaghan, Wilson and many other others stayed close to Mario Soares, and they helped to nurture democracy in Portugal. The Labour party and other socialist parties across Europe played a fundamental role in helping Mario Soares to retain democracy in Portugal. My generation has a responsibility to do the same for the poor people of Belarus.</p>

I am not a little Englander, but a rather big Englander. This country has a heritage of thinking big, because we have always looked overseas for our future. However, we have never looked towards Europe, and while its countries were squabbling, we were off exploring new worlds, creating new opportunities for the country. We are a great trading nation that does not like the artificial confines of the European Union, and we have truly wide horizons.</p>

the responsibility to address those concerns. At each stage of the European experiment, when people raised their concerns, we just said, rather patronisingly, &#147;No, no; you are just seeing ghosts. It will never happen,&#148; but what was originally conceived of as a trading bloc is now moving into involvement in social and workplace legislation, and that is a far remove from what was originally conceived by the so-called founding fathers.</p>

Member for Birmingham, Edgbaston(Ms Stuart) showed that she really knew her stuff when she accused EU institutions of mission creep, because when grand institutions come into being, the first thing that they want is to grab even more power. The EU is its own worst enemy, because it constantly meddles and interferes. A classic example is its failing labour market model. European labour markets are not competitive, as they do not create jobs. We heard about the big ideas at the Lisbon summit of 2000. Delegates at the summit said that Europe should create 20 million new jobs by 2010&#151;they thought that just by talking about it, it would happen. However, not one new job has been created. Structural unemployment in France and Germany has not budged in the past two decades. While some countries, including the UK, have enjoyed economic growth of varying levels, Europe has remained stagnant. Far from wanting to adopt the UK model, Europe continues to look inward, persisting with failed labour market solutions. It has tried to foist its problems, including the working time directive, on us. What business is it of Government to tell people how long they should work?</p>

In my constituency we recently had a delegation of professors visiting one of our secondary schools to see how we manage education in this country. They were not from Spain or from France. They were from China. Fantastic! My secondary school, John Warner school, is to offer Mandarin from next year. If my secondary school can recognise the opportunities that reside in China, so must we and, more importantly, so must our European Union partners, or they will be left behind.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o331"><a name="61206-0017.htm_para7"><a name="06120664000047">I shall give an example of the unintended&#151;perhaps they were intended&#151;consequences of European regulations. I recently met the chief executive of one of my local hospitals. I asked why the hospital&#146;s performance had not improved. I said, &#147;You&#146;ve had huge amounts of additional money. Where is it all going?&#148; She replied, &#147;Well, we have to pay our doctors 30 per cent. more and, because of the working time regulations, they are working 30 per cent. fewer hours. How can I increase productivity on that basis?&#148;</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o332"><a name="61206-0017.htm_para8"><a name="06120664000048">That is what Europe does not understand. People can be paid more and work more, they can be paid less and work less, but they cannot be paid more and work less. That just does not add up. We have been getting away with it for the past 40 or 50 years, but the hard-working people in China, India and other emerging economies will not let us get away with it in the future. Clearly, I am causing great distress to the Minister&#146;s Parliamentary Private Secretary, who has left her place, but the situation that I am describing is the reality, which the hon. Lady&#146;s Chancellor recognises, as in his pre-Budget report he spoke a lot about China and India and not a lot about the European Union. Perhaps the message is getting through to him as well.</p>

We have an opportunity to forge a new relationship both with our European partners and with the emerging economies of India and China.

We should follow their lead. It is a sadness that at a time when our new European partners are looking outwards, the Government&#151;this is just a mild criticism&#151;are tending to favour the more regulatory approach followed by some of our old European partners. We want a successful economy. We want high levels of employment. We want substantial wealth creation. As currently structured, the EU is a barrier to that, not a promoter of that aspiration.</p>

I have been to Bulgaria, which is a fine country, but not yet to Romania. The accession of those countries represents an important time for the European Union and, indeed, for the United Kingdom. Last week, I met the Romanian Immigration Minister and raised concerns expressed by many of my constituents about the number of economic migrants who might come to Shropshire and to this country as a whole. The Minister tried to comfort me by saying that she thought that most people leaving Romania would go to countries with warmer, sunnier climates, such as Italy and Spain. That may be so. Nevertheless, when the most recent accession countries acceded to the EU, the Government predicted, despite the Foreign Secretary&#146;s earlier denials, that 15,000 economic migrants would come to the UK. We now know that the figure is 500,000 and growing. The hon. Member for Aberdeen, South (Miss Begg) is not here today, but she has rightly  <br>

observed that more than 10,000 Polish people have entered Aberdeen over the past year or so. In Shropshire, there are many hundreds of Polish people; no poll has been undertaken to ascertain precisely how many.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o338"><a name="61206-0017.htm_para14"><a name="06120664000055">Many of those people are contributing legitimately to our economy and have brought skills that we need. However, this needs to be seen in the contextof unemployment, which is at a seven-year high. Unemployment is going up and we have an inflow of economic migrants, so more people are chasing fewer jobs. We also see wage deflation in some areas of the economy, certainly in the agricultural sector in Shropshire, Herefordshire and other parts of the west midlands. If we are not careful, the very good community relations that this country has enjoyed over generations, for hundreds of years, could inadvertently be undermined. That would not be good for our nation, and I know that the Government do not intend that it should happen.</p>

They go back to the factory where they turned the job down, where the manager says, &#147;I&#146;m sorry, the job&#146;s taken.&#148; They look over his shoulder and see people from other EU nations doing the job that they need to pay their mortgage and put bread on the table. It is not an ethnic issue or a skin colour issue&#151;there could be a white European in that job. One might say that that is the price we are paying for being members of the EU.</p>

The population has clearly increased from the turn of the century and, by definition, an increase in population means more people in work. Let me be helpful: unemployment has clearly decreased under the Labour Administration. However, today it is at a seven-year high. Let me give the Minister a specific example&#151;I know that he is keen on them. In Shropshire in the past 12 months, unemployment has risen by 36 per cent.

<p><a name="stpa_o341"><a name="61206-0017.htm_para17"><a name="06120664000060">I would like some reassurance from the Minister about what the transitional derogation means in detail. As I understand it, for the Bulgarians and Romanians who enter the United Kingdom next year, any transitional derogation will last for only two years. After that, it will go to the European Commission, and the Commission, not the Government will have a say. That worries me and I would be interested to hear the detail.</p>

However, I do not share the Government&#146;s position or, indeed, that of my Front Bench on Turkey acceding to the European Union&#151;for the time being. That is my get-out clause. It is not that I am unprepared to be principled and put my head above the parapet, but I believe that Turkey will not be able to do the things that it needs to do in the short, medium or long term. My position is therefore pragmatic as well as&#151;I hope&#151;principled.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o343"><a name="61206-0017.htm_para19"><a name="06120664000062">I am worried about Turkey because it has a poor record on human rights and it has not made enough progress on religious freedom. It also needs to make more progress on Cyprus, including the embargo on Cypriot ships, the green line, property such as Famagusta in the north of Cyprus and the wider issue of property ownership in the north of the island. It would be an opportune moment for Turkey to recognise the Armenian genocide. Its continuing reluctance to state clearly that the genocide took place and that it was exceedingly wrong is disappointing. Turkey could also reinstate diplomatic relations and normalise relations with Armenia. Again, it has not done that to date.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o344"><a name="61206-0017.htm_para20"><a name="06120664000065">A further point on Turkey relates to safeguarding our national culture. Our Government sometimes describe Turkey as a secular nation; at other times they describe it as a Muslim nation. We should try to encourage democracy in Turkey and to buttress, support and strengthen it. We should encourage the moderate voices in that nation. However, the British Government&#146;s view of Turkey, as expressed in their foreign policy, should not be driven by American foreign policy. Yes, I understand America&#146;s strategic geopolitical and defence position of wanting Turkey to be westward facing rather than eastward facing, but Turkey is already a member of the customs union, and it benefits greatly from its trading relationship with the European Union. Even if the EU decided not to allow it to become a full member, I do not think that  <br>

it would suddenly pull up the drawbridge and stop trading with other European nations. It would not cut off its nose to spite its face. Nor do I believe that it would turn eastwards towards the central Asian republics, because those republics are also looking westwards. Therefore, I believe that that is a false argument.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o345"><a name="61206-0017.htm_para21"><a name="06120664000066">We have heard today&#151;even from the Liberal Democrats&#151;about supporting an independent British foreign policy. The issue of Turkey represents an opportunity to assert British independence in foreign policy outside of American strategic geopolitical interests. Some elements of the Austrian position on Turkey are right, and many of the points that Germany has made are correct. Even the French have been right about some of their concerns over Turkish accession.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o346"><a name="61206-0017.htm_para22"><a name="06120664000067">Another key issue is the free movement of people, should Turkey become a full member. With 15,000 people having come from the Baltic states and Poland in the most recent accessions, how many would we see coming here from Turkey? Would it be 15,000, or half a million, or more? How would that change our nation? Would it change our culture or our identity? Thisis not a criticism or a slight on the Turkish people. I have Turkish people in my constituency&#151;they are wonderful people who are fully integrated into the Shropshire community in which I live. However, this is a matter of making our own national culture and identity&#151;and, arguably, in extreme circumstances, our national security&#151;paramount, and placing them above the interests even of those in the State Department in the United States.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o347"><a name="61206-0017.htm_para23"><a name="06120664000068">I also want to touch on the position of the Vatican, the Holy See, in relation to Turkey. His Holiness the Pope visited Turkey recently and it was claimed by some elements of the Turkish media&#151;and, indeed, the British media&#151;that he had changed his view about Turkey. It was declared that while he had previously not been keen on the idea of Turkey&#146;s accession, as a result of his visit he had endorsed proposals for its full membership. I understand, however, that that is not the position. I have checked this over the past 48 hours, and the position is that the Vatican is neutral on the matter. It is neither in support of nor against Turkey becoming a full member. It is important to put that on the record because some of the British media followed the Turkish media in getting that wrong. There is no endorsement from the Catholic Church&#151;I speak asa non-Catholic&#151;for Turkey joining the European Union.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o348"><a name="61206-0017.htm_para24"><a name="06120664000069">We have heard some excellent contributions today on the European constitutional treaty. I would be interested to hear what the Government&#146;s position is on this matter because I am still confused, especially after the Home Secretary&#146;s reference this week to the constitutional treaty as a &#147;diseased dead parrot&#148;. I am not sure whether that was a misquote. Perhaps it should have read &#147;a deceased dead parrot&#148;, if it was a reference to the &#147;Monty Python&#148; sketch. While the treaty might be dead&#151;I say &#147;might&#148;&#151;is it buried? As my hon. Friend the Member for Altrincham and Sale, West (Mr. Brady) said, there is talk of a mini treaty. However mini and compressed a new treaty might be, if issues of competency and sovereignty are involved the Government should allow this nation a referendum. It is time that we took powers back from Europe, rather than giving new powers to Europe.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o359"><a name="61206-0018.htm_para7"><a name="06120664000085">The notion that we might reform the EU into something that it is in our national interest to remain part of is a fantasy. It is, I believe, the greatest Euro-myth of all. The EU cannot reform, because its institutions lack the democratic accountability and scrutiny that would drive them to reform. We often debate European affairs in the House, and there is much talk of reform. There is much talk of enlargement, the Lisbon agenda, and qualified majority voting. It is so much hot air. It is time for the House to recognise what many in the country now recognise: the EU will not reform in the way that it should, regardless of enlargement. The Lisbon agenda will not be met. QMV will continue to make the continent sclerotic. When we debate European affairs we must debate the real issue: should we be in or out? I say we should be out.</p>

The point is that the constitution and issues around it are unresolved business; if we looked at the minutes of previous meetings, we would see that it is outstanding business. It should be brought forward. However, we seem still to be in a period of reflection. We have heard time and again in the Chamber about the growing economic competitiveness of India, China, Brazil and other countries, and yet we still seem to be in a state of reflection. The constitution issue is fundamental to how we will go forward. What is the purpose of the European Union? What is it actually for?

A lot of UK Eurosceptics could at least feel a little warmer about the concept of the EU if the waste of money aspect were addressed, and that would be simple to do. There is still the ridiculous situation of our having two Parliament buildings. We have a tentative idea that the Government are looking into that, but for how long do they need to do so? There are two Parliament buildings, and every time that all the MEPs&#151;along with the whole caboodle&#151;get on the gravy train and move from one side of Europe to another there is a complete waste of money.

First, he might recall that the origins of the EU are in the European Coal and Steel Community, an avowedly political project to prevent conflict between France and Germany at the end of the second world war. Secondly, the problem faced by all Governments who wish to address the issue of the buildings of the European Parliament was caused by the previous Conservative Government, who agreed that Strasbourg be a legally required site of the European Parliament. As to change that would require unanimity, I am less interested in the hon. Gentleman&#146;s rather casual observations than in how he proposes to persuade 24 other countries to end that situation&#151;including France, which happens to be one of those countries and where Strasbourg is located.</p>

There is no single overall co-ordinator with the authorisation to knock heads together and to move the reconstruction efforts forward.

I want the Government to confirm that they will commit themselves to NATO&#146;s long-term future and not allow an EU-style security force to grow in conjunction with it. The Minister for Europe might say that the two forces could work side by side, but I put it to him that that cannot happen. The EU security forces that are already in existence are double-hatting with NATO operations and overlapping them, thereby causing confusion within the military structures. That needs to change, and we need to recommit ourselves to what NATO is actually for.</p>

I proudly proclaim in this place and outside it, to any audience, that I am pro-European for that reason.

on the teasing of Turkey. There is no such word as &#147;never&#148; in politics, but Turkey will not be able to join the EU in the proposed time scale.

That situation is unfortunate, but we must be realistic about the fact that Turkey is a large country and has borders with the states to which I referred. I find it incredible that we should advance the candidacy of a country that actually occupies part of EU territory. That is a matter of legal fact, as northern Cyprus is the territory of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus, but also territory of the EU, so I find it inconceivable that we should be negotiating membership of a country whose occupation of another country still endures.</p>

Malta is currently enduring great problems as a result of mass migration from north Africa, with immigrants coming in particularly from sub-Saharan Africa. It is unfair that Malta has to cope with this growing and disproportionate influx of illegal immigration, and it is demonstrably a European problem that the Council of Ministers needs to deal with urgently. I hope that the Minister will announce a revisiting of the Dublin convention, as there needs to be a comprehensive discussion among European member states of how to share the burden of the illegal immigration that is unfairly hitting Malta.

We want to ensure that it works fairly towards British companies and that other companies, as my right hon.

Member for Stone (Mr. Cash), and I agree with him that the EU affects a vast amount of our constituents&#146; lives&#151;it certainly does&#151;and that EU policy on co-operation is being tested in a number of areas of the world, not least in Iraq, the middle east and Sudan, and we need to co-operate more closely with them on that. His amendment to the Legislative and Regulatory Reform Bill&#151;which, as he said, was supported by Conservative Front Benchers&#151;was an innovative solution to which, I am sure, we will wish to return.</p>

Members: &#147;She is.&#148;] Oh, she is. I am very sorry. She has moved seats, and I apologise to her. Of course, she did an excellent job on the convention last year. She mentioned the very important problems of Kosovo, which the hon. Member for Thurrock has just mentioned, and the possible implications for Russia of the independence movements in the Caucasus states. We all need to concentrate carefully on that very important issue.</p>

Members, and I want to say something about it this evening. I do not agree with her. When NATO secured the peace all through the cold war; when NATO played a major part in Kosovo and elsewhere in the Balkans to secure the peace; when we have been invited into Afghanistan, under a United Nations resolution, to try to secure peace, infrastructure building and democracy; and when some European countries are not prepared to play their full part&#151;even if they do play their fullpart, they do not do so with the flexibility of troops needed by the commanders on the ground&#151;I do not understand in those circumstances why we need a separate European Defence Agency. As has been mentioned, when most European countries spend less than, or about, 1 per cent. of the gross domestic product on defence, the problem is that they need to spend more on defence, so that we can share the burden of defence more equally than we do at present.</p>

Of course, like other hon. Members, he was very supportive of EU enlargement. The Conservative party is particularly keen on enlargement, and many Members have spoken either in favour of or against Turkish membership. I want to say one or two things about Turkish membership. Turkey is, of course, a very large country, with a population of about 80 million, which is set to grow towards 100 million in the near future, and we all recognise the immigration problems that that could create. We all recognise the problems that Turkey has with different religious and political minorities.</p>

Member for Luton, North (Kelvin Hopkins)&#151;I regret that I was not here when he made his speech&#151;said that regional PR led to risky euro-enthusiastic MEPs. That may well be the case, and it may well be that we do not like the PR system and the open list system for elections to the European Parliament and we wish that the European Parliament had better scrutiny of the Commission&#146;s affairs, but the European Parliament is nevertheless some form of democratically elected body.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o392"><a name="61206-0019.htm_para16"><a name="06120664000135">I totally agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Windsor (Adam Afriyie): we want the EU to be an open, trading non-bureaucratic body. We want it to succeed in world trade. As the Chancellor said today in his pre-Budget statement, we must look outwards to the rest of the world. We must look at what is going on in China and India and in the countries of the Association of South East Asian Nations. I attended the ASEAN gala dinner on Monday, and it is delightful to know that Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation is getting together in Vietnam&#151;Vietnam of all countries, one of the most suppressed countries in the world emerging on to the world stage. Those are the challenges that the EU must face.</p>

I have to say to him, in the gentlest and nicest terms&#151;he is a good chap&#151;that that is not official Opposition policy. We want to work within the EU. We want to see a reformed EU; but we do not wish to leave the EU. Let me tell him why. The EU has been amazing in embracing some of the most oppressed countries in the world&#151;some of the former Commonwealth of Independent States countries. The whole EU, including this country, has benefited from the enlargement of the membership of the EU. NATO has benefited from the increased membership of the Baltic states, Ukraine and others.</p>

We all have reservations about the European experiment. He talked about mission creep, and meddling and interfering. I have that fear about the new human rights body in Vienna. Human rights should be a matter that each individual state is proud to uphold and to have an excellent record on. We do not need an overarching body to tell us what to do in that respect.</p>

I have mentioned that. He also looked forward and considered what might have been in relation to the European constitution. With the advent of the French and the Dutch referendums, let us hope that the constitution is well and truly buried. I hope that, when the Minister for Europe sums up, he will tell us something about that. I entirely agree with my hon. Friend: we do not wish to see an external diplomatic service.

Friend the Member for Harwich (Mr. Carswell), in the sort of robust speech that he is renowned for, pointed to the fact that there are much higher tariff barriers for some African countries. That is a real worry. It is a real concern in terms of the failure of the WTO Doha round of trade talks. We all want to see progress on the Doha round. The Government could do more to press their friend the Trade Commissioner to make sure that we are not continually protecting agricultural subsidies and farmers who are not competing in the real world. I say that as a farmer myself&#151;I have declared that in the Register of Members&#146; Interests.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o397"><a name="61206-0019.htm_para21"><a name="06120664000140">It is shameful that the APEC countries that met in Vietnam last week said that they were prepared to break the deadlock on the WTO round provided that others did the same. The European Union could have done more. A successful Doha round, as my hon. Friend said, would be of enormous benefit to some of the poorest countries in the world. We should not shut them out from our markets. That is what is happening in far too many cases&#151;by means not just of tariff barriers, but of non-tariff barriers and a whole range of other bureaucratic mechanisms for keeping them out of our market.</p>

The EU has expanded from the original six members when we joined it in 1973, to nine as it was then, to27 now&#151;looking forward to 30 with the advent of Croatia, Montenegro and Turkey. It is a very different Union from the one that existed in the original days of the European Economic Community. We need to look for continual reform. We look for inspired leadership. When the Prime Minister came to office, he said that he would give us that inspired leadership as far as Europe is concerned. We are still waiting. We very much hope that, at next week&#146;s summit, he will show some of that inspired leadership and make sure that the European Union is pointed in the direction that we want to see it go in&#151;a full, open, non-bureaucratic, trading organisation that creates employment and wealth for its citizens.</p>

ensure that the EU is working for the people of Britain, and how we can play our part, with others, in steering the EU in the right direction. Above all, that flows from a recognition that the European Union is central to much of what we in this country want to achieve on a wide range of policies, including environmental protection, climate change, energy security and development. The Government are playing a leading role in the European Union to ensure that we can respond effectively to the political challenges of the 21st century.</p>

The Leader of the Opposition&#146;s rhetoric on the importance of tackling climate change is hopelessly inconsistent with his approach to Europe. Indeed, I am curious to know whether the hon. Member for Altrincham and Sale, West (Mr. Brady) could at any time enlighten us about his actual policy on Europe, or even tell us whether his party has a policy on Europe. It is a shame that the hon. Gentleman is not an English batsman because he is able to talk at great length without giving anything away. At no point during the course of his rather long speech did he reveal any aspect of what is positively his policy. Again, as far as I could detect, his policy appears to be something of splendid isolation. Perhaps we should reflect on the fact that one of his colleagues described him as a good negotiator, although there was no evidence that he wanted to discuss anything. As far as I could detect from his speech, Conservative party policy on Europe is &#147;just say no&#148;.</p>

Friend the Foreign Secretary and me with such obvious interest and enthusiasm. With the Christmas recess coming up, I am sure that we can offer him some entertainment as he wiles away the hours between debates on Europe.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o407"><a name="61206-0020.htm_para1"><a name="06120664000151">My hon. Friend the Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, North (Mr. Henderson) asked several detailed questions about climate change. If he will allow me, I will write to him with detailed responses. However, as I made it clear in my observations about the Leader of the Opposition, if the right hon. Member for Witney (Mr. Cameron) genuinely believes in tackling environmental problems, he must genuinely believe in engagement with the European Union, because it is only through the European Union that it will be possible for this country, working in partnership with other European countries, to develop energy policies that are in line with climate change objectives. His position simply does not make sense. No one would believe a political party that pretended that it was somehow possible to tackle such problems in splendid isolation.</p>

<p><a name="st_o349"><a name="06120664000152"><a name="61206-0020.htm_spnew0"><a name="06120664000288"><b>Mr. Brady:</b> I am sorry to interrupt the Minister on his birthday, and I hope that he enjoys the rest of the evening more than he enjoyed this afternoon. We have been very clear: we have no difficulty engaging with our EU partners to tackle climate change, and I referred to that in our opening speech. We are also clear aboutthe fact that we do not need additional EU competences to do that. He agreed with me on that point on 26 October when I challenged him on the subject, and the Foreign Secretary agreed with me on the subject yesterday in Foreign Office questions.</p>

<p><a name="st_o350"><a name="06120664000153"><a name="61206-0020.htm_spnew1"><a name="06120664000289"><b>Mr. Hoon:</b> The point that the hon. Gentleman misses about his approach is that in any international organisation such as the European Union it is simply not possible to pick and choose, although he pretends that it is. It is necessary to be engaged, to debate and discuss, and to argue one&#146;s cause. That does not mean always saying no on a range of issues, but that is the impression that he gives. I have listened to him on a number of occasions, and he speaks well, effectively and at length, but he does not say anything about the Conservative party&#146;s policy; I would be delighted to hear what it is.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o408"><a name="61206-0020.htm_para2"><a name="06120664000154">Several other Conservative Members contributed to the debate. I apologise to the hon. Member for Stone (Mr. Cash) because I was not in the Chamber during his speech, but I suspect that I have heard it many times before. I am sure that he spoke with his customary style and enthusiasm on the issue of Europe. My hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Edgbaston(Ms Stuart) asked when Kosovo would join the European Union. She is right to emphasise that there is a clear European perspective on the Balkan region, including both Kosovo and Serbia. Their European position will be a key factor in ensuring their economic development and, indeed, their shorter-term stability. Obviously, it is important to wait for the conclusion of the UN-led process to determine Kosovo&#146;s final status, and we cannot speculate at this stage on its prospects for membership of the European Union, but the western Balkans are a vital part of Europe and it is important that that ambition remains open to countries in the region.</p>

He emphasised the importance of the relationship with the European Union, mentioning countries such as Ukraine, Moldova and Belarus. I hope that he accepts that one of the EU&#146;s singular achievements during the period of enlargement has been to offer a focus, goal and ambition for countries that were formerly part of the Warsaw pact&#151;and, in some cases, formerly part of the Soviet Union. Without that focus and ambition, they could easily have drifted away from democracy, the rule of law and free markets. I am sure that we will all celebrate that singular achievement of the EU next March.</p>

If they will forgive me, I shall not go through each of their speeches in detail, although I listened to each and every one of them. It is an interesting characteristic that, with the singular exception of the hon. Member for Shipley (Philip Davies), they avoided saying what they believed. They criticised the European Union without saying what they would put in its place, or indicating which other countries in the European Union might share their view. At least the hon.

In any negotiation&#151;I have negotiated throughout my career, both as a lawyer and as a politician&#151;it is necessary to accept certain parts of the subject on which one is negotiating. If one does not do so, one is not negotiating&#151;one is simply sitting in a corner, isolated, with no one taking any notice. That is pretty much what the previous Government did, and that is why they failed to deliver for Britain&#151;something with which the hon. Member for Stone used to agree.</p>

It is vital, in trying to negotiate in the UK&#146;s best interests, that we accept certain aspects of the EU. I hope that he agrees that since those days in the early 1990s, to which the hon. Member for Stone referred, the Conservative party has undergone an incredible transformation. If today&#146;s debate is anything to go by, and if the Conservative Back Benchers who spoke represent their party&#146;s views, I sympathise with the Front-Bench team because they are in splendid isolation.

I also thank the Minister, whom I am delighted to see. Having been in her shoes as a planning Minister in the past, I realise that there is little that she can say on the specific points that I shall raise, because after the inquiry, which is about to start, the draft plan will move to her desk or that of one of her colleagues. However, the debate is an opportunity to present some of the points that she can bear in mind when the time comes and perhaps even put to the inspector.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o419"><a name="61206-0020.htm_para13"><a name="06120664000178">As I am sure the Minister knows, Surrey county council is a Conservative council. It is a good performing council in many respects, but it has spectacularly failed to cover itself in glory on one aspect of this matter. Some time back, Surrey entered into a private finance initiative agreement with an organisation called Surrey Waste Management, a derivative of SITA. The contract has a number of interesting points, but there are two that I shall mention.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o420"><a name="61206-0020.htm_para14"><a name="06120664000179">First, I find it intriguing that the waste management contract contains a requirement for two incinerator sites. That is written in black and white. I find this extraordinary because it immediately inhibits the flexibility of either side to react to changing circumstances. I have in mind the recent success of Surrey district councils in increasing recycling, thereby reducing demand. I foresee the ghastly possibility of Surrey having two huge incinerators without the sources of waste to fill them, and the company looking for waste from elsewhere to be trucked in.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o421"><a name="61206-0020.htm_para15"><a name="06120664000180">Secondly, it is of some concern to me that in the contract the costs related to any application by the contractor to build an incinerator or two are to be borne by the local authority, rather than by the contractor. I have a little bit of experience of local government and contracts with the private sector, and that seems to me a weeny bit strange, to put it mildly. To my mind, it instantly means that the council has an incentive to look for an easy and cheap route for progressing any application. As the Minister will be aware, in situations where a local authority is in effect the applicant, or has a particular interest in the progress of an application, there must be a so-called glass wall between the planning department and the rest of the council, particularly the service department. On reading an interview with Surrey&#146;s head of planning in a recent edition of <i> Planning</i>, I was disturbed to find that the glass wall seems to have cracked or even crumbled.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o422"><a name="61206-0020.htm_para16"><a name="06120664000181">Surrey county council&#146;s first attempt at a waste plan was to insist on the contractor coming forward with suitable sites, instead of the council naming them. Clearly, though&#151;the council did not seem to understand this&#151;if one leaves the decision on sites to a private contractor, the economic issues tend to predominate. Two sites were proposed where proprietary access was simple. One of them was a little place called Capel in my constituency. At the time, I put it to the chief executive  <br>


<meta name="Date" content="6 Dec 2006">

<notus-date day="6" month="12" year="2006" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><b>6 Dec 2006 : Column 414</b><br>
of the Environment Agency, Lady Young, who was appearing before the Select Committee on Communities and Local Government, that the Capel site had been chosen for economic expediency, rather than taking into account environmental issues. She agreed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o423"><a name="61206-0020.htm_para17"><a name="06120664000182">The application for an incinerator at Capel was approved&#151;just. A furious but knowledgeable local group took the decision to judicial review. In November 2002, Mr. Justice Sullivan, who is very well versed in planning, quashed the application. In doing so, it would not be unfair to say that he was fairly damning of the council and its approach. One of the key decisions from the judicial review was that the application for an incinerator was premature. The council was directed to go back to the drawing board and to come forward with a new plan that actually named sites. It went through that procedure and came up with several sites, including Capel. All bar Capel were in the green belt, but many were already used in some way for waste. The council chose to put Capel at the head of its list merely because it is not in the green belt, ignoring the fact that it is right alongside an area of outstanding natural beauty. Other key issues, particularly that of proximity, appear to have been ignored. I found that surprising, because in quashing the previous application the court found that the council had erred in its failure to apply that principle. At a recent public meeting, the executive member responsible was questioned on the proximity principle. He brushed it to one side and said that it no longer applied because European Union legislation had superseded it. In fact, as the Minister will know, it has been strengthened by the EU regulation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o424"><a name="61206-0020.htm_para18"><a name="06120664000183">I do not expect the Minister to know much of Surrey. The western and northern portions are urban&#151;Spelthorne, Guildford and Woking run down the western side. The eastern side, particularly the south-eastern side, is very rural, with farmers making livings and belonging to the National Farmers Union. The most eastern and southerly point includes Capel. Bearing in mind the proximity principle, one would have expected Surrey county council to have found sites in the west, but in its wisdom its prime site was as far away as possible from the source of the waste produced in Surrey, while still being just within Surrey. If one asks why, one must conclude that there are some attractions to choosing that site from the council&#146;s point of view, especially if one is an executive member in a hurry to get an incinerator through the planning procedure, get it built and into action.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o425"><a name="61206-0020.htm_para19"><a name="06120664000184">The site is owned either by Surrey or SITA, the contractor. It is rural and fairly sparsely populated, hence the protests. The site is not in the green belt, especially if one ignores the adjacent area of outstanding natural beauty and the nearby site of special scientific interest. I believe that Surrey has again chosen, through its executive member, to accept commercial expediency over the environmental issues.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o426"><a name="61206-0020.htm_para20"><a name="06120664000185">The site is licensed for landfill. It was originally used for mining clay for bricks. Planning permission was given for the mining hole to be used for waste filling, but the site had to be restored to agricultural land by December 2004. There was a recent application by the contractor to extend that to 2008. Surrey county council&#146;s planning committee rejected that but took no enforcement action.</p>

<b>6 Dec 2006 : Column 415</b><br>

<p><a name="stpa_o427"><a name="61206-0021.htm_para0"><a name="06120664000186">It is even more interesting to note that Surrey county council has accepted a landscape impact report, which included examining the site some seven years ago. The report said that the site should never be considered for waste in the future. The council revalidated the same report earlier this year.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o428"><a name="61206-0021.htm_para1"><a name="06120664000187">In quashing the original application, Mr. Justice Sullivan made it clear that the court accepted that the council had erroneously treated the site as land with an existing waste use for the purposes of the plan. He confirmed that the council should have considered the site as greenfield. It appears to have ignored that. The quashed application was based on using Guildford as a collection site and trucking the waste to an incinerator at Capel. The vehicles that would have to be utilised to carry the waste would be large, for economic reasons, and it was estimated that some 80 vehicles would make the return trip from Guildford to Capel daily. There are two possible routes. One is through some fabulous villages with tiny streets. That route was finally rejected for the longer route of the A3, M25 and A24. Eighty trucks a day were to make that journey of approximately 60 miles there and back. The added difficulty, which was ignored, was that, as one approaches the Capel site, the A24 is a small, narrow, windy single carriageway with an appalling accident history. The addition of 160 truck movements daily would mean that sense had gone out of the window. One wonders whether the council has ever heard of the proximity principle.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o429"><a name="61206-0021.htm_para2"><a name="06120664000188">Let me consider the adverse effect on the ecology of the site. It is near Vann lake and Ockley woods, which are an SSSI. The actual site is a geological SSSI. Added to that, there are&#151;bless them&#151;great crested newts. Lack of time means that I must restrict the detail, but I must mention one specific matter, which is especially unusual.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o430"><a name="61206-0021.htm_para3"><a name="06120664000189">The Capel site is unique in that it is directly in the flight path of planes flying into Gatwick airport from a westward direction. The planes must pass a beacon on the Capel site at an altitude of 1,500 ft. Recent research from NASA has shown that aircraft of the size that fly into Gatwick flying over the chimney that would be required for dispersing the fumes of an incinerator would cause a downward draught that would drive all the fumes downwards. I have a video from NASA that I could lend or give to the Minister to show the effect. It is a dramatic video. At busy times, one plane lands or takes off from Gatwick every two to three minutes. The chimney plume would not work.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o431"><a name="61206-0021.htm_para4"><a name="06120664000190">If we consider other environmental issues, I cannot understand from my background in local government and in planning as a Minister responsible for planning why on earth Surrey county council has picked the site. In choosing it as the primary site, it has ignored the proximity principle, its own decisions about the restoration of the site, the consequences of the flight path at Gatwick airport, the surrounding landscape, the SSSIs, the AONB and the various environmental issues, including the newts. It is also now quite apparent that it has ignored the effect of the waste production, and the Government&#146;s PPS on rural development. It has ignored the access problems relating to the road network close to the site and the issues that were specifically expressed when the original application was quashed.</p>

Smith):</b> I congratulate the hon. Member for Mole Valley(Sir Paul Beresford) on his success in securing this debate on the draft Surrey waste plan. It is obviously an issue about which he feels passionately. I also thank him for giving me an idea of some of the issues that he was going to raise. As a former planning Minister, he will be familiar with ministerial proprieties in relation to what we now call spatial planning matters. An independent planning inspector will be conducting the public examination into the Surrey waste plan, which will begin in February next year. If I were to comment on the merits of the plan and the proposals that it contains, there would be a risk that I would prejudice the outcome of that examination. The hon. Gentleman will therefore understand that I can talk about the waste plan in only the most general terms.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o433"><a name="61206-0021.htm_para6"><a name="06120664000193">I would like to begin by providing some context on waste management and waste planning. It is widely acknowledged that waste management is an issue of national importance, and there is a pressing need for new waste management facilities to be provided throughout the country. The Government&#146;s visionfor waste, embodying the principle of sustainable development, is to protect the environment and human health by producing less waste and by using it as a resource wherever possible. In particular, this means reducing reliance on landfill and making significant new investment in waste management facilities. Theoretically, the Government would prefer it if no waste at all were produced. Where it is produced, it should be re-used, recycled or composted wherever possible. However, we know that there is a need to manage what is left after recycling and composting, and our view is that energy from waste has an increasingly significant role in diverting waste away from landfill. In doing that, there are potential benefits to be exploited in terms of the security of energy supply, climate change, and our national obligations under the landfill directive, as well as for sustainable development generally.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o434"><a name="61206-0021.htm_para7"><a name="06120664000194">The planning system is pivotal to the adequate and timely provision of the new facilities needed for all types of waste. Planning policy statement 10, published in July last year, underlines the importance of planning for, and consenting to, the necessary number and range of facilities to support sustainable waste management. The Government expect development plans to be up to date and fit for purpose.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o435"><a name="61206-0021.htm_para8"><a name="06120664000195">I should now like to widen the scope of the debate and say a few words about our reformed planning system, which will help to deliver the mix of development that communities need, in the right place, at the right time and in a faster, fairer and more flexible way. I hope that that will address some of the hon. Gentleman&#146;s concerns. Our reforms are designed to improve the integration between planning for housing,  <br>

services and other infrastructure, including waste management. That is not an easy challenge to meet, and it places a great responsibility on regional and local planning bodies. We know that it involves taking difficult decisions, so we are asking local councils and their officers to show real leadership, backed up with the best support that the Government can offer.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o436"><a name="61206-0021.htm_para9"><a name="06120664000196">Collectively, our challenge is to bring the community on side. The community needs accurate information about the process in order to learn about the choices available and their implications. It is essential that members of the community are fully involved in the planning process, so that they understand that it is not possible to dump all their waste on someone else&#146;s doorstep. It is obvious that every human, every home and every business creates waste&#151;indeed, almost every human activity creates waste. We just sometimes try to forget about it. The Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004 introduced major legislative changes to the planning system, which we have underpinned with a programme of changing planning culture. We have made the planning system faster, fairer and more flexible.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o437"><a name="61206-0021.htm_para10"><a name="06120664000197">In the past&#151;and too often in the present&#151;industry has complained that it is difficult to get planning permission and that the process takes too long. On the other hand, local communities and environmental non-governmental organisations feel that ill-considered proposals are railroaded through the system. Local planning authorities are often caught in the middle. In my experience, businesses often do not understand the local authority planning process and, likewise, local authorities do not always understand the pressures on business. Greater understanding between the two can smooth the entire process.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o438"><a name="61206-0021.htm_para11"><a name="06120664000198">The 2004 Act puts a much stronger emphasis on both the need for speed and the quality of decision making, while emphasising the importance of community consultation and involvement. The hon. Gentleman will know all about the duty to draw up statements of community involvement as part of local development frameworks, which makes sense. With often controversial waste schemes, it is critical that the public do not just object as a matter of principle. Planning authorities must engage and take the community with them as they assess the need for new facilities, identify suitable sites, scrutinise the environmental impacts and ensure open and transparent decision making. Experience has shown that that is a proven way of making faster and better decisions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o439"><a name="61206-0021.htm_para12"><a name="06120664000199">That is the bigger picture that supports PPS10. As PPS10 says, positive planning has an important role to play in delivering a more sustainable approach. It confirms our belief, and enshrines in policy, that good planning strategies, regionally and locally, can help deliver sustainable waste management. Rather than seeing waste as a problem, we need to try to see waste as a resource. Disposal must be the last option, but one which must be catered for adequately.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o440"><a name="61206-0021.htm_para13"><a name="06120664000200">Good plans should provide a framework in which communities take more responsibility for their own waste, and enable sufficient and timely provision of waste management facilities to meet the needs of communities.

in PPS10 by integrating waste management alongside other planning concerns, including housing. We need clear regional strategies and local development frameworks, which provide for waste management and ensure that the design and layout of new development takes waste management into account.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o441"><a name="61206-0021.htm_para14"><a name="06120664000201">On the whole, planning applications for waste proposals are determined favourably: the approval rate approaches 90 per cent., which is higher than that for housing. The system is not working as smoothly as it should, however, and decisions are too often taken in a heated, adversarial climate. The end result is that we are still not getting enough waste facilities on the ground. There is a great need for local authorities to engage more with their communities earlier in the development plan process.</p>

Smith:</b> The point about communities considering how to deal with their own waste is an important one. Of course, transporting waste increases its environmental impact. Obviously, every county council will have to make plans on the basis of what suits its area best. It is important to engage local people on all those matters, including environmental and transport issues.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o442"><a name="61206-0021.htm_para15"><a name="06120664000204">As the hon. Gentleman said, Surrey county council&#151;although he disagrees with its conclusions&#151;has been busy preparing its draft waste plan under the new local development framework system, which includes specific site allocations. The plan was formally submitted to the Secretary of State in June, and will be one of the first waste development plan documents to be examined under the new system.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o443"><a name="61206-0021.htm_para16"><a name="06120664000205">I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for indicating in advance which issues he wished to raise this evening. As we have heard, Surrey county council has included a proposal within its plan for an energy-from-waste plant at a site known as the Clockhouse Brickworks in Capel near Dorking, which is in his constituency. The waste plan explains that because the site is on the southern fringe of Surrey&#151;as he said&#151;and therefore away from the main centres of population, the plant may be expected to be of relatively small capacity. Fromhis comments, I do not think that that is his understanding. I can therefore well understand that he and his constituents have genuine concerns about the proposal. We all produce waste, but dealing with it is unpopular. The planning system must therefore help us to balance those difficult, competing interests.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o444"><a name="61206-0021.htm_para17"><a name="06120664000206">In this case, the planning inspector will preside over the Surrey public examination, listen to and read the arguments for and against the proposal and come to a judgment, which will be binding on Surrey county council. That point requires some clarification. Under our system of local development frameworks, the purpose of the examination is not to debate the particular merits of individual policies or proposals but to determine whether the plan is sound&#151;whether it has a robust basis, in terms of its content and the process by which it has been produced. It must also be founded on robust, credible evidence with an appropriate level  <br>

of community involvement. It will be assumed that a local authority&#146;s plan is sound unless it is shown to be otherwise as a result of evidence considered at the examination.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o445"><a name="61206-0021.htm_para18"><a name="06120664000207">I understand that the hon. Gentleman did not make any representations on the Surrey waste plan during the two formal six-week consultation periods. That is unfortunate. The last consultation period closed on18 August, and it is now too late to submit comments for consideration at the examination. The hon. Gentleman may still wish to make his feelings known, but unfortunately there is every chance that the county council and the inspector will rule them inadmissible. I cannot intervene in the process, because it is possible that I would end up in court if I tried to do so. Clearly the hon. Gentleman has nothing to lose from airing his views, but let me suggest two possible alternatives to writing what could prove to be an abortive letter.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o446"><a name="61206-0021.htm_para19"><a name="06120664000208">The inspector can request the attendance at the examination of any person or organisation he considers to be needed to enable the soundness of the plan to be determined. That applies whether or not the person or  <br>

organisation has previously made representations on the plan. The hon. Gentleman could write to the inspector to ask whether his presence at the examination could help the inspector to reach a decision. Alternatively, he could approach a person or organisation whose views are aligned with his own&#151;I am sure he knows of such people or organisations in his constituency&#151;and offer to speak on behalf of that party at the examination, if comments have been submitted at an earlier stage.</p>
