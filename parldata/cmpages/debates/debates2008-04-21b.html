physically out of circulation when that is possible, in the end the only way to resolve and drive against the problem of guns in our inner cities is by changing hearts and minds and the culture that says that the gun is acceptable. That means working with young people and finding them beneficial activities that they want to do and that the rest of society wants them to be involved in.</p>

 I met my hon. Friend and representatives of community organisations and the police in his constituency, and that demonstrated to me what a difference can be made on the issue when the community stands by the police. When I visited his constituency, I was particularly pleased to see the work done by local police officers in Plymouth Grove primary school, for example. They were getting in early, alongside teachers, and not only talking to children and young people about the dangers of guns, but giving them the strength to resist some of the pressures, from their peers and others, that might well have led them into trouble later in life. I wholeheartedly agree with my hon. Friend. What he has mentioned has been an important part of the programme.</p>

 The day of action is part of an ongoing programme of work in which police forces, particularly in areas that face the most gun crime, are involved all the time.

gun crime in inner cities and elsewhere. Does the Home Secretary agree that it is not about &#163;1.5 million-worth of one-day actions collecting 10 guns, or about working with children in schools, both of which are perfectly legitimate things, and that the only thing that the little neds who carry guns illegally will understand is tough sentencing?

It is of such a scale that the Scottish Government have organised a gun summit that will be attended by the police, gun control campaigners and shooting groups&#151;everybody other than herself and Home Office Ministers. Surely she could take a couple of hours out of her diary to come to the summit to explain what the UK Government are going to do about the issue, because if she does not, the impression will be that she could not care less about it and is prepared to do absolutely nothing.</p>

 It is a shame that the hon. Gentleman&#146;s party is using the very good initiative of the summit and a whole range of actions to make cheap party political points. I have discussed gun control with his colleagues in the Scottish Executive, and I discussed the issue of airguns. They, like me, will therefore be pleased that the Violent Crime Reduction Act 2006 ensures that it is now necessary to have a licence to sell an air weapon and has increased to 18 the age limit for acquiring or possessing an air weapon. It is probably better if we work together to implement that legislation and to review what more we need to do, instead of making cheap political points that have more to do with the campaign for independence than with a campaign against gun crime.</p>

 Security is of course an important issue. The National Policing Improvement Agency, which is responsible as the custodian of the DNA database, is also responsible for other key national databases and has a good track record. My right hon. Friend mentions replication, which is currently at 13.3 per cent. but going down. That is partly because in the early days of new DNA testing, police forces took extra samples to meet higher evidential standards. Much work has gone on to educate police forces in taking DNA samples, so that replication is being reduced. However, that does not adversely affect any of the individuals involved.</p>

 I am grateful to the Minister for that answer, but is he aware that the Bill gives the Home Secretary fundamental powers to overhaul the coroners system completely? For example, the Home Secretary will have the power to appoint the coroner, and to issue a certificate requiring an inquest to be held without a jury. Is today&#146;s terrorist threat so different from what we faced under the IRA that it is vital in the minds of the Home Secretary and the Minister to tear up hundreds of years of judicial procedure? Is that really necessary? Surely the Government should wait until a coroners Bill is before the House so that the matter can be properly discussed and debated.</p>

 Yes, I can. Indeed, the powers that the UK Border Agency takes under the UK Borders Act 2007 will also provide for stiffer sanctions. However, we have said consistently that we should prioritise the removal of those who have abused our welcome and broken our laws. I am therefore pleased that the UK Border Agency deported 80 per cent. more foreign national prisoners last year. The new agency this year will set tougher targets and we expect it to deport more than 5,000 foreign national prisoners. That is a different order of magnitude from a couple of years ago.</p>

 The growth in passenger numbers between 2005 and 2007 was about 5 and a bit per cent. Over the same period, the number of immigration officers increased by about 33 per cent.

That policy has been the fruit of new partnerships with the police up and down the country; almost all constabularies have immigration crime partnerships in place and one of the most fundamental objectives is to ensure that everyone detected at a lorry drop who we think is an illegal immigrant is arrested and brought to detention centres.</p>

 We take seriously the fear of crime wherever it occurs and we are taking steps to reduce crime and the fear of crime. According to the 2006-07 British crime survey, younger people have the highest levels of worry about violence and car crime and are more likely than older people to be victims of crime. Older people are less likely to be victims of crime than other age groups. However, their fear of crime is disproportionately high when compared with their low risk of being a victim.</p>

 The British crime survey for 2007 records overall crime falling by 32 per cent. since 1997 and 5.5 million fewer victims than in 1995, yet fear of crime continues to paralyse too many lives, both old and young alike. What discussions has the Minister had with the Youth Justice Board and Department for Communities and Local Government colleagues about Age Concern recommendations to have regular intergenerational meetings in all communities so that young and old alike can discuss their fears and counter the destabilising threat of age-related segregation?</p>

 I know that my hon. Friend works closely with Age Concern in his constituency, and as a former magistrate he knows the importance of different generations working together. At a recent conference, we discussed the issue of intergenerational liaison to enable elderly and younger people to discuss fear of crime. It is often said that there is a difference between older and younger people. There might be such a difference in perception, but it is in everybody&#146;s interest&#151;whether they are old, middle-aged or young&#151;to reduce crime and the fear of crime.</p>

 The understandable fear of crime felt by my rural constituents of all ages is partly based on their awareness of the fact that national police targets are forced on local chief constables, and in their circumstances that means the concentration on urban crime leaving too many isolated rural communities at the mercy of travelling intimidating thieves. How long will it be before local chief constables get more scope to decide their own priorities, rather than following those of the Home Office?</p>

 I think that the hon. Gentleman would accept that all levels of crime in all areas of the country have fallen dramatically over the last 10 years, and he should also accept that with the new police assessment framework we have ensured greater scope for local chief constables to determine their priorities. One of the best ways to ensure that local people get the policing they want is the roll-out of neighbourhood policing, which was completed on 1 April.</p>

Importantly, those teams can respond and act differently, depending on the priorities and circumstances of local areas.

<p><a name="st_o100"><a name="0804216000159"><a name="80421-0004.htm_spmin1"><a name="0804216000604"><b>The Chancellor of the Exchequer (Mr. Alistair Darling):</b>
 With your permission, Mr. Speaker, I would like to make a statement about this morning&#146;s announcement by the Bank of England to improve conditions in the financial markets. This scheme has been developed following extensive discussions with the Treasury and the Financial Services Authority. I also want to report on the recent G7 meeting in Washington on restoring financial stability to financial markets. I will also report on the measures that we are taking here at home to strengthen the stability of the banking system, as well as to help home owners with their mortgages.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o15"><a name="80421-0004.htm_para1"><a name="0804216000160">Before I set out in further detail the Bank of England&#146;s special scheme, let me remind the House of the background against which it has been developed. The financial markets throughout the world remain turbulent, following the problems that arose in the US housing market last year. Functioning financial markets rely on banks and building societies being able to raise finance from each other, and from other investors, including through securitisation markets and through inter-bank lending markets. These funds can then be used to finance lending to businesses and to consumers, including the provision of mortgages.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o16"><a name="80421-0004.htm_para2"><a name="0804216000161">However, global financial markets are currently not functioning normally. Across the world, there is a lack of confidence in credit markets, most notably in mortgage-backed securities. That lack of confidence was prompted by the downturn in the US housing market, and in particular by the problems associated with sub-prime mortgages there. Banks are reluctant to lend to each other, and as a result lending to customers is more expensive and more restricted.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o17"><a name="80421-0004.htm_para3"><a name="0804216000162">Along with other central banks, the Bank of England has, over the past few months, made additional funding available to the markets through its regular market operations. The UK financial system remains fundamentally strong, and the Bank of England&#146;s action has helped to take some of the pressure out of the system by giving banks additional liquidity to continue their usual banking operations. Indeed, last week the Bank of England made a further &#163;15 billion available, over three months, as part of its open market operations, and the Governor has said that he is committed to providing the liquidity assistance that the system as a whole needs to enable it to function normally.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o18"><a name="80421-0004.htm_para4"><a name="0804216000163">Here at home, the economy continues to grow. Last week&#146;s figures confirm that unemployment remains low and employment high. That, and the recent interest rate cuts, will provide wider support for the housing market and the wider economy. As banks here and across the world disclose their losses and strengthen their financial positions, which will help to rebuild confidence, the Bank of England can now take action to ease conditions in the financial markets, particularly in relation to mortgage-backed securities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o19"><a name="80421-0004.htm_para5"><a name="0804216000164">The special scheme announced today by the Bank of England is a further step towards tackling the problems that have become more evident in recent weeks with the increasing cost and decreasing availability of lending by banks and building societies. Under the new scheme,  <br>


<meta name="Date" content="21 Apr 2008">

<notus-date day="21" month="4" year="2008" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><b>21 Apr 2008 : Column 1050</b><br>
for a six-month period the banks and building societies, and other institutions that are eligible for the Bank&#146;s standing facility, will be able to enter into agreements with the Bank of England under which they exchange high-quality asset-backed securities for Treasury bills. They can then hold these bills or trade them in the markets. Each exchange agreement will be for a maximum of a year but can be renewed at the Bank&#146;s discretion, so that the exchange could be ultimately for up to three years. The arrangement is available only for assets existing at the end of December last year and does not apply to new lending since then.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o20"><a name="80421-0004.htm_para6"><a name="0804216000165">At the end of the scheme, the banks will return the Treasury bills to the Bank of England and will receive back the securities that they provided as collateral. This means that the banks will continue to hold the risk on the securities that they provide, so it is they, rather than the Bank of England, that will be exposed to any fall in value. At all times, the banks must provide as security to the Bank of England assets worth significantly more than the Treasury bills they receive in return. If the value of their assets falls, the banks must provide more assets to the Bank of England or return some of their Treasury bills. They will be charged a commercial rate, so there is no subsidy to the banking sector.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o21"><a name="80421-0004.htm_para7"><a name="0804216000166">The Bank of England expects the initial take-up to be &#163;50 billion. It will monitor the position daily, both to check new bids from banks and to track the value of the assets exchanged as collateral. The Treasury is supporting the scheme announced by the Bank of England by lending to it&#151;at a commercial rate&#151;the Treasury bills which it will then exchange with the banks and building societies. As the House will know, the Government stand behind the Bank as its sole shareholder, and we are making this clear by providing an indemnity. The Bank of England believes that these measures will support the banking sector during the present period of uncertainty and will help to restore the stability that the financial markets need both now and in the longer term. This will help to alleviate the problems that have seen banks reluctant to lend to each other, and, in turn, support the provision of new mortgage lending.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o22"><a name="80421-0004.htm_para8"><a name="0804216000167">Maintaining economic and financial stability is a key objective. In addition to the Bank of England&#146;s announcement, I can confirm to the House that the Government will take further action at home, and internationally, to restore stability in financial markets. It is important that banks continue to make full disclosure of their exposure to losses, and that they do so as soon as possible. That is why, at the G7 and International Monetary Fund committee meetings in Washington, we agreed that banks should be as open as possible&#151;as quickly as possible&#151;in order to remove the continuing uncertainty as to their true positions. This process has started throughout the world, including here in Britain, with banks disclosing their losses and making proposals to rebuild their capital position.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o23"><a name="80421-0004.htm_para9"><a name="0804216000168">Transparency is an essential part, along with other steps that we are taking, of stabilising financial markets. In Washington last week, the Financial Stability Forum agreed a range of actions&#151;some to be implemented in the next three months, and others for the longer term. We agreed to strengthen the oversight of risk management, including capital and liquidity,  <br>

clearer standards for valuation and transparency, and changes in the role and use of credit ratings. We will strengthen international co-operation so that we are better able to prevent crises and deal with problems that occur. We are also working with the IMF to allow it to play a greater role in providing early warning of the threats to financial stability, so that the relevant authorities can take early action to prevent these actions in the future.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o24"><a name="80421-0004.htm_para10"><a name="0804216000169">Here at home, we are about to finish consulting on the reforms to the banking system that I announced in January. These reforms will make it easier to intervene in the event that a bank gets into trouble, in order to protect depositors and maintain the stability of the financial system. Because it is important that we get this right, I will continue to hold discussions with the industry on the detail of these proposals before bringing forward legislation. We will also want to make changes to the Bank of England to emphasise its role in maintaining financial stability.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o25"><a name="80421-0004.htm_para11"><a name="0804216000170">The responses that we have received so far to the consultation have made it clear that, given the importance of these reforms, it is crucial that we have further discussions. Once those are completed, I can confirm that it is our intention to introduce legislation this Session to strengthen financial stability and depositor protection. The legislation needs to be on the statute book early next year, when some of the provisions of the Banking (Special Provisions) Act 2008, which we passed in February, are due to expire.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o26"><a name="80421-0004.htm_para12"><a name="0804216000171">Finally, we are determined to do everything that we can to help home owners, so I am meeting the Council of Mortgage Lenders, the Finance and Leasing Association and major lenders tomorrow, along with the Chief Secretary to the Treasury and the Minister for Housing. Since 2004, mortgage lenders have been required by statute to treat their customers fairly, and at our meeting I will be discussing how banks and building societies can help people whose fixed-rate mortgages are coming to an end, as well as helping people who may get into difficulties in repaying their mortgages. Banks and building societies have a duty to treat their customers fairly and, in the light of everything we are doing, I want to discuss how they can pass on the benefits of falling interest rates as well as wider Government support to mortgage holders.</p>

The announcement by the Bank of England this morning will help to resolve problems in the wholesale financial markets, which have a subsequent impact on the retail markets, and so help businesses, individuals and, in particular, the mortgage market. I commend this statement to the House.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o28"><a name="80421-0004.htm_para14"><a name="0804216000174">It is nine months since the credit crunch began. We know from the recent International Monetary Fund report, to which the Chancellor referred, that Britain has been left more exposed than any other European country: it has the highest Government borrowing in the developed world and the highest personal debt on record. Of course we welcome any international moves to improve stability. Such moves should include reforms to the Basel accords. Surely it is time to look at counter-cyclical capital rules, so that we try to avoid this boom and bust in debt and asset prices in future.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o29"><a name="80421-0004.htm_para15"><a name="0804216000175">I know that the Prime Minister was with the Kennedy clan last week. Perhaps he should borrow a phrase from President Kennedy: next time, let us fix the roof &#147;when the sun is shining.&#148; In the meantime, the Bank of England has to pick up the pieces. I broadly welcome the liquidities scheme that it announced this morning. <i> [Interruption.]</i> Indeed, we were recently calling for it. The difference between a well-judged intervention and a bail-out lies in the details and in the protection offered to the taxpayer.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o30"><a name="80421-0004.htm_para16"><a name="0804216000176">Will the Chancellor, on the record today, give us his personal promise that as the man entrusted with the nation&#146;s finances, he believes that the guarantees are such that there will be no loss to the taxpayer? Would not the risk to the taxpayer be reduced still further if the Government had not agreed to indemnify securities backed by credit card debt as well as those backed by mortgages? Why has he done that? Perhaps he could explain that to the House, because we are trying to keep people in their houses, not prop up credit card lending. According to the market notice issued by the Bank this morning, the British taxpayer is underwriting securities based on United States credit card debt. Could the Chancellor confirm whether that is the case? Has he calculated the extent to which that will expose the taxpayer to developments in the US economy?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o31"><a name="80421-0004.htm_para17"><a name="0804216000177">The Chancellor is calling on the banks to be more transparent about their liabilities&#151;I agree with him on that&#151;but can he confirm that the Treasury has insisted that the scheme be designed to keep the taxpayer exposure off the Government&#146;s balance sheet? Is it true that the swaps are for 364 days because if they were for a day longer, &#163;50 billion of debt would be added to the national debt? Crucially, what steps is he taking to ensure that the main lending banks will use the facility to pass lower rates to borrowers? Has he had any commitment from the banks that they will do that?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o32"><a name="80421-0004.htm_para18"><a name="0804216000178">We have seen the share prices of the banks go up since word of the scheme was leaked by the Prime Minister on his American trip, but what we have not seen is mortgage costs come down. The last time the Chancellor called for the banks to pass on a rate cut, they all ignored him, even the bank that he now owns, and several actually raised their rates. Let us hope he is more successful when he meets the Council of Mortgage Lenders tomorrow.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o33"><a name="80421-0004.htm_para19"><a name="0804216000179">Finally, do not the past nine months reveal the folly of a Prime Minister who failed to use the global good times to prepare for the difficult times? A competent Government would be in a position to help people with the rising cost of living.

than cancel out any help with mortgage costs that this scheme might bring. It is not too late for the Chancellor to back down and stop this tax raid on the poorest. We know from the climbdowns on capital gains tax and non-doms that this Chancellor is for turning. We know from his comments yesterday that he thinks the Prime Minister&#146;s last Budget was such a mess that he has to return to it. If the Chancellor has a concession to announce or if he wants to set out the process towards any concession, he should not leave it to his deputy; he should get up and have the courage to announce the concession at the Dispatch Box himself.</p>

 I note that the shadow Chancellor had very little to say about the Bank of England scheme, just as he has had precious little to say throughout the past few months. Indeed, ever since these problems first arose in the financial markets last summer, what he has had to say has been contradictory. I note his invitation to discuss boom and bust&#151;something that the Conservative party is well qualified to talk about. I prefer to remind the House that because we have a strong and stable economy, with low levels of unemployment and record levels of people in work, we are far better placed than most other economies to see through this period of financial uncertainty and turbulence.</p>

Gentleman&#146;s assertion that we are the only country affected, he must have noticed that banks and other financial institutions in the United States have been substantially affected. So too have banks in Germany and in other parts of the world. This problem is affecting the banking system throughout the world, which is why central banks and Governments have been taking action to try to alleviate it, with a view to getting the financial markets stabilised and returning to normality.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o36"><a name="80421-0004.htm_para22"><a name="0804216000183">The hon. Gentleman asked several questions. He asked about the Basel regime, and Basel II in particular. I am sure he would agree that it is important that the banks have adequate capital, and the Basel II agreement was meant to ensure that banks are properly capitalised, so that if they run into difficulties they have something to fall back on. Indeed, the evidence of the past few weeks is that several banks throughout the world need to improve their capital position.</p>

Gentleman asked how the banks will adapt from the present regime to the new regime, and the FSA is considering that. He also asked about the Bank of England scheme itself, which I understand he broadly welcomes. First, the issue of its classification is for the independent Office for National Statistics. Secondly, perhaps I may explain to him further how the scheme will work, although the Governor must have covered this ground in his helpful conversation yesterday. The Bank of England will make available Treasury bills to a bank in return for which it will have to pledge collateral. Most of that will be mortgage-backed securities, but it can include credit card assets,  <br>

<p><a name="stpa_o38"><a name="80421-0004.htm_para24"><a name="0804216000185">Crucially, as I think the hon. Gentleman acknowledged on the radio this morning, the Bank of England will ensure that it takes far more from the bank than it gives out in Treasury bills. An example is given in the Bank of England press notice today, which shows that if &#163;100  of collateral is pledged, the receiving bank will get between &#163;70 and &#163;90, depending on the strength and value of the collateral. In other words, there will be a margin to protect the taxpayer. In addition, the banks will pay a fee.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o39"><a name="80421-0004.htm_para25"><a name="0804216000186">The crucial point is that the Bank of England is now able to take action to provide liquidity in the system for a longer period, which will help banks to restore their capital position and be able to start lending to businesses and individuals. That is crucial for this country in terms of improving the mortgage market. We want to ensure that institutions are sound, but we also want to see the benefits of what is happening passing to home owners, because they are entitled to expect not only support from lenders, but that will the Government to do everything they can to support them. We will continue to do that.</p>

 The banks are not in this position by accident. The Institute of International Finance, which is the bankers&#146; group, acknowledged only last week that the banks had engaged in substantial bad practice. British banks have, over the past few years, lent too much, too quickly and too carelessly. The correct course of action, which the markets now anticipate, is that the banks should make a rights issue to their shareholders to raise money to offset the losses that they have to own up to. The problem is that chief executives do not want to go to the markets because they face the sack, so they rattle the begging bowl to the Government and hope that the Government will help them out, which they are doing.</p>

The most important condition should be that the banks accept up front and in writing that they will go to the markets to raise money in the way proposed by the Royal Bank of Scotland. Without that, there is no guarantee that the money raised in this way will not sit in the banks without being advanced to the markets, to small business or to residential borrowers. Without those guarantees, the package promises to be a liability to the taxpayer and to do little to sustain the domestic economy.</p>

We are in a situation, getting on for nine months after the problems first started, in which the mortgage bank security market is virtually non-existent. That is putting particular strain on banks and making them increasingly reluctant to lend to each other and to customers.

 I think that the principle of moral hazard is very important, but as I have said to my right hon. Friend on a number of occasions, I do not think that we can just stop there. We have a particular problem in relation to the banks. The banking system is crucial to just about every single business and individual, and to all home owners in the country; no Government could simply say, &#147;It really doesn&#146;t matter what will happen to the banking system.&#148; It is crucial to the economy, as we have seen in the United States, as we see in Europe, and as we now see in Asia. There is not a country in the world that is not now being affected by the problem.

Let me make a general point: I know that both in the Treasury Committee and on the Floor of the House the hon. Gentleman has frequently asked perfectly pertinent questions about Northern Rock, as he was concerned about the exposure in that case. The Government did step in to stabilise the position at Northern Rock, but of course money has not been lost; indeed, Northern Rock&#146;s exposure and debt to the Bank of England are being reduced.</p>

That is what destabilised the housing market in the early 1990s. The position today is quite different. There are very high levels of people in work, and historically low interest rates. What we have to deal with at the moment is an almost unprecedented shock to the financial system, or certainly one that we have not seen in recent generations. It is important that we, and other banks, and authorities throughout the world, act together to do everything that we can to ensure stability in the banking system.</p>

 In reply to the latter point, it is not possible for the Government to insist that a cut in the bank rate, for example, should be passed through in every case, whatever happens. There may be reasons why a financial institution is not able to do that&#151;not least because it may need to make sure that its capital position is strong. However, one of the reasons why, in the present position, the rate decreases have not been passed on, and why people have found getting mortgages more difficult or expensive, is that there is less money around because banks are not lending to each other.

the root cause of that lack of funding and of the increase in the cost of getting loans, and it is the fact that the mortgage-backed security market is virtually shut. Sorting that problem out will begin the process of freeing up the lending process. That, I believe, will enable us to achieve the situation that we all want, in which people receive the benefits of that. It is not possible to prescribe in a mechanistic way what every single institution in this country must do, but, as I said, if public money is doing its bit, people expect banks to do everything that they can so that the general public can see the benefit.</p>

 Banks and building societies should lend responsibly. They should be satisfied that the borrower can afford the loan being taken on, that the asset on which the loan is secured is good and that they will get their money back. I also agree that those responsible for running financial institutions should remember what has happened. What often happens is that the generation involved in one financial or banking crisis has long gone by the time something else happens. I hope that the memories of what has happened in the past few months stick not only with the current generation of managers, but with the rising generation.

As I have said before, certainly to the Treasury Committee and, I think, on the Floor of the House, by the time Northern Rock started to get into difficulties it would have been very difficult to help it through a general provision, because by that time it needed so much money that it was almost inevitable that it would come along to the Bank of England.

Has he spoken to utility regulators to ask why they continue to rely on rating agencies to fulfil their statutory duty to assess financial stability, despite their track record?</p>

 The scheme that we are considering applies to the institutions that can normally get support from the Bank of England. That would not include a utility company. Credit rating agencies should be perceived as a means of reaching a decision, whether that is for a bank, a utility company or anybody else. Their findings are not something definitive, which demands no further questions. The responsibility for running companies and making decisions about debt must lie, first and foremost, with their boards of directors.</p>

 Anything that stops us going back to the 15 per cent. interest rates of 1992 must be welcomed in the House. However, what will be the pecking order for the banks in borrowing the &#163;50 billion? Will UK banks come first or can foreign banks also borrow the money?</p>

 As I said, the facility is open to the banks that are normally here&#151;British banks and those from abroad with branches here. From the discussions that the Bank of England has held, I do not think that there will be a pecking order problem. The Bank of England is fairly confident that the banks that want to take advantage of the facility can do that.</p>

 As is fairly widely known, a long discussion has taken place between the Bank of England and banks in this country about what the scheme might resemble and whether banks might take advantage of it. I believe that most said that they would. The hon. Gentleman mentioned opprobrium. A feature of the scheme is that the Bank of England will not report on individual banks as and when they may look for facilities. It will report on an aggregate but, for obvious reasons, there is no sense in identifying individuals. My guess is that the scheme will be taken up fairly widely.</p>

 On a point of order, Mr. Speaker. Following the recent Freedom of Information Act report released to <i> The Times</i> last week by the Ministry of Defence on the humiliating abduction of Royal Navy and Royal Marine personnel by the Iranian revolutionary guard, I seek your advice on how to secure more transparent, accurate and timely information from the Government on the issue, which is obviously of great importance.</p>

 I beg to move, That the Bill be now read a Second time.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o53"><a name="80421-0006.htm_para4"><a name="0804216000249">The Finance Bill implements measures from the Budget 2007, the pre-Budget report last year and the Budget 2008. There are three central areas in the Bill that I want to highlight: support for the economy at a time of global economic turbulence; the changes to the personal tax system; and the long-term reforms for the future of our country, particularly those addressing climate change. I will take each of those three areas in turn.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o54"><a name="80421-0006.htm_para5"><a name="0804216000250">The Bill supports the economy at a time of significant global pressures. As the Chancellor said in his statement a moment ago, a serious global credit squeeze is taking place, triggered by the problems in the US sub-prime mortgage market. At the same time, as families in Britain know well, world food and fuel prices are increasing, too. As a result, all economies across the world are likely to be affected this year.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o55"><a name="80421-0006.htm_para6"><a name="0804216000251">The British economy is well placed to weather global storms. Inflation is lower here than in the US or the euro area. As the recent labour market figures show, claimant count unemployment is now at its lowest for more than 30 years. Product, capital and labour markets have become more flexible and responsive as a result of the skills and competition reforms that we have introduced. That is why the independent International Monetary Fund has forecast that the UK will be the joint fastest growing economy in the G7 this year.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o56"><a name="80421-0006.htm_para7"><a name="0804216000252">However, resilience is not enough. We are doing more now to respond to the economic challenges that we face. So for a start, the Chancellor has today set out the steps that we are taking with partners across the world to help address the problems that have stopped banks from lending to each other. As well as the action to promote financial stability, supporting liquidity and monetary policy, the Budget sets fiscal policy to support the economy, too.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o57"><a name="80421-0006.htm_para8"><a name="0804216000253">The overall approach set out in the Budget and implemented through the Finance Bill is deliberately to put more money into the economy this year. We are using the flexibility that our fiscal rules give us to support additional borrowing in a sensible and sustainable way when the economic pressures are greatest. That is the right thing to be doing now. The overall impact of the fiscal decisions is to put billions more into the economy this year, through the automatic stabilisers and the decisions on things such as delaying the increase in fuel duty until October, which is implemented in the Bill. That is the right thing to do within the fiscal framework at a time when the economy faces global challenges.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o58"><a name="80421-0006.htm_para9"><a name="0804216000254">Thanks to our fiscal rules, we are able to protect investment at the same time. Previous Governments often slashed capital investment when economic pressures grew. We are protecting it, however, which means protecting  <br>

investment for the future in our vital transport infrastructure, in our schools and hospitals, and in the underpinnings of the economic growth that we have sustained for so long.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o59"><a name="80421-0006.htm_para10"><a name="0804216000255">The Opposition have set out a rather different fiscal judgment&#151;in fact, they have set out several, depending on their audience. First they say that borrowing is too high; then they set out ways to increase it further. In the past 12 months, they have set out &#163;10 billion of unfunded tax promises. On Budget day alone, the shadow Chancellor set out proposals for borrowing an extra &#163;5.4 billion, cutting inheritance tax except for millionaires, changing stamp duty and more. Six days later, after the Budget debates, the Opposition voted for an extra &#163;10 billion in borrowing on top of that and against all the revenue-raising measures&#151;on alcohol, on vehicle excise duty and so on&#151;but for none of the tax cuts. Funny that. The Opposition have never told us where the money would come from or how they would make up their black hole&#151;a black hole that just gets bigger and bigger.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o60"><a name="80421-0006.htm_para11"><a name="0804216000256">The Budget and the Finance Bill also support the economy in other ways, confirming corporation tax at 28 per cent. for this year and next&#151;the lowest rate in the G7 and the lowest rate since the tax was introduced. The Bill also makes changes to the small companies rate to create a more level playing field, and introduces a new annual investment allowance to support capital investment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o61"><a name="80421-0006.htm_para12"><a name="0804216000257">The Bill also increases research and development tax credits and makes the enterprise investment scheme&#151;a tax scheme that supports small businesses&#151;more generous. It restructures capital gains tax, creating a single rate of 18 per cent. with a new entrepreneurs relief. It implements more than 20 business tax simplification measures that were announced in the pre-Budget report and the Budget. So, the Bill supports the economy, simplifies the tax system to help businesses and provides overall support for the economy at a time of global pressures, while retaining a sustainable and responsible approach to the public finances.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o62"><a name="80421-0006.htm_para13"><a name="0804216000258">I want to turn now to the personal tax measures in the Bill. It sets out a major package of reforms to run alongside the changes made by the National Insurance Contributions Bill last year and the changes made to the tax credit system. These include the cut in the basic rate by 2p to 20p, its lowest rate for 75 years. They also include the removal of the 10p starting rate. They include increases in the tax allowance for pensioners, increases in the working tax credit for those in low-paid work, increases in child tax credits and, next year, child benefit to help families with children, and changes to the national insurance upper earnings limit.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o63"><a name="80421-0006.htm_para14"><a name="0804216000259">As the independent Institute for Fiscal Studies has set out, the poorest third of the population will benefit most from this package because of what we have done for pensioners, for families with children and for low-paid workers through allowances and tax credits. Indeed, the impact of the two Budgets and the pre-Budget report is to raise more than 500,000 children out of poverty. We should not underestimate the immense impact of this. When children grow up in poverty, it can disadvantage them for the whole of their lives. Lifting them out of poverty now could help them not only in the year to come but for decades into the  <br>

future. As a result of these measures, households with children in the poorest fifth of the population will be on average &#163;340 a year better off, and that will make a very big difference to them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o64"><a name="80421-0006.htm_para15"><a name="0804216000260">Pensioners will benefit too&#151;600,000 pensioners will be taken out of tax altogether&#151;and the increases to the working tax credit will help low-paid workers without children. The working tax credit increases will mean that a single-earner household without children earning, say, &#163;14,000 a year will be about &#163;180 a year better off as a result of the Bill.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o65"><a name="80421-0006.htm_para16"><a name="0804216000261">I want to say more about those who will not benefit from this year&#146;s package. These are major reforms, and the majority of households will be better off or remain the same, although some will pay more as a result of the package. It is hard, in any one Budget, to help everyone, and those who lose in any one year might have benefited in previous years or might benefit in the next. If we look at the Budgets as a whole since 1997, we see that even those who are paying more in this year&#146;s Budget have still benefited significantly overall since 1997. So, on average, those who will pay more this year are still about &#163;500 a year better off than they would have been under the 1997 personal tax and benefits system that the Conservatives left us with.</p>

 As the right hon. Lady has already cited the Institute for Fiscal Studies, will she remind the House what the institute&#146;s estimate is of the number of people who will be losers as a result of this package? Will she also remind the House of the Treasury&#146;s own estimate, as reported to the Select Committee?</p>

 We have set out the figures. Four out of five households will be better off or see no change. One in five will pay more as a result of this year&#146;s personal tax package, but that does not take into account measures such as the extra given on the winter fuel package or the increases to the minimum wage. For example, the increases to the minimum wage over the past two years alone are worth about &#163;13 a week to those on the lowest pay. We want to do more to help many of those who will not benefit from this year&#146;s package and we have already been working to achieve that.</p>

Before we reach clause 3, as I think we will do next week, I hope that the Government will be able to find their way not to unstitch the Budget&#151;nobody is asking that&#151;but to bring forward specific proposals to ensure that those in work who are on the lowest pay are not made worse off by a Labour Budget.</p>

from tax credits as part of this year&#146;s proposals. He will also recognise that tax changes are part of a major package and that it is not always possible to help everybody in any one package; even those who may end up paying more as a result of this package will still be significantly better off on average than under the Conservatives&#146; package of 1997.</p>

That is why we have already made proposals for additional money to help those over 60 this year with winter fuel payments and also why we have provided further help with child tax credit and child benefit.

We said that we would work with stakeholders, launching seminars and debates over the next few months, and begin pilot programmes on new approaches to help more children out of poverty. I can tell the House that we will now extend that work to include consideration of households on low incomes without children. Many without children have already benefited from things such as minimum wage increases and the working tax credit, but we want, as always, to do more for those on the lowest incomes, given the resources in the economy at the time. We will therefore consult stakeholders, MPs and different groups on the next phase of tackling poverty and unfair inequality in Britain. That work will initially feed into the pre-Budget report and then future Budgets as well.</p>

 Indeed, those figures have been published as part of parliamentary answers, but I say again that they have not included such things as the winter fuel payment, which is an important factor. I would also say to hon. Members that they might be interested to know that about half those households that pay more this year are in the top half of the income distribution. It is right to say, as the IFS has said, that we are providing the most support for those who are on the lowest incomes.</p>

 As I have just said, interestingly, the figures show that around half those who are paying more as part of this particular package are in the upper half of the income distribution, so in fact the distribution is rather different from how it has often been presented in the media.

Did he say then that he was worried about low-income households? Not a bit of it. What he talked about then was inheritance tax for millionaires. In his big speech on tax reform in February, did he say that he wanted to change the 10p rate? Not once. In his website call for action on Budget day this year, did he mention the 10p rate?

The shadow Chancellor tells us about plenty of other taxes that he has promised to cut, but there is nothing on the 10p rate. They would vote to keep the rate, but now they admit that they do not even like it. The hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge (Mr. Hammond) said this weekend:</p>

In order to fund the additional winter fuel payment, as well as child benefit and child tax credit increases the following year, we are increasing alcohol duty as part of this Finance Bill. Over recent years, as incomes have risen, alcohol has become more affordable. In the supermarket, a bottle of wine costs around &#163;4, whereas 10 years ago, the equivalent figure was nearly &#163;4.50. The extra duty is worth only around 14p, so that bottle of wine is still cheaper than it was a decade ago.

If one takes into account such countervailing measures, and also that some households have a low-paid earner and a higher-paid earner, what is the net number of households that will lose&#151;if there are any&#151;because of the abolition of the 10 per cent. tax rate?</p>

Committee last year mentioned that 5.3 million was the ballpark figure. In our report, we have asked the Treasury to look at that, but I will go one step further today and give the Chief Secretary and the Chancellor time to think about this before the end of the Second Reading debate tonight: I will ask my Committee to explore with the Chancellor and his officials who will lose out as a result of this 10p tax rate withdrawal and to look at any measures that could be implemented sooner rather than later to compensate them. I will ask my Committee members to look at that so that we can report back before June or July in order to inform the Treasury, in the hope that we can go a step further towards ensuring that we do not penalise poor people unnecessarily.</p>

He has so little room that he has to increase taxes on average families who like an occasional drink or drive a family car. The Bill leaves the business community still facing huge uncertainty about the detail of the non-dom taxation policy, which is now set out in schedule 7&#151;a schedule that is so dense and impenetrable that even the experts tell us that they are baffled by it. By the Government&#146;s own admission, it is still so full of holes, six months after the PBR announcement, that it will require substantial amendment during the Bill&#146;s passage.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o82"><a name="80421-0008.htm_para4"><a name="0804216000334">In short, this is a Finance Bill that does exactly what we do not need at this point in the economic cycle. It raises taxes on households as the economy slows, the cost of living soars and the housing market teeters on the brink, fuelling the collapse in consumer confidence. It raises taxes on business at a time when our competitors are cutting them to support their economies, undermines investment and business confidence, and kicks families and businesses when they are down.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o83"><a name="80421-0008.htm_para5"><a name="0804216000335">It is typical of this Prime Minister that, at a time when the focus of attention in the Bill should be on supporting business and consumers and stimulating investment to keep the economy from slowing still further, the income tax measures announced in his Budget of 2007, when he was seeking to box in his successor, have dominated the debate. Perhaps it is poetic justice that when he stepped off the plane to confront the grim reality of home, it was his income tax reform that was fuelling the collapse of his authority and undermining his successor&#146;s first Finance Bill.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o84"><a name="80421-0008.htm_para6"><a name="0804216000336">It is typical, too, that the Prime Minister seems to be just about the only person who still does not get it and is still in denial that there is a problem. He still refuses to acknowledge his cynical sacrifice of the interests of the poorest to his own short-term political agenda. Opposition Members well remember the farce of the 2007 tax con Budget, and how Labour Back Benchers cheered the announcement of the reduction of the basic rate. What a coup to crown the then Chancellor&#146;s decade in the Treasury, and to launch his bid for the Labour leadership. How he basked in that achievement&#151;for about five minutes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o85"><a name="80421-0008.htm_para7"><a name="0804216000337">Then, it unravelled. Table A1 of the Red Book exposed the sleight of hand that paid for the tax cut with the abolition of the 10p rate. Then, the Institute for Fiscal Studies identified who the losers would be; the Chief Secretary to the Treasury apparently cannot say the figure, but I will: 5.3 million of Britain&#146;s poorest families. That figure was confirmed, give or take, in the Treasury&#146;s evidence to the Select Committee, and that is after taking account of the increases in tax credits.</p>

The other sought to put in place a long-term constraint on the Chancellor&#146;s ability to manoeuvre in future Budgets. Neither of those is the right way to address this problem.

That compares with the &#163;9 billion cost to the Exchequer of reducing the 22p rate to 20p and, interestingly, with the &#163;550 million that the Chancellor managed to magic out of nowhere between his pre-Budget report last October and the publication of his Budget this year to fund his climbdowns on capital gains tax and the non-doms regime.

The safeguard on distraint of taxpayers&#146; goods will be scrapped in primary legislation. There are constitutional questions around clause 117, which will create an order-making power to repeal or amend any primary legislation, including the Finance Act 2008 itself. These are huge new powers at a time when HMRC is miscalculating the taxes of 1 million or more of our fellow citizens every year, when public confidence in the chaotic administration of tax credits is at an all-time low, and when the shockingly casual attitude to data security has been exposed by the loss of the personal data of half the families in Britain. The Government&#146;s response is to give it more powers. This increase in powers is a step too far and a step too soon, and we will seek to postpone their implementation, if the Bill obtains a Second Reading, and to get them brought forward again in a stand-alone Bill that would be subject to scrutiny in the other place, which has expressed a strong interest in such bureaucratic powers.</p>

At a time when families, particularly those on lower incomes, are struggling with the soaring cost of living and stagnant earnings, it clobbers them with tax increases.

The Committee itself makes no forecasts for growth in future years, but we said that the outlook from the collection of independent forecasters indicated that the Treasury&#146;s forecasts were slightly optimistic.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o117"><a name="80421-0009.htm_para17"><a name="0804216000420">I will consider three aspects of the Finance Bill and its contents: first, the overall fiscal position; secondly, the measures to reduce poverty and the 10p tax rate; and thirdly, the scope and impact of measures affecting non-domiciled taxpayers. On the fiscal position, in many ways the Government&#146;s position is strong. Other than Canada, no G7 country has had a fiscal surplus in more years since 1997 than the United Kingdom, and compared with many EU countries our levels of public sector net debt are low. As a Committee, we understandably focused on the two fiscal rules that the Government have set themselves, and we highlighted two areas of concern. First, on the interpretation of the golden rule, we consider that it has been too closely linked to the timing of economic cycles, which has encouraged a position in which examination of the Government&#146;s overall fiscal position has been unduly focused on rather arcane controversies about the dating of the economic cycle.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o118"><a name="80421-0009.htm_para18"><a name="0804216000421">Secondly, the margins by which the Government expect to meet their sustainable investment rule relating to net sector public debt are tight, and seemingly highly dependent on the Treasury growth forecasts, which are at the top of the outside forecasts for growth in 2008 and 2009.</p>

 Does the right hon. Gentleman agree that if we add the unfunded pension liabilities, the PFI and PPP off-balance-sheet liabilities and the off-balance-sheet liabilities for Network Rail and Northern Rock, public sector total obligations are in excess of gross national product, at around &#163;1.5 trillion? That is an enormous figure.</p>

 As the right hon. Gentleman knows, the Treasury Committee comprises Members of all parties&#151;his own, the Liberals and Labour. We have concluded that the fiscal position of the UK is strong in comparison to other EU countries.</p>

The Treasury Committee considered the problems of marginal deduction rates and the impact of the abolition of the starting rate of income tax in the context of measures to reduce poverty. We welcome the increases in child benefit and child tax credit that are designed to achieve further progress on the Government&#146;s child poverty targets, and we specifically welcome the &#163;1 billion that the Government found to fulfil those targets. As those on the Front Bench know, we were cautious about that because, in a previous report, we questioned whether the Government were resiling from their commitment. We were pleased to see that the &#163;1 billion was included in the Budget proposals.</p>

We also welcomed the maintenance of the 10 per cent. starting rate for savings for pensioners. Our concern about the abolition of the 10p income tax rate, however, is concentrated on households that do not stand to benefit from measures targeted on families with children, those seeking to return to work or pensioner households. We specifically said that those who do not gain from the measures on child poverty, fuel poverty and incentives to work would lose out, and we are talking largely about those on incomes of about &#163;18,500 a year and less. We are talking about those who are under 60, who will not qualify for the winter fuel allowance; those with no under-18s in their households, who will not qualify for child poverty payments; early retirees; and those not claiming working tax credit, where take-up is low. The Minister will know that the tax credit take-up rate is about 19 or 20 per cent., which is scandalously low. I believe that &#163;1.28 billion is available, and it is important that there is a campaign to increase the take-up rate. We cannot allow such a scandalously low figure to be maintained.</p>

 Does my right hon.

earnings were, and then corrections would be made. The Government say that they will move to a system whereby things can change on a monthly basis so that we can encourage people to work. However, the bureaucracy gets in the way. People do not remind the Government of their intentions or report their earnings, or loss of earnings, and we end up with the situation we have seen in the past. We have to work on that, and I endorse a system whereby we ensure that people&#146;s income is reviewed on a regular basis so that they get the benefits they need. However, there are problems with the system and, as my hon. Friend knows, the Select Committee has been vigilant about that. We will ensure that we maintain that vigilance.</p>

 On tax credits, especially the marginal deductions for those who are seeking to get back into work and coming off tax credits, the problem is that the Budget increases the number of people who have to pay more than the 60 per cent. marginal rate of tax if they come off working tax credit and get into work. In the past 10 years, that number has grown from 800,000 to 1.8 million. Surely that trend is going in the wrong direction.</p>

poverty and fuel poverty, especially by redoubling our efforts to make working tax credit take-up worth while for those in households without children.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o124"><a name="80421-0010.htm_para5"><a name="0804216000435">Ministers made the point about the number of people who are affected by the change. The Treasury Committee is clear about the matter. In evidence to the Committee last year, Mr. Mark Neale, the director of the budget, tax and welfare directorate at the Treasury, said that 5.3 million was the ballpark figure. We should all be straightforward and honest about that, identify the problem and state what we will do. I therefore reiterate my invitation to the Chief Secretary and others. I will put it to my members that the Treasury Committee examine the issue urgently and report back to the Treasury. I repeat that 5.3 million is a ballpark figure.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o125"><a name="80421-0010.htm_para6"><a name="0804216000436">The Treasury stated to us in evidence:</p>
<a name="80421-0010.htm_brev1"><a name="0804216000479"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Estimates are that 0.8 million single earners with income under &#163;18,500 will see their income decrease by around &#163;1.45 a week on average...The maximum amount any single individual could be worse off by is &#163;232 per year (&#163;4.46 per week) about 3 per cent. of net income...For households that are worse off, the average loss is about &#163;2 per week.&#148;</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o126"><a name="80421-0010.htm_para7"><a name="0804216000437">The Treasury recognises that. Indeed, the Chancellor acknowledges it. In evidence to the Committee, he clearly said that it would affect women between the ages of 60 and 65. Let us therefore establish that people will be affected. People on low incomes will be affected and we need to find out who the winners and the losers are.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o127"><a name="80421-0010.htm_para8"><a name="0804216000438">One of the problems is identifying the winners and the losers. I have been asked in many interviews in the past few weeks why it has taken Members of Parliament a year to wake up to this matter. No specific information identified the winners and losers and one had to wait until the new arrangements were introduced in the Department for Work and Pensions&#151;that happened last month. Before I was interviewed on one television programme, I tried to find out, through contact with representatives of the Department for Work and Pensions, exactly what the new measures were. They said that they would not be available until the first Monday in April.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o128"><a name="80421-0010.htm_para9"><a name="0804216000439">We got that information, from which I found out that, sure, a working household with no children with a combined income of &#163;17,500 to &#163;18,000 a year would lose about &#163;13 a week, but also that in some instances single earners would gain. There is a fuzziness, and we do not know who the winners or the losers are. I refer the Minister to the Treasury Committee&#146;s clear recommendation in its report on the 2007 Budget:</p>
<a name="80421-0010.htm_brev2"><a name="0804216000480"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;An important part of any change to the personal taxation regime must be that both winners and losers can identify, with ease, how they are affected by the changes stated within a Budget package.

 No, 5.3 million is still the figure. I mentioned the winners and the losers. There are ups and downs and a nebulous element to the process. That is why we need to ensure clarity in the debate, so that we can show who the winners and the losers are. If the Committee undertook any inquiry, that is one thing that we would want to do.</p>

 I thank my right hon. Friend for giving way again. I was not trying to minimise the issue for the losers; I was just referring to the evidence that Mr. Chote gave the Committee last year. He made it clear that the figure of 5.3 million would come down over the next 12 months. It would be helpful to have some proper quantification of the figure. Whether the figure is 5.3 million, 4.3 million or 3.3 million, the issue is still vital, but it appears that Mr. Chote has not provided any further information.</p>

couples with children who will lose twice because of income tax and national insurance changes, but who will perhaps gain only once through child tax credit or working tax credit. There will be 300,000 tax-paying women between the ages of 60 and 64 who do not get tax credits and who are too young to be compensated by the rise in pensioner tax allowance. There will also be 500,000 non-workers paying more tax on their taxable benefit and pensions than they gain. They could be early retirees or incapacity benefit claimants. We can see, therefore, how wide-ranging the impact of this measure will be. Those are the figures that add up to the 5 million; I am quite happy to share that information.</p>

John Whiting, our adviser on the Select Committee, was very clear on the issue of low-income non-doms, and he said that millions of them could be affected. I am aware that the Treasury has estimated that there are 80,000 people with both a UK and a foreign income. That might be because it did not include the unwitting non-doms. The Treasury Select Committee report makes it clear that we feel there has been insufficient consideration of the possible impact of the tax changes in the Budget on middle and lower income groups, and we would like the Government to look at that.</p>

An example that has been cited are the typical Polish or Romanian migrant workers who pay UK taxes but who probably do not even know that they are non-doms because they do not know the term, and therefore do not realise that they are about to lose their personal allowance. They will certainly not have any advisers. That group could unwittingly be in breach of the new &#163;2,000 limit for non-doms, and could therefore suddenly lose their UK tax-free allowance. We are asking the Government to be aware of that problem. More importantly, in the light of some of the recent comments about the capability of HMRC, we are asking HMRC to be aware of it.

This applies to anyone whose foreign income could be affected, such as anyone with overseas savings of about &#163;40,000, as the interest on that would be more than &#163;2,000, which is the de minimis level. Equally, the measure could affect anyone renting out a property abroad or who has a summer job abroad. I want HMRC to look at this, because I have enough on my plate as Chairman of the Treasury Select Committee with all the inquiries that we carry out. I do not want to have to carry out an inquiry into this matter in a year&#146;s time, so will the Minister help me out by solving this before it becomes a bigger problem?</p>

 There are two main ways in which a Member of this House can judge a Finance Bill, a Budget or, for that matter, a Government. The first is to ask whether the measure has a vision, a sense of purpose and a direction. The second is to ask whether it has what the Prime Minister calls a moral compass. That is the issue that has occupied us to the greatest extent so far today, and the one to which I will devote the largest part of my speech. It is the specific issue of the doubling of the 10p tax rate that is causing the greatest amount of grief and unhappiness among my constituents and among people right across the country.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o134"><a name="80421-0011.htm_para0"><a name="08042119000002">First, however, I want to touch briefly on whether the Budget had a vision or a sense of purpose, and whether it told us what the Labour party seeks to achieve and what drives the Government. In this debate, we have been discussing a change that was made in the Budget of 2007. The 2008 Budget has escaped without being given much attention at all because it was the most puny, unambitious Budget in living memory.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o135"><a name="80421-0011.htm_para1"><a name="08042119000003">During the parliamentary recess, I had the opportunity to attend a commemorative service in my constituency to mark the 40th anniversary of the assassination of Martin Luther King in Memphis, Tennessee, in 1968. During the service, I reflected that he had been a man of huge vision. He was an inspirational figure who had a dream and who had stood on the mountain top. He had seen the promised land. How diminished our politics seem by comparison today.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o136"><a name="80421-0011.htm_para2"><a name="08042119000004">The Labour party, which was founded just over a century ago, was founded for entirely noble reasons. Many people in this House, not only those in the Labour party, will conclude that the formation of the Labour party was to the benefit of the politics of this nation and the many people who live in it. The Labour party was out of government from when I was eight years old until just before my 27th birthday. During that period&#151;from the earliest that I can remember through to my mid-twenties&#151;many people worked in the Labour party to try to make it fit to govern this country again. Many people, including those on the Labour Benches, when they heard this year&#146;s Budget, will have been entitled to ask, &#147;Is that it? Is that what it was all for? Is this what our great party has become?&#148; It was the thinnest, most unambitious, managerial Budget that I can remember.</p>

Yet there are a number of visionary causes that they or any UK Government could adopt. After a massive expansion over the last decade, the Government are now spending &#163;1,700 million every single day&#151;in fact, the Government&#146;s  <br>

The primary domestic objective must be to make public services more accessible and more accountable. How can we, as a group of politicians, ensure that people of all incomes can be empowered to shape their own lives? The big domestic challenge of the 21st century is to create health and school systems that are fit for our times&#151;not just through extra public spending, but through meaningful reform.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman is talking about vision, so has he not heard of the Climate Change Bill, which is going through the House? How does that Bill square with the idea of the Labour Government not doing anything about climate change? I simply do not understand the hon. Gentleman&#146;s point, as we are the only Government in the world to introduce a Bill to deal with climate change.</p>

 I did not claim in my opening remarks that the Government had done nothing at all; I said rather that the scale of their ambition was far too puny, timid and lacking in ambition. That is very much true of the Climate Change Bill; in fact, I could not have come up with a better example if I had sat in my office and given considerable thought to the matter. That Bill is a proposal put forward by a Government who have been in office for 11 years, during which time the issue of climate change has become considerably more acute. It would be fair to say that my party was talking about environmental issues to a greater extent than the other parties in the 1997 election and before, but the Government have put this proposal forward and made some progress. The Bill, however, does not go far enough. Instead, we had a Budget that confirmed how small and how visionless Labour in government has become. If I were a Labour Member, that&#151;beyond any specific proposals in the Budget package&#151;would depress me most: the sense that the momentum of the whole exercise and the entire reason for being in government have come to a halt. The Government are petering out, running out of ideas for the future of this country.</p>

I was not present at the parliamentary Labour party meeting&#151;obviously, because I am not a member of the parliamentary Labour party&#151;but I heard reports, which the hon. Gentleman might like to confirm, that Labour Back Benchers told the Prime Minister that they did not know what he stood for. At least with Tony Blair as leader, people felt that there was a sense of direction; they may not have liked it, but they were not left confused about what the Government were trying to achieve. Many people in the Labour party and beyond it no longer know precisely what the Prime Minister and the Government stand for.</p>

Seventy three Labour MPs have signed early-day motions critical of the change, but the Budget was on 21 March 2007&#151;precisely 13 months ago today&#151;when the Government Benches were full of Labour MPs waving their Order Papers and braying at the electoral triumph just laid before them by the man who is now the Prime Minister.

Member for Witney (Mr. Cameron) than they do for any other Opposition MP, so we are entitled to think that he will stand head and shoulders above us all in respect of his ability to analyse the Budget&#151;but unfortunately, he did not notice the doubling of the 10p rate. In fact, in the first line of his speech, the leader of the Conservative party said the following words on behalf of the 5.3 million people who were losers in the Budget:</p>

But if one looks carefully, one sees that the revenue to justify that reduction will be obtained from the abolition of the 10p rate. To fund the reduction, income tax will be increased for many taxpayers. One could say that we will be asking the poor to subsidise the rich.

In fact, over the weekend, she took to the airwaves to damp down any speculation that that other Treasury Minister might have been suggesting or hinting at imminent changes.</p>

It was the shadow Chief Secretary, who is so out of touch not just with public opinion but with the mood in his own party, who said recently that the Conservative party would not be able to introduce any tax cuts until 2015. Unfortunately, over the recess he was overruled by the shadow Chancellor, who indicated that it might not be possible to reduce the tax burden until 2018 at the earliest.

 That is an intelligent intervention. The answer is that we shall see at the time&#151;<i> [Interruption.] </i>Let me answer the question. We know for certain that for the purposes of the next general election the Conservative party is committed to taxing the same proportion of GDP as the Labour party. I hope&#151;although it will depend on the economic circumstances and on what GDP is at the time&#151;that the Liberal Democrats may be able to introduce a tax cut aimed at people on low earnings who, in my view, are currently paying too large a proportion of those earnings in tax. If we could do that and, as a consequence, reduce the proportion of GDP that is taken by the Government in overall taxation and help people on low incomes, it would be fantastic, but we need to make our overall calculations to see where we can afford to make the savings. We know that the Conservative party is committed to not doing that. For those who want an overall net reduction in taxation in the United Kingdom, there is only one party that can potentially offer that at a general election: the Liberal Democrats.</p>

The abolition, or doubling, of the 10p rate sends out the signal that the end of the empty hologram that was new Labour has finally arrived.

 It is a pleasure to follow the hon. Member for Taunton (Mr. Browne). He reminds me of a former Member of Parliament, Bob Woof, whom many Members may recall. Each year he made a Budget speech, but about the previous year&#146;s Budget. He read the previous year&#146;s Budget carefully, and then made his speech. Having listened to all of today&#146;s debate so far, I have a feeling that this too is a debate on last year&#146;s Budget, and on last year&#146;s abolition of the 10 per cent. tax rate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o165"><a name="80421-0012.htm_para7"><a name="08042119000063">I remind the House that last year, as now, there was a Budget statement, followed by publication of the Red Book, which has been mentioned. It was followed by a Budget debate which continued for about five days, a debate on Second Reading of the Finance Bill&#151;such as we are having now&#151;a Committee stage, and Third Reading. Where the House went wrong in not picking up the fact that the 10 per cent. rate was to go must be a mystery to most of us. It seems to me that the reason why we are having a debate on that particular aspect is the Institute for Fiscal Studies and the figure of 5.3 million net losers, and I am not sure that the IFS report actually said that.</p>

Member for Taunton talked about&#151;our vision has been clear. We believed in a fundamental and irreversible shift in the balance of wealth and power to workers and their families. Over those 11 years, we have brought in a national minimum wage, against great hostility in this House from the Opposition, who said that it would cost jobs, and increased it to more than &#163;5 an hour. We introduced tax credits, of which we have heard some criticism, to which I shall refer in a moment. We have signed the social chapter; the Conservatives not only did not support it, but have said that they will repeal it when they come to power. We have brought in specific measures for the elderly, of which the increases in winter fuel allowances are one.

For families with children, the child tax credit child element increased by &#163;175 above earnings indexation from &#163;1,845 to &#163;2,085, providing additional financial support for families and further reducing child poverty.</p>

Those on lower and middle incomes have benefited the most. Giving low-income families a negative income tax rate&#151;that is to say a tax credit&#151;is better than leaving in place the 10p rate; that was the philosophy and reasoning behind the Government&#146;s decision, which was not picked up throughout last year&#146;s Budget proceedings.</p>

Each year, the Labour Government have put more and more resources into tax credits. The 10p rate is not a targeted tax measure as all taxpayers benefit from it, including higher earners, such as those on &#163;100,000 a year who would still only pay 10p in the pound on the first &#163;2,230 of their taxable income.</p>

Friend the Member for West Dunbartonshire (Mr. McFall) said, it is because of these tax credits that we have been able to deliver historic achievements such as taking millions of pensioners and children out of poverty. The tax credits mean that we have rates of 40 per cent. and 20 per cent. for income tax, but that we have effective tax rates of minus 1 per cent. right up to minus 200 per cent. through tax credits, so that the tax and benefits system pays more to people on low and middle incomes.</p>

The answer was yes, we were; we had had three months of negative growth. We are not in a recession and we are not likely to go into one. We are holding the line in a very difficult and turbulent financial world.</p>

The rise was 1.1 per cent., while Tesco reported a 12 per cent. increase in sales in the past financial year. By the way, over the same period cash was used for 60 per cent of all retail sales, up from 54 per cent. in 2006.

 It would be a great help if the Conservatives were to match our commitment on child poverty. The point has been frequently made today that the Opposition are not the Government, and I fully accept that. I accept that the Government must make decisions and bring forward policies, but when we do have policies that are in the national interest it would be helpful if they were supported, and the Conservative Opposition should support our child poverty aims. We have heard about stability repeatedly from the Chancellor today, and also in the Budget&#151;stability for the country as a whole. The Opposition are right that we have difficulties with consumer prices; wheat and fuel prices have risen. The price of a loaf of bread has risen in this country at the same level as in France and Italy. That is currently a problem for all such countries.</p>

 I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for giving way again. No other countries are putting taxes up at present, as they know that they need to support those with least in their societies now when they are being hit with those price rises. Only our country&#146;s Government are hitting millions of poor people. That is why so many Labour Members are so uneasy about the Budget and the Bill.</p>

 Clearly, rising food and fuel prices will trouble the economy, and the Government must look at those matters and deal with them as they can. Making changes to last year&#146;s Budget this year might not be the appropriate way forward. Instead, the appropriate way forward might be that suggested by my right hon. Friend the Member for West Dunbartonshire and the Minister, which is to see how we might accommodate the changes being forced upon us by exterior events.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o182"><a name="80421-0012.htm_para24"><a name="08042119000087">The hon. Member for Taunton asked about the vision thing. There have been answers from the Labour Benches on the national health service and climate change, but the vision is also present in the Budget and the Budget statements. It is a value vision based on opportunity, fairness, efficiency and equilibrium between all strands of society. We are frequently coming across that vision. A reference was made to this being a managerial Budget. It was not managerial, but it was intended to accommodate a difficult financial situation and to be a steady-as-she-goes Budget&#151;the words of Stanley Baldwin many years ago.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o183"><a name="80421-0012.htm_para25"><a name="08042119000088">There are difficulties, therefore, but within them there are also opportunities, and this Budget reflects those opportunities, as do the Labour Government. Our business is to maintain stability in our society in what is an unstable world, and this Budget does that. The measures announced today by the Bank of England, supported by the Chancellor, will assist that stability, and as time goes by we will see that the British public will come to understand that and will support us.</p>

 Despite the strictures of the hon. Member for Middlesbrough (Sir Stuart Bell), whom it is always a pleasure to follow, the speeches we have so far heard in the debate have concentrated, as, I suspect, will those we have yet to hear, on the effects of the abolition of the 10p rate&#151;or as the hon. Member for Taunton (Mr. Browne) rightly described it, the doubling of the 10p rate&#151;on the 5.3 million households who will lose out as a result, and who are among the poorest households in our land. I know that there has been a certain amount of controversy about that figure, but no Member has put forward an alternative. The only Member who came close to doing so was the Chairman of the Treasury Committee, the right hon. Member for West Dunbartonshire (John McFall)&#151;and, indeed, if we add up the various components he itemised in his speech, we get to a number that is pretty close to 5.3 million.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o184"><a name="80421-0013.htm_para0"><a name="08042119000090">It is right that we should concentrate on that aspect of the matters before us this evening, because there is no doubt that this change will cause genuine hardship to people such as the young man I met in a supermarket in my constituency on Friday. With great pride, he told me that he had been unemployed for some time and that he had just got a job in the supermarket. I congratulated him, of course. He is precisely the kind of person whom we ought to be helping by making work a more attractive prospect. It is madness to take action that will make the world of work less attractive to him and others like him, as this change will do.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o185"><a name="80421-0013.htm_para1"><a name="08042119000091">However, I want to concentrate in my brief contribution to the debate on another aspect of the change: what does it tell us about the Prime Minister? I have studied the Prime Minister for many years. We entered the House at the same time, after the 1983 election. During the 25 years that have elapsed since, I have had ample time to get to know him, sometimes at close quarters, such as when he was Chancellor and I shadowed him, and at other times from a distance. I do not want to damage him by praising him too extravagantly, but I have long had considerable respect for the Prime Minister. It has always seemed to me that, quite unlike his predecessor, he brought to his political life a clearly formed philosophy and a deep-seated sense of values. He wanted to help the poor, and he cared about social justice&#151;indeed, we all do, although we may differ radically on what is the best way of achieving that eminently desirable goal.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o186"><a name="80421-0013.htm_para2"><a name="08042119000092">It has always seemed to me that the Prime Minister has been clear in his own mind that the best way of helping the poor has been through old-fashioned, socialist redistribution. By and large, that is what he tried to do during most of his tenure as Chancellor. Of course, that has given rise to a great deal of internal tension, because he was never prepared, or allowed, to admit that that was what he was doing. The word &#147;redistribution&#148; was expunged from the new Labour lexicon, so it was all carried out by stealth&#151;and it was only moderately successful, largely because the Prime Minister&#146;s chosen weapon of the tax credit system is so complicated and unwieldy that many do not claim what they are entitled to claim, and many who do claim suffer severe hardship when overpayments are recovered. I was, however, always prepared to give the  <br>

Prime Minister credit for good intentions; I always thought that although his methods may have been flawed, his intention was clear.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o187"><a name="80421-0013.htm_para3"><a name="08042119000093">So how on earth did it come about that this Prime Minister could introduce a change that hurts so many who are among the least well-off in our society? What is the explanation? We know that in one sense the explanation is that through making this change he found the money to reduce the basic rate of income tax from 22p to 20p, but why did he choose to benefit the somewhat better-off at the expense of the less well-off? </p>

<p><a name="stpa_o188"><a name="80421-0013.htm_para4"><a name="08042119000094">The hon. Member for Hyndburn (Mr. Pope) said in his short-lived early-day motion earlier in the month that that was not the intention of the Government&#151;that, in effect, it was an accident. However, no one doubts that the Prime Minister is a very clever man with a reputation&#151;although perhaps not always well deserved&#151;for prudence and caution. It is inconceivable that he could introduce such a measure without making a careful assessment of its consequences. After all, as Chancellor&#151;when he introduced the Budget we are discussing today&#151;and now as Prime Minister, he has held in his hands the power to make a real difference to the condition of life of millions of our fellow countrymen. I do not believe for one moment that he is so irresponsible that he would introduce a change of this kind without carefully thinking through all that it would mean for those affected. No, I think that the Prime Minister knew very well what he was doing, and he was doing it deliberately and for a purpose.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o189"><a name="80421-0013.htm_para5"><a name="08042119000095">Of course, we can only speculate about the reason, but I am afraid that none of the likely candidates reflects well on the Prime Minister. My hon. Friend the Member for Runnymede and Weybridge (Mr. Hammond), the shadow Chief Secretary, said, in an excellent speech that has rightly earned tributes from all quarters of the House, that it was to curry favour with the then Chancellor&#146;s own party in advance of a possible leadership election. That is certainly one explanation, but I confess that I am somewhat sceptical about it. I think that if there had been a leadership election, quite a lot of attention would have been paid to the consequences of doubling the 10p rate, and I am not sure that it would necessarily have helped the then Chancellor.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o190"><a name="80421-0013.htm_para6"><a name="08042119000096">Another possibility is that, even at that early stage, the current Prime Minister had an autumn general election in his sights. What better platform to appeal to middle England, he might have thought, than a reduction in the basic rate of income tax? If that were achieved at the expense of those who were less well off, so what? That would, of course, have been an extremely cynical act. Had it been put to the test, I do not think that it would have worked. We all want to better ourselves, but very few of us, if any, want to do so at the expense of those who are less well off than ourselves. If an autumn election had taken place, I do not think that the Prime Minister would have reaped the electoral reward that he may have expected from the policy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o191"><a name="80421-0013.htm_para7"><a name="08042119000097">I am afraid that I cannot put out of my mind the thought that there may have been another, even more unworthy, reason for the Prime Minister&#146;s action. We all remember the flourish with which he finished his Budget speech last year. Without leak or prediction, the reduction in the basic rate of tax was produced, like  <br>

<p><a name="stpa_o192"><a name="80421-0013.htm_para8"><a name="08042119000098">As we all know, the reply to the Budget is given by the Leader of the Opposition. It is often said that it is the most difficult speech in the parliamentary calendar, and as someone who has had the dubious privilege of delivering it on two occasions, I am rather inclined to agree with that assessment. The Leader of the Opposition is not given any notice whatever of the Budget&#146;s proposals. The hon. Member for Taunton missed the point that immediately after the then Chancellor announced that shock, unexpected, unanticipated reduction in the basic rate of tax, my right hon. Friend the Leader of the Opposition had to get to his feet to reply.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o193"><a name="80421-0013.htm_para9"><a name="08042119000099">I am afraid that I cannot entirely escape the thought that at least one reason behind the Prime Minister&#146;s action was the hope and belief that it would wrong-foot and embarrass my right hon. Friend and cause him to stumble at precisely the time when all the media&#146;s attention was upon him, and that that would damage his reputation, possibly even permanently. In the event, that proved a total miscalculation, as has happened so often on other occasions. My right hon. Friend dealt with it with his usual aplomb and the Prime Minister&#146;s arrow conspicuously failed to hit its target.</p>

What was the slogan of which we heard so much early in his premiership? &#147;Not flash, just Gordon&#148;. Well, we know an awful lot more about Gordon now, and I suspect that we will hear an awful lot less of that slogan.</p>

 It is a pleasure to follow the right hon. and learned Member for Folkestone and Hythe (Mr. Howard), although I am not sure that I agree with his analysis. I do not think that when my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister was Chancellor, he would have designed the replacement of an income tax rate simply to wrong-foot the Leader of the Opposition. That is a simplistic scenario. I suggest that he might have decided, wrongly, to try to distance himself from the then Prime Minister and establish his own manifesto before a possible autumn election.</p>

I declare an interest: I am the honorary adviser to the northern Federation of Licensed Victuallers Associations, which, like most people in the pub industry, is concerned about the increases in alcohol duties, particularly that on beer. Duties on other alcohol are not as punitive and are not having the same effect on the pub industry.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o196"><a name="80421-0013.htm_para12"><a name="08042123000003">It is no secret that the pub industry is in trouble. Both the Prime Minister and the Chancellor have been lobbied on the issue a great deal in the not-too-distant past, and there has recently been a flurry of reports on the industry&#146;s problems and the crisis that it faces. Various estimates have been made of the number of pubs that are closing each week in this country, ranging from 30 to 60. Figures have also made the broadsheet press, stating that the last time the volume of beer sold was equivalent to the present was in the 1930s. They also stated that the beer market has fallen by 22 per cent. since its peak in 1979, and beer sales have fallen by 49 per cent. since then. The breweries&#146; profits have decreased by some 78 per cent. There has been a huge decline in beer sales in pubs, and the increases announced in the Budget have increased that problem.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o197"><a name="80421-0013.htm_para13"><a name="08042123000004">One problem that the beer industry faced last year was the smoking ban, which has had an effect on pubs and clubs. The industry has not complained about that and has accepted it, but the Government&#146;s increasing of beer duty has put another nail in the coffin of pubs and clubs around the country.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o198"><a name="80421-0013.htm_para14"><a name="08042123000005">The main problem that our pubs and clubs face is the sale of alcohol in supermarkets, which have targeted alcohol sales as something on which they wish to take over from the pubs. They are in competition with pubs, and at the moment they are winning by selling alcohol at less than the wholesale cost, as a loss leader at a lower price than they pay for it. Alcohol is sold to people who drink at home, in an uncontrolled environment, whereas there are controls on them when they drink in a public house. Pub operators and owners have to operate to codes of practice, whereas people drinking at home can drink as much as they like. If alcohol is extremely cheap, as it is in supermarkets, it is easy for them to do that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o199"><a name="80421-0013.htm_para15"><a name="08042123000006">I am talking not about under-age drinking or sales to minors but about sales to an adult population, particularly those between the ages of 18 and 35, who drink alcohol bought from supermarkets. We have debated the matter before in the House. The phrase used is &#147;pre-loading&#148;: young people drink at home among their friends before they go out to a pub or club. Unfortunately, the drunkenness kicks in at the last licensed premises that they visit. The pubs and clubs get the blame for binge drinking, yet a lot of this drinking is done at home.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o200"><a name="80421-0013.htm_para16"><a name="08042123000007">There has been a call for controls to be placed on such sales by supermarkets to try to make pubs more attractive, to promote them as controlled drinking areas and to prevent them from going out of business in the face of competition from supermarkets and their loss-leaders.</p>

 I am delighted with the terms of the hon. Gentleman&#146;s argument and he is making a very valid point, especially with regard to rural pubs, which have been particularly hard hit by the smoking ban and the increases that we are discussing. They are the heart of our rural communities. Does he agree with me that we are in danger of losing more and more of them, and that that would be bad for our rural communities?</p>

 I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for that and yes, I do agree with him. Attempts have been made to deal with the situation. One initiative aimed at rural pubs used the catchphrase &#147;The pub is the hub&#148;.  <br>


<meta name="Date" content="21 Apr 2008">

<notus-date day="21" month="4" year="2008" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><b>21 Apr 2008 : Column 1109</b><br>
Some rural pubs were given post office counters and internet connections in an effort to attract people there to do business, and to retain the pub as part of the community by allowing it to go further than just selling alcohol. This is a big issue, particularly in rural areas, but even in urban areas pubs are closing at a drastic rate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o201"><a name="80421-0013.htm_para17"><a name="08042123000010">I have referred before to sales promotions in supermarkets, so I shall not dwell on this point. We debated this issue in the House on 6 December, and I gave examples of supermarkets offering cases of beer at the discounted rate of three for the price of two, and three bottles of spirits for the price of two. In one instance, a 75 cl bottle of whisky was sold at &#163;9.99, yet the 1 litre bottle was sold for &#163;10&#151;for an extra penny. It might interest Treasury Front Benchers to know that on the day of this year&#146;s Budget, supermarkets knocked &#163;5 off the price of a bottle of spirits. So whatever the message that the Government were sending out regarding controlling or curbing drinking, the supermarkets cocked a snook at them on that one.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o202"><a name="80421-0013.htm_para18"><a name="08042123000011">Further such examples have been given in debates in the House. Budweiser sold beer to Morrisons supermarkets at &#163;9.82 per case excluding VAT, and Morrisons sold those cases for &#163;10&#151;the same as, or less than, the wholesale cost. The supermarkets are taking the mickey out of the Government and ignoring any message that comes across on safe drinking by selling at a loss.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o203"><a name="80421-0013.htm_para19"><a name="08042123000012">In 1968, a can of Tetley bitter sold at the off-sales at a pub in, say, Yorkshire, where the Tetley brewery is located, for the equivalent of 79p. Today, a can of Tetley bitter costs about 55p. In February 1986, when, VAT was 15 per cent., a pint of Tetley bitter in a pub cost 68p. If we add 2.5 per cent. VAT to bring it up to the present rate and we allow for inflation, that price rises to &#163;1.51. Today, a pint of Tetley bitter is being sold in pubs in Leeds, for example, for between &#163;2.40 and &#163;2.50. Such is the cost to pubs of overheads and so on that they simply cannot compete with the supermarkets. Whereas a pint of Tetley bitter is &#163;2.50 in a pub, it is 55p down the road in the Asda supermarket, for example. We are talking about a figure that is 59 per cent. higher than the retail prices index. This is the competition from supermarkets that pubs are having to deal with.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o204"><a name="80421-0013.htm_para20"><a name="08042123000013">How do the supermarkets get away with that, and how do they fund it? The answer is simple&#151;part of that funding comes from us, the taxpayers. Through the VAT regime, the supermarkets can claim back some of the VAT resulting from such sales. For example, if a pub buys &#163;200 worth of beer, it will try to sell it at a profit to cover its overheads. It pays &#163;35 VAT on the &#163;200 of beer and claims &#163;17.50 back. A supermarket buying &#163;100 worth of alcohol will sell it at &#163;75. The VAT on that figure takes it to &#163;88.12, so it is paying &#163;13.12 in VAT but it claims &#163;17.50 back, just as the pub does. However, the net contribution to the Treasury is &#163;4.38, so the taxpayer is subsidising the supermarkets to sell alcohol at a loss. We are not claiming the full amount of VAT back. After taking into account VAT, the net loss to the supermarket on &#163;100 of alcohol, which it sells at &#163;75, is &#163;20.60. It simply recovers that by increasing the price of goods in the non-VATable area, which, of course, is food. That is another reason why food prices are increasing.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o205"><a name="80421-0013.htm_para21"><a name="08042123000014">That is a rather clumsy example of how VAT works, but if we apply those figures to alcohol sales of some &#163;50 billion in our supermarkets, which are avoiding VAT and requiring us to pay for it, we can see exactly what the Government are losing. If they addressed that fact and claimed some more VAT back off the supermarkets, we would probably not be having the debate on the 10p rate of income tax, as plenty of revenue would be coming in. Something has to be done about how supermarkets can avoid their responsibilities in respect of VAT and sell alcohol as cheaply they do.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o206"><a name="80421-0013.htm_para22"><a name="08042123000015">Another suggestion that has been mooted heavily is to rate supermarkets on the areas in which they sell alcohol on the same basis as pubs&#151;in other words, on turnover, not square footage. The rate that would be paid by a supermarket on the section of it that carries alcohol would be higher than the rate for the rest of it, but on a basis equivalent to a pub.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o207"><a name="80421-0013.htm_para23"><a name="08042123000016">I turn now to an issue that is not covered in the Finance Bill, but which I and other Members think perhaps should have been: VAT on bingo participation fees. Some of my colleagues and I have been lobbying the Government for a number of months on the issue of bingo duty. Just as pubs are closing, so are bingo clubs. Nine have closed already this year, and some 57 closed last year. The bingo industry has made representations to the Government for a number of years regarding what it refers to as</p>
<a name="80421-0013.htm_brev0"><a name="08042123000089"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;the current system of double taxation&#148;</p>

Licensed bingo remains the only gambling product subject to double taxation, which results in an effective tax rate of 28.2 per cent., compared with 15 per cent. for most other gambling products.

<p><a name="stpa_o209"><a name="80421-0013.htm_para25"><a name="08042123000018">I can explain the situation very simply. If a Member of this House goes into a betting shop to put a bet on a horse, they are not charged an entry fee or required to pay anything to place that bet; they simply pay the stake over to the bookmaker, who takes it at a certain set of odds. If a person walks into licensed bingo premises to play bingo, they might be charged for entry or for the bingo card on which they will play the game, and anything that they buy within those premises will also be subject to a charge and to VAT. So bingo operators are subject to VAT and what is known as gross profit tax.</p>

There are some 3 million bingo players at any one time; they continue to be disadvantaged by this system, and bingo clubs continue to close. Bingo is a soft form of gambling that appeals mainly to women, and all constituencies contain bingo clubs. Bingo should not be subject to this level of taxation. We should be encouraging safer forms of gambling, rather than promoting casinos and all the rest of it. I mentioned that there are 3 million bingo players at any one time, but I should also say that the total membership of UK bingo clubs is about 17.5 million people&#151;that is an average of 30,000 members per club. If an hon. Member&#146;s constituency contains a Gala bingo club, the chances are that 30,000 people will be registered as members of it. My local club in Barnsley, Central has 26,000 registered members.</p>

tax from other areas of revenue. The Bingo Association and the bingo industry are therefore saying to the Government, &#147;You&#146;re allowing these clubs to close at an alarming rate, and you&#146;re losing the VAT and other revenues from them. If you waived VAT and stopped the double taxation, you would keep that VAT and you would also get other revenue from people paying tax on other aspects of the clubs.&#148;</p>

 I know that one of the arguments has been that the removal of VAT might require a derogation from the EU, but can the hon. Gentleman confirm that no such derogation is required in terms of gambling or gaming&#151;that matter is purely at the discretion of each state&#151;and that there would be no technical, legal or European obstacle to removing VAT on bingo?</p>

 The hon. Gentleman is right to say that that very technical issue would not require a derogation, because in order to levy VAT on bingo as we do, the Government apply a derogation to the existing European Union legislation. This issue is subject to a court case, known as the Linneweber judgment. I shall not go into that this evening, because it is extremely complicated and I would not want to bore hon. Members rigid by referring to it. In order to remove VAT on bingo duty, we would need an exemption from the exemption that we already have. The issue is complex, but it would not be difficult to remove VAT on bingo. As I have mentioned, the wider aspect is that the Government will lose revenue from the closure of bingo clubs, and our constituents will be deprived of a particular leisure activity.</p>

I hope that the Government will re-examine bingo duty as the Finance Bill goes through Committee.

Like many hon. Members, I have been out campaigning in the local government elections and have been surprised by the representations that I have received on the doorstep, and by the number of letters and emails I have received about this matter. That is mainly because, like other hon. Members who made representations to the Treasury on behalf of constituents, I was assured that this would affect a small number of people at a very small level of income. As it is, that level of income is obviously very important to the people affected, because they are on low incomes, and I cannot understand why a Labour Government have simply not thought this through.</p>

 I am grateful to the former chairman of the Altrincham constituency Labour party for making that point; he may return to that role in the near future. He makes my point for me, because the Budget, and the Finance Bill that seeks to implement it, demonstrated a continuation of business as usual; the same procedure and approach that we have had over a number of years rolled on. Precisely what it failed to do was to respond in any significant way to changed circumstances.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o217"><a name="80421-0014.htm_para3"><a name="08042123000033">The underlying assumption of the past 10 or 11 years is that a high tax burden is sustainable and that the Government can keep taking money out of people&#146;s pockets and it will not hurt and people will not object. The assumption is that that is true for individuals and for companies. We are now starting to find&#151;the story is the same from Labour Members&#151;that such taxes are becoming much more difficult to justify in the difficult circumstances pertaining today when people are up against the credit crunch and worried about whether they can pay their mortgages or whether they will be in stable employment in one or two years&#146; time.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o218"><a name="80421-0014.htm_para4"><a name="08042123000034">The only obvious concession to a new and more difficult economic situation was the six-month delay in the implementation of the fuel duty increase. That is a welcome recognition of the fact that fuel costs are rising for families and businesses, which is creating a competitive problem for UK hauliers, many of whom are competing against continental competition from countries that do not impose such a high fuel duty. However, the Budget was not clear about why the duty rise would have been unacceptable now. If it is because of the overall effect on costs for families or businesses, how will the Government respond if the same, or worse, circumstances appertain in October when they intend to proceed with the duty increase? People need some clarity about whether the Treasury accepts the principle that the costs in UK industry should not be levered up, creating an increasing competitive disadvantage for British businesses. Or was the delay just a response to short-term pressure and intended to get the Chancellor off the hook? Do the Government accept the principle that families are hurting because they have to pay increased fuel costs every week when they fill up their cars&#146; fuel tanks, or was the delay just a short-term fix to put off the moment of reckoning?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o219"><a name="80421-0014.htm_para5"><a name="08042123000035">The same question arises in relation to the abolition of the 10p tax rate. It is welcome that Labour Members are starting to recognise that taxes cannot be increased again and again without consequences. For 11 years, taxes on all our constituents have increased dramatically. The pain has been mitigated, in many cases, by significant increases in salaries, easy credit, and rising house prices, which have given people a sense of security. It has also been mitigated by the hugely complex system of tax credits, which has reduced the impact on some groups of people.</p>

That is welcome, but simplifying taxes when raising or maintaining the overall burden of taxation means that there will inevitably be losers as well as winners, which has also been demonstrated in the changes to capital gains tax.

measures, such as entrepreneurs&#146; relief and the transitional arrangements, because of the damaging effects&#151;some of which were unintended consequences&#151;on some people.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o221"><a name="80421-0014.htm_para7"><a name="08042123000037">With both the capital gains tax regime and the abolition of the 10p rate, I hope that a new understanding is developing on both sides of the House that there is a limit on how much it is fair or sensible to tax people, and that that limit has been reached if not exceeded.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o222"><a name="80421-0014.htm_para8"><a name="08042123000038">Much has also been said about how proper consultation could have helped on the capital gains tax issue. That brings me to my final issue, because I wish to congratulate the Treasury on its sensible and detailed consultation on the proposed tax change to aviation duty. The changes will come into effect in autumn next year, but the paving measures are in this Finance Bill. The intention is to move from air passenger duty to aviation duty. The consultation document released in January was a serious and thorough exploration of the options and some of the difficulties arising from the proposal. I suspect that by now, with the consultation drawing to a close on Thursday of this week, Ministers will have begun to arrive at some conclusions. It will be clear, for example, that applying aviation duty to freight could lead to significant problems for the UK air freight industry. It could lead to significant job losses, especially in some parts of the country, such as the area around East Midlands airport. It could lead to the diversion of air freight from UK airports to near continental airports, and that will not save any emissions. Instead, it will increase road haulage and the environmental impact caused by the transhipment of freight by road. It will also transfer thousands of British jobs to other EU competitor countries, and that will clearly not be beneficial to the British economy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o223"><a name="80421-0014.htm_para9"><a name="08042123000039">The document also goes into sufficient detail about some of the other difficulties that might arise. The first obvious answer is to exempt freight-only flights, but not all flights carrying freight are freight-only flights. Passengers and freight are often carried on the same aircraft.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o224"><a name="80421-0014.htm_para10"><a name="08042123000040">The second conclusion that is difficult to escape is that applying a distance criterion to aviation duty discriminates in favour of short-haul routes and against longer haul routes. Short-haul routes tend to give rise to the most emissions, which are concentrated during take-off and landing. Therefore, mile for mile, applying a distance criterion has a perverse effect.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o225"><a name="80421-0014.htm_para11"><a name="08042123000041">Thirdly, the inability to apply the charge to movements other than those that originate at UK airports would encourage the use of aviation hubs outside the UK. All the same aviation would take place, so there would be no environmental benefit. People would take short-haul flights from UK airports to Schiphol or Paris to transfer to their long-haul flights. All that that would achieve is to damage Britain&#146;s strategic economic interests by undermining UK hubs.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o226"><a name="80421-0014.htm_para12"><a name="08042123000042">Fourthly, the duty could have a damaging effect on regional airports. It could therefore increase the pressures on and congestion at Heathrow and other airports in the south-east of England.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o227"><a name="80421-0014.htm_para13"><a name="08042123000043">Fifthly, an up-front charge, unrelated to demand and the number of people on board a flight, would make it much harder to establish new long-haul routes from  <br>

regional airports. I have a particular interest in Manchester airport, which is very close to my constituency. When long-haul services from regional airports are established, they often depend on relatively low volumes of use in the early stages, and putting a charge on the flight when the service is first inaugurated could render them uneconomic and uncompetitive, and might also lead to a diversion of traffic to the more congested airports in the south-east. </p>

<p><a name="stpa_o228"><a name="80421-0014.htm_para14"><a name="08042123000044">Sixthly, basing the duty on the maximum take-off weight of the aircraft provides no incentive to invest in cleaner aircraft. Furthermore, while the shift to a duty based on air movements rather than passenger numbers is superficially attractive, the change could lead to higher emissions rather than lower emissions for all the above reasons. Given that the whole of aviation will, we hope, be included in the European emissions trading scheme within a relatively short period of time&#151;that ought to cover the environmental costs of the industry&#151;we are not talking about a provision that will have an environmental benefit. In fact, the new tax might defeat many of the objects that it purports to achieve.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o229"><a name="80421-0014.htm_para15"><a name="08042123000045">Finally, the proposals might actually breach international law. They might be contrary to the Chicago convention and the EU-US aviation agreement. For all those reasons, I hope that the Government will learn something from the numerous problems in their application of tax policy and tax changes in recent months. I hope that they will reflect on the fact that where they have not consulted, they have come unstuck. They have had to engage in some embarrassing changes in policy. They have had to execute some U-turns and have looked unprofessional and unco-ordinated in doing so. When they have engaged in some consultation but have not taken proper account of its findings, they have had further difficulties.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o230"><a name="80421-0014.htm_para16"><a name="08042123000046">In this case, the Government are consulting. They have given themselves a reasonable time. They do not need to finalise the details of the duty regime until this autumn in order to give the 12 months&#146; notice that they have promised the industry for implementation in November 2009. They have time to think again and to consider the implications of what they are doing. I strongly urge them to do so.</p>

That equates to a &#163;10 billion black hole in their economic plans on top of the &#163;10 billion in unfunded tax pledges. Support in the Budget included the additional one-off payment in 2008-09 of &#163;100 alongside the winter fuel payment for the households of those aged over 80, and of &#163;50 for the households of those aged over 60. That will benefit about 9 million households. The increase in the first child rate of child benefit to &#163;20 a week from April 2009 reinforces our Government&#146;s commitment to child benefit as a foundation of financial support for all families. The increase in the child element of the child tax credit of &#163;50 a year above indexation from April next year will further help low to middle-income families.</p>

It was precisely that reckless approach to public finances that saw the last Tory Administration inflict on hard-working families across Britain interest rates at levels that reached 15 per cent.

 I thank the hon. Gentleman for his intervention. The current and the previous Chancellor have obviously watched the increase very carefully in recent years. If the price of crude oil was seriously to increase, and crept up towards $200 a barrel, we would need to look at the issue in its entirety. It is for all of us seriously to consider where we are going as a nation, and whether we will be held to ransom by oil producers. The Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries is not at present considering increasing output; if it did, the price of oil would fall, so we are, to a certain extent, being held to ransom.</p>

That is a major issue for some pensioner households. Earlier, I intervened on the hon. Member for Taunton (Mr. Browne); he has not stayed around to hear the end of the story that I told him, but I am sure that he will read <i> Hansard </i>enthusiastically tomorrow. I told him that within two or three weeks of the Budget last year, a number of colleagues and I met the then Chancellor of the Exchequer, now the Prime Minister, to discuss various aspects of the Budget.

In recent weeks, we have read in newspapers, seen on TV and heard on the radio that many households and individuals will be adversely affected, including women pensioners under 65, those who have retired early on the grounds of ill health, and wage-earning households where there is an income of under &#163;18,000 and no recourse to tax credits to offset some of the loss.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o242"><a name="80421-0015.htm_para0"><a name="08042123000063">The tax credit system has to be improved; that  may be the best way of putting it. In an intervention  on my right hon. Friend the Member for West Dunbartonshire (John McFall), I made the point that far too many families have fallen foul of the system and ended up having to repay some of the tax credit that was awarded to them. Let us imagine someone on a low income, earning barely more than the national minimum wage, working hard and taking the opportunity to do a little bit of extra overtime. Months down the line, that may put their figures out of kilter, and it may mean that they receive an overpayment. In some cases, such people have unfortunately fallen foul of the tax credit system. They are then very reluctant to go back to it. That is a tragedy, because tax credits have removed so many families and children from poverty. I raised that issue with the former Chancellor shortly after the Budget statement last year, and I have also raised it twice in the past three months or so with the current Chancellor. He understood, and made it abundantly clear that he had been lobbied on the issue, particularly as regards the issue of women pensioners under the age of 65.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o243"><a name="80421-0015.htm_para1"><a name="08042123000064">I am somewhat perturbed by some of the stories  that the press have run. As well as dealing with constituents through correspondence, I have also  taken the time to pick up the phone and call them in the evening, so that I can understand what their difficulties are. I have been astounded by the number of pensioners over 65 who have believed everything that has been in the press. They have not recognised the fact that there has been an increase in their personal allowance, which will more than likely take many of them out of the tax-paying bracket. That has not been helpful. I tell my right hon. Friend the Financial Secretary to the Treasury that I suspect that in many working households, people in the low-earning  bracket, who have not yet received their April salary, do not yet realise the impact that the measures may have on them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o244"><a name="80421-0015.htm_para2"><a name="08042123000065">How did we get where we are? The figure of 5.3 million has been quoted regularly today, but I am not desperately concerned about the exact figure, because I come from a background where if people on low incomes are being adversely affected, we have to do something about it. Whether we are talking about 5.3 million people or a few hundred, it matters. There are people who will find it much more difficult to make their household budget meet their needs. I tell my right hon. Friend that we have a problem, and we, as a Labour Government, need to put it right. It really does not matter how we try to dress things up, or what the facts are. If a pensioner pays an extra &#163;1 a week, or &#163;52 a year, we may try to offset that with a winter heating allowance increase, but the reality is that that does not matter to them. All that they are concerned about is the fact that they are paying additional income tax.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o245"><a name="80421-0015.htm_para3"><a name="08042123000066">I am greatly concerned by the fact that our problem&#151;I do see it as a problem&#151;is not easily resolved; there is no quick fix. Earlier, the hon. Member for Buckingham (John Bercow) suggested that an increase in the national minimum wage would help low-wage earners. Yes, it would, but that is no good for women pensioners under 65 years of age, or anyone who has retired early on the grounds of ill health. The matter is much more complex than that.

Given that she represents a Yorkshire constituency, I would have thought that she would have known a little more about how to judge a wicket. It seems to me that she was on a particularly sticky wicket today, and I expected her to respond accordingly. However, my judgment of her words was that she thought that the wicket would take a bit of spin, and I found that disappointing.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o247"><a name="80421-0015.htm_para5"><a name="08042123000077">I want to talk about what is missing from the Finance Bill and what should be put in on Report. I want to concentrate on three issues: the rising costs of regulation faced by business generally; the increasing tax burden borne by small and medium-sized enterprises, particularly small ones; and the personal debt faced by many of the poorest in our community, for whom the cutting of the 10p tax rate will cause considerable hardship.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o248"><a name="80421-0015.htm_para6"><a name="08042123000078">I have spoken about regulation on a number of occasions and the issue is well rehearsed among many other Members. It is almost a truism now to say that the cost of regulation is hitting business hard. Much of that regulation is increased tax regulation, with which the Bill is particularly concerned. The Chancellor&#146;s inability&#151;or unwillingness; call it what you will&#151;to simplify that tax burden for business generally is a sizeable omission. I do not need to repeat that the British Chambers of Commerce recognises that the cost of regulation under this Government has now risen to &#163;66 billion&#151;a massive burden for business, given the global challenge that is emanating from Brazil, India and China. In addition, the statutory instrument statistics for 2007 made it clear that 14 new regulations were enacted by the Government every working day. Many of them impact on business. Finally, the Federation of Small Businesses said that, on average, small businesses spend seven hours a week on red tape and paperwork.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o249"><a name="80421-0015.htm_para7"><a name="08042123000079">Those are tremendous burdens on a business economy to which we are looking to provide the real challenge on which our children and grandchildren will rely for their well-being in 20, 30 and 40 years&#146; time.

I could read them out, but I do not think that you, Mr. Deputy Speaker, would want me to do so, given that time is limited. However, the Treasury Committee grabbed on to the fact that we need to simplify our tax system and get burdens off the backs of businesses, particularly small ones.</p>

how the Government, in my humble opinion, are going wrong. The National Audit Office said that the monitoring regulations for small schemes were not well developed and that there was no assessment of the impact of Small Business Service expertise on the development of regulation. Indeed, the Government went on to argue that they would cut the number of small business support schemes from the estimated 3,000 in existence at that time to 100.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o252"><a name="80421-0015.htm_para10"><a name="08042123000082">Way back in March last year, I asked the Treasury how many schemes had been cut, how many had been consolidated and how many were in existence then as a result of the reduction. Secondly, I asked what assessment had been made of the effectiveness of the schemes, but I am afraid that I got no answer. I tabled a written question on the issue on 3 April this year, which means that I was due an answer this morning. Sadly, I did not receive an answer to the important question of how many schemes have been reduced, how many are now in existence and the Government&#146;s assessment of their effectiveness. My guess is that I will not receive an answer, although I hope that the Minister will give me it tonight. Unless the Government effectively assess what they do, they cannot do anything effectively; the premise is simple. My concern about the Bill is that nothing in it tells me that the Government are assessing properly. I shall talk more about that in a little while.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o253"><a name="80421-0015.htm_para11"><a name="08042123000083">I move on to taxation. I can say from my own experience that the business sector is not getting the message that the Government are business friendly. In fact, it is becoming increasingly concerned about the Government&#146;s attitude when it comes to real measures rather than words. There has been a capital gains tax increase from 10 per cent. to 18 per cent.&#151;an 80 per cent. increase. I welcome entrepreneurial relief, but many entrepreneurs are still being put off from starting, developing and growing businesses. We need to recognise the impact of such increased taxation on small businesses particularly. What assessment has been made of that increase, and what effect do the Minister and the Government generally feel that the increase will have on small business start-ups and on the businesses that might leave these shores as a result of increased taxation? Capital gains tax plays a particular role in that respect. It is estimated that the Exchequer yield from increased capital gains tax will be &#163;250 million in 2008-09, &#163;300 million in 2009-10 and &#163;500 million in 2010-11. However, it does not seem to assess what the cost impact will be in real terms. If it does, I will be happy for the Minister to prove me wrong later, but I bet that I do not get a proper answer.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o254"><a name="80421-0015.htm_para12"><a name="08042123000084">An example of the impact of Government thinking on small businesses is that of income shifting. Many small businesses run by husband and wife teams will recognise the value of consultation undertaken by the Government after due pressure and will be equally pleased that this measure has been put off until 2009, but there is fear about the bureaucracy that will be enacted at that time. Anybody who has been involved in a small business and knows about the impact of such bureaucracy will understand that fear. It will mean all sorts of double accounting for husband and wife teams.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o255"><a name="80421-0015.htm_para13"><a name="08042123000085">My main concern, however, is that the Government seem to believe that every small business is out to twist the taxman.

speech to recognise that that was the underlying theme of this move. The truth of the matter is that most people in small businesses are, frankly, too damn busy&#151;I apologise if that is unparliamentary language, Madam Deputy Speaker&#151;earning a living and creating and developing their businesses to have the time to think about dishonesty with the taxman. In fact, they are quite fearful of the taxman and want to be honest because they do not want him on their backs. I do not understand why the Government think that small businesses are out to cheat them. Again on assessment, it would be nice to know what is the economic advantage to the Treasury. Has that figure been worked out? Are we putting a massive burden on small business generally for very little return to the Treasury simply because this Government do not trust business? If so, business knows the answer and will know how to act.</p>

It is all about weekly cash flow, and the problem is that the Government&#146;s proposals will affect that. There lies the hidden problem that they have not understood. I wonder whether they have assessed the impact of that weekly necessity to repay debt and how that relates to the abolition of the 10p tax rate. If so, perhaps the Minister will tell me what it is. That is a serious matter that has not been considered and needs to be.</p>

It has brought despair to would-be first-time buyers, because there was no help for them. It has turned off entrepreneurs and depressed business managers. It has made the poor poorer. Sadly, all this is from a Minister who has bailed out bankers who have caused their own problems, and caused problems for this country, not only by allowing increased personal debt but by acting in the most irresponsible manner imaginable. There are parameters to controlling any sector of business, and, by golly, there is an immediate need to look at the finance sector.</p>

He hid behind the technical defence&#151;I think, Madam Deputy Speaker, that you were asked about it in several repetitious points of order&#151;that the Opposition cannot table amendments to make positive suggestions on the Budget. That is not what the Opposition are duty bound to do if they are suggesting, as the right hon. Member for Witney suggests, that the abolition of the 10p tax rate is wrong. What the Opposition can do, and I invite the hon. Member for Fareham (Mr. Hoban) to do this in his winding-up speech, is tell us their policy.

 The hon. Gentleman&#146;s memory is short. During the 10 years that my right hon.

One of the only economies that survived and prospered was this one. The Chancellor was entitled to take some credit for the stability and growth that this Government brought forward from 1997.</p>

reasons: low interest rates, in contradistinction to circumstances when other credit crunches caused severe recession, pain, negative equity and so on; low inflation; and high and improving levels of employment, a point made earlier by my hon.

He comments on the circumstances of credit crunches and squeezes in the past, and analyses three or four previous examples. In summary, he says that, on each and every one of those occasions, the credit crunch lasted for a certain period and was then over, with the economy back on an even keel. He measured three previous credit squeezes as lasting between six and 18 months. He said that we are already seven months into the current credit squeeze, which began roughly in August last year, and, unless those previous historical circumstances&#151;I am talking not about pre-history but about events in the 1990s, 1980s and 1970s&#151;are completely different from our position now, he guesstimates that we will get through it very soon or a little later.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o274"><a name="80421-0016.htm_para8"><a name="08042128000023">David Smith therefore says that there are two sets of circumstances.

help those small businesses to talk up the credit crunch or talk down the economy&#151;the real economy. David Smith also says that some of the conversations about the credit crunch are divorced from the way in which the real economy works. The small businesses about which the hon.

Members of all parties refer to the Institute for Fiscal Studies. One of its leading economists said that there are basically three solutions and that, in simple terms, two are simply not affordable. The one that is left is to mitigate the effect on the so-called 5.3 million. The effect cannot be reversed, as the Opposition suggest, but mitigated. Labour Members have pointed out the problem with mitigation, but we have received no help from Opposition Members, who refuse to say what they would do instead. The problem is that several separate components of the electorate are differently affected by the removal of the 10p tax rate, so that mitigation for one sector might not assist another. The House must consider that seriously. My right hon. Friend and neighbour the Member for Birkenhead (Mr. Field) may table an amendment to try to address the mitigation aspect, but could fall into the trap of not dealing with the matter for every one of the 5.3 million. We should not, as the hon. Member for Tatton said about a different matter, rush to judgment.</p>

The Chancellor told us earlier that he would give the banks &#163;50 billion in Treasury bills in return, at least in part, for US credit card debt; there are tens of billions of Treasury bills in Northern Rock now; there will be &#163;581 billion of cumulative deficit next year&#151;that is in the Red Book, as is next year&#146;s &#163;43 billion of debt, and there will be &#163;189 billion of private finance initiative liability, most of it off balance sheet.

</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o278"><a name="80421-0016.htm_para12"><a name="08042128000030">The clearest indication that we have had of that limited room for manoeuvre is the detail in the Bill, which is another smash-and-grab raid. The Government will take &#163;2 billion extra from business, including &#163;200 million extra from business in Scotland, in the next three years. I will come to the detail of that, but there is also the abolition of the 10p rate. I do not want to claim credit for being the first person to notice that in last year&#146;s Budget, but I should like to put it on the record that I mentioned it in my speech on Budget day. </p>

<p><a name="stpa_o279"><a name="80421-0016.htm_para13"><a name="08042128000031">The Finance Bill sees the Government scrambling around for every penny that they can get from business and people&#146;s pockets to plug the holes in the books. I have outlined some of those holes to the hon. Gentleman and will return to them later. The Bill also takes its lead from policy decisions in the previous Budget and the pre-Budget report, which the CBI estimated would take some &#163;5 billion from business, straight into the black hole of the Exchequer. That is the clearest indication that, after 10 years of relatively benign international conditions, relatively stable if unspectacular growth and reasonable inflation, there is nothing left in the tank. Debt levels are far too high and there is no cash reserve to allow the Government to do what is necessary to stimulate the economy when the downturn comes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o280"><a name="80421-0016.htm_para14"><a name="08042128000032">Ministers have said that there is stuff in the Budget and the Finance Bill for business, but where are the measures genuinely to increase investment in research and development? We know that such investment is relatively low in the UK, at about 1.8 per cent. of GDP, as I have said before. Our main competitors have a higher rate, and in Scotland the figure is very low indeed. The Government have done little in the Budget or the Finance Bill to assist R and D. Ministers may point to the small and medium-sized enterprise R and D tax credit increases, as well as the general R and D tax credit increases, from previous Budget measures. That will cost the Exchequer some &#163;70 million this year, and that goes to business; however, that is taken away from business, in yield to the Exchequer, either by the changes to the integral fixtures capital allowances, which will bring in &#163;70 million, or the first year of the phased abolition of the industrial buildings allowance, which brings in &#163;75 million. There is therefore no net gain for business from doing the R and D that they want, and they will have to find the cash to pay for those outgoings.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o281"><a name="80421-0016.htm_para15"><a name="08042128000033">By increasing taxes&#151;the small companies rate of corporation tax in particular&#151;and refusing to reconsider proposed changes to capital gains tax, the Government are taking more tax from business at a time when they are making it potentially more difficult to secure investment. I am certain that those measures will worsen the situation in manufacturing, which has seen 1 million jobs lost in the UK since 1997, including 100,000 lost in Scotland and 34,000 lost since 2002.</p>

transportation and raw material costs, will worsen the balance of trade problem. We are talking about an &#163;87 billion deficit in our trade in goods and a &#163;70 billion deficit in our overall balance of trade, which is up &#163;10 billion from &#163;77 billion in the past full year. That deficit affects our ability to grow GDP. Since 2000, we have seen a suppression of GDP of around 0.25 to 0.5 per cent. every year. That means that UK GDP has grown by &#163;30 billion less than it would have, had trade been in balance, which equates to about &#163;1,000 per household. That is another matter that should have been addressed in the Budget and the Finance Bill, but which has not been.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o283"><a name="80421-0016.htm_para17"><a name="08042128000035">The Chief Secretary also argued that the Finance Bill was a Finance Bill for the environment&#151;that was when she was actually talking about the Bill. I am not sure whether the Government are right about that. The Bill will defer the April rise in fuel duty until the autumn, which is to be welcomed, but from next year there will be a 1.84p per litre rise and a 0.5p per litre rise above indexation from 2010, as well as a swingeing new vehicle excise duty regime.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o284"><a name="80421-0016.htm_para18"><a name="08042128000036">My hon. Friends and I have no objection to using price to discourage unnecessary journeys, to encourage public transport or to encourage freight off the roads, which everyone in the House agrees is sensible. However, many of the Government&#146;s measures ignore the fact that so many journeys, of both people and freight, are wholly necessary and that in many areas there is often no alternative. With the Government already taking in excess of 60 per cent. of the price of a litre of fuel in duty and VAT, it remains outrageous that, when there is a windfall, particularly in VAT, and when there is spiking of prices at the pump, that money is not used to moderate the price of fuel.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o285"><a name="80421-0016.htm_para19"><a name="08042128000037">I hope at some stage to be able to table amendments to the Bill to do a number of things. The first would be to introduce a fuel tax regulator, in order to use the VAT windfall, first to help generally, secondly to assist remote rural areas, and thirdly and most importantly &#151;I hope that this will command support&#151;to assist the road haulage industry, which is being hammered and is even contractually unable to pass on the fuel prices it is having to pay.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o286"><a name="80421-0016.htm_para20"><a name="08042128000038">The second thing that I would like is for the Government to reconsider possible exemptions for working 4x4 vehicles from the new high rates of VED. The Chief Secretary said that growth is continuing, but at a much lower rate than previously forecast. The impact of the lower growth is that Government receipts are forecast to be down &#163;1.2 billion from the pre-Budget report. That did not stop the Chancellor, like his predecessor, boasting about growth in the UK economy. However, it is worth reminding ourselves &#151;particularly the hon. Member for Wirral, West, who believes that this is the best of all possible worlds&#151;that average growth in the OECD has outshone that of the UK in half of the past 10 years and that low-tax economies such as Ireland&#146;s have outshone the UK every year since Labour came to power.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o287"><a name="80421-0016.htm_para21"><a name="08042128000039">As ever, the Chancellor, like his predecessors, ignored the quarterly downturns in the Scottish economy and the many low and flat growth quarters under the Government&#146;s watch. Indeed, average growth in Scotland has been 30 per cent. lower than in the UK over the past 25 years, yet there was nothing in either the Budget or the Finance Bill to assist.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o288"><a name="80421-0016.htm_para22"><a name="08042128000040">One of the few areas where the Budget indicated revenue growth was from the North sea. There was an increased tax yield from the North sea, which was based on an average price at the Budget of $83.60 a barrel of oil, which is an increase on the $68 a barrel forecast in the pre-Budget report. As I pointed out at the time, four out of the five closing prices for oil in the week running up to the Budget were record closing prices. The price on Budget day was $94 a barrel, but it has now smashed through the $100 a barrel price. It is worth noting that the Budget forecast &#163;56 billion in revenues over the next six years, as compared with &#163;38 billion over the previous six-year forecast. That massive windfall alone should act as an encouragement for the Government to consider how we might deploy some of the extra revenue generated for a fuel tax regulator, to help people in remote rural areas in particular and the road haulage industry.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o289"><a name="80421-0016.htm_para23"><a name="08042128000041">Many Ministers and Government Back Benchers&#151;the ones loyal to the Government, that is&#151;have argued that the Finance Bill was a Bill for stability. Obviously the Budget was so dull and the Bill so appalling that the only watchword that they could come up with was &#147;stability&#148;. However, the Bill and the Budget will not provide stability. They are designed to do one thing: to fill the holes in the UK books. There was &#163;37.6 billion of debt, with &#163;43 billion forecast for next year. There was a cumulative debt of &#163;541 billion last year, with a debt of &#163;581 billion forecast this year. The PFI liability last year was &#163;179 billion, with &#163;189 billion of PFI liability this year, for&#151;from memory&#151;only &#163;60 billion of capital projects. That is why our First Minister, my right hon. Friend the Member for Banff and Buchan (Mr. Salmond), described PFI as hyper-expensive and a hyper-waste of money.

rate; they have not done that. They could also have looked again at the plans on capital gains tax, but they have not done so. The Finance Bill will take more money from business. Ministers will say that the baseline capital gains tax rate has been reduced, and that is absolutely correct. That will save business about &#163;5.5 billion. However, almost every penny of that will be clawed back by the changes to general plant and machinery capital allowances. Indeed, this year and next year, the changes to those allowances will outstrip the benefit of the 2p reduction in the basic rate of corporation tax. Businesses will gain no net benefit by investing in their business or their people or, most importantly at this time, by absorbing the increases in the cost of fuel, energy, transportation and raw materials.</p>

 That is absolutely right, and the same argument applies to the new annual allowance. That is why we in Scotland are delighted that the Scottish National party Government have either slashed or removed the business rates for 150,000 small companies.

It is one of the few success stories in terms of real exports and real balance of trade surplus. The decision might also damage the industry abroad. When whisky manufacturers, companies, marketers and wholesalers go abroad to argue the case that another country has a discriminatory regime against Scotch, those other countries could turn round and say, &#147;So what?

The tax, whether it be on wine, beer, cider or spirits, should be levied on the basis of the alcohol content. That would create an absolutely level playing field, irrespective of the type of alcoholic drink.</p>

 I think that the hon. Gentleman will be pleased that he has given way to me, because I entirely support what he is saying. The latest research shows that a lot of binge drinking involves people being served supersized measures of wine in wine bars. They are deliberately given larger measures in order to make more profit, and the profit is greater because the wine is not taxed in the same way as beer and spirits. Might not the hon. Gentleman&#146;s proposal for more equitable taxation also be of benefit in that regard?</p>

 It is utterly unsustainable for people in my hon. Friend&#146;s constituency and in other remote rural areas throughout the UK. We cannot have parts of the UK paying 33 per cent.&#151;a third&#151;more for a litre of diesel or petrol, which is quite extraordinary. The impact in some remote rural areas, where it happens to be particularly cold among other things, is even worse; the hon.

For the first time, we saw child benefit for the first child rise by only 70p and the second child by 45p. I know that it is planned for it to rise to &#163;20 in future years, but when the Minister sums up, I would be grateful if she would explain where the Government intend it to go. Those annual rises&#151;a tin of juice or a packet of crisps for the second child&#151;are really very low. Likewise, the extra &#163;50 winter fuel allowance is welcome, but I am already talking to pensioners who are saying that that amount has been gobbled up already. I hope that at some point, the Government could commit either to making the allowance permanent, which it is not at the moment, or, better still, to rolling up lots of these allowances and delivering a proper living citizens pension.</p>

In addition, they have significantly enhanced the incomes of the poorest households, right across the board, through a combination of tax credits, pension credit, the national minimum wage and improving training skills for employment. That is a thoroughly good and reputable record, and it would be a tragedy if the good will that comes from that substantial gain to the poorer half or quarter of society were undermined by this unfortunate mishap over the abolition of the 10p tax rate.</p>

 The hon. Member for Beverley and Holderness (Mr. Stuart) pointed to the fact that many single working people who do not receive any tax credits are in relative poverty because the economy  has expanded, and the upper echelons are therefore  earning much more than they did before. Should the Government not seriously consider the trade unions&#146; recommendation that the minimum wage should be 50 per cent. of the median wage in the country? That would have started it off at &#163;5 an hour, and would now be giving people enough money not to be in poverty even if they were single.</p>

 I have always been a supporter of the national minimum wage. Fifteen or 20 years ago, when I was a Back Bencher, I promoted a private Member&#146;s Bill proposing its introduction before it was finally introduced by this Government. The rate appears to be slowly increasing&#151;it is now &#163;5.52 an hour&#151;and I believe that, without any loss of employment, it could rapidly be raised to &#163;6.50 and probably to &#163;7.

To concentrate the gain on those in need&#151;the Institute for Fiscal Studies spoke of 5.3 million losers; I do not know whether that is the exact figure, but the number is clearly substantial&#151;one obvious mechanism would be to limit the restoration to poorer taxpayers and those who pay the standard rate of tax. As about 12 per cent. of taxpayers pay the higher rate, that would immediately recoup &#163;2.4 billion. The problem would be how to raise the remaining &#163;4.2 billion. There are several ways in which we could make the tax system a whole lot fairer, and I hope that in Committee next week we can examine amendments suggesting how that could be done.</p>

It is inconceivable that, on average, their portfolios are changed in total once every 50 years. In fact, it is known that the average market holding at that time was only 14 months.

the London stock exchange. Even if individuals traded their portfolios only half as frequently as the actual recorded rate, every 14 months&#151;and we can be certain that that would be an underestimate of the degree to which they trade&#151;if the proceeds were collected, stopping evasion would still raise the revenue take by at least &#163;4 billion a year. Collection could be guaranteed by a requirement for automatic declaration by the stockbroker of all such deals.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o305"><a name="80421-0017.htm_para12"><a name="08042128000080">Another remarkable fact is that nearly half all commercial property in the UK&#151;I think the exact figure is 45 per cent.&#151;is now owned by foreign nationals. I have no objection to that. Yet they are unlikely to pay UK tax on their UK property sales, unlike the practice in many other countries where non-residents do pay tax on their property gains. In addition to the revenue lost, that distorts the UK market. Closing this gap by charging capital gains tax on the sales of foreign holdings could well form a second strand of the strategy. Property disposals in 2004-05, in the latest information we have, accounted for nearly a third of all reported capital gains, amounting to &#163;5.3 billion. That suggests that the gains to foreign property owners amounted to some &#163;2.4 billion. Eighteen per cent. capital gains tax would yield nearly a further &#163;0.5 billion.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o306"><a name="80421-0017.htm_para13"><a name="08042128000081">My third point is this. It may not be realised that a fifth of all financial assets sold and subject to capital gains tax have been held for less than a year. Gains in terms of liability to capital gains tax, however, are meant to arise on investments, which, by definition, are usually meant to be long-term holdings. Those arising from short-term trades are likely not to have arisen from investments at all. It is clearly right that the profit in that case should be subject to income tax. More than &#163;1 billion of chargeable gains was declared on these disposals in 2004-05 and the percentage rate was only 13 per cent.&#151;a far lower proportion of profit compared with disposals as a whole, which amounted to 52 per cent. Ending that anomaly could also provide the third arm of recoupment for the Treasury and would yield at least a further &#163;0.5 billion.</p>

Of course I would be the first to say that there are many other options that the Chancellor could equally consider. I want to mention one or two of them very quickly.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o308"><a name="80421-0017.htm_para15"><a name="08042128000083">Recent research prepared by Richard Murphy, one of the country&#146;s foremost tax experts, found that the 50 largest UK companies almost always pay 5 per cent. less tax on average than they declare on their accounts. As a result, the actual corporation tax rate paid by these UK companies in 2006 was 22.5 per cent., when the rate set by Parliament was 30 per cent. By the end of 2006, the cumulative tax savings recorded in the accounts of the 50 largest companies amounted to no less than a staggering &#163;47 billion from deferred tax charges for which no date of payment is set. The amount actually exceeded the total tax paid by all companies in 2006 by some &#163;2 billion.</p>

We should not be looking to punish those who are hard-working and who are already struggling with bills, yet that is exactly what the abolition of the 10p rate does; it doubles the tax on those on low incomes, and it is a direct result of this Government&#146;s plans.</p>

Why did he do that? Was it to discomfort the Leader of the Opposition for a moment&#151;was he really looking for that brief glimpse of instability on the Conservative Benches? Was it because, after 10 years at the Treasury, he simply did not understand the impact, when he had been given the reports that clearly stated&#151;he did have this information&#151;that 5.3 million people would be affected, including a lot of those with least and those who had been least well served by the changes made by the Government during his time?

In my speech, I plan to examine this Finance Bill in the context of that mission to improve the lot of hard-working people, and particularly the working poor. The Government have delivered some noticeable successes. The minimum wage dreamt of by Keir Hardie was implemented without the dire employment impacts initially forecast from the Opposition Benches. Economic growth has continued year on year, and employment has grown&#151;even if at a slightly lower rate than under the previous Government of John Major.</p>

During his time as Chancellor, he used the tax and benefit system to increase the average incomes of the poorest tenth of the population by 12 per cent. and cut those of the richest tenth by 6 per cent. Even if he was not allowed to say it in public, he did redistribute wealth. He set ambitious targets for the elimination of child and fuel poverty, and consistently championed his flagship new deal programme.</p>

The difference between the two sides of the House is the methods of carrying out that programme; that is what separates us. The Opposition never arrogate moral superiority over Labour Members.

What is especially good about the Budget is that it balances a slight increase in fuel duty with a significant reduction in income tax. That is the way forward and, for the first time in 11 years, the Government have started to take seriously the important message about shifting the burden of taxation from the bads to the goods, reducing taxation on income and labour and increasing taxation on pollution, and I welcome that. I am just desperately sorry that the official Opposition, who have tried over the past two years to identify themselves opportunistically with the politics of climate change and the environment, are silent on the really important measures in the Budget.</p>

 My constituency has many low-income families and the focus of my concern is the tax credit system that is supposed to bridge the gap for those on lower incomes when the 10 per cent. band is removed. Other measures will help to bridge the gap, but they will not be introduced until April 2009. They also rely on people applying for and using tax credits. That is a shift from taxing people on income and earnings to the benefit system.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o338"><a name="80421-0019.htm_para0"><a name="08042135000048">Instead of a starting rate of tax that helps hard-working individuals and families, we will have a benefits system that is complicated and burdensome, especially for some of the sorts of families we are talking about. I take as an example a family in my constituency&#151;other hon. Members will have many more examples&#151;in which both parents are working. Do we want to encourage them to work and to earn money with a lower starting rate, or do we want them to spend their free time continually fiddling with child tax credit applications and becoming more and more dependent on a benefit culture?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o339"><a name="80421-0019.htm_para1"><a name="08042135000049">I want to run past the House some research that illustrates the inefficiency of the processing of tax credits, but before I do I want to pay tribute&#151;as would quite a few other people, I would guess&#151;to the staff on the tax credit hotline and the staff at HMRC, who always had a difficult system to deal with. We have all met constituents&#151;we have sat in their homes surrounded by piles and piles of relevant paperwork&#151;who are trying to make head or tail of their statements and the various amendments. They are unable to persuade the powers that be that they spent overpaid tax credits in good faith. As we all know, those overpayments are often the result of errors on the part of HMRC, and the many people trying to cope with the complicated system.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o340"><a name="80421-0019.htm_para2"><a name="08042135000050">There is a dilemma. Should we recover the taxpayers&#146; money that was paid in error to hard-working families who went on to spend that money on essentials, also in error, or should we write off that money, which came from taxes paid by other hard-working families and individuals?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o341"><a name="80421-0019.htm_para3"><a name="08042135000051">One reason for highlighting the plight of my constituent, who lives in a tower block and does their best with young children, is that the last thing that working families want to do is to spend additional time fiddling around applying for tax credits and benefits. Shifting the balance from the 10 per cent. rate to tax credits does not help working families. Some families I have met have variable incomes and have multiple jobs to make ends meet. They certainly do not benefit from a shift from the 10 per cent. rate to a need to make tax credit applications, which they must change every time there is a minute adjustment in their employment arrangements. One of my constituents told me that a tax credit office adviser had told them to try to have only one job as it would simplify the tax credits situation. That seems pretty crazy.</p>

The taxpayer is already owed about &#163;4 billion in overpaid credits, and solving the problem through further use of the woefully inefficient system perfectly highlights the shift towards a long-term benefits-based system that reduces the impetus for people to work. My constituents are paying for the increased inefficiency in the tax credit benefit system, having the burden of the system imposed on them or avoiding the situation altogether because it is too complicated for them to deal with.</p>

In a way, I feel quite sorry for the Government. If the tax credit system had been more competently designed and managed, large numbers of families up and down the country would have been indebted to them for the additional income. As it is, millions of taxpayers are now oblivious to the amount of their money that has been washed down the drain through incompetence. Many thousands of families who are entitled to tax credits are feeling pretty fed up. Those who fund them through their taxes are becoming more aware of the cost and inefficiency of the system. Thousands of people in my constituency will be among the 5.3 million who will lose out through the removal of the 10 per cent. rate. I cannot help agreeing with the right hon. Member for West Dunbartonshire (John McFall) who said a few hours ago that we are penalising poor people completely unnecessarily.</p>

As for the ways in which the Budget and the Bill are designed to deliver increased investment and growth overall, will the Financial Secretary look specifically at clause 82 and the removal of industrial buildings allowances for manufacturing areas such as the one that I represent?

I am a single man of 30 years, on a salary of only &#163;13,000 a year working full time as a teaching assistant. I cannot afford to have a home of my own and am still living with my parents. If the Labour Government say they will support or help those hit by this ridiculous fiasco you bet that I will not be one of them as a single man...Please make my comments known in Parliament.&#148;</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o346"><a name="80421-0019.htm_para8"><a name="08042135000058">It is extraordinary that in his final Budget as Chancellor, the Prime Minister, having cast around for people to raid for revenue, should have alighted on the least well-off who are employed. He has always said, and asked us to believe, that work is the best way out of poverty. What kind of message does it send when those who are targeted are precisely those who are in work but who are earning the smallest possible amount? Is that a wholesale reversal of his mantra over the years?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o347"><a name="80421-0019.htm_para9"><a name="08042135000059">There is an almost grotesque irony in the fact that the group hit hardest by the increase in tax are people on the Government&#146;s official poverty line. The amount at which a single person will be hit is &#163;149 a week; &#163;145 a week is the official poverty line for a single man. The Government have targeted those on the poverty line to raise revenue. Of course we can argue about whom we can best help when distributing the Treasury&#146;s occasional largesse, but for people in the Treasury to have a discussion about which people should be tackled and hit hardest, and come up with the answer that it is low-paid people on the poverty line, is so extraordinary that it beggars belief.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o348"><a name="80421-0019.htm_para10"><a name="08042135000060">As for how the issue can be resolved, of course the review that has been mentioned will no doubt involve discussion of tax credits and the question of how we can put more money into child tax credits. However, as my constituent made clear in his e-mail, there are people across the country in deep poverty who do not have children. Their poverty should be our concern, just as other people&#146;s poverty is. Child poverty is to be tackled, but adult poverty is booming. Severe poverty&#151;people on incomes of less than 40 per cent. of the median across the economy&#151;has hit a 30-year record under this Government, and is increasing all the time. Surely our aim should be to rescue them from poverty, as well as to tackle child poverty. We should not get into a situation in which we can take adults out of poverty only by making them dependent on their children. That is not right, and it is not a sustainable way forward.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman&#146;s constituents in Luton will be delighted that he has chosen a debate on a practical matter, about which I am sure they have written to him, to rehearse tired arguments that are 20 and 30 years old rather than deal with the problem in hand.</p>

The calamitous Budget that resulted in this situation had implications for charities too; I should say that I am a Front-Bench spokesman on charities. Charities were caught up in the issue of whether the circumstances were unforeseen or, as my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Folkestone and Hythe (Mr. Howard) said in his masterful speech, the result of a rather more cunning enterprise&#151;to raise revenue without disclosing its source.</p>

The then Chancellor kept quiet about that in his Budget speech, but in this year&#146;s Budget the Chancellor came forward with a package of &#163;285 million to relieve charities for a limited, three-year period. The Treasury was exercised and busy in trying to find a way to get charities out of the mess that it had created for them, but what was wrong with the low- paid? Why could the Treasury not give them the thought and attention that it gave charities? Why have the Chancellor and Prime Minister said that they will start thinking about that now? Why did they not do that before the most recent Budget? Why do we have to wait for the pre-Budget report and the Budget after that?</p>

<p><a name="st_o407"><a name="08042212000024"><a name="80421-0019.htm_spnew12"><a name="08042212000697"><b>Mr. Speaker:</b>
 Order. Perhaps the hon. Gentleman can write to the hon. Member, because his intervention is too long.</p>

<p><a name="st_o408"><a name="08042212000025"><a name="80421-0019.htm_spnew13"><a name="08042212000698"><b>Mr. Hoban:</b>
 I gave the Prime Minister&#146;s PPS the opportunity to speak&#151;I think he is the first Prime Minister&#146;s PPS to speak in a debate in this House and refer back to his crib sheet, which he also had to refer to earlier. Let me remind him of the centrepiece of the pre-Budget report in October: a change in the rules on inheritance tax. We will not take any lessons from him on these matters. Of course, the hon. Gentleman is part of the problem: the constant listing of briefings and changes of mind. The Exchequer Secretary said &#147;Watch this space&#148; on Friday. The Chief Secretary was on the airwaves on Saturday, trying to pretend that nothing was going to change.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o360"><a name="80421-0019.htm_para22"><a name="08042212000026">Today, we have a new line&#151;the &#147;jam tomorrow&#148; line. The argument is: &#147;We don&#146;t have the time to sort this crisis out before Monday. Just wait till the pre-Budget report and we will sort it all out then.&#148; But this is not a problem that has suddenly emerged in the past few days. No one can pretend that this crisis came as a surprise. The Prime Minister and the Treasury knew last year that a net 5.3 million households would be worse off as a consequence of the abolition of the 10p rate. In fact, the Exchequer Secretary herself was signatory to a Treasury Committee report of last year that was highly critical of the decision to scrap the 10p rate&#151;it cropped up during our debates on the Budget and the Finance Bill last year.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o361"><a name="80421-0019.htm_para23"><a name="08042212000027">The Government have had plenty of time to put together a package to soften the blow for the losers. Let us not forget how quickly the Government can move when they want to. They quickly backtracked on non-doms, and let us remember how quickly they reversed their position on inheritance tax, after facing pressure from business. Why is it that the 5.3 million households who have lost out have to wait until the PBR? Why do they have to wait, when the Government can move so quickly if they want to?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o362"><a name="80421-0019.htm_para24"><a name="08042212000028">Why should the people affected believe that there will be jam tomorrow? As the Institute for Fiscal Studies points out, the number of childless, working age adults in poverty has increased by half a million since 1997. They are not going to listen to the promises, hints and suggestions made by the Treasury and the Prime Minister. They want prompt action, and I suggest that Labour Members hold their Ministers to account on the matter, because the pressure put on the Treasury during the past few weeks has clearly started to create movement.</p>

 Several of us have raised this very issue with the Government for the past 12 months. The hon. Gentleman is absolutely right to say that this issue has been around for 13 months, since the 2007 Budget, but we still have no comprehensive alternative policies from the official Opposition.</p>

 I would have expected the hon. Gentleman, for whom I have a great deal of respect, to come up with a better intervention than that. If this problem has been around for so long, why have the Government not responded? Why have they not listened to Labour Back Benchers? Why have they not listened to the Parliamentary Private Secretaries who have been writing letters to complain about it? The Government did not budge on a single thing about it until they realised that they had a large-scale rebellion on their hands, and if Labour Members want to put pressure on the Government to get prompt action, they should continue to push the Government to change their mind.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o363"><a name="80421-0020.htm_para0"><a name="08042212000031">There are many other measures that we could discuss, including the small companies rate; changes to capital gains tax; non-doms; raising taxes for families; putting a green gloss on the Budget; and using an attack on binge drinking to increase taxes on alcohol. However, the challenge for the Government is scrapping the 10p rate, to which there is widespread opposition. We heard that tonight, not only from the Opposition Benches, but from Labour Members.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o364"><a name="80421-0020.htm_para1"><a name="08042212000032">Last year, the Government put together a package to ensure that people over 65 or those with young children would not lose out by scrapping the 10p rate. However, that left 5.3 million households losing out, including those who have retired early, young people on low incomes who do not qualify for tax credits, and those who are over 25 and on low incomes, but have no children and do not claim tax credits. The challenge that the Chancellor faces is whether he can help those 5.3 million households this year. Can he act to remedy the unfairness of last year&#146;s Budget in the Bill? As Labour Members know, the Government have no excuse not to act. The problem is not new; they have known about it for a year and they can act quickly when they wish. They can back down just as they did when they compromised on non-doms, retreated on capital gains tax and reversed their policy of reducing taxes on small companies.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o365"><a name="80421-0020.htm_para2"><a name="08042212000033">The Government should do the right thing for families and businesses in times of economic uncertainty, when they are finding it harder to meet ever-higher costs, including increased fuel prices and council taxes.

<p><a name="stpa_o366"><a name="80421-0020.htm_para3"><a name="08042212000035">As one would expect with such a wide-ranging Bill, several points have been made and I would like to respond to as many as possible, within the constraints of time. However, before dealing with those points, I would like to address the changes that the Bill makes to income tax and restate the context in which the debate takes place.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o367"><a name="80421-0020.htm_para4"><a name="08042212000036">The introduction of the starting rate of income tax in 1999 was an important step in providing incentives for people to work, along with the reduction in the basic rate of tax to 22 per cent. and a set of changes that took 900,000 low paid workers out of paying national insurance contributions. However, the 10p rate is a poorly targeted way of helping people on low incomes. It benefits the very highest earners, but not the very lowest earners, who pay no tax. Since 1999, we have been developing a far more targeted way of making work pay for people on low incomes, and of providing them with support.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o368"><a name="80421-0020.htm_para5"><a name="08042212000037">Our tax credits system&#151;the working tax credit and the child tax credit&#151;now supports 6 million families across the country. The changes to income tax in the Bill have to be seen as part of a package that puts additional resources into those tax credits. The child element of the child tax credit has been increased by &#163;150 a year above inflation this month, and the income threshold up to which working tax credit is received in full has increased by &#163;1,200.</p>

 Whenever I see the hon. Gentleman bouncing up and down, I think of the old adage that empty vessels make the most noise. However, he occasionally makes interesting contributions, as his speech today showed. If he will allow me to make a few more comments, I will take interventions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o369"><a name="80421-0020.htm_para6"><a name="08042212000040">The changes to income tax in the Bill must be seen as part of a package that puts additional resources into those tax credits. The child element of the child tax credit has been increased, as I said. Those changes mean that 3 million of Britain&#146;s 7 million families with children will now have their income tax liability effectively wiped out by the tax credits and child benefit that they receive. Together with the changes in the National Insurance Contributions Bill, which is before another place, the above-inflation increases in personal allowances for pensioners and the reduction in the basic rate of income to 20 per cent., those changes were designed to interact as a package.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o370"><a name="80421-0020.htm_para7"><a name="08042212000041">As my hon. Friends the Members for Middlesbrough (Sir Stuart Bell) and for Dumfries and Galloway (Mr. Brown) said, the overall impact of those changes is to provide more support for families and pensioners. Some 80 per cent. of families with children will be better off, 200,000 children will be lifted above the poverty line and 600,000 pensioners will be taken out of paying income tax, meaning that 59 per cent. of pensioners aged 65 and over will get their incomes free of tax.</p>

 I am extremely grateful to the Minister, who was partly gracious in her answer. It is not empty vessels bouncing up in the Chamber, but the empty promises of the Labour party that most concern my constituents. What policies and funding need to be put in place to meet the Government&#146;s target of halving child poverty by 2010-11? Are those policies in place and will she ensure that that commitment is met, or is the Treasury Committee right that the Government have lost their wholehearted commitment to reducing child poverty?</p>

 If the hon. Gentleman is as committed to eradicating poverty as he claims, I would have hoped that he would acknowledge the steps that we took in the Budget to lift the families of a further 200,000 children above the poverty line. Our approach to the Finance Bill and the Budget has been carefully constructed precisely to enable us to make that progress in tackling child poverty, which his party was responsible for more than doubling when they were in power in the 1980s and 1990s.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o373"><a name="80421-0020.htm_para10"><a name="08042212000052">If we were to amend the criteria for tax credits, for example, to make more people eligible, we would also reduce their effectiveness in specifically targeting those at the greatest risk of poverty, such as low-income families with children.

I completely take his point about ensuring that we work harder to ensure that those who are entitled to, for example, the benefit of tax credits, and working tax credits in particular, receive the entitlement that they deserve. It may well be that many people who fear that they will lose as a result of the proposed change would not be in that position if they were claiming the working tax credits to which they are entitled.</p>

About a third of the women in that age group who are affected will be in two-earner households. It is therefore not true to say&#151;as the right hon. and learned Member for Folkestone and Hythe (Mr. Howard) did, in what I acknowledge was a powerful speech, from an Opposition point of view&#151;that 5.3 million of our poorest families will see their taxes double. That is how he and his colleagues characterise the situation, but it is not true. The make-up of those who will, overall, pay a relatively small increase in taxes is diverse, and that is why it is difficult to say exactly who they are, and why it is difficult to devise a set of measures to ameliorate the effect of the changes.</p>

In that context, let me say this. When I was elected in 1992, one in four men aged 25 and over in my constituency were unemployed, yet unemployment in this country is now almost a thing of the past, particularly among the young people I represent in my constituency. Even if we had not fixed unemployment, or even if we had addressed only the scourge of unemployment and not built the schools and hospitals and not put in the investment in public services that we have, I would still be incredibly proud to be taking forward a Finance Bill on behalf of this Government, who have achieved so much. I hope that the House will support the Government in these measures, which we will take forward next week.</p>

 I beg leave to present a petition on behalf of 2,712 constituents, representing concerned professionals in the nursery sector, parents and members of the public from Enfield, Southgate. The basis of their concern is the new nurseries code of practice, its rigid one-size-fits-all criteria and a shortfall in funding likely to lead to the loss of choice of nursery care and free provision.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o391"><a name="80421-0021.htm_para6"><a name="08042212000608">The petition states:</p>
<a name="80421-0021.htm_brev6"><a name="08042212000671"><ul><p class="tabletext">The Petition of professionals in the nursery sector, concerned parents and members of the public,</p>
</ul><a name="80421-0021.htm_brev7"><a name="08042212000672"><ul><p class="tabletext">Declares that nurseries, pre-schools and day-care providers fulfil a vital role in the development of pre-school children and that voluntary, private and independent nurseries provide the overwhelming majority of nursery care. The Government&#146;s new code of practice fundamentally changes the rules regarding the provision of free nursery places for three and four year olds. They are concerned that the new code of practice could cause significant financial harm and insecurity in the nursery sector, and force existing, trusted nurseries out of business, creating uncertainty for parents and children.</p>
</ul><a name="80421-0021.htm_brev8"><a name="08042212000673"><ul><p class="tabletext">The Petitioners therefore request that the House of Commons urges the Government to halt the implementation of this code of practice and undertake an urgent assessment of its impact on nurseries.</p>

 May I thank you, Madam Deputy Speaker, and Mr. Speaker for allowing me to bring this matter before the House today? I also thank the Minister for being present to respond to my comments&#151;I have given him good warning of what I will say&#151;and my neighbour and good  friend, my hon. Friend the Member for Tewkesbury (Mr. Robertson), for being here to support me.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o394"><a name="80421-0021.htm_para9"><a name="08042212000612">As I am sure the Minister is aware, this is not the first time that I have spoken in such a debate on this issue, which has unfortunately been going on since 1994, and progress on which is about as slow-moving as the traffic on the road. If the Cotswolds had not just been hit by 12 post office closures, I would describe this as the biggest constituency issue I have faced in my time as a Member of Parliament.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o395"><a name="80421-0021.htm_para10"><a name="08042212000613">I would like briefly to describe the problem. The A417/419 leaves the M4 at junction 15, bypasses Swindon, Cirencester and Gloucester, and joins the M5 at junction 11A. In other words, it is the apex of the triangle that joins the M4 and M5 so that traffic travelling between Swindon and Gloucester does not have to go all the way round two sides of the triangle via Bristol, thus saving 40 miles. The so-called missing link is the three and half miles in the middle that is the single carriageway between the two junctions. Therefore, this problem clearly has national, regional and county-level significance.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o396"><a name="80421-0021.htm_para11"><a name="08042212000614">In 1994, I stood with the then transport Minister, John Watts, at the opening of the Brockworth bypass on this stretch of road. With both the Swindon and Gloucester ends of the road having been built, and with &#163;150 million having been spent&#151;then a huge sum of money&#151;it was confidently predicted that this missing link would be built. Unfortunately, however, matters have not progressed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o397"><a name="80421-0021.htm_para12"><a name="08042212000615">Wrangling has occurred ever since over various possible solutions, one of which was the suggestion of a tunnel, which I believe has now been rejected even by most of its ardent supporters, given the physical and financial logistics stacked against it. Instead, in 2004 the Highways Agency presented a &#163;150-million surface project, the so-called brown route, about which my hon. Friend will be well aware as he and I have attended meetings with the Highways Agency to discuss it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o398"><a name="80421-0021.htm_para13"><a name="08042212000616">Following the 2004 publication by the Highways Agency, Gloucestershire county council consulted the community on the available options. At that time, 67 per cent. of the population and 90 per cent. of the business community were in favour of the brown route. Despite that, the scheme did not receive regional prioritisation. I believe that if a similar poll were carried out today there would be an even higher level of support from the local population, and certainly from the business community, because the Gloucester business park is expanding at one of the fastest rates in the country, and housing in both Swindon and Gloucester is expanding at a huge rate. Indeed, all the   <br>

authorities now support the building of the missing link&#151;the county, district and parish councils&#151;as do five Gloucestershire Members of Parliament.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o399"><a name="80421-0021.htm_para14"><a name="08042212000617">As the House may be aware, on 11 October 2006 I had an Adjournment debate on this subject, during which the then Minister with responsibility for transport, the hon. Member for South Thanet (Dr. Ladyman), undertook to ask his Department to instruct the Highways Agency to search for and consider the best available surface option. It is on the back of its excellent and detailed report, published in March this year, that I have called today&#146;s debate, in order to see how we can take this matter forward.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o400"><a name="80421-0021.htm_para15"><a name="08042212000618">The Minister, whom I am grateful to see in his place today, will be aware that during the last Adjournment debate, I pointed out that the south-west region adjoins three other regions. In this respect, the situation is unique. In considering these very big regions, we should remember that this scheme is only 14.5 miles from the Welsh region border, 6.5 miles from the south-east region border and 11.2 miles from the west midlands region border. It is therefore very close to four regions in total, and it is this factor that causes a weakness in the regional transport prioritisation for delivering road schemes. This is a problem, given that the south-west region is so large. Chipping Campden and the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for Tewkesbury are closer to the border of Scotland than they are to Land&#146;s End, at the south-western tip of the south-west region. That demonstrates how big the south-west region is.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o401"><a name="80421-0021.htm_para16"><a name="08042212000619">This scheme will benefit the south-west, as the current bottleneck at the top of the region affects the growth and prosperity of the whole region. However, the critical point of this whole debate is that, because the scheme benefits four regions, it becomes no one region&#146;s priority. Under a system in which roads are delivered only if they can achieve regional priority, this scheme will never be delivered unless we have some form of national priority.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o402"><a name="80421-0021.htm_para17"><a name="08042212000620">During my Adjournment debate in October 2006, the then Minister with responsibility for transport stated the following regarding the regional funding allocation process:</p>
<a name="80421-0021.htm_brev10"><a name="08042212000675"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;I acknowledge that there were problems, some of which related to schemes on the edge of regions that might not seem of such central importance to the region. Sometimes a scheme might be located in one region but its importance might be to another, so it is not given priority.&#148;&#151;[<i> Official Report, Westminster Hall</i>, 11 October 2006; Vol. 450, c. 102WH.]</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o403"><a name="80421-0021.htm_para18"><a name="08042212000621">He went on to confirm that two schemes were put to him: the A417 and the M5. He gave the M5 national priority, while the A417 and the missing link were given regional priority. He conceded in the debate that he might have got that decision wrong, and that he would reflect on it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o404"><a name="80421-0021.htm_para19"><a name="08042212000622">Perhaps now is a suitable time to explain exactly why I have campaigned so long and hard for this improvement to be made. The missing link is the only section of single-lane road in a dual carriageway that runs from Palermo in Sicily up to Perth in Scotland. One need only scan briefly the 2008 review by the Highways Agency to understand the significance of this road economically and environmentally, but surely most importantly on the ground of safety.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o405"><a name="80421-0021.htm_para20"><a name="08042212000623">For those of my constituents and those of my hon. Friend who are forced to use the road regularly, I am afraid that the facts are frightening. More than 30 deaths or serious injuries have occurred in the past decade; tragically, the most recent death was just last month. Speaking following this fatality, Inspector Dave Collicott of the county&#146;s road policing unit told the local media that</p>
<a name="80421-0021.htm_brev11"><a name="08042212000676"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;the likelihood of this collision would have been reduced had this section been to the same standard as those on either side of it&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o406"><a name="80421-0021.htm_para21"><a name="08042212000624">Accidents happen with unfailing regularity. The really significant point is that this section of road has an accident rate 30 per cent. higher than the national average. The Minister will note from the report that &#147;107 personal injury accidents&#148; were</p>
<a name="80421-0021.htm_brev12"><a name="08042212000677"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;recorded over the 5 year period to October 2007, a 6 per cent. rise compared with 3 years ago&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o407"><a name="80421-0021.htm_para22"><a name="08042212000625">Sadly, despite an awareness of those safety concerns, the road is the only viable option for most.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o408"><a name="80421-0021.htm_para23"><a name="08042212000626">The Highways Agency goes on to say:</p>
<a name="80421-0021.htm_brev13"><a name="08042212000678"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;The route is also vitally important to the regional economy in providing direct links to and between Swindon, Gloucester and Cheltenham, where there is significant development. It is therefore the most appropriate route for all traffic between these two centres&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_o409"><a name="80421-0021.htm_para24"><a name="08042212000627">People certainly use the road; between 28,000 and 34,000 vehicles a day are forced to tackle this bottleneck. At the best of times, that can cause traffic jams as cars sit stationary with fumes pumping from their exhausts. Breakdowns can cause huge congestion problems, particularly as heavy goods vehicles often struggle up the steep incline at Crickley hill, in the constituency of my hon. Friend, break down and cause even more congestion as they do so.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o410"><a name="80421-0021.htm_para25"><a name="08042212000628">Since the problem has been highlighted, minor improvements have been made to the road. However, the fundamental fact is that 10 years of inactivity on the matter has seen four deaths, 31 serious injuries and 211 minor injuries, alongside countless hours lost to traffic jams and the sheer volume of carbon monoxide emissions from stationary vehicles.</p>

 I congratulate my hon. Friend on, yet again, introducing this matter for debate. He will doubtless have noticed that the road, as it comes towards my constituency, does not clog up just at rush hour, as perhaps it once did; even in mid-afternoon it is not unusual to see a very long tailback. The inadequacy of the rail travel between here and my constituency, and between Cheltenham and Gloucester, makes the matter even worse. We do not have a good transport system to our constituencies.</p>

 My hon. Friend makes a really good point. I believe that he made it in our previous debate in 2006. This really important road improvement is needed for the growth and prosperity not only of our region, but of the adjoining regions. As he says, it is not as if we have a really good rail system. Despite the size of Gloucester and Cheltenham, and their distance from London&#151;less than 100 miles&#151;we are talking about some of the worst rail transport in the country. This important piece of infrastructure needs to be completed.</p>

My hon.

<p><a name="stpa_o412"><a name="80421-0021.htm_para27"><a name="08042212000632">I am aware that a number of challenges are presented by this stretch of road.

<a name="80421-0021.htm_brev14"><a name="08042212000679"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;this constraint must be fully considered in any proposed scheme&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o414"><a name="80421-0021.htm_para29"><a name="08042212000634">Secondly, the topography of the area is a challenge to road builders and makes the section at Nettleton Bottom and the Air Balloon so dangerous. Even with those considerations in mind, the Highways Agency has produced a preferred solution&#151;still described as the brown route&#151;that is almost identical in nature to the one it found in 2004. The cost, with inflation taken into account, is inevitably much the same. The Highways Agency states that the proposal is</p>
<a name="80421-0021.htm_brev15"><a name="08042212000680"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;highly developed and has captured virtually all the available savings for a major improvement giving long term service, reliability and resilience.&#148;</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o416"><a name="80421-0021.htm_para31"><a name="08042212000636">In the Adjournment debate of 2006, I commented that the Highways Agency was uncomfortable with the road remaining a single lane.

debate. Five key agencies&#151;I have just listed them&#151;support the scheme. The road is a vital economic gateway nationally, regionally and locally. The solution proposed this year in the comprehensive review is similar to the one proposed in 2004. To my mind that is a clear indication that the best solution is now on the table, as proposed by the Highways Agency.</p>

Perhaps the Minister can confirm that due consideration will be given to making it a national priority. For even beginning work tomorrow will be too late, because the scheme will take many years to complete. If correct prioritisation had been given, we could be well on the way to a solution. Too many people have died or been seriously injured, and the economic fortunes of the nation and the Gloucestershire region are being restricted by that 3.5 mile stretch of single road. I hope that the Minister will be able to give us some good news this evening.</p>

 I congratulate the hon. Member for Cotswold (Mr. Clifton-Brown) on securing this second Adjournment debate in 18 months on what he refers to as the missing link on the A417 near Gloucester. I thank him for his constructive engagement with and his commitment to this campaign, which is important to his constituents and to the wider region. I will return to the issue of national importance later in my speech.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o421"><a name="80421-0022.htm_para0"><a name="08042212000642">Since the last Adjournment debate on this issue 18 months ago, the Highways Agency has undertaken a wide-ranging and thorough review of possible improvement options to address the existing conditions on the Cowley to Brockworth section of the A417. The report that I sent to the hon. Gentleman and his colleagues the hon. Members for Tewkesbury (Mr. Robertson) and for Forest of Dean (Mr. Harper) on 12 March details the work undertaken and conclusions reached during this review. The hon. Member for Cotswold alluded to that report.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o422"><a name="80421-0022.htm_para1"><a name="08042212000643">The review carried out by the Highways Agency has left no stone unturned in an effort to identify whether a more affordable option can be found to improve the existing conditions on this section of the A417. The hon. Gentleman will be aware that the views of key stakeholders have been an important part of the information gathering during the review. Indeed, I know that he gave his own helpful and supportive views personally to the Highways Agency as part of the value management stakeholder workshop in March 2007.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o423"><a name="80421-0022.htm_para2"><a name="08042212000644">The value management exercise was very useful. It enabled the agency to identify various options put forward by stakeholders that might contribute to a more affordable scheme and then rank them to establish which elements would be worth considering further. Each of the worthy options was then assessed to identify the impact that they would have on safety and journey time reliability, and then compared with the improvement achieved by the major scheme. This review has confirmed that the major scheme already developed by the Highways Agency would capture virtually all the available benefits, provide optimum  <br>

value for money and be a long-term solution. As the hon. Gentleman rightly points out, following an extensive review we have returned to the original proposal.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o424"><a name="80421-0022.htm_para3"><a name="08042212000645">The hon. Gentleman pointed out the increase in costs of the major scheme. I know that he is acutely aware of the issue. It is why the region requested in 2005 that the Highways Agency carry out a review to examine the possibility of a lower cost solution. Since that last debate the costs have increased from &#163;150 million to &#163;250 million, and that rise is of such an order that it would be entirely appropriate to offer some explanation of why the figures have changed so much.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o425"><a name="80421-0022.htm_para4"><a name="08042212000646">There are three reasons. First, construction inflation has been far higher than was previously predicted. Secondly, a later date has been assumed for a possible start date. Thirdly, estimates include the historic costs spent on the scheme. As it turned out, construction inflation between 2001 and 2006 was higher than predicted and added some &#163;50 million to the cost. In addition, delaying the scheme to beyond 2013 takes it through the construction period for the Olympics, when inflation is expected to be even higher. In fact, inflation for the period adds about &#163;45 million to the cost. I understand that if a major construction scheme takes place at the same time as construction on the Olympics, resources and materials will be available only at a premium.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o426"><a name="80421-0022.htm_para5"><a name="08042212000647">The increases led us to look at other ways to reduce the cost of the major scheme. One would be to build the scheme in a number of phases, spreading the cost over a number of years. However, that would increase the costs by at least a further &#163;30 million&#151;13 per cent. of the total. It would also extend the period of construction, which would inevitably cause additional congestion during the construction phase. On balance, there is no doubt that it would be better to build the whole scheme under one contract.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o427"><a name="80421-0022.htm_para6"><a name="08042212000648">In a world of finite resources, we must ensure that our transport investment is focused on the most important schemes. That is why in July 2005 we invited the south-west region to give us advice on transport priorities with an indicative funding allocation for major schemes in the south-west. The regional funding allocation, or RFA, process has, for the first time, given regions a say in making decisions about transport schemes that affect them. The RFA process is an opportunity for people in the region to work together to develop a realistic, prioritised and affordable transport investment programme to support the region&#146;s high-level objectives for jobs, the economy, housing and the environment. It is central to our thinking that the regions are better placed than the men and women of Whitehall to advise decision makers on how transport can help to make the regions even better places.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o428"><a name="80421-0022.htm_para7"><a name="08042212000649">We backed the RFA process with massively increased investment funding. We have increased our annual spending on such schemes by 50 per cent. since 2001-02. For example, the Highways Agency has invested &#163;16 million improving the Commonhead junction on the A419 in Swindon. The agency is also spending &#163;65 million to provide a much-needed bypass for Blunsdon on the same route.</p>

schemes in the south-west. However, the hon. Gentleman and others have suggested that we are not making enough money available in the south-west.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o430"><a name="80421-0022.htm_para9"><a name="08042212000651">I shall interrupt my flow at this point to reassure the hon. Gentleman and the hon. Member for Tewkesbury that I understand absolutely that when a constituency MP is dealing with the horrific aftermath and tragedy of people being killed on a local road it makes  little difference, particularly to the families, for a Government Minister to talk about the record amounts of money being invested in road schemes elsewhere in that region. I am aware of the importance of providing safe roads in the region represented by the hon. Member for Cotswold and in other parts of the country. That does not detract from the fact that we are spending record amounts of money. I fully understand the hon. Gentleman&#146;s personal concerns about the accident record on that stretch of road, which are in no way obviated by the levels of investment.</p>

 The Minister has alluded to the critical point in the debate. The regional priority system will not deliver the road because it is on the edge of three other regions. I have given the figures. It is very close to the edge: some 16 or 8 miles from the three other regions. The problem is that it benefits all four regions, but because of that fact the south-west region will not deliver it as a priority. Unless we get some national input from the Minister, the scheme will never be delivered. It is even more important to deliver it now that the two schemes to which he referred at Blunsdon and Commonhead have been delivered, as the whole road is now a dual carriageway except for the little bit in the middle&#151;the 3.5 miles of single track. That makes it even more dangerous, because motorists get into the frame of mind of driving faster, having been on a dual carriageway section.</p>

 I will come on to the issue of whether a road is identified as a road of national or regional importance in a few moments. It is sometimes implied&#151;I know that this is not what the hon. Gentleman is suggesting&#151;that if a road scheme is on the edge of a region and is close to other regions, and therefore evades the attention of the regional transport board, that is reason enough for it to become a road of national importance. As I am sure he will accept, the fact that a road is on the edge of a region is not enough in itself to make it a road of national importance, however important the road is to one or more regions.</p>

Gentleman is suggesting that the Government should show leadership and give advice to regional transport boards on prioritisation, that is something that the Government can and will do. If he is suggesting that the Government should make available significantly more money than is already available through regional funding allocation, I will have to disappoint him. That was certainly the suggestion made when the prioritisation took place; some people claimed that there was no way that prioritisation could be given to the improvement of the Cowley to Brockworth section of the A417, given current spending commitments. I hear similar arguments from every region in relation to many other schemes, and that makes me think that we have been reasonably fair in dividing the pot among the regions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o432"><a name="80421-0022.htm_para11"><a name="08042212000655">It could be argued that the regional pot should be bigger, but it would have to be made clear where the money would come from, whether from tax increases or from cutting investment somewhere else. Politicians in this place often go round in circles arguing about which scheme we should cut in order to promote another scheme. Unfortunately that is the truth of the argument, and the issue is not just one of party politics. When it comes to funding, there is a circle to be squared, and we have to be realistic. The Government do not have unlimited funds and sometimes tough choices have to be made. The RFA process helps us to make those choices in the best and most sensible way.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o433"><a name="80421-0022.htm_para12"><a name="08042212000656">Following the RFA&#146;s advice, the south-west region assigned funding to a total of 31 schemes in the period up to 2016, including three schemes in Gloucestershire &#151;the Elmbridge integrated transport package, the Gloucester and Cheltenham park and ride and the Gloucester A40 improvements and widening. The region advised us that the Cowley to Brockworth improvement on the A417 may well prove to be a long-term priority, but will probably not come forward before 2016. I understand why the hon. Members for Cotswold and for Tewkesbury will be disappointed with the outcome, but we nevertheless accepted the region&#146;s advice. We will ask regions later this year to consider their priorities and tell us whether they have changed. The Highways Agency has already made its report available to the region so that it can take into account the benefits and value for money offered by options, including the lower cost options.</p>

 Let me try just one more time. This is not an issue of funding, but of process. If a scheme is on the edge of four regions, and will benefit all four, no one region will give it priority. The scheme will never be delivered unless the Minister, working on a national basis, advises the four regions that all of them want the scheme. There must be a system of second preferences, as it were, otherwise the south-west region will never regard the road as a priority.</p>

south-west regional transport board does not see this particular road as a priority, what are the chances of other regions, through which this particular section of the A417 does not pass, giving a significant amount of their allocations to the upgrade of the road? If the south-west region will not prioritise it, I suggest to the hon. Gentleman, who knows the local political layout better than I, that it will be very difficult for the other three regions to which he has referred to put their hands in their pockets and surrender some of their own schemes for one that effectively lies outside their borders. However, I might be able to offer something positive to the hon. Gentleman in the one minute that I have left.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o434"><a name="80421-0022.htm_para13"><a name="08042212000659">If the hon. Gentleman, as a supporter of the scheme, does not like the priorities already drawn up by the regional transport board, he has the opportunity in the next few months to try to convince it of the evidence that the improvement should be higher on the region&#146;s list of priorities and that other schemes that currently have higher priority should be lower on that list. If the region wishes to change its priorities and include the improvement scheme or any of the lower-cost options in the RFA programme, we will be delighted to accept that advice, subject to the scheme meeting the Department for Transport&#146;s value for money criteria.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_o435"><a name="80421-0022.htm_para14"><a name="08042212000660">The hon. Gentleman referred to the edge factor, mentioned by my predecessor, and made the point that the geographical position of the scheme may not have helped it within the RFA process. He is right; my predecessor did acknowledge the existence of the edge factor, which may have been an issue in some of the advice that we received from the regions. I do not consider that the edge factor is relevant in this case; if it had been, we would have expected other schemes in Gloucestershire not to have been prioritised. Clearly, that has not happened, as schemes in Gloucestershire have been prioritised.</p>
